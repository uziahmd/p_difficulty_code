On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers representing performers' actions. Each number is either 1 or 2. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subsequence from l to r. Then, he needs to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the modified array.\n\nHmm. The goal is to find the best possible interval to reverse so that this LNDS is as long as possible.\n\nFirst, let's understand what reversing a subarray does. Reversing can change the order of elements, which might create a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nWait, but how? For example, if the original array has a decreasing part, reversing might make it increasing, thus allowing for a longer LNDS.\n\nSo the approach should be to consider all possible intervals [l, r], reverse them, compute the LNDS, and find the maximum over all possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. If we try all possible intervals, that's O(n^2) intervals. For each interval, reversing takes O(n) time, and computing LNDS is O(n log n) using the standard algorithm.\n\nWait, 2000^2 is 4 million, and for each, 2000 steps plus 2000 log n steps. That would be around 4e6 * 2000 = 8e9 operations, which is way too much for Python to handle in reasonable time. So that approach won't work.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think: the sequence consists of 1s and 2s. So maybe the structure is manageable.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible LNDS without any reversal? It's simply the count of 1s followed by 2s. Like, for the first example, the original array is [1,2,1,2]. The LNDS is 3 (1,2,2), but after reversing [2,3], it becomes [1,1,2,2], with LNDS 4.\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to reverse any subarray. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to arrange as many 1s as possible before the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best way is to group all 1s together and then 2s, but by reversing certain subarrays.\n\nWait, but the reversed subarray can only flip a continuous segment. So perhaps the best approach is to find a point where, when we reverse a certain interval, the 1s on the left of that interval are connected to 1s on the right, creating a longer 1s run, followed by 2s.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the sequence is made of 1s and 2s, maybe the key is to find the maximum number of consecutive 1s possible after some reversal, followed by 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nWhat is the LNDS for any given array? For a binary array, the LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after all the 1s. Because you can take all the 1s first, then all the 2s that are after them.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the standard approach for the LNDS in a binary array is to count the number of 1s and 2s. Because in a non-decreasing sequence, all 1s come before 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s after the last 1.\n\nWait, no. Because in the array [1, 2, 1, 2], the LNDS is 3: 1,2,2. But the total 1s is 2, 2s is 2. So 2 + 2 =4, but the actual LNDS is 3.\n\nSo that approach doesn't directly hold. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the LNDS is equal to the maximum number of 1s that can be followed by 2s. So, for each position i, count the number of 1s up to i, plus the number of 2s after i. Then the maximum over all i is the answer.\n\nYes! Because in the optimal case, the LNDS would consist of all 1s up to some point i, followed by all 2s after i.\n\nSo for any i (0-based or 1-based?), compute the sum of 1s in [0..i] and 2s in [i+1..n-1], then take the maximum.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nOriginal array is [1,2,1,2].\n\nIf we compute for each position i:\n\ni=0: 1s up to 0:",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence. The sequence consists of 1s and 2s, and reversing a subarray can potentially create a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reverse a subarray such that the resulting sequence has the longest possible non-decreasing subsequence. Since the sequence only contains 1s and 2s, a non-decreasing subsequence can be formed by all 1s followed by all 2s.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For any position `i` in the array, compute the maximum number of 1s up to `i` and the number of 2s after `i`. The sum of these two values gives the potential length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at `i`.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of checking all possible intervals and their reverses, which would be computationally expensive, we can directly compute the optimal point where the transition from 1s to 2s occurs. This avoids the need for exhaustive checks and reduces the complexity.\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - Precompute prefix sums of 1s.\n   - Precompute suffix sums of 2s.\n   - For each position `i`, compute the sum of 1s up to `i` and 2s from `i+1` onwards.\n   - Track the maximum value of this sum across all positions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nprefix_ones = [0] * n\nprefix_ones[0] = 1 if a[0] == 1 else 0\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n\nsuffix_twos = [0] * n\nif a[-1] == 2:\n    suffix_twos[-1] = 1\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n\nmax_length = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    current = prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[i+1]\n    if current > max_length:\n        max_length = current\n\nprint(max_length)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Prefix Sums**: We calculate the cumulative count of 1s up to each position `i` using a prefix sum array.\n- **Suffix Sums**: We calculate the cumulative count of 2s starting from each position `i` using a suffix sum array.\n- **Max Length Calculation**: For each position `i`, we compute the potential length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence by combining the 1s up to `i` and the 2s from `i+1` onwards. The maximum value of this computation across all positions gives the desired result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal solution in O(n) time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 2000.",
