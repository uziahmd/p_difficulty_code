He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but if the second part of a door is 'R', then it's using Roman numerals instead of a normal base. Hmm, let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the input has two lines. The first line is a and b, where b can be R. The second line is c in base a, which could be a very long string. My task is to output c in base b, but if the second part was R, then we have to represent it as a Roman numeral.\n\nWait, right. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read a and b. If b is R, then the output should be in Roman numerals. Otherwise, output the number in base b as a string.\n2. Read the number c which is in base a. It can have leading zeros but shouldn't be zero itself.\n3. Convert c from base a to an integer value.\n4. Then, if the second part is R (i.e., we're dealing with Roman numerals), convert that integer to a Roman numeral string. Otherwise, convert it to base b and output without leading zeros.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second part is either b or R. Oh right. So the second part in the first line can be R, which indicates that the conversion is to Roman numerals. So if the second part is R, then after converting the number to integer, we have to represent it in Roman numerals. Else, we convert to base b as a string.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, one case is 5 R: the number is 5 in base 10, so converted to Roman is 'V'.\n\nAnother case is 12 13 and the number is A (which is 10 in base 13). So converted to base 13, it's just 'A' since 10 is less than 13.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Parse the input to get a, b, and c_str.\n- Determine whether the conversion is to Roman numerals or base b. That depends on whether b is R.\n- Convert c_str from base a to an integer.\n- If the conversion is to Roman numerals:\n   - Convert the integer to a Roman numeral string.\n- Else:\n   - Convert the integer to base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n- Output the result.\n\nNow, the main challenges are:\n\n1. Converting a string in base a to an integer. Since a can be up to 25, the digits can go beyond 10, so each character needs to be mapped correctly. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. But wait, the input is given as a string in base a, which might include letters. So for each character in c_str, we need to convert it into its corresponding value in base a.\n\n2. Converting the integer to Roman numerals. This involves knowing the rules for Roman numerals, including the subtractive combinations like IV (4), IX (9), XL (40), etc. Also, for numbers larger than 3999, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the maximum number is 300010, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but wait: the note says that in any case, the number won't be greater than 101510. So we don't have to handle extremely large numbers beyond that. So our Roman converter doesn't have to handle numbers beyond that, which is good.\n\nSo let's break down each step.\n\nFirst, parsing the input. The first line has a and b, separated by space. The second line has c_str, which is the number in base a.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a string with possible leading spaces? Or perhaps, in the sample input, it's shown as ['10 2\\n1', ...]. So in code, when reading the input, I'll have to split the lines accordingly.\n\nIn Python, I can read the first line as a and b. For example, the first line is something like '10 2\\n1', so splitting by whitespace gives ['10', '2'] and the next token is '1'.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead the first line: split into a_str and b_str. Then read the second line as c_str.\n\nThen, determine if the conversion is to Roman or base b:\n\nif b == 'R':\n    roman_numerals = True\nelse:\n    roman_numerals = False\n\nWait, but wait: in the input, the second line is a single non-negative integer in base a, possibly with leading zeros. So for example, the sample input shows '16 R' as the second line, but wait, no— looking at the sample input description, it's written as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nSo the first line is a and b, which are integers except that b can be 'R'. Wait, no, in the input, the first line is a and b, where b can be 'R' as a string, but in code, how do we read it? Because in Python, when you read a line, you can split into parts, and each part is a string. So for example, if the first line is '10 2\\n1', then a is '10' and b is '2', which is straightforward. But if the first line is '10 R\\n...', then a is '10' and b is 'R'.\n\nSo in code, the first line is read, split into two parts: a_str, b_str.\n\nThen, the second line is read as c_str.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb = line1[1]\n\nc_str = input().strip()\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample input, the first line is something like '10 2\\n1', which when split() becomes ['10', '2'], and the second line is '16 R\\n5'? No, wait, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but in the actual problem, each run has only one test case. So for each run, the input is two lines: first line is a and b, second line is c_str.\n\nSo the code should read the first line as a and b, and the second line as c_str.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement's Input section.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\n\nSo, the first line has two tokens, a and b, which can be 'R' for b.\n\nThe second line is a single string, which is c in base a.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb = line1[1]\nc_str = input().strip()\n\nYes.\n\nNow, check if b is 'R' or not.\n\nIf b is 'R', then we need to output the number in Roman numerals.\n\nElse, output the number in base b as a string.\n\nSo, now, the next step is to convert c_str from base a to an integer.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nEach character in c_str represents a digit in base a. So for each character, map it to its value, then compute the integer.\n\nFor example, in base 10, '123' is 1*100 + 2*10 +3.\n\nBut for base a, the digits can be 0-9, then A=10, B=11, etc.\n\nWait, but wait: in the problem statement, it's said that c is written in base a. So the characters can be 0-9, A-Z (but uppercase?), but in the problem statement, the note says that in any case, the number won't be 0, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo, for each character in c_str, we need to find its value in base a.\n\nWait, but the way the problem statement describes the Roman numerals is that in bases higher than 10, letters are used for 10 and above. So, for example, in base 13, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc.\n\nSo, for the general case, each character in c_str is a digit in base a. So for a base higher than 10, the digits are 0-9, followed by A=10, B=11, ..., up to base a-1.\n\nSo, in code, for each character in c_str:\n\ndigit_value = ord(char) - ord('0') if char.isdigit() else (ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10)\n\nWait, but what about lowercase letters? The problem statement says 'c is in base a, which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.' So probably, the letters are uppercase, but perhaps it's better to make it case-insensitive.\n\nBut according to the note in the problem statement, the maximum is 101510, so the number can't be too big, so the code can handle it.\n\nSo, for each character in c_str:\n\nWe can create a mapping function that returns the value.\n\nSo, a helper function to convert a character to its value:\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        # Assume uppercase; if not, convert to uppercase\n        c_upper = c.upper()\n        return 10 + ord(c_upper) - ord('A')\n\nWait, but what about letters beyond 'Z'? Well, the problem states that the number is up to 101510, so the maximum digit needed is when a is 25, so digits can be up to 24, which would require 'Y' (since 10 is A, 24 is Y). So any letters beyond Y are not needed, but perhaps the problem allows for any letters, but in practice, the input will not have such.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's better to assume that all letters are valid for the given base a.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nConvert c_str to an integer in base a.\n\nOnce we have that integer, then:\n\nIf b is 'R', we need to convert it to a Roman numeral string.\n\nElse, we convert it to base b and output as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nSo, the next step is to write a function to convert an integer to a Roman numeral.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nRoman numerals have specific patterns. The standard approach is to use a list of tuples that represent the value and corresponding numeral, in descending order. Then, for each tuple, subtract as many times as possible from the number, appending the corresponding numeral each time.\n\nFor example, the list would include:\n\n[\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for the number, iterate through this list, and for each value, while the number is >= current value, append the numeral and subtract the value.\n\nSo, for example, number 394:\n\nStart with M (1000) which is larger than 394 → skip.\n\n900: larger, skip.\n\n500: larger, skip.\n\n400: 394 <400 → skip.\n\n100: 394 >=100 → append C (394-100=294), repeat until 294 <100 → append another C (total CC), now 294-100=194.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the list is ordered from largest to smallest. So for 394:\n\nLooking at 1000: no. 900: no. 500: no. 400: 394 <400 → no.\n\nThen 100: 394 >=100 → append C, subtract 100 → 294.\n\nAgain, 294 >=100 → append C → total CC, 294-100=194.\n\nAgain, 194 >=100 → append C → CCC, 194-100=94.\n\nNow, 94 is less than 100, move to next tuple.\n\nNext is 90: 94 >=90 → append XC (subtract 90 → 4).\n\nThen, 4: append IV → done. So total is CCCXCIV.\n\nWait, but 394 is 300 +90 +4 → 300 is CCC, 90 is XC, 4 is IV → CCCXCIV.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the function to convert to Roman numerals would use this approach.\n\nNow, the code for this function:\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, the next part is to convert the integer to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWe can repeatedly divide the number by b and collect the remainders, then reverse the result.\n\nBut we have to handle zero correctly. Since the input c is non-zero, the output won't be zero.\n\nAlso, the output must not have leading zeros.\n\nSo, for example, converting 5 to base 2: 101.\n\nBut if the number is 0, output 0, but according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the number isn't zero.\n\nSo, the function to convert to base b:\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            # For bases higher than 10, use letters A-Z\n            # So 10 is 'A', 11 'B', etc.\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but wait: for base higher than 36, but in the problem, the maximum base is 25, so we don't have to worry about letters beyond 'Y'.\n\nTesting this function: for n=5, base 2 → '101'; for n=5, base 13 → '5' since 5 <13 → '5'.\n\nAnother example: n=26, base 13 → 2*13=26 → '20'.\n\nWait, 26 in base 13 is 2*13^1 + 0*13^0 → '20'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the function should work.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Read a, b, c_str.\n\n2. Check if b is 'R' → roman_numerals = True.\n\n3. Convert c_str from base a to integer.\n\n   - For each character in c_str, get its value in base a.\n\n   - Sum them up.\n\n4. If roman_numerals is True:\n\n   - Convert the integer to a Roman numeral string.\n\n5. Else:\n\n   - Convert the integer to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\n6. Output the result.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\na, b = input().split()\na = int(a)\nc_str = input().strip()\n\nroman_numerals = (b == 'R')\n\n# Convert c_str to integer in base a\nn = 0\nfor ch in c_str:\n    val = char_to_value(ch)\n    n = n * a + val\n\nWait, but wait: what about the case where a is 1? Oh, no, because the constraints say a is >=2.\n\nSo, a is at least 2.\n\nSo, the code for conversion:\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + ord(c.upper()) - ord('A')\n\nBut wait, what about letters beyond 'Z'? For example, if a is 25, then the maximum digit is 24, which is 'Y'. So the input should not have any letters beyond that. So the function is safe.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn = 0\nfor ch in c_str:\n    v = char_to_value(ch)\n    n = n * a + v\n\nWait, no: no, the correct way is to process each digit in the string from left to right, multiplying by a each time.\n\nWait, for example, '123' in base 10 is 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 +3*10^0. So, the code should be:\n\nn = 0\nfor ch in c_str:\n    v = char_to_value(ch)\n    n = n * a + v\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, after getting n, proceed.\n\nIf roman_numerals is True:\n\n    s = int_to_roman(n)\nelse:\n    s = int_to_base(n, b)\n\nThen, print(s)\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is miswritten, but in code, the inputs are read as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is more like:\n\nThe first line is '10 2' and the second is '1'.\n\nThen, the second line is '16 R' and the third is '5'.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Anyway, in code, the first line is a and b, the second line is c_str.\n\nSo, now, testing the sample.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nLine 1: 10 2 → a=10, b=2.\n\nLine 2: 1 → c_str is '1' in base 10 → n=1.\n\nSince b is 2, not R, so convert 1 to base 2: '1'.\n\nOutput is '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nLine 1: 16 R → a=16, b='R'.\n\nLine 2:5 → c_str is '5' in base 16 → n=5.\n\nSince b is R, convert 5 to Roman: 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\nLine 1: 5 R → a=5, b=R.\n\nLine 2:4 → c_str is '4' in base5 → n=4.\n\nConvert to Roman: 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\nLine 1: 2 2 → a=2, b=2.\n\nLine 2: 1111001 → binary number 1111001 is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 +0*2^1 +1*2^0 → 64+32+16+8+1 = 121.\n\nConvert 121 to base2: 1111001 → same as input. So output is '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\nLine 1:12 13 → a=12, b=13.\n\nLine 2: A → A in base12 is 10.\n\nConvert to base13: since 10 <13, it's 'A'.\n\nSo, output is 'A'.\n\nSo the sample outputs match.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge Case 1: c_str is '0' → but problem says it's guaranteed not to be zero.\n\nEdge Case 2: a=2, b=2, c_str is '1111' → n=15. Output is '1111'.\n\nEdge Case 3: a=25, c_str is 'Y' → value is 24.\n\nIf b is 25: output 'Y'.\n\nIf b is 'R': 24 in Roman is XXIV.\n\nWait, 24 is XXIV? No, 24 is XXIV → 20 (XX) +4 (IV) → yes.\n\nAnother Edge Case: n=0 → but not allowed.\n\nAnother Edge Case: a=3, c_str is '10' → which is 1*3 +0 =3.\n\nConvert to base 3: '10'.\n\nWait, but the function int_to_base will return '10' as the string.\n\nWait, no: for n=3, base=3, the function would do:\n\n3 //3 =1, remainder 0 → add '0' to digits.\n\n1 //3 is 0, remainder 1 → add '1' to digits.\n\nDigits are [0,1], reversed → '10'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but wait: 3 in base3 is 10.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother Edge Case: n=400, which is CD in Roman numerals.\n\nSo, the function should correctly convert it to 'CD'.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing the helper functions:\n\nchar_to_value(c):\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + (ord(c.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\nint_to_roman(n):\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nint_to_base(n, base):\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nNow, handling the case where n is zero is not necessary since the problem says it's not zero.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nRead a, b, c_str.\n\nCompute n as the integer value of c_str in base a.\n\nThen, decide whether to output Roman or base b.\n\nSo, the code:\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + (ord(c.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\na, b = input().split()\na = int(a)\nc_str = input().strip()\n\nroman_numerals = (b == 'R')\n\nn = 0\nfor ch in c_str:\n    v = char_to_value(ch)\n    n = n * a + v\n\nif roman_numerals:\n    print(int_to_roman(n))\nelse:\n    print(int_to_base(n, int(b)))\n\nWait, but wait: what if b is 'R' but a is not a base that uses letters beyond 10? Like, for example, a=7, but in the problem statement, it's allowed since a can be up to 25.\n\nBut the code handles that correctly because in the c_str, any letters beyond the base's capacity would not be present.\n\nWait, but the code doesn't check that the c_str is a valid number in base a. But the problem statement says that it's guaranteed that the number is valid.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c_str='1'\n\nn =1 → base2 is '1'.\n\nOutput: '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\na=16, b=R, c_str='5' → 5 in base16 is 5.\n\nRoman numerals: 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\na=5, b=R, c_str='4' → 4 in base5 is 4.\n\nRoman: 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\na=2, b=2, c_str='1111001' → 121 in base2 is '1111001'.\n\nSample Input5:\n\na=12, b=13, c_str='A' → A in base12 is 10.\n\nConvert to base13: 10 is less than 13 → 'A'.\n\nSo, all sample outputs are correct.\n\nAnother Test Case: a=3, c_str='10' → 3 → in base3 is '10'.\n\nSo code would output '10'.\n\nAnother Test Case: a=25, c_str='Y' → 24.\n\nb=25: output 'Y'.\n\nb=R: output 'XXIV'.\n\nAnother Test Case: a=10, c_str='0' → but problem says it's not allowed.\n\nAnother Test Case: a=2, c_str='111' → 7 → in base2 is '111'.\n\nSo the code should handle all these correctly.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to either Roman numerals or another base `b`. The conversion depends on whether the second part of the input specifies the use of Roman numerals ('R') or a different base.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the first line to get the bases `a` and `b`. The second line contains the number in base `a` which we need to convert.\n2. **Determine Conversion Type**: Check if `b` is 'R' to decide if we need to convert the number to Roman numerals.\n3. **Convert to Integer**: Convert the given number from base `a` to an integer.\n4. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: If `b` is 'R', convert the integer to a Roman numeral string using predefined rules for Roman numerals.\n5. **Conversion to Base `b`**: If `b` is not 'R', convert the integer to a string representation in base `b`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + (ord(c.upper()) - ord('A'))\n\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef int_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n# Read input\na, b = input().split()\na = int(a)\nc_str = input().strip()\n\nroman_numerals = (b == 'R')\n\n# Convert c_str to integer in base a\nn = 0\nfor ch in c_str:\n    v = char_to_value(ch)\n    n = n * a + v\n\nif roman_numerals:\n    print(int_to_roman(n))\nelse:\n    print(int_to_base(n, int(b)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into the respective components. The first line gives the bases `a` and `b`, and the second line provides the number in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Integer**: The function `char_to_value` converts each character of the input string to its corresponding integer value in base `a`. This is done by iterating through each character and computing the total value.\n3. **Roman Numerals Conversion**: The function `int_to_roman` converts the integer value to a Roman numeral string using a list of tuples that map integer values to their Roman numeral equivalents, applying the subtractive principle where necessary.\n4. **Base Conversion**: The function `int_to_base` converts the integer value to a string in the specified base `b`. It handles bases higher than 10 by using letters A-Z for values 10 and above.\n\nThis approach ensures that the number is accurately converted from base `a` to the desired format, whether it be Roman numerals or another base, efficiently and correctly.",
