            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but if the base is 'R', it's the Roman numeral system. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the input has two parts: the first line is a and b. But b can be 'R' which represents the Roman numeral system. Then, the next line is c in base a, which could be a very long string. My task is to convert this number into base b, without leading zeros.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse the input correctly. The second line contains the number in base a. So, for each test case, I have a and b, then a string representing c in base a.\n\nWait, but what about when b is 'R'? Oh right, in that case, we need to treat b as the Roman numeral system. So, for example, if a is 10 and b is R, then I have to convert the number from base 10 to Roman numerals.\n\nSo the first step is to determine the target base. If b is 'R', then target base is Roman numerals. Else, it's an integer.\n\nNow, the main challenge is to write a function that converts a number from base a (which is a digit) to either another base or to Roman numerals.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read a and b. Check if b is 'R'. If not, it's an integer.\n2. Read the number string c in base a.\n3. Convert c from base a to an integer (assuming c is a decimal number).\n4. Then, convert this integer to base b. But wait, if the target is Roman numerals, then we need to represent it as per Roman rules.\n\nWait, no. Because when converting from base a to base b, if b is 2, it's just binary, etc. But when b is 'R', we're converting to Roman numerals, which isn't a positional numeral system like others. So, perhaps the process is:\n\n- If b is not R: Convert c (base a) to decimal, then to base b as a string.\n- If b is R: Convert c (base a) to decimal, then convert that decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Parse the input correctly.\n- Convert the given number string from base a to a decimal integer.\n- Then, if the target is a normal base, convert the decimal to that base as a string.\n- If the target is Roman numerals, convert the decimal to Roman.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement each part.\n\nFirst, parsing the number string c in base a.\n\nThe number can be up to 103 digits long. So, for bases up to 25, each digit can be 0-24 (for base 25, digits are 0-9 and A-T). Wait, but in base a, each digit must be less than a. So, when parsing, each character in the string must be checked to ensure it is a valid digit in base a.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that the number is valid because the input is guaranteed to be correct. So, I don't need to handle errors here.\n\nSo, for each character in c, I can map it to its value in base a. For example, in base 10, 'A' is invalid unless a > 10, but the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the number is in base a. So, for example, if a is 16, then the number can include letters A-F. So, the parser needs to handle digits beyond 9 when a is higher.\n\nSo, I'll need a helper function to convert a character to its value in base a.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For digits 0-9: their value is the same as their integer.\n- For letters A-Z (case doesn't matter?), they represent 10-35. But wait, since a can be up to 25, letters beyond T (19+6=25) won't be used. So, for a given a, letters go up to a certain point.\n\nSo, the helper function will take a character and the base, and return its value.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, when the number is written in base a, the letters are uppercase? Or does it matter? The sample input shows 'A' being handled correctly. So, probably, the input uses uppercase letters, and our code should treat them as such.\n\nSo, the function to get the value of a character in base a would look like:\n\ndef char_to_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        # It's a letter\n        val = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        return val\n\nBut wait, in the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to base `b`. If the target base `b` is 'R', the conversion should be done to Roman numerals. The solution involves parsing the input, converting the given number to a decimal integer, and then converting that decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input:** Read the bases `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R' indicating Roman numerals. Also, read the number string `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Convert to Decimal:** Convert the number string `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer.\n3. **Convert to Target Base or Roman Numerals:** Depending on whether `b` is 'R' or an integer, convert the decimal integer to either the specified base or Roman numerals.\n4. **Output the Result:** Print the result without leading zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while num >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            num -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef char_value(c, base):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return 10 + ord(c.upper()) - ord('A')\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    decimal = 0\n    for c in s:\n        decimal = decimal * base + char_value(c, base)\n    return decimal\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(str(rem))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    a_b = input_lines[0].split()\n    a = int(a_b[0])\n    b = a_b[1] if len(a_b) > 1 else 'R'\n    c = input_lines[1].strip()\n    \n    decimal = str_to_decimal(c, a)\n    \n    if b == 'R':\n        print(int_to_roman(decimal))\n    else:\n        print(decimal_to_base(decimal, int(b)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read and split into the respective components: bases `a` and `b`, and the number string `c`.\n2. **Character Value Conversion:** The function `char_value` converts each character to its corresponding value in the given base.\n3. **String to Decimal Conversion:** The function `str_to_decimal` converts the number string from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and computing the total value.\n4. **Decimal to Roman Conversion:** The function `int_to_roman` converts the decimal integer to a Roman numeral string using predefined mappings of values to their Roman representations.\n5. **Decimal to Base Conversion:** The function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal integer to the specified base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders.\n6. **Main Function:** The main function orchestrates the conversion process, handling both Roman numerals and other bases, and prints the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that the number is accurately converted from any base `a` to the target base `b` or Roman numerals, handling all edge cases efficiently.",
