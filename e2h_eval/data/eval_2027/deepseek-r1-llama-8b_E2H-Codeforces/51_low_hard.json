Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be used to exactly form two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters of the guest and host, they should exactly match the pile, without any extra letters left over or missing.\n\nHmm, so the input has three lines. The first line is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile. All are uppercase letters. I need to determine if the pile can be rearranged to form both names together.\n\nSo, the approach here seems clear. We need to count all the letters in the guest and host names combined, and then compare that to the counts in the pile. If they match exactly, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle this in Python? Let's think.\n\nFirst, I'll read the three lines from the input. Then, I'll process each of them by counting the frequency of each character.\n\nFor each line (guest, host, pile), I can convert them into a Counter object. Then, for the guest and host, I'll combine their counters by adding them. This will give me the total required letters. Then, I'll compare this combined counter with the pile's counter. If they're equal, then return YES; else, NO.\n\nOh right! So the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines.\n2. Create Counters for guest and host.\n3. Combine these Counters to get the expected total.\n4. Create a Counter for the pile.\n5. Compare the combined Counter with the pile's Counter. If they match, output YES, else NO.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBut wait, what about the edge cases? Like, if one of the names is empty? But the problem states that all lines are not empty, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nAnother thing: the order doesn't matter, just the counts. So sorting the letters isn't necessary; using Counters is more efficient.\n\nIn Python, the collections.Counter class is perfect for this. So I'll import Counter from collections.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\n- Read the three lines, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace (since sometimes newlines can cause issues).\n- For each line, create a Counter.\n- Sum the guest and host Counters.\n- Check if this sum equals the pile Counter.\n\nWait, but how to read the input? Because the problem shows the input as a list with three elements, but in reality, the input comes from standard input as three lines.\n\nIn Python, I can read using input().strip() for each line.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, create counters:\n\nguest_counter = Counter(guest)\nhost_counter = Counter(host)\nexpected = guest_counter + host_counter  # Adding them gives the total.\n\npile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\nif expected == pile_counter:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, yes. That's the plan.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is three lines, each being the guest, host, and pile. So in code, the guest is the first line, host the second, pile the third.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nGuest is 'SANTACLAUS' which is SANTACLAUS → let's see letters: S A N T A C L A U S → S:2, A:3, N:1, T:1, C:1, L:1, U:1.\n\nHost is 'DEDMOROZ' → D E D M O R O Z → D:2, E:1, M:1, O:2, R:1, Z:1.\n\nCombined, the expected letters would be all letters from guest and host.\n\nThe pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' → which when combined, should match the expected.\n\nIn the sample, the output is YES.\n\nAnother sample: the second input's pile has a missing P and an extra L. So the code should detect that.\n\nThird sample: the pile has an extra L, so the code correctly returns NO.\n\nI think this logic covers all cases.\n\nWhat about case where the guest and host names together have more letters than the pile? Or less?\n\nYes, the Counter comparison takes care of that.\n\nSo, the code",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given pile of letters can be used to exactly form two names: the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the combined letters of the guest and host names match the letters in the pile without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Counting Letters:** Use the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each letter in the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile.\n3. **Combining Counters:** Combine the counters of the guest's and host's names to get the total expected letters.\n4. **Comparison:** Compare the combined counter with the pile's counter. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of letters using their frequencies, which is both time and space efficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three lines from input\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Create counters for each part\nguest_counter = Counter(guest)\nhost_counter = Counter(host)\nexpected = guest_counter + host_counter\n\n# Create the counter for the pile\npile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\n# Check if the expected letters match the pile\nif expected == pile_counter:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The code reads three lines of input corresponding to the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Counting Letters:** Using `Counter`, we convert each string into a dictionary-like structure where keys are characters and values are their respective counts.\n3. **Combining Counters:** The counters for the guest and host are combined to get the total required letters.\n4. **Comparison:** By comparing the combined counter with the pile's counter, we determine if the pile can be rearranged to form both names exactly.\n\nThis method ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, providing the correct result based on the exact letter counts.",
