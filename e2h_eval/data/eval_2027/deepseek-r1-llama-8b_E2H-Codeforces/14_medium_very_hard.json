He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many positive integers n exist such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n where Z(n) = m. Then count them and list them.\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's efficiently?\n\nI think I can use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds where Z(n) equals m.\n\nWait, but sometimes there might be a range of n's that give the same Z(n). Like, maybe multiple consecutive n's have the same number of trailing zeros. So I need to find all such n's.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that Z(n) >= m.\n2. Check if Z(n) equals m. If not, then there's no solution (return 0).\n3. Otherwise, find the next n where Z(n) increases beyond m. The numbers between the first and last n (inclusive) would all have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut wait, sometimes Z(n) might increase by more than one when n increases by one. For example, when n is a multiple of 5^k for some k, adding 1 might add multiple 5s.\n\nBut for the purpose of finding the range, we can perform binary search to find the start and end points.\n\nLet me outline the steps more concretely.\n\nFirst, implement a function to compute Z(n), which counts the number of trailing zeros.\n\nThen, find the minimal n_low such that Z(n_low) == m. But wait, no—maybe it's better to find the first occurrence where Z(n) >= m, and see if it's exactly m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using binary search to find the left and right boundaries where Z(n) equals m.\n\nWait, but the function Z(n) is non-decreasing because as n increases, the count of 5s can only stay the same or increase. So it's a monotonic function. Therefore, all n's where Z(n)=m form a contiguous range. Or do they?\n\nWait, no. Because for some n, Z(n+1) = Z(n) + something. For example, n=24: Z(24)=4 (from 5,10,15,20). n=25: Z(25)=6 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So between 24 and 25, Z increases by 2. So for m=4, the only n is 24. For m=6, the only n is 25. But what about m=5? It doesn't exist because Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6. So for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the key is to find all n where Z(n)=m. Since Z is non-decreasing, all such n's will form a continuous interval.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Use binary search to find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m.\n2. Check if Z(n) is equal to m. If not, return 0.\n3. Then find the largest n where Z(n) <= m. Wait, no. Because once Z(n) reaches m, it may stay at m for several increments. So the correct approach is to find the maximum n where Z(n) is exactly m.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: after finding the first n where Z(n) = m, we can find the next n where Z(n) > m. Then all numbers between the first and (next-1) will also have Z(n)=m.\n\nBut wait, let's think about when Z(n) increases by more than 1. For example, suppose m=5. Then, as before, n=24 gives Z=4, n=25 gives Z=6. So m=5 isn't present. But for m=6, n=25 is the only one.\n\nBut for m=6, what happens at n=26? Let's calculate Z(26).\n\nZ(26) = 26//5=5, 26//25=1 → total 6. So Z(26)=6 as well.\n\nSimilarly, Z(27)=5+1=6. So for m=6, the numbers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30? Wait, no. Let's compute Z(30):\n\n30//5=6, 30//25=1 → total 7. So Z(30)=7.\n\nSo for m=6, the n's are 25,26,27,28,29. Wait, no—wait, 25 gives 6, 26 gives 6, 27 gives 6, 28 gives 6, 29 gives 6, 30 gives 7. So n ranges from 25 to 29 inclusive. That's 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, the set of n's satisfying Z(n)=m is a continuous range. So the plan is:\n\n- Find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m.\n- If Z(n) != m, return 0.\n- Else, find the maximal n where Z(n) = m.\n- The count is max_n - min_n + 1.\n- The numbers are from min_n to max_n inclusive.\n\nSo how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nWe can use binary search.\n\nFirst, find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m. Let's call this low.\n\nIf Z(low) != m, then no solution exists.\n\nOtherwise, find the smallest n where Z(n) > m. Let's call this high.\n\nThen, the min_n is low, and max_n is high-1.\n\nWait, yes. Because all n's between low and high-1 have Z(n) = m.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the minimal n where Z(n) >= m.\n\n   - If Z(n) != m, output 0.\n\n2. Else, compute the minimal n where Z(n) > m.\n\n   - The max_n is (this n minus 1).\n\n3. The count is max_n - min_n + 1.\n\n4. Output the numbers from min_n to max_n.\n\nSo the main challenge is to implement the binary search correctly.\n\nNow, how to compute Z(n)?\n\nImplement a function count_zero(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nWhich is sum of n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo code for that function is straightforward.\n\nNext, the binary search for the lower bound.\n\nWe can set low to 0, high to a sufficiently large number. Since m can be up to 1e5, n can be up to 5*m, but actually higher. So perhaps setting high to 5*m is sufficient, but perhaps to avoid errors, we can set high to 5*(m+1) or something.\n\nWait, but binary search can handle larger values. So the initial high can be 5*m, since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero.\n\nWait, for example, when m is 1e5, the minimal n could be around 5e5, but perhaps not. Let's see:\n\nWhat is Z(5e5)?\n\nZ(5e5) = 5e5 /5 +5e5/25 +5e5/125 + ... \n\nWhich is 1e5 + 4e4 + 3.2e3 + 2.56e2 + ... etc. That's way more than 1e5.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n for m=1e5 is less than 5e5.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, what is the minimal n where Z(n) >= 1e5?\n\nWell, perhaps it's around 5e5 / 4, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the binary search can safely go up to 5e5 *5 = 2.5e6 or something, but perhaps a better approach is to start with a high that's big enough.\n\nWait, but for the purposes of binary search, starting high at 5e5 should be sufficient for m=1e5.\n\nBecause Z(5e5) is definitely more than 1e5.\n\nWait, let's compute Z(5e5):\n\n5e5 /5 = 1e5\n\n5e5 /25 = 2e4\n\n5e5 /125 = 4e3\n\n5e5 /625 = 8e2\n\n5e5 /3125 = 160\n\n5e5 /15625 = 32\n\n5e5 /78125 = 6.4 → 6\n\n5e5 /390625 = 1.28 → 1\n\nTotal is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + 800 + 160 +32 +6 +1 = \n\nLet's compute step by step:\n\n1e5 = 100000\n\n+2e4 = 120000\n\n+4e3 = 124000\n\n+800 = 124800\n\n+160 → 124960\n\n+32 → 124992\n\n+6 → 124998\n\n+1 → 124999.\n\nSo Z(5e5)=124999, which is way more than 1e5.\n\nWait, so for m=1e5, the minimal n is much smaller.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute for n where Z(n) is 1e5.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal n is somewhere around 5e5 / (1 + 1/5 + 1/25 + ...) ?\n\nNot sure, but binary search can find it.\n\nSo, in code, the binary search will have low=0 and high=5e5 initially, but perhaps even high=5e6 is safe.\n\nSo now, the plan for the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute the minimal n (low) where Z(n) >= m.\n\nIf Z(low) != m, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal n (high) where Z(n) > m.\n\nThen, the numbers are from low to high-1.\n\nThe count is high - low.\n\nWait, no: high is the first n where Z(n) > m. So the max_n is high-1.\n\nSo the count is high - low.\n\nWait, no: from low to high-1, inclusive, that's high - low numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, m=1.\n\nFind the minimal n where Z(n)>=1.\n\nZ(5)=1, which is >=1.\n\nCheck if Z(5) ==1: yes.\n\nThen find the minimal n where Z(n)>1.\n\nZ(5)=1, Z(6)=1, Z(7)=1, Z(8)=1, Z(9)=1, Z(10)=2.\n\nSo the minimal n where Z(n)>1 is 10.\n\nSo the max_n is 9.\n\nSo the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 → 5 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example, m=5.\n\nAs discussed earlier, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6. So for m=5, there's no solution.\n\nSo the code should output 0.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nImplement count_zero(n).\n\nImplement binary search for low and high.\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low as the first n where Z(n) >=m.\n\nIf Z(low) != m: print 0.\n\nElse, compute high as the first n where Z(n) >m.\n\nThen, the numbers are from low to high-1.\n\nIf low >= high, then the count is 0.\n\nWait, no: because if low is 5 and high is 5, then high-1 is 4, which is less than low. So that case won't happen.\n\nWait, no: because in the binary search, low will be the first n where Z(n)>=m, and high will be the first n where Z(n)>m.\n\nSo, for example, if m=1, low=5, high=10.\n\nSo high - low =5 → the count is 5.\n\nIn code, after getting low and high, if high <= low: output 0.\n\nElse, the count is high - low.\n\nWait, no: high is the first n where Z(n) >m.\n\nSo for n=5, Z(n)=1.\n\nn=6,7,8,9: Z=1.\n\nn=10: Z=2.\n\nSo high is 10.\n\nSo the max_n is 9.\n\nSo the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9: 5 numbers.\n\nWhich is high (10) - low (5) =5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code logic:\n\nif low >= high: → no solution.\n\nelse: count is high - low.\n\nWait, no, because in the case where high is found, but Z(high) is not greater than m, but that's impossible because the binary search condition is correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nread m.\n\ncompute low via binary search.\n\nif Z(low) !=m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute high via binary search.\n\n   count = high - low.\n\n   if count ==0: output 0.\n\n   else: output the numbers from low to high-1.\n\nWait, but in cases where high is low, then high - low is zero, which implies no solution.\n\nBut earlier condition already checks if Z(low) ==m.\n\nSo perhaps, in code:\n\nafter finding low and high:\n\nif Z(low) !=m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   if high == low:\n\n       output 0.\n\n   else:\n\n       output the numbers from low to high-1.\n\nWait, but why can high be equal to low?\n\nOnly if Z(low) >m, but that's not possible because we have checked Z(low)==m.\n\nWait, no. Because in the binary search for high, it's the first n where Z(n)>m.\n\nSo if low is such that Z(low) ==m, then Z(high) must be >m.\n\nThus, high will be > low.\n\nSo the count will be high - low.\n\nWhich is always >=1.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nImplement the binary search functions.\n\nSo now, the code structure:\n\nImplement count_zero(n).\n\ndef count_zero(n):\n\n    res =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        res +=n\n\n    return res\n\nThen, function to find the first n where Z(n)>=target.\n\nWe can write a binary search function:\n\ndef find_first_ge(target):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high=5* (target) # initial high.\n\n    # but maybe better to set high to a higher value.\n\n    # Alternatively, start with high=5e18.\n\n    # because for m up to 1e5, n can be up to 5e5.\n\n    # but perhaps setting high=5*(target) is insufficient.\n\n    # So, perhaps set high to 5e18.\n\n    high=5e18\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n\n        if z < target:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but this can take a lot of time for very high targets.\n\nWait, but for m up to 1e5, 5e5 is sufficient.\n\nWait, but for m=1e5, the function would have to compute up to 5e5.\n\nBut binary search over 5e18 is not feasible because the number of steps is log2(5e18) ~ 60 steps. Which is manageable.\n\nSo perhaps it's better to set high to a sufficiently large value, say 5e18.\n\nSo the function becomes:\n\ndef find_first_ge(target):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high=5e18\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n\n        if z < target:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid\n\n    return low\n\nSimilarly, the function to find the first n where Z(n) >m.\n\ndef find_first_gt(m):\n\n    low=0\n\n    high=5e18\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n\n        if z > m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for find_first_gt, the condition is whether Z(mid) >m. So during binary search, we adjust high and low accordingly.\n\nOnce we find low after loop, that's the first n where Z(n) >m.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low = find_first_ge(m).\n\nif Z(low) !=m: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   compute high = find_first_gt(m).\n\n   count = high - low.\n\n   if count ==0:\n\n       print(0)\n\n   else:\n\n       print(count)\n\n       print the numbers from low to high-1, space-separated.\n\nWait, but for m=1, the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nSo, in code, for the numbers, when count is 5, we print 5 followed by a newline, then the five numbers separated by spaces.\n\nWait, no. Looking at the sample output:\n\nThe first line is '5', then the second line is '5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nSo the output is a single integer k on the first line, followed by k integers on the second line.\n\nSo, in code, after determining that there are k numbers, we print k, then print the numbers separated by spaces.\n\nSo, for the sample, k=5, and the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high))))\n\nWait, but range is exclusive of the end, so range(low, high) gives low, low+1, ..., high-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, test cases.\n\nTest case 1: m=1.\n\nlow is 5, Z(5)=1.\n\nhigh is 10, Z(10)=2.\n\nSo numbers are 5,6,7,8,9 → 5 numbers.\n\nOutput is 5 followed by the five numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nFind low where Z(n)>=5.\n\nCompute Z(20): 4.\n\nZ(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6.\n\nSo low is 25.\n\nBut Z(25)=6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nlow is 25.\n\nZ(25)=6 ==m.\n\nhigh is 30 (since Z(30)=7).\n\nNumbers are 25,26,27,28,29 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo output is 5 followed by these five.\n\nAnother test case: m=0. Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1, so we don't need to handle m=0.\n\nWhat about m=2?\n\nZ(10)=2.\n\nWait, Z(10) is 10/5=2, so yes.\n\nlow is 10.\n\nhigh is the first n where Z(n) >2.\n\nWhich is 15? Let's compute Z(14):\n\n14//5=2, 14//25=0 → Z=2.\n\nZ(15)=3.\n\nSo high is 15.\n\nSo numbers are 10,11,12,13,14 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo output is 5 followed by those.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\nFind low where Z(n)>=3.\n\nCompute Z(14)=2, Z(15)=3.\n\nSo low=15.\n\nhigh is 20 (since Z(20)=4).\n\nNumbers 15,16,17,18,19 →5 numbers.\n\nSo output is 5 followed by them.\n\nWait, but Z(19)=3, right?\n\nYes: 19//5=3, 19//25=0 → Z=3.\n\nSo numbers 15,16,17,18,19.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if m is zero? Not in the input constraints.\n\n- What if m is 1e5? The code should find the correct low and high.\n\nAnother thing to consider: for large m, the binary search must be efficient enough. But since it's logarithmic, it's manageable.\n\nSo now, implementing the code.\n\nBut in Python, for the binary search, perhaps the initial high is 5e18, but for m=1e5, the low can be found quickly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], but the actual code expects a single integer.\n\nWait, the problem says the input is an integer m, so in the code, we can read it as:\n\nimport sys\n\nm = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nThen, implement the functions.\n\nBut in Python, 5e18 is a float, which may cause issues. So perhaps better to represent high as a very large integer, say 5 * (10 ** 18).\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef count_zero(n):\n\n    res =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        res +=n\n\n    return res\n\ndef find_first_ge(target):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high=5 * (10**18)\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n\n        if z < target:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid\n\n    return low\n\ndef find_first_gt(m):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high=5 * (10**18)\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n\n        if z > m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nThen, compute:\n\nlow = find_first_ge(m)\n\nif count_zero(low) !=m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    high = find_first_gt(m)\n\n    count = high - low\n\n    print(count)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high))))\n\nWait, but for m=5, the code correctly outputs 0.\n\nTesting:\n\nFor m=5:\n\nfind_first_ge(5) returns 25, because Z(24)=4 <5, Z(25)=6 >=5.\n\nBut since Z(25) is 6 !=5, the code will print 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nlow=25, Z=6.\n\nhigh=30.\n\ncount=5.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when m is such that the count is 1?\n\nLike m=3, and the only n is 15.\n\nNo, earlier test case shows that when m=3, the count is 5 (n=15,16,17,18,19).\n\nWait, no: Z(15)=3, Z(16)=3, Z(17)=3, Z(18)=3, Z(19)=3, Z(20)=4.\n\nSo for m=3, the count is 5 (15-19 inclusive).\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about m=7?\n\nCompute Z(20)=4, Z(21)=4, Z(22)=4, Z(23)=4, Z(24)=4, Z(25)=6, Z(26)=6, Z(27)=6, Z(28)=6, Z(29)=6, Z(30)=7.\n\nSo for m=7:\n\nlow=30.\n\nhigh is the first n where Z(n)>7.\n\nCompute Z(31)=7, Z(32)=7, etc., up to Z(34)=7.\n\nZ(35)=7 + 35//25=7 +1=8.\n\nSo high=35.\n\nSo the numbers are 30,31,32,33,34 → count is 5.\n\nSo code will output 5 followed by these.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nSo now, the code can be written as:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low and check if Z(low) ==m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse compute high.\n\nPrint the count and the numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if m is such that Z(n) never equals m?\n\nLike m=5.\n\nIn that case, low=25, Z(low)=6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code handles all cases.\n\nNow, write the code.\n",

Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This count can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: We use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeroes is at least \\( m \\) and the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeroes exceeds \\( m \\). This helps us determine the range of valid \\( n \\) values.\n\n3. **Determine Valid Range**: Once we have the bounds, the valid integers \\( n \\) lie between these two values. If the smallest \\( n \\) found does not exactly match \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, there are no solutions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zero(n):\n    res = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        res += n\n    return res\n\ndef find_first_ge(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (10**18)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n        if z < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef find_first_gt(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * (10**18)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zero(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nlow = find_first_ge(m)\nif count_zero(low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    high = find_first_gt(m)\n    count = high - low\n    print(count)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer \\( m \\), which represents the required number of trailing zeroes.\n\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeroes**: The function `count_zero` computes the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) using the formula described.\n\n3. **Finding Bounds**: \n   - `find_first_ge(target)` finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeroes is at least \\( m \\).\n   - `find_first_gt(m)` finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeroes exceeds \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Determining Valid Range**: After finding the bounds, we check if the lower bound actually results in exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. If it does, we calculate the range of valid \\( n \\) values and print them. If not, we print 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and handles the constraints effectively.",
