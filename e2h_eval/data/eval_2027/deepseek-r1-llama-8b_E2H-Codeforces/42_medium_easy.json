    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is about two progress bars when copying files. Each file is copied in order, and after each byte is copied, both progress bars are updated. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file that's been copied. The second shows the overall percentage across all files.\n\nThe goal is to find all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive such that at some moment both progress bars show the same number. Then, output these numbers in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So for each possible value p from 0 to 100, I need to check if there's a time when both progress bars equal p.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nEach time a byte is copied, the current file's progress bar increases, and the total progress bar also increases. So for each step, I can compute the current state of both progress bars and see if they match any p.\n\nWait, but the steps are per byte. Since the file sizes can be up to 1000, and n up to 100, the maximum number of bytes is 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut for each step, I can track the current progress of each bar and record when they are equal.\n\nBut wait, the progress bars are updated after each byte, so for each x (number of bytes copied so far), we can calculate the percentages.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to simulate the process and for each step, calculate both percentages, then record if they are in 0-100 and equal.\n\nBut let's think about what the progress bars are.\n\nAt any step, for the current file i, x is the number of bytes copied from this file. The first progress bar is floor(100 * x / a_i).\n\nThe second progress bar is floor(100 * (sum of a_1 to a_{i-1} + x) / total_sum), where total_sum is sum(a_1 to a_n).\n\nWait, but the sum is the total bytes to copy. So for each step, when processing file i, the total bytes processed so far are sum_{k=1 to i-1} a_k + x, where x is the bytes processed in file i up to this step.\n\nWait, no: because x is the bytes processed in file i. So for the first file, i=1, x is the bytes processed. For the second file, i=2, x is the bytes processed in file 2, etc.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the simulation as moving through each byte, but that might be too slow for large file sizes. But since the maximum a_i is 1000, and n is up to 100, the maximum total bytes is 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Compute the prefix sums for each file. Or more precisely, for each file, have an array of cumulative bytes processed.\n\nWait, no. Let's model the process step by step.\n\nInitially, no bytes are copied. So for the first file, we start copying bytes one by one. After each byte, we update both progress bars.\n\nWait, but the progress bars are based on the current file and the total.\n\nSo for each step, the progress for the current file is (x / a_i) * 100, floored down. And the total progress is (total_so_far / total_sum) * 100, floored down.\n\nWe can represent the current state as:\n\ncurrent_file = i (the current file being processed)\nbytes_in_current_file = x (the number of bytes processed in this file so far)\ntotal_processed = sum_{k=1 to i-1} a_k + x\n\nWait, but for each step, x increases by 1. So for each step, we can:\n\n- Update the current_file's progress.\n- Update the total progress.\n\nThen, check if both are equal to the same p.\n\nSo, for each possible step, calculate p1 and p2, and if p1 == p2, add p to the result set.\n\nNow, how do I model the steps?\n\nLet's think of the process as going through each file in order. For each file i, we process each byte from 1 to a_i, updating the progress bars each time.\n\nWait, but that's exactly what needs to be done. Because for each byte in each file, the progress bars change.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- total_sum = sum(a)\n- current_file_index = 0\n- current_bytes_in_file = 0\n- total_processed = 0\n- results = empty set\n\nFor each file i from 0 to n-1:\n    for x in 1 to a[i]:\n        current_bytes_in_file += 1\n        total_processed += 1\n\n        p1 = floor( (current_bytes_in_file * 100) / a[i] )\n        p2 = floor( (total_processed * 100) / total_sum )\n\n        if p1 == p2:\n            add p1 to results\n\nWait, but wait: after each byte is copied, both progress bars are updated. So for the first file, x starts at 0, then increments by 1 each time. So for each x in 1..a[0], we have to calculate p1 and p2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For each file, for each byte in that file, update x, compute p1 and p2, and collect all p where p1 == p2.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as:\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a)\nresults = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        # Update current bytes in file i\n        current_bytes_in_file = x\n        # Update total processed bytes\n        total_processed = sum(a[:i]) + x  # sum of previous files plus current x\n        # Compute p1 and p2\n        p1 = (current_bytes_in_file * 100) // a[i]\n        p2 = (total_processed * 100) // total_sum\n        if p1 == p2:\n            results.add(p1)\n\nBut wait, for each file i, the sum of the previous files is sum(a[:i]). So for i=0, sum(a[:0]) is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo yes.\n\nOnce all steps are processed, collect the sorted list of p in 0-100.\n\nWait, but what about the initial state before any bytes are copied? Both progress bars are 0, so 0 is included.\n\nIn the code above, for the first step, x=1: p1 = 100*1//a[0], which could be 0 or higher. So the initial state isn't captured.\n\nAh, right! So the initial state is before any x is incremented. So, when x is 0, both p1 and p2 are 0.\n\nSo, I need to include 0 in the results if 0 appears at any step.\n\nWait, but in the code above, when x is 0 (before any bytes are processed), it's not considered. So, in the code, the initial state is when x=0, but in the loop, x starts from 1.\n\nSo, I need to handle x=0 separately.\n\nWait, no. Because initially, both progress bars are 0. So p=0 is definitely in the results.\n\nSo, in the code, after initializing, we can add 0 to the results.\n\nWait, but in the loop, for each x from 1 to a[i], the code processes the steps after x has been copied. So, the initial state (x=0) is not covered.\n\nTherefore, the code should also consider adding 0 to the results.\n\nSo, modify the code:\n\nresults = {0}\n\nThen, proceed with the loop.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, now, the code will capture all the p's that are equal at any step, including the initial state.\n\nAnother thing to note: the progress bars are updated after each byte. So, for x=1, the first step, the progress bars are updated. So, for x=0, it's not part of the loop.\n\nSo, the initial 0 is added, and then the loop captures all other steps.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\nSample Output:\n\nEach line corresponds to a test case.\n\nWait, the input is multiple test cases, each consisting of a line with n followed by n numbers.\n\nWait, the way the input is given is unclear. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the Input section:\n\nThe first line is n. The second line contains n integers a_1 ... a_n.\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input is:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nWhich means n=1, a=[6].\n\nThe output is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nSo, during the process:\n\nAfter each byte is copied, the progress bars are updated.\n\nWait, but in the first case, the progress bars are the same because it's only one file.\n\nSo, every time a byte is copied, both progress bars are equal.\n\nSo, for x=1: p1 = 100*1/6=16.666... → 16. p2 is 100*(1)/6 → 16.666 →16. So p1=p2=16.\n\nSimilarly for x=2: 33.333→33, p2 is 33.333 →33.\n\nSo, the output includes all the p's when p1=p2.\n\nIn the code, the initial 0 is added, then for x=1, 16 is added, x=2 adds 33, etc.\n\nSo the code correctly captures all the required p's.\n\nAnother sample case: the second input is:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nSo, a = [100,500], total_sum=600.\n\nThe process is:\n\nFirst, file 1 with 100 bytes.\n\nx runs from 1 to 100.\n\nFor x=1: p1=1 →1% (since 1/100=0.01 →1). p2= (100*1)/600=0.166 →0%.\n\nSo, p1=1, p2=0. Not equal.\n\nAs x increases, the p1 and p2 will cross.\n\nWait, but when does p1 equal p2?\n\nHmm, perhaps in this case, the two progress bars may coincide at certain points.\n\nWait, but according to the sample output, the second case's output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps during the processing of the first file, after some steps, p1 equals p2.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps when the first file is completely processed (x=100), the total_processed is 100, so p2 is 100*100/600 = 16.666 →16.666, floored to 16. So p1 is 100% (100/100=1 →100%), but p2 is 16. So p1 != p2.\n\nWait, but perhaps during the second file's processing, after some bytes, p1 and p2 are equal.\n\nWait, maybe after the second file is processed completely, the total_processed is 600, so p2 is 100%.\n\nBut during processing the second file, each byte increases p2 as well as p1 (for the current file).\n\nSo, for the second file, when x is 500, the total_processed becomes 600. So, p2 is 100%. The p1 is 500/500=1 →100%. So, p1=p2=100.\n\nThus, 100 is included.\n\nBut why are 95,96, etc., included?\n\nHmm, perhaps during the processing of the second file, at certain points, the p1 and p2 are equal.\n\nWait, let's model this.\n\nLet me try to find when p1 = p2.\n\np1 is (x / a_i)*100, floored.\n\np2 is (total_processed * 100) / total_sum, floored.\n\nWait, for the second test case, a = [100,500], total_sum=600.\n\nProcessing the first file:\n\nFor x in 1 to 100.\n\nAfter x bytes, total_processed = x.\n\np1 = (x * 100) // 100 → x.\n\np2 = (x * 100) // 600 → (10x)//6 → floor.\n\nSo, for x=10: p1=10, p2= (100)/6=16.666→16. Not equal.\n\nLooking for x where x == floor(100x/600).\n\nWhich is x == floor( x / 6 ).\n\nWait, let's solve for x:\n\nx = floor( x / 6 )\n\nHmm, let's find x where this holds.\n\nTry x=0: yes.\n\nx=1: 1 vs 0 → no.\n\nx=5: 5 vs 0 → no.\n\nx=6: 6 vs 1 → no.\n\nx=12: 12 vs 2 → no.\n\nWait, perhaps for x= 0, 6, 12, etc., but p1 is x, p2 is 10x//6.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, for x=95:\n\np1 =95, p2 = (95 * 100) // 600 →9500/600=15.833 →15.\n\nNo, 95 !=15.\n\nWait, perhaps during the processing of the second file.\n\nLet's see.\n\nAfter processing the first file (x=100), total_processed=100.\n\nNow, processing the second file.\n\nFor x in 1 to 500.\n\nEach x increases the current_bytes_in_file (for second file) by 1, and total_processed by 1.\n\nSo, for x=1 in second file:\n\ncurrent_bytes_in_file =1.\n\np1= (1/500)*100=0.2 →0.\n\np2= (100+1)/600 *100=101/600≈16.833 →16.\n\nSo p1=0, p2=16: not equal.\n\nx=2:\n\np1=0.4→0.\n\np2=102/600=17 →17.\n\nNot equal.\n\n...\n\nWait, when does p1 equal p2?\n\nWe can model this as follows.\n\nLet’s denote s = sum of a[:i] + x, where i is the current file, and x is the bytes processed in that file.\n\nWait, no, in this case, when processing the second file, the sum of the first file is 100.\n\nSo for the second file, the total_processed after x bytes is 100 + x.\n\np1 = (x * 100) // 500 → (x * 0.2), floored.\n\np2 = (100 + x) * 100 / 600 → (100 +x)*100 /600 → (100 +x)*5/3 → approx.\n\nWe need to find x where p1 = p2.\n\nSo, equation: floor( x * 0.2 ) == floor( (100 + x)*5/3 )\n\nLet me compute for various x:\n\nWait, 0.2x is the p1.\n\n(100 +x)*5/3 = (500 +5x)/3 ≈ 166.666 + 1.666x.\n\nWe need 0.2x = (100 +x)*5/3.\n\nWait, but this is approximate because we're using floors.\n\nWait, perhaps solving for x where 0.2x <= (100+x)*5/3 < 0.2x +1.\n\nBut this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the second test case, the p values that are in the output are 0, 95, 96, etc., up to 100.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe in the second test case, during the processing of the second file, at certain x, p1 and p2 coincide.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to rely on the code to correctly compute all the p's.\n\nSo, the code structure seems solid.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, a = [1].\n\nSo, for each x from 1 to 1:\n\nx=1: p1=100, p2=100. So p=100 is added.\n\nAlso, initial state: 0 is added.\n\nSo the output is 0,100.\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, n=1, a=6.\n\nWait, the sample output is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nSo, for each x in 1 to 6:\n\nx=1: p1=16, p2=16 → added.\n\nx=2: 33,33 → added.\n\nx=3:50,50 →added.\n\nx=4:66,66 → added.\n\nx=5:83,83 → added.\n\nx=6:100,100 → added.\n\nSo, all the p's except 0 and 100 are included.\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial 0 is added, and then the loop adds 16,33, etc. So the output is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a=1000.\n\nSo, for each x from 1 to 1000, p1 = (x*100)/1000 →10x, floored.\n\np2 = (x*100)/1000 → same as p1.\n\nSo, for each x, p1=p2.\n\nSo, the output is 0, 10,20,...,100.\n\nSo, the code should capture all 11 values.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a=[1,1]. Total sum is 2.\n\nProcessing first file, x=1: p1=100, p2=50.\n\nSo, p1=100, p2=50: no match.\n\nThen, process second file, x=1: p1=0 (since x=1, a=1 →100%?), wait wait, wait.\n\nWait, a is [1,1].\n\nProcessing first file:\n\nx=1: p1=100 *1 /1 →100, p2=1*100/2 →50.\n\nSo, 100 !=50.\n\nProcessing second file:\n\nx=1: current_bytes_in_file=1, a_i=1 →100% →p1=100.\n\ntotal_processed=1+1=2 →p2=100.\n\nSo, p1=100, p2=100 → added.\n\nSo, in the output, 0,100.\n\nBecause initial 0 is added, and at the end, p=100 is added.\n\nSo, the code correctly captures these.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a = [500,500].\n\nTotal sum=1000.\n\nProcessing first file, x=500: p1=100%, p2=500/1000=50% → no.\n\nProcessing second file:\n\nAt x=500: p1=100%, p2=1000/1000=100%.\n\nSo, 100 is added.\n\nBut during the processing, maybe some p's match.\n\nLike, when x=250 in the second file:\n\np1=250/500 *100=50.\n\np2=(500 +250)/1000 *100=750/1000*100=75 →50 !=75.\n\nSo, no.\n\nSo, the output would include 0 and 100.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nThe code should read multiple test cases. Each test case is a line with n, followed by n numbers.\n\nWait, no. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nIt says:\n\nInput:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is multiple lines, each starting with n, followed by n numbers.\n\nSo, in Python, the code should read each line, split into parts, and process each test case.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nFor each line:\n\nsplit into n and the list of a.\n\nn is integer, a is list of integers.\n\nprocess each case as described.\n\nNow, in Python, to read the input:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, for each line in lines:\n\nparts = line.split()\n\nn = int(parts[0])\n\na = list(map(int, parts[1:]))\n\nThen, process a.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    for line in lines:\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        parts = line.split()\n        n = int(parts[0])\n        a = list(map(int, parts[1:]))\n        total_sum = sum(a)\n        results = {0}\n        for i in range(n):\n            ai = a[i]\n            for x in range(1, ai + 1):\n                current_bytes_in_file = x\n                total_processed = sum(a[:i]) + x\n                p1 = (current_bytes_in_file * 100) // ai\n                p2 = (total_processed * 100) // total_sum\n                if p1 == p2:\n                    results.add(p1)\n        # Now, sort the results\n        sorted_results = sorted(results)\n        # Print them space-separated?\n        # No, wait, the sample output shows each line is the numbers separated by newlines, each on its own line.\n        # Wait, the sample output is:\n\n        # ['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', ... ]\n\n        # So, for each test case, output the numbers in order, each on a separate line.\n\n        # So, for the first test case, the output is \"0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\"\n\n        # So, for each test case, print the sorted list as space-separated values? Or as each number on a separate line?\n\n        # Looking at the sample output, each line is a string containing the numbers separated by newlines.\n\n        # So, for the first test case, the output is:\n\n        # 0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\n\n        # So, for each test case, we need to print the sorted list as a single line, with each element on a new line.\n\n        # So, in code:\n\n        output = '\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_results))\n        print(output)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the output is four lines, each representing a test case.\n\nYes, the code needs to process each line as a test case and output the corresponding line.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, testing.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a = [1, 1, 1].\n\nTotal sum is 3.\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst file:\n\nx=1: p1=100, p2=33.333 →33. So, no.\n\nSecond file:\n\nx=1: p1=0 (since 1/1=100 →100?), wait no.\n\nWait, for the second file, when x=1:\n\ncurrent_bytes_in_file =1.\n\np1 = (1 *100)/1 →100.\n\ntotal_processed = 1 (sum of first file) +1=2 →p2= (2/3)*100 →66.666→66.\n\nSo, 100 !=66.\n\nThird file:\n\nx=1: p1=0 (since 1/1=100 →100?), no.\n\nWait, no, for third file, x=1.\n\ncurrent_bytes_in_file =1.\n\np1=100 *1 /1 →100.\n\ntotal_processed = 1+1+1=3 →p2=100.\n\nSo, p1=100, p2=100 → added.\n\nSo, the output includes 0, 100.\n\nAre there any other points where p1=p2?\n\nLet me see:\n\nWhen processing the first file, x=1: p1=100, p2=33. No.\n\nWhen processing the second file, x=1: p1=100, p2=66. No.\n\nWhen processing the third file, x=1: p1=100, p2=100 → yes.\n\nSo, the output is 0,100.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, a = [1,2].\n\nTotal sum is 3.\n\nProcessing first file, x=1:\n\np1=100, p2=33.333 →33. Not equal.\n\nProcessing second file:\n\nx=1:\n\np1=0, p2= (1+1)/3 *100 = 66.666 →66.\n\nNo.\n\nx=2:\n\np1= (2/2)*100=100.\n\np2= (1+2)/3 *100= 100 →100.\n\nSo, p1=100, p2=100 → added.\n\nSo, output includes 0,100.\n\nAlso, during processing second file, any other x where p1=p2?\n\nx=2: yes.\n\nx=3: no, because a[1]=2, so x runs from 1 to 2.\n\nSo, only 0 and 100 are in the output.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Correctly handling the sum of a[:i]. Because for i-th file, the sum of a[0..i-1] is needed.\n\nIn Python, a[:i] gives the first i elements.\n\nYes.\n\n- For each x in 1..ai, adding to the current_processed.\n\nYes.\n\n- The initial 0 is added correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about performance?\n\nConstraints:\n\nn ≤ 100, a_i ≤ 1e3 → total steps: 1e5.\n\nWhich is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nThus, the Python code should look like this.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the moments during which both progress bars (one showing the percentage of the current file copied and the other showing the overall percentage of all files copied) show the same value. These values should be output in ascending order from 0 to 100.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves two progress bars that update after each byte is copied. The first bar shows the percentage of the current file processed, while the second bar shows the percentage of all files processed. We need to find all values from 0 to 100 where these two progress bars match at the same moment.\n\n2. **Simulation Approach**: We simulate the process of copying each file byte by byte. For each byte, we calculate the current progress of both bars and check if they are equal.\n\n3. **Initial State Handling**: Both progress bars start at 0, so we include this value in our results.\n\n4. **Iterate Through Each File**: For each file, iterate through each byte, updating the progress bars after each byte. Check if the current values of both progress bars match and record this value.\n\n5. **Collect Results**: Use a set to collect all matching values to avoid duplicates and then sort these values for the final output.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    for line in lines:\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        parts = line.split()\n        n = int(parts[0])\n        a = list(map(int, parts[1:]))\n        total_sum = sum(a)\n        results = {0}\n        for i in range(n):\n            ai = a[i]\n            for x in range(1, ai + 1):\n                current_bytes_in_file = x\n                total_processed = sum(a[:i]) + x\n                p1 = (current_bytes_in_file * 100) // ai\n                p2 = (total_processed * 100) // total_sum\n                if p1 == p2:\n                    results.add(p1)\n        sorted_results = sorted(results)\n        output = '\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_results))\n        print(output)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of multiple lines, each starting with an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the sizes of the files.\n- **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize the total sum of file sizes and a set to store the results.\n- **Processing Each File**: For each file, iterate through each byte, updating the current progress of both bars. Check if they match and add the value to the results set.\n- **Output**: Convert the set of results to a sorted list and print each value on a new line.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently track and record all moments where the progress bars match, providing the correct output in the required format.",
