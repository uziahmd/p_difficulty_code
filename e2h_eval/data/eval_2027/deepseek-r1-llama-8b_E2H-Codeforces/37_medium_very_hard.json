    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding a permutation of an array such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the empty set and the full set), the sum of elements in the original array a and the sum in the permuted array b are different. Hmm, that sounds tricky.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that for every non-empty subset S (where 0 < k < n), the sum of the elements in a at those positions should be different from the sum in b. So for any subset size between 1 and n-1, the sum must differ between a and b.\n\nSo how can I approach this? Let me think.\n\nFirst, let's understand what subsets we're considering. For example, if n=4, then subsets of size 1, 2, 3 must have different sums in a and b.\n\nI need to find a permutation b where all these subset sums are unique across a and b. If such a permutation exists, output it; else, output -1.\n\nHmm, but with n up to 22, trying all possible permutations is impossible because 22! is way too big. So brute-force is out of the question.\n\nWait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the properties that b must satisfy.\n\nOne idea: Perhaps arrange the elements such that each element in b is as different as possible from a, especially in a way that any subset sum can't collide. Maybe by placing larger elements in certain positions that affect multiple subset sums.\n\nAlternatively, maybe construct b such that the difference between a and b is unique for each subset. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: The condition implies that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of a_S != sum of b_S. So, for each subset, the sum in a and the sum in b must differ.\n\nWait, but the subsets vary in size. How can I ensure that for all subset sizes, their sums don't collide?\n\nMaybe think about the problem in terms of linear algebra. Each subset corresponds to a vector in a vector space over GF(2). But I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find a permutation where each element is placed in a position that changes the subset sums uniquely. Like, place the largest element in a position that affects many subsets, ensuring that its presence in b breaks any possible sum equality.\n\nWait, another angle: The sum of the entire array is fixed, right? Because both a and b are permutations of the same array, so the total sum is the same. So for the full set, the sum is the same in a and b, but since we're excluding it, that's okay.\n\nBut for all other subsets, the sums must differ. So how can we arrange the elements so that no subset's sum in a equals the same subset's sum in b?\n\nLet me think about small examples.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nn=4\na = [1000, 100, 10, 1]\n\nThe output is b = [100, 1, 1000, 10].\n\nWait, how does this work?\n\nCheck for all subsets:\n\nFor subsets of size 1:\nIn a, the elements are 1000, 100, 10, 1.\nIn b, they are 100, 1, 1000, 10.\n\nSo each single element's value is swapped in some way. For example, 1000 is in position 3 in b, which was position 1 in a. Similarly for others.\n\nNow, for subsets of size 2:\n\nTake any two elements in a. Their sum in a vs in b must be different.\n\nSimilarly for subsets of size 3.\n\nSo in the sample, swapping some elements seems to work.\n\nBut how do I generalize this?\n\nPerhaps the key is to make sure that for each element in a, its placement in b doesn't allow any subset sum to be equal in both arrays.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by ensuring that for each element in a, when moved to b, it doesn't create any situation where a subset sum equals the same subset sum in b.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: Think of the difference between a and b. For each element, we can compute the delta (difference) between a and b. Then, for each subset S, the sum of deltas in S must not be zero. Because if the sum is zero, then the subset sums in a and b are equal.\n\nWait, yes! Because sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) = 0 implies sum_{i in S} b_i = sum_{i in S} a_i.\n\nSo the condition is equivalent to: for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of deltas for S is not zero.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding a permutation b such that the multiset of delta values (differences between b and a) has the property that no non-empty proper subset sums to zero.\n\nSo now the problem becomes: find a permutation of a into b, such that for all S (non-empty, proper), sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) != 0.\n\nHmm, but how can I model this?\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of a \"zero-sum\" free set. Wait, but the opposite: we need that no subset of the deltas sums to zero except for the empty set and the full set.\n\nWait, but the full set's delta sum would be sum(b) - sum(a) = 0, since both are permutations. So for the full set, it's allowed.\n\nSo our deltas must form a set where the only subsets that sum to zero are the empty set and the full set.\n\nSo how can I arrange the deltas to satisfy this?\n\nWell, one way is to ensure that all the deltas are distinct and form a system where no subset (except empty and full) sums to zero.\n\nBut this is getting abstract. Maybe think about the differences between elements.\n\nWait, suppose I assign each element in b to a position such that the delta is unique and arranged in a way that no subset can sum to zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assign the deltas in such a way that for any non-empty proper subset, the sum is non-zero.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the minimal case is that all deltas are non-zero, but that might not be sufficient because some subsets could still sum to zero.\n\nWait, but the deltas can be negative or positive. For example, if I swap two elements, their deltas would be +x and -x, where x is the difference between them.\n\nBut then, any subset containing just one of them would have a non-zero sum, but any subset containing both would have a sum of zero. Which violates our condition because S could be a subset of size 2, whose sum is zero.\n\nSo swapping two elements may not be acceptable if their difference is non-zero.\n\nWait, that's a problem. For example, if I swap two elements, say a[i] and a[j], then for the subset {i, j}, the sum of deltas is (b[i] - a[i]) + (b[j] - a[j}) = (a[j] - a[i}) + (a[i] - a[j}) ) = 0. So this subset's sum is zero, which is invalid.\n\nAh, so swapping any two elements would cause their pair subset to have a zero sum. Hence, such a permutation is invalid.\n\nSo that suggests that for any two elements i and j, we cannot have b[i] and b[j] being a[j] and a[i]. Because that would create a subset {i,j} with sum zero.\n\nSo, how can we arrange the permutation without having any two elements swapped? Or is that possible?\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, in the sample input, the permutation swaps 1000 with 10, and 100 with 1. So let's see: Are there any two elements that are swapped, causing their pair to have a zero sum?\n\nWait, the delta for each position:\n\nIn the sample, a is [1000, 100, 10, 1]\nb is [100, 1, 1000, 10]\n\nSo deltas are:\n100 - 1000 = -900\n1 - 100 = -99\n1000 - 10 = 990\n10 - 1 = 9\n\nSo the delta array is [-900, -99, 990, 9].\n\nNow, any pair of these deltas: let's see if any two sum to zero.\n\n-900 + 990 = 90 ≠ 0\n-900 + (-99) = -999 ≠ 0\n-900 + 9 = -891 ≠ 0\n-99 + 990 = 891 ≠ 0\n-99 +9 = -90 ≠ 0\n990 +9 = 999 ≠ 0\n\nSo no pair sums to zero. Also, any triplet?\n\nTake three deltas:\n\n-900 + (-99) + 990 = (-999) + 990 = -9 ≠ 0\n-900 + (-99) +9 = -990 ≠ 0\n-900 +990 +9 = 99 ≠ 0\n-99 +990 +9 = 900 ≠ 0\n\nAnd all four deltas sum to zero.\n\nSo in this case, no subset of size 1, 2, or 3 has a sum of zero. Thus, the permutation is valid.\n\nSo the key is to arrange the deltas such that no non-empty proper subset of them sums to zero.\n\nHmm. So how to construct such a permutation.\n\nOne approach is to find a permutation where all deltas are non-zero, and no subset of them (except the full set) sums to zero.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to have all deltas be unique and form a set with the property that no subset (size < n) sums to zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a greedy approach: Place elements in such a way that the deltas are all distinct and increasing, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the problem as a graph problem. Each element is a node, and edges represent whether swapping two elements would create a forbidden subset. But again, with n=22, this seems computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assign each element to a position such that the delta is unique and arranged in a way that no subset sums to zero.\n\nWait, another idea: Assign each element to a position such that all deltas are powers of two. Then, since each delta is unique and large, any subset sum would be unique, and thus no two subsets (other than the full set) would sum to the same value.\n\nWait, but that might not necessarily prevent zero sums, but perhaps it's a direction.\n\nWait, suppose each delta is a power of two, like 1, 2, 4, 8, etc. Then, any subset sum is unique. However, the sum of all deltas is zero because the total of the permutation is the same as a.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of the deltas is sum(b) - sum(a) = 0. So the sum of all deltas is zero.\n\nSo if I have the deltas as 1, -2, 4, -8, then the sum is 1-2+4-8 = -5, which is not zero. Hmm, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but if the sum of all deltas is zero, then the full set is allowed.\n\nBut for other subsets, since all deltas are powers of two, any subset sum is unique. So no two different subsets will have the same sum. But wait, is that enough? Because even if a subset sum is zero, that would violate the condition.\n\nWait, for example, suppose I have deltas 1 and -1. The sum of these two is zero, which is bad. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo the deltas must be chosen such that no subset (other than the full set) sums to zero.\n\nHmm. So maybe using a system where the deltas are linearly independent over the binary field. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the deltas such that each is larger than the sum of all previous ones. That way, any subset can't sum to a value that could cancel out another.\n\nWait, like the binary representation idea. If each delta is larger than the sum of all previous deltas, then each delta is unique and any subset sum is unique.\n\nSo for example:\n\ndelta_1 = d1\n\ndelta_2 = d2 > |d1|\n\ndelta_3 = d3 > d1 + d2\n\nand so on.\n\nIn this case, any subset sum is unique, so no two subsets (including empty) would have the same sum. Thus, no subset (except the full set) would sum to zero.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all deltas is zero, so the full set sum is zero, which is allowed.\n\nSo how can I assign deltas in such a way?\n\nEach delta can be either positive or negative, but arranged in a way that no subset (other than the full set) sums to zero.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the permutation to get such deltas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assign each delta as a unique power of two, but with alternating signs.\n\nWait, for example, for n=4:\n\ndeltas = 1, -2, 4, -8.\n\nThen, any subset sum can't reach zero because each delta is larger than the sum of the previous ones.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\nSubsets of size 1: 1, -2, 4, -8 → none are zero.\n\nSize 2: 1-2=-1, 1+4=5, 1-8=-7, -2+4=2, -2-8=-10, 4-8=-4. None are zero.\n\nSize 3: 1-2+4=3, 1-2-8=-9, 1+4-8=-3, -2+4-8=-6. No zeros.\n\nOnly the full set sum is 1-2+4-8 = -5? Wait, no, the sum is 1-2+4-8 = -5, which isn't zero. Oh, wait, that's a problem. Because the sum of all deltas must be zero. So perhaps the selection of deltas is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe the deltas should add up to zero, but individually be large enough that no subset sums to zero.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assign the deltas as 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{n-1}, but then adjust the signs such that their total sum is zero.\n\nWait, but that's a bit tricky.\n\nWait, for example, for n=4, the deltas could be 8, 4, -12, -4. Sum is 8+4-12-4= -4, which isn't zero. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for even n, have half positive and half negative, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arrange the deltas in a way that any non-empty proper subset cannot sum to zero. How?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is similar to finding a \"Sidon sequence\" but in two's complement or something. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to model this as a graph problem where each node represents a state of the permutation, and edges represent adding a new element, ensuring that no subset sum is zero.\n\nBut with n=22, that's impractical.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think recursively. For each position, choose an element from a that hasn't been used yet, and check whether adding it to the current permutation would cause any subset sum to become zero.\n\nBut even that seems computationally expensive because for each step, you have to check all possible subsets.\n\nWait, but perhaps the number of subsets to check is manageable for small n. But for n=22, it's impossible.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires a mathematical approach rather than a brute-force one.\n\nLet me think about the necessary conditions for the deltas.\n\nWe need that for any non-empty subset S, sum_{i in S} delta_i ≠ 0.\n\nSo the deltas must form a set where no non-empty proper subset has a zero sum.\n\nWhat is such a set called? It's a set with the property that the only subset with zero sum is the empty set and the full set.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a \"zero-sum-free set,\" but in reverse.\n\nWait, I recall that in additive combinatorics, a zero-sum-free set is a set of numbers where no non-empty subset sums to zero. So this is exactly what we need.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation of a into b such that the deltas form a zero-sum-free set.\n\nSo, the task is to find a permutation b such that the deltas form a zero-sum-free set.\n\nNow, the question is: How can I construct such a set?\n\nWait, in additive combinatorics, it's known that for integers, a zero-sum-free set can be constructed by choosing elements such that each element is larger than the sum of all smaller elements. For example, 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., which are powers of two.\n\nBecause any subset sum would be unique and the sum of any proper subset would be less than the next element, so no subset can sum to zero.\n\nWait, but in that case, the sum of all elements would be 15 for n=4, which is not zero. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, but in our case, the sum of all deltas must be zero because sum(b) = sum(a). So that complicates things.\n\nHmm, perhaps the deltas can be arranged in a way that each delta is a power of two, but with some negatives, so that the total sum is zero.\n\nWait, for example, for n=4, deltas could be 8, -4, 4, -8. Sum is zero.\n\nBut then, checking for subsets:\n\nSingle elements: 8, -4,4,-8. No zeros.\n\nPairs: 8-4=4≠0, 8+4=12≠0, 8-8=0→ Oh, wait, that's bad. Subset {8, -8} sums to zero. So that's invalid.\n\nSo that approach fails.\n\nAlternative idea: Use elements that are all positive, but that's impossible because sum(b) - sum(a) is zero, meaning that the sum of deltas is zero. So positive and negative deltas are needed.\n\nWait, perhaps arrange the deltas as a prefix where each delta is larger than the sum of all previous deltas, but that's difficult because the sum needs to be zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a system where each delta is greater than the sum of all the absolute values of the previous deltas. That way, any subset can't sum to zero unless it's the full set.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Since the sum of all deltas is zero, any subset S must have sum delta_S ≠ 0.\n\nSuppose I arrange the deltas such that for any proper subset S, delta_S is not equal to -delta_T, where T is the complement of S.\n\nWait, but that's always true because the sum of all deltas is zero. So delta_S = -delta_{not S}.\n\nSo any proper subset S will have delta_S = -delta_{not S}, which means that for S and its complement, their subset sums are negatives of each other. So neither can be zero unless delta_S is zero, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, but that's already implied by the sum of all deltas being zero. So perhaps the key is to arrange the deltas such that no proper subset S has delta_S = 0, and for any S, the sum delta_S is not zero.\n\nWait, but delta_S is the sum of the deltas in S. Since all deltas are non-zero (as each element is moved), then delta_S can't be zero for S being a singleton.\n\nBut for larger subsets, it's possible.\n\nSo the problem is to arrange the deltas such that for any non-empty proper subset S, sum_{i in S} delta_i ≠ 0.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother thought: The problem is similar to constructing a system where the deltas form a basis for the vector space, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the problem as a graph problem. Each element is connected to positions, and we need to assign each element to a position such that the resulting delta set satisfies the condition.\n\nBut again, with n=22, this is challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the problem as a bipartite graph where one side is the elements of a, and the other side is the positions, and edges represent whether assigning a particular element to a position would not create a forbidden subset.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model the forbidden subsets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to find a derangement of the elements, but that's probably not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to arrange the elements in such a way that each element is placed in a position that makes the delta as unique as possible, and no subset of deltas can sum to zero.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: Since the sum of all deltas is zero, any subset S and its complement T must have sum_S + sum_T = 0 → sum_S = -sum_T. So for any S, if sum_S = 0, then sum_T is also zero, but S and T are complements. So if sum_S = 0, then sum_T is zero as well. But in our condition, only the full set is allowed to have sum zero. So we need to ensure that no proper subset S has sum_S = 0.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a permutation where the delta set is zero-sum-free, i.e., no proper subset of the deltas sums to zero.\n\nSo the problem is now to arrange the permutation such that the delta set is zero-sum-free.\n\nNow, how to construct such a delta set.\n\nFrom some research, I recall that for a set of numbers to be zero-sum-free, it's sufficient that each element is greater than the sum of all previous elements. This ensures that any subset sum is unique and can't be zero.\n\nWait, but in our case, the sum of all deltas must be zero. So perhaps for the first m elements, each is greater than the sum of the previous ones, and the remaining are arranged to balance the sum to zero.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by greedily assigning the largest possible delta first.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress here.\n\nLet me think differently. Since the problem requires that all subset sums (except the full set) are non-zero, perhaps the simplest way is to have all the deltas be unique and arranged in such a way that no subset can sum to zero.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assign the elements in such a way that the delta for each position is a unique power of two, but this may not sum to zero.\n\nWait, but in that case, the sum of all deltas is not zero. So that's not acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the deltas in a way that each delta is a unique power of two, and the sum of all deltas is zero. But that's tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps for even n, split the deltas into positive and negative parts, each forming a zero-sum-free set.\n\nFor example, for n=4, have two positive deltas and two negative deltas, each of which forms a zero-sum-free set.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each element, assign a unique prime number as a delta, and arrange the permutation such that the sum of any subset of these primes is not zero modulo something. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the problem can be transformed into finding a permutation where the delta set is zero-sum-free, and then for each such permutation, the problem is solvable.\n\nBut how to find such a permutation.\n\nGiven that n is up to 22, perhaps a backtracking approach is feasible if the pruning is efficient.\n\nBut for n=22, even with pruning, it's challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node represents the current state of the permutation, and edges represent adding a new element. We can try to build the permutation step by step, checking at each step whether adding the new element would create any subset sum that is zero.\n\nBut with n=22, even this approach would be too slow.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by recognizing that the solution is to place the elements in a specific order, such as sorted order or reverse sorted order, but adjusted to avoid creating any forbidden subsets.\n\nWait, let's consider the sample input again.\n\na = [1000, 100, 10, 1]\n\nb = [100, 1, 1000, 10]\n\nWhich is a rearrangement where the middle elements are swapped.\n\nThe deltas are 100-1000 = -900, 1-100 = -99, 1000-10=990, 10-1=9.\n\nThese deltas are chosen such that no subset sums to zero.\n\nHmm, perhaps the deltas are designed to have certain properties. For instance, the large deltas are placed in a way that their combination can't cancel out.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the largest delta is 990, which is bigger than the sum of all other deltas except for the largest negative.\n\nWait, 990 - 900 = 90, which is less than 990. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deltas are arranged so that any two of them can't add up to another delta's negative.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the problem differently. Instead of permuting the elements, perhaps the required condition can be met by ensuring that the multiset of elements is such that no subset has the same sum as another subset.\n\nBut that's not directly applicable here.\n\nWait, the problem requires that for every non-empty proper subset S, the sum of the elements in S in a is different from the sum in b.\n\nSo for a given permutation b, the function f(S) = sum_{S} a_i - sum_{S} b_i must be non-zero for all non-empty proper S.\n\nWhich is equivalent to the condition that the multiset of deltas D must be zero-sum-free.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a permutation where the delta set is zero-sum-free.\n\nNow, the problem is to find a zero-sum-free set D, which is the difference between the permutation b and a.\n\nHow can I construct such a set D?\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate all possible permutations, compute the delta set for each, and check if it's zero-sum-free. But for n=22, this is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps a necessary condition is that all elements in the delta set are pairwise distinct and that the absolute values are sufficiently large to prevent any subset sum from being zero.\n\nBut how to arrange that.\n\nWait, perhaps the following strategy can work:\n\nArrange the elements in b such that the delta set consists of elements where each element is larger in absolute value than the sum of all the other elements. This way, any subset sum cannot reach the value of any other element, preventing cancellation.\n\nWait, for example, for n=4, the deltas could be 8, -4, 4, -8. But as before, that causes some subsets to sum to zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the deltas such that each delta is larger than the sum of all other deltas in absolute value.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because the sum of all deltas is zero.\n\nHmm, perhaps the first delta is 1, the second is 2, the third is 4, and so on, but then the sum isn't zero. So perhaps not.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's sort the elements in a in increasing order and then place them in b in a way that alternately places high and low elements, which might create large deltas that can't be canceled out by smaller ones.\n\nFor example, in the sample, the elements are [1, 10, 100, 1000], and the permutation is [100, 1, 1000, 10]. The deltas are -900, -99, 990, 9.\n\nWait, perhaps the largest delta is placed first, followed by the next largest, but in a way that prevents any subset sum from being zero.\n\nBut how to formalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by greedily choosing the permutation that maximizes the absolute values of the deltas early on, thus making it harder for any subset sum to reach zero.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum of all deltas is zero, perhaps the deltas can be arranged in such a way that they form a \"prefix code\", where each delta is larger than the sum of all previous deltas. This would prevent any subset from summing to zero, except the full set.\n\nFor example, for n=4:\n\ndelta_1 = 1\n\ndelta_2 = 2 (>1)\n\ndelta_3 = 4 (>1+2=3)\n\ndelta_4 = - (1+2+4) = -7.\n\nSum is 1+2+4-7=0.\n\nNow, check subsets:\n\nAny single delta: 1, 2,4,-7 → no zero.\n\nAny two deltas:\n\n1+2=3≠0\n\n1+4=5≠0\n\n1-7=-6≠0\n\n2+4=6≠0\n\n2-7=-5≠0\n\n4-7=-3≠0.\n\nAny three deltas:\n\n1+2+4=7≠0\n\n1+2-7=-4≠0\n\n1+4-7=-2≠0\n\n2+4-7=-1≠0.\n\nFull set: sum is zero.\n\nSo this works.\n\nSo the deltas are 1,2,4,-7.\n\nSo, in this case, the permutation would be:\n\na[0] = 1 → b[0] = a[0] + 1 = 2.\n\na[1]=2 → b[1] =2 +2=4.\n\na[2]=4 → b[2]=4+4=8.\n\na[3]=7 → b[3]=7-7=0. Wait, but the original array a must have 7 as one of its elements. Wait, but in my example, a is [1,2,4,7], but in the actual problem, a has distinct elements, so perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the elements are 1000,100,10,1. So in the sample, the deltas are -900, -99, 990, 9.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to assign the deltas in a way that each delta is as large as possible, and the last delta is the negative sum of all previous deltas.\n\nThis would ensure that no subset sum can reach zero, except the full set.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the elements in a in increasing order.\n\n2. Assign the first n-1 elements to have deltas that form a prefix sum, each larger than the sum of all previous deltas.\n\n3. Assign the nth element to have a delta that is the negative of the sum of the first n-1 deltas.\n\nThis would ensure that the sum of all deltas is zero.\n\nNow, the question is: Does this arrangement satisfy that no subset sum (other than the full set) is zero?\n\nIn the example above, yes.\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\nElements sorted: a = [a1, a2, a3].\n\nDeltas:\n\nd1 = 1\n\nd2 = 2 (>1)\n\nd3 = -(1+2) =-3.\n\nSum: 1+2-3=0.\n\nCheck subsets:\n\nSingles: 1,2,-3 → no zeros.\n\nPairs:\n\n1+2=3≠0\n\n1-3=-2≠0\n\n2-3=-1≠0.\n\nTriplet: sum is zero, allowed.\n\nSo this works.\n\nAnother example: n=2.\n\nSorted a: [a1, a2]\n\nd1=1\n\nd2=-1.\n\nSum: 0.\n\nCheck subsets: any single element's delta is 1 or -1, which are non-zero. Pairs: the only subset is size 2, which is allowed.\n\nSo this works.\n\nThus, this approach seems promising.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nSort the array a in increasing order.\n\nCompute the deltas for the first n-1 elements as 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^{n-2}.\n\nWait, no, in the earlier example, for n=4, the deltas were 1,2,4,-7.\n\nWait, the sum of 1+2+4=7, so the last delta is -7.\n\nSo the first n-1 deltas are 1,2,4,...,2^{k}, where k is n-2.\n\nThe last delta is -(sum of first n-1 deltas).\n\nYes.\n\nSo for general n, the first n-1 deltas are 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^{n-2}.\n\nThe last delta is -(1+2+4+...+2^{n-2}) = - (2^{n-1} -1).\n\nWait, because 1+2+4+...+2^{k} = 2^{k+1} -1.\n\nSo for n=4, 1+2+4=7=2^3 -1. So the last delta is -7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for the permutation, the first n-1 elements are assigned to the smallest elements in a, and the last element is assigned to the largest.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the largest element is 1000, which is assigned a delta of 990, which is not 2^{n-1} -1.\n\nHmm, that suggests that this approach may not work for all cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to assign the deltas as per the binary method, regardless of the elements' values.\n\nBut then, the permutation would have to arrange the elements accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the elements are sorted, and then the first n-1 elements are assigned deltas 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{n-2}, and the last element is assigned a delta of -(sum of first n-1 deltas).\n\nThen, the permutation is constructed by placing the elements in b such that the first n-1 elements correspond to the sorted a elements plus their deltas, and the last element is a's last element minus the sum.\n\nBut wait, no, because the deltas are the differences between b and a.\n\nSo, in the sorted a, the first element is a1, and in b, it's a1 + d1.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nThe last element in b is a_last + d_last, where d_last = -(d1 + d2 + ... + d_{n-1}).\n\nSo the permutation is built by taking the sorted a and adding the deltas to each, except the last which is adjusted.\n\nBut wait, the permutation must be a permutation of the original array. So the elements in b must be the same as a, just reordered.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Sort a in increasing order.\n\n2. Assign the first n-1 elements to have deltas 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{n-2}.\n\n3. Assign the last element a delta of -(1+2+4+...+2^{n-2}) = - (2^{n-1} -1).\n\n4. Now, construct the permutation b by placing the sorted a elements with their deltas applied, except for the last element which is adjusted.\n\nBut wait, the last element in b is a[-1] + d_last.\n\nBut since d_last is the negative of the sum of the first n-1 deltas, which is -(2^{n-1} -1), then the last element in b is a[-1] - (2^{n-1} -1).\n\nBut the permutation must consist of the same elements as a, so this approach may not work for all cases.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the sorted a is [1,10,100,1000].\n\nIf we apply the deltas as per the approach:\n\nd1=1, d2=2, d3=4, d4=-7.\n\nWait, wait, for n=4, the first 3 deltas are 1,2,4. The last delta is -(1+2+4)= -7.\n\nSo the permutation would be:\n\nb[0] = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nb[1] =10 + 2 =12\n\nb[2] =100 +4=104\n\nb[3] =1000 -7=993.\n\nBut 993 is not present in the original array. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because the permutation must consist of the same elements as a, but in this case, 993 is not in a.\n\nSo this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that the approach is flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the deltas are computed based on the sorted a, but the permutation must arrange the elements in a way that their deltas are as per the binary approach, but this may not be possible if the elements don't fit.\n\nThus, perhaps this approach is only applicable when the elements can be arranged to match the required deltas.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by checking if the array can be arranged in a way that the delta set is zero-sum-free.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nWait, perhaps the only way this is possible is when the array can be partitioned into two sets, such that one set has elements whose sum is equal to the sum of the other set. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the sum of all elements is fixed, so that's not helpful.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the problem as a linear algebra problem. We need to find a permutation matrix P such that the difference matrix (P - I) has the property that no non-empty proper subset of the rows sums to zero.\n\nBut again, not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be reduced to checking if the array has a subset whose sum is equal to another subset's sum, which would imply that a certain permutation is invalid.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be considered as requiring that the array is \"subset-sum-distinct\" when considering all possible subset sums. But that's a different problem.\n\nWait, but the problem here is about the difference between two permutations, not about the subset sums of the same array.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be rephrased as follows: Is",
