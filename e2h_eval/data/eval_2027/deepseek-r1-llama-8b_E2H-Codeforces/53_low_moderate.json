Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.

It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. The task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. So, given a string like 'ababa', the output is 3 because the substring 'aba' appears twice. Oh right, and these occurrences can overlap. So for the third example, 'zzz', the output is 2 because 'zz' appears twice as substrings (positions 0-1 and 1-2).\n\nSo the goal is to find the maximum possible length L such that there exists a substring of length L that occurs more than once in the string.\n\nHow do I approach this? Well, the brute-force way would be to check all possible substrings of decreasing length and see if any appear more than once.\n\nWait, but what's the efficient way to do this? Because the string can be up to 100 characters, which isn't too bad, but I should aim for an optimal solution.\n\nLet me think about possible steps:\n\n1. For each possible substring length L, starting from the maximum possible down to 1.\n   - For each possible starting index i, extract the substring s[i:i+L].\n   - Check if this substring appears again in the string, possibly overlapping.\n   - If we find any such substring, then return L as the answer.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the plan is:\n\nLoop L from the length of the string down to 1:\n   For each i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n      substring = s[i:i+L]\n      check if this substring appears again somewhere else in the string.\n      if yes, return L.\n\nIf no such L is found (which shouldn't happen because even single characters repeat), then return 0 or 1, but since the string is non-empty, the minimum is 1.\n\nWait, but the sample input includes 'abcd', where the output is 0. Wait, no, looking back, the sample input shows outputs as 0, 3, 2. Wait, no, the sample input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and the outputs are 0, 3, 2. Wait, but 'abcd' has all unique characters, so the longest substring appearing at least twice is of length 0? Or perhaps the problem expects 0 when there are no such substrings, but wait, in the sample input, the outputs are 0, 3, 2. So for 'abcd', the output is 0. But that can't be right because 0 would imply that no substring exists, but that's not true because every single character is a substring of length 1. Wait, maybe the problem counts the substring as appearing at least twice. So for 'abcd', each single character occurs only once, so the maximum length is 0.\n\nWait, no. Let's look at the sample input again.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd'\nSample Output: 0\nExplanation: All substrings of length 1 occur only once, so the maximum is 0.\n\nSo in the problem statement, it's possible that the output is 0 if no substring occurs at least twice.\n\nSo the algorithm needs to find the maximum L >=0 such that there exists a substring of length L occurring at least twice.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor L in range (current_max_length down to 0):\n   Check for all substrings of length L whether they appear at least twice.\n   If any such substring exists, return L.\n\nOnce such an L is found, return it immediately as the maximum possible.\n\nSo now, how to implement this.\n\nThe key part is checking for each substring of length L whether it appears more than once.\n\nHow to do that efficiently?\n\nOne approach is to collect all substrings of length L, store them in a set, and see if adding a new substring causes a duplicate. But wait, that's O(n^2) time, which for n=100 is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each substring of length L, check if it appears again in the string beyond its initial position.\n\nBut perhaps using a sliding window approach with a hash set can help.\n\nWait, here's the plan:\n\nFor each possible L from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   Create a set to keep track of substrings we've seen.\n\n   For each i in 0 to len(s)-L:\n\n      current_substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n      if current_substring is already in the set, then return L as the answer.\n\n      else, add it to the set.\n\n   After checking all i for this L, if no duplicates were found, continue to the next smaller L.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, no duplicates are found, return 0.\n\nWait, but this approach might not work because for some L, two",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking each possible substring length starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we check if any substring of that length appears more than once in the string. If we find such a substring, we return the length immediately as it will be the longest possible. If no such substring is found for any length, we return 0.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n1. Iterate over possible substring lengths from the length of the string down to 1.\n2. For each length, extract all possible substrings of that length and check if any of them appear more than once.\n3. Use a set to keep track of seen substrings for the current length. If a duplicate is found, return the current length.\n4. If no duplicates are found for any length, return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging a set for quick lookups and avoiding unnecessary computations once the longest valid substring is found.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: Read the input string and determine its length.\n- **Loop Over Lengths**: Start from the longest possible substring length and decrement down to 1.\n- **Substring Extraction and Checking**: For each length, extract substrings and use a set to track seen substrings. If a duplicate is found, print the current length and exit.\n- **Result**: If no duplicates are found for any length, print 0.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging a set for quick lookups, making the solution both effective and efficient for the given problem constraints.",
