On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers, each being 1 or 2. Tommy wants to reverse a subarray (a continuous segment) in the original sequence such that after reversing, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the new array is as long as possible. My task is to find the maximum possible length of this LNDS after choosing the best possible subarray to reverse.\n\nHmm, right. So the input is a sequence of n elements, each either 1 or 2. We can choose any interval [l, r], reverse the elements from l to r, and then compute the LNDS of the modified array. The goal is to find the maximum possible LNDS over all possible choices of [l, r].\n\nWait, but what exactly is the LNDS? It's the length of the longest subsequence where each element is >= the previous one. So for example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4 because we can take all elements in order, which after reversing becomes [1,1,2,2]. Or wait, no, actually, the example given says that after reversing [2,3], which are the elements at positions 2 and 3 (so the subarray is [2,1] which when reversed becomes [1,2], making the entire array [1,1,2,2], whose LNDS is 4.\n\nSo the first step is to consider all possible subarrays to reverse and find the one that maximizes the LNDS.\n\nBut trying all possible subarrays would be O(n^2), since for each possible l and r (with l <= r), we reverse the subarray and compute the LNDS. Then, among all these possibilities, select the maximum.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2000. Reversing each possible subarray would result in 2000*2000 = 4 million operations. For each of those, computing the LNDS could take O(n) time using a standard dynamic programming approach. That would give 4e6 * 2e3 = 8e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThat won't work. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the array. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, maybe there's a pattern or a way to model this without having to check every possible reversal.\n\nWait, the LNDS in the original array can be computed quickly. But when you reverse a subarray, how does that affect the LNDS? It might connect some 1s and 2s that were previously separated by a longer stretch of 2s, but perhaps not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal is to make the array consist of as many 1s followed by as many 2s as possible. Because the LNDS in that case would be the sum of the counts of 1s and 2s, which is n.\n\nWait, but that's only possible if all 1s come before all 2s. But the initial array may not have that structure.\n\nSo maybe the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the current LNDS and the best possible arrangement achievable by reversing a subarray to create a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother angle: the LNDS after reversal depends on the arrangement of 1s and 2s. Reversing a segment can change the order of certain elements, potentially creating a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nFor example, suppose the array has a 1 followed by a 2, then some stuff, then another 1. Reversing the middle part (the 2 and the 1) would turn them into 1 and 2 again, but perhaps in a different context.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the problem statement, the array after reversal becomes [1,1,2,2], which has an LNDS of 4, which is the maximum possible. So perhaps the optimal is to arrange all 1s first, then 2s.\n\nBut how can we achieve that with a single reversal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find a point k, such that all 1s up to k are followed by all 2s beyond k. The reversal can help in connecting the 1s and 2s across the reversed segment.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find for each possible position i, the maximum number of 1s up to i and 2s from i onwards, and then see how reversing a segment can connect them.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's model the problem as follows: for each possible l and r, reverse the subarray a[l..r], and compute the LNDS. We need to find the maximum over all possible l and r.\n\nBut with n=2000, the number of possible l and r pairs is about 2e6. For each pair, computing the LNDS takes O(n) time, leading to 4e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nWait, but the LNDS for a given array can be found in O(n) time using a DP approach. Maybe we can precompute something that allows us to compute the effect of reversing a segment quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS after reversing a certain segment can be determined by looking at the structure of the original array.\n\nLet me think about the DP approach for LNDS. The standard approach uses a patience sorting-like method, maintaining a list where each element represents the smallest possible last element of an increasing subsequence of a certain length. For each element, we find the first element in the list that is larger than the current, replace it with the current, and the length of the list is the LNDS.\n\nBut applying this for each reversed segment would be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the array consists of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be at most the total count of 1s plus the count of 2s minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's see. For example, in the array [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 4 because we can arrange it as 1,1,2,2. Similarly, the array [2,1,2,1] can be rearranged as 1,1,2,2 by reversing certain segments.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is equal to the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s, which would be the sum of all 1s and 2s. But that's only possible if all 1s are before all 2s. Otherwise, the LNDS is limited by the number of transitions.\n\nBut in the problem, we can only reverse a single continuous segment. So perhaps the optimal way is to arrange all the 1s and 2s in such a way that the 1s are as far left as possible and the 2s as far right as possible, within the constraints of a single reversal.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible split point k, the optimal LNDS would be the maximum of (number of 1s in the first part + number of 2s in the second part). So perhaps the best is to find the point where the number of 1s before k plus the number of 2s after k is maximized.\n\nWait, but how does reversing a segment help in achieving this? Because reversing a segment can change the order of some 1s and 2s, possibly allowing more 1s to be on the left and 2s on the right.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum over all possible k of (count_1_before_k + count_2_after_k), and then for each k, see whether it's possible to achieve this by reversing a suitable segment.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS can be found by considering all possible reversal points, and for each possible reversal, the LNDS can be at least the maximum of the current LNDS and the count_1_before_r + count_2_after_l, where the reversed segment starts at l and ends at r.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a direction. Let me think: when we reverse a segment [l, r], the 1s and 2s in that segment are flipped. So the 1s that were after l and before r become before l, and vice versa.\n\nSo, for the segment [l, r], the number of 1s in this segment before reversal is S_ones, and the number of 2s is S_twos. After reversal, the number of 1s becomes S_twos and the 2s become S_ones.\n\nNow, the question is: how does this affect the overall count of 1s in the prefix and 2s in the suffix.\n\nPerhaps for each possible l and r, we can compute how much this reversal contributes to the LNDS.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible l and r, the maximum LNDS after reversal is the maximum between:\n\n- The current LNDS without any reversal.\n\n- The maximum possible LNDS when the reversed segment is considered as a block of 2s and 1s.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the LNDS after reversal can be thought of as the sum of the 1s in the prefix (before l) plus the 1s in the reversed segment (which are now 2s) plus the 2s in the suffix (after r). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS after reversal will be the sum of all 1s in the prefix (before l) and the 1s in the suffix (after r) plus the 2s in the reversed segment. Because the reversed segment's 1s are now 2s, and the 2s are now 1s. So the total 1s in the entire array remain the same, but their positions have changed.\n\nWait, yes! Because reversing a segment [l, r] swaps the positions of 1s and 2s in that segment. So the total number of 1s in the array is fixed. So the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut the way the 1s and 2s are arranged affects this. So perhaps the optimal LNDS is the maximum possible count of 1s plus the maximum possible 2s that come after all the 1s.\n\nBut how does reversing a segment help in achieving this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is simply the minimum between the total number of 1s and 2s, but that's not correct because sometimes you can't arrange them in a way that all 1s are before all 2s.\n\nWait, no. For example, in the first sample, the array is [1, 2, 1, 2]. The total 1s are 2, 2s are 2. So the maximum possible is 4. Which is achieved by reversing [2,3], turning the array into [1,1,2,2].\n\nSo the maximum is indeed the sum of 1s and 2s, which is 4.\n\nIn the second sample, the array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. The total 1s are 5, 2s are 5. So the maximum possible is 10, but the output is 9. Oh, so why is that?\n\nAh, because in that case, even though the total 1s and 2s are 5 each, the way they are arranged makes it impossible to have all 1s before all 2s with a single reversal.\n\nWait, let's see. The array after reversing [3,7], which is the segment from index 3 to 7 (assuming 1-based or 0-based?), turns into [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. So the LNDS is 9: the 1s at positions 1-4, and the 2s at positions 5-9, but the last element is 1, which breaks it. So the LNDS is 9.\n\nWait, but how? Because after the reversal, the array is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. So the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2, but then the last 1 comes, so the maximum is 9.\n\nSo the maximum possible is 9, which is less than the total 10.\n\nSo the sum of 1s and 2s isn't always achievable.\n\nSo the problem is to find, for some reversal, the maximum possible LNDS, which could be up to the sum of 1s and 2s, but sometimes less.\n\nSo perhaps the way to approach this is to find for each possible reversal, the maximum possible contribution to the LNDS.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAnother thought: The LNDS is determined by the arrangement of 1s and 2s. When you reverse a segment, you're effectively swapping 1s and 2s in that segment. So, the number of 1s in the array remains the same, but their positions change.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before a certain point, followed by all 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. But the LNDS can include interleaved 1s and 2s as long as they are non-decreasing.\n\nWait, for example, [1,1,2,2] has LNDS 4, which is the maximum. [1,2,2,1] has LNDS 3, since 1,2,2 is the longest.\n\nSo the key is that the more 1s are to the left and 2s to the right, the better.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy is to find the best possible split point where the number of 1s before the split plus the number of 2s after the split is as large as possible.\n\nThen, the maximum LNDS is the maximum of this value across all possible split points, and also considering the effect of reversing a segment to bridge the split.\n\nHmm, but how can reversing a segment help in bridging the split?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible split point k (i.e., after the k-th element), the maximum number of 1s before k plus the maximum number of 2s after k can be achieved by reversing a segment that connects the 1s in the prefix and 2s in the suffix.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's precompute for each possible l and r, the number of 1s in [l, r] and the number of 2s in [l, r]. Then, when we reverse [l, r], the number of 1s in [l, r] becomes the number of 2s in [l, r], and vice versa.\n\nNow, the total 1s in the array is fixed. So, the total 1s after reversal is the same as before. So the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be followed by 2s.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the reversal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS is min(total_ones, total_twos + ones_in_reversed_segment) ?\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal LNDS is the maximum over all possible k of (the number of 1s in the first k elements plus the number of 2s in the last (n - k) elements). Because after reversing a segment, it's possible that the 1s in the first part and the 2s in the last part are connected via the reversed segment.\n\nBut how to find k and the corresponding reversal.\n\nWait, for each k, the maximum number of 1s in the first k elements is C1[k], and the maximum number of 2s in the last (n - k) elements is C2[k]. Then, the maximum LNDS could be C1[k] + C2[k].\n\nBut how can we find the maximum such sum across all possible k, and see if it's achievable by reversing a segment.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute C1[k] = maximum number of 1s in the first k elements.\n\n2. Precompute C2[k] = maximum number of 2s in the last (n -k) elements.\n\n3. The maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of C1[k] + C2[k] for all k.\n\nBut wait, that might not account for the effect of reversing a segment. How?\n\nBecause when you reverse a segment [l, r], you can bring some 1s from the end of the segment into the prefix, and some 2s from the start of the segment into the suffix. This could allow for a higher C1[k] + C2[k].\n\nSo perhaps for each possible [l, r], the maximum possible C1' + C2' is C1_prefix + C2_suffix + (some delta caused by reversing [l, r]).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as follows:\n\nAfter reversing [l, r], the number of 1s in the prefix (before l) remains the same. In the reversed segment, the 1s become 2s and 2s become 1s. So in the reversed segment, the 1s count becomes the number of 2s in [l, r], and the 2s count becomes the number of 1s in [l, r].\n\nSimilarly, the suffix (after r) remains the same.\n\nSo, for the prefix up to l-1, the number of 1s is C1[l-1]. For the suffix after r, the number of 2s is C2[r+1]. And in the reversed segment, the number of 1s (now 2s) is the number of 2s in [l, r], which is S_twos = (r-l+1) - S_ones, where S_ones is the number of 1s in [l, r].\n\nWait, but in the reversed segment, the 1s and 2s are swapped. So the number of 1s in the entire array is still the same. So the 1s in the prefix (C1[l-1]) plus the 1s in the reversed segment (S_twos) plus the 1s in the suffix (C1_suffix) must equal the total number of 1s.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nWe can model the maximum possible LNDS after reversing a segment [l, r] as follows:\n\nThe LNDS will be the sum of the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to l-1, plus the maximum number of 2s in the suffix starting from r+1, plus the maximum number of 2s in the reversed segment.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it does.\n\nWait, after reversing [l, r], the 1s and 2s in that segment are flipped. So in the reversed segment, the 1s become 2s and vice versa.\n\nSo, the 1s in the prefix (before l) are C1[l-1]. The 1s in the reversed segment are now 2s, so they contribute nothing to the 1s count. The 1s in the suffix (after r) are C1_suffix.\n\nSo the total number of 1s in the array remains the same: C1_total = C1[l-1] + C1_suffix.\n\nWait, but no, because in the reversed segment, the 1s become 2s and the 2s become 1s. So the total 1s is C1[l-1] + (number of 2s in [l, r]) + C1_suffix.\n\nWhich equals C1_total, since the original array had C1_total 1s.\n\nSo, the 1s after reversal in the prefix and suffix plus the 2s in the reversed segment (now 1s) sum up to the original total.\n\nBut how does this affect the LNDS?\n\nThe LNDS is the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s. So, the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of (number of 1s in the prefix up to some point) plus (number of 2s in the suffix after that point).\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to find a point where the 1s in the prefix and 2s in the suffix are as large as possible, and see if reversing a segment can connect them.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the array consists of 1s and 2s, perhaps the LNDS after reversal can be computed based on the counts of 1s and 2s in certain regions.\n\nFor example, the maximum possible LNDS is the minimum of the total 1s and the total 2s. But in the second sample, the total 1s and 2s are both 5, but the output is 9, which is less than 10. So that theory is wrong.\n\nSo, another approach is needed.\n\nMaybe, instead of trying all possible reversals, we can find for each possible split point k, the maximum number of 1s in the first k elements and 2s in the remaining n-k elements, and then determine whether a reversal can bridge the gap to achieve this.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS after any reversal is at least the LNDS of the original array. So perhaps the optimal solution is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum of C1[k] + C2[k] for all possible k.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's think about the original array. The LNDS is the maximum possible without any reversal.\n\nWhen we reverse a segment, we can potentially increase this number.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum possible is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum of (C1[k] + C2[k]) for all k.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps to solve this are:\n\n1. Compute the original LNDS.\n\n2. Precompute for each possible k (from 0 to n), the maximum number of 1s in the first k elements and the maximum number of 2s in the last (n-k) elements.\n\n3. Find the maximum value of (C1[k] + C2[k]) across all k.\n\n4. The answer is the maximum between the original LNDS and this maximum.\n\nWait, but is that correct?\n\nIn the first sample, the original LNDS is 2 (since the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 2, but after reversal, it becomes 4, which is the sum of 1s and 2s.\n\nIn the second sample, the original LNDS is 5 (for example, 1,1,2,2,2,2,2 is not possible because the array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1], so the LNDS is 5 (taking the first two 1s, then four 2s, then the fifth 1 breaks it; perhaps a better way exists). Wait, perhaps the original LNDS is 5, but after reversal, it's 9.\n\nBut according to this approach, the maximum C1[k] + C2[k] across k is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, let's compute for the second sample:\n\nThe array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1].\n\nCompute for each k, C1[k] is the maximum number of 1s in the first k elements, and C2[k] is the maximum number of 2s in the last (n -k) elements.\n\nFor k=0: C1=0, C2=5 (all elements are 2s). Sum is 5.\n\nFor k=1: first 1 element has 1 1s. Last 9 elements: the last 9 elements have 5 2s (since the array ends with 1, but the last 9 elements include the last 1). Wait, no—how to compute C2[k] correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps C2[k] is the maximum number of 2s in the last (n -k) elements.\n\nWait, for k=0, the last 10 elements: the entire array. Number of 2s is 5. So C2[0] =5.\n\nFor k=1: last 9 elements. Let's see: the array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. The last 9 elements are [1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. The number of 2s is 4 (positions 2,3,4,7,8? Wait, wait the 9 elements are from index 1 to 9 (assuming 0-based). Let's count 2s:\n\nElement 1: 1\n\nElement 2: 2\n\nElement 3: 2\n\nElement 4: 2\n\nElement 5:1\n\nElement 6:1\n\nElement 7:2\n\nElement 8:2\n\nElement 9:1.\n\nSo 2s are at indices 2,3,4,7,8: 5 2s. So C2[1]=5.\n\nSum C1[1] + C2[1] = 1 +5=6.\n\nFor k=2: first 2 elements are 1,1. C1=2. Last 8 elements: [2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. Number of 2s: 2 (indices 2,3,4,7,8: wait, that's 5 again. Wait, the last 8 elements are from index 2 to 9. Let's count 2s:\n\nindex 2: 2\n\n3:2\n\n4:2\n\n5:1\n\n6:1\n\n7:2\n\n8:2\n\n9:1.\n\nSo 2s are at 2,3,4,7,8: 5. So C2[2]=5. Sum is 2+5=7.\n\nk=3: first 3 elements: 1,1,2 → C1=2. Last 7 elements: [2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. Wait, no, for k=3, n-k=10-3=7 elements. The last 7 elements are from index 3 to 9. Elements are 2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1. Wait, no, 7 elements: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nElements: 2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1 → wait, 7 elements? No, 3 to 9 is 7 elements (including 3 and 9). So elements 3:2,4:2,5:2,6:1,7:1,8:2,9:1. So 2s are at 3,4,5,8 → 4. So C2[3]=4. Sum is 2+4=6.\n\nHmm, this seems lower than previous values.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in computing C2[k]. Maybe I should precompute for all k the maximum number of 2s in the last (n -k) elements.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, C2[k] is the maximum number of 2s in the subarray starting at position k and extending to the end.\n\nWait, no. Because the last (n -k) elements are from position k onwards.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position i, precompute the number of 2s from i to the end. So for each k, C2[k] is the number of 2s in a[k ... n-1].\n\nSo, for the second sample, for each k, the number of 2s in the suffix starting at k is:\n\nk=0: 5 (positions 0-9: 1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1 → 2s are at 2,3,4,7,8 → 5)\n\nk=1: 4 (positions 1-9: 1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1 → 2s at 1,2,3,4,7,8 → wait, that's 6 2s? Or am I miscounting.\n\nWait, wait, the array is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]. So for k=0, the suffix is the entire array, which has 2s at positions 2,3,4,7,8: 5.\n\nFor k=1: the suffix is from index 1 to 9. The elements are 1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1. So 2s are at positions 1,2,3,4,7,8: 6.\n\nWait, that's 6.\n\nSo for k=1, C2[k] is 6.\n\nSo the sum is C1[1] (1) + C2[1] (6) =7.\n\nHmm, so for k=1, the sum is 7.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: the suffix is from index 2 to 9: 2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1. 2s are at 2,3,4,7,8 → 5. So C2[2]=5. C1[2] is 2. Sum is 7.\n\nFor k=3: suffix is 2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1 → 2s are at 3,4,7,8: 4. So C2[3]=4. C1[3] is 2. Sum is 6.\n\nk=4: suffix is 2,2,1,1,2,2,1. 2s at 4,7,8 → 3. So C2[4]=3. C1[4] is 3 (first four elements are 1,1,2,2 → 3 1s). Sum is 6.\n\nk=5: suffix is 2,1,1,2,2,1. 2s at 5,8,9? Wait, no, index 5 is 1, index 6 is 1, index 7 is 2, 8 is 2, 9 is 1. So 2s are at 7,8 → 2. So C2[5]=2. C1[5] is 3. Sum is 5.\n\nk=6: suffix is 1,1,2,2,1. 2s at 6,7 → 2. C2[6]=2. C1[6] is 4 (elements 0-5: 1,1,2,2,1,1 → 4 1s). Sum is 6.\n\nk=7: suffix is 1,2,2,1. 2s at 7,8 → 2. C2[7]=2. C1[7] is 5 (elements 0-6: 1,1,2,2,1,1,2 → 5 1s). Sum is 7.\n\nk=8: suffix is 2,1. 2s at 8 → 1. C2[8]=1. C1[8] is 6 (elements 0-7: 1,1,2,2,1,1,2,2 → 6 1s). Sum is 7.\n\nk=9: suffix is 1. 2s are 0. C2[9]=0. C1[9] is 7. Sum is 7.\n\nk=10: suffix is empty. C2[10]=0. C1[10]=7. Sum is 7.\n\nSo the maximum sum is 7.\n\nBut the sample output is 9. So this suggests that the approach of finding C1[k] + C2[k] is not sufficient.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating C2[k]. Let me recheck.\n\nIn the second sample, after reversing [3,7], the array becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. The LNDS is 9: the 1s from positions 0-3, then the 2s from 4-8 (9 elements?), which gives a sum of 4+5=9.\n\nWait, but how does that fit into our earlier approach.\n\nWait, in this case, the reversed segment is [3,7]. The original segment was [2,2,2,1,1,2,2]. After reversal, it's [1,1,2,2,2,2,2].\n\nSo the first part (before l=3) is [1,1,1], and the suffix is [2,2,1]. Wait, no, the suffix is from r+1=8 onwards. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with 1-based or 0-based indices.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach of precomputing C1 and C2 is not capturing the scenario where the reversed segment allows for a longer run of 1s or 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nInstead of trying to precompute for each k, perhaps for each possible reversal [l, r], calculate the maximum possible LNDS that can be achieved by considering the 1s in the prefix up to l, the 1s in the suffix after r, and the 2s in the reversed segment.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The LNDS is determined by the maximum number of 1s that can be taken from the prefix, followed by the maximum number of 2s from the suffix, considering that the reversed segment can bridge the two.\n\nSo, for each possible reversal [l, r], the maximum possible contribution to the LNDS is:\n\nmax( (number of 1s in prefix up to l-1) + (number of 2s in the reversed segment) + (number of 2s in suffix after r) )\n\nBut wait, that's not necessarily correct because the 2s in the reversed segment can come after the 1s in the prefix, thus contributing to the LNDS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the LNDS after reversal can be calculated as:\n\nnumber of 1s in the prefix (before l) + number of 2s in the reversed segment + number of 2s in the suffix (after r).\n\nBut this assumes that the 2s in the reversed segment are after the 1s in the prefix, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the key: after reversing [l, r], the 1s in the prefix (before l) are before the reversed segment, which now contains 2s and 1s. So in the reversed segment, the 2s that were originally in [l, r] become 1s, and the 1s become 2s.\n\nSo, for the LNDS, the prefix 1s can be followed by the 2s in the reversed segment, which can then be followed by the 2s in the suffix.\n\nSo the total LNDS would be:\n\nprefix_ones + reversed_twos + suffix_twos.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nSo, for each possible [l, r], the LNDS would be:\n\nprefix_ones (number of 1s before l) + (number of 2s in [l, r]) + suffix_twos (number of 2s after r).\n\nBecause after reversal, the 2s in [l, r] are now 2s, and can be added to the prefix 1s, followed by the suffix 2s.\n\nWait, that makes sense.\n\nSo the formula for the LNDS after reversing [l, r] is:\n\nprefix_ones + (reversed_twos) + suffix_twos.\n\nWhere:\n\nprefix_ones is the number of 1s in a[0...l-1]\n\nreversed_twos is the number of 2s in a[l...r] (because after reversal, they become 2s)\n\nsuffix_twos is the number of 2s in a[r+1 ... n-1]\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum of all possible (prefix_ones + reversed_twos + suffix_twos) for all possible l and r.\n\nAdditionally, we should compare this with the original LNDS of the array.\n\nSo, the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. Compute the original LNDS of the array.\n\n2. Precompute for each l and r:\n\n   a. prefix_ones[l] = number of 1s in a[0...l-1]\n\n   b. suffix_twos[r] = number of 2s in a[r ... n-1]\n\n   c. reversed_twos = number of 2s in a[l ... r] → which is (r-l+1) - (number of 1s in a[l...r])\n\n3. For each possible l and r (with l <= r), compute the value:\n\n   value = prefix_ones[l] + ((r - l + 1) - (number of 1s in a[l ... r])) + suffix_twos[r+1]\n\n   (Note: if r is the last element, suffix_twos[r+1] is 0.)\n\n4. The maximum of all these values across all l and r, along with the original LNDS, is the answer.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, to implement this:\n\n- Pre",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing a contiguous subarray in the given sequence. The sequence consists of elements that are either 1 or 2.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Original LNDS Calculation**: First, compute the LNDS of the original array using a dynamic programming approach. This gives us a baseline value which we will compare against our results from reversed subarrays.\n\n2. **Precompute Prefix and Suffix Arrays**:\n   - **Prefix Array**: For each position `l`, compute the number of 1s in the subarray from the start up to `l-1`.\n   - **Suffix Array**: For each position `r`, compute the number of 2s in the subarray from `r` to the end.\n\n3. **Iterate Over All Possible Subarrays**: For each possible subarray `[l, r]`, calculate the potential LNDS if this subarray is reversed. The key insight is that reversing a subarray allows us to transform 1s and 2s within it, potentially increasing the LNDS.\n\n4. **Calculate Maximum LNDS**: For each subarray `[l, r]`, compute the LNDS after reversal as the sum of:\n   - The number of 1s before `l`.\n   - The number of 2s within the subarray `[l, r]` (since they become 2s after reversal).\n   - The number of 2s after `r`.\n\n5. **Determine the Result**: The result is the maximum value obtained from all possible subarray reversals compared to the original LNDS.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    # Compute original LNDS\n    def compute_lnds(arr):\n        dp = []\n        for num in arr:\n            left, right = 0, len(dp)\n            while left < right:\n                mid = (left + right) // 2\n                if dp[mid] <= num:\n                    left = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    right = mid\n            dp.insert(left, num)\n        return len(dp)\n    \n    original_lnds = compute_lnds(a)\n    \n    # Precompute prefix_ones: prefix_ones[l] is the number of 1s in a[0..l-1]\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (a[i-1] == 1)\n    \n    # Precompute suffix_twos: suffix_twos[r] is the number of 2s in a[r..n-1]\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (a[i] == 2)\n    \n    max_lnds = original_lnds\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible l and r\n    for l in range(1, n+1):\n        for r in range(l, n+1):\n            # Calculate the number of 1s in a[l-1 ... r-1]\n            # which is prefix_ones[r] - prefix_ones[l-1]\n            ones_in_sub = prefix_ones[r] - prefix_ones[l-1]\n            twos_in_sub = (r - l + 1) - ones_in_sub\n            # The number of 2s after r is suffix_twos[r+1]\n            current_value = prefix_ones[l] + twos_in_sub + suffix_twos[r+1]\n            if current_value > max_lnds:\n                max_lnds = current_value\n    \n    print(max_lnds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Original LNDS Calculation**: This is done using a dynamic programming approach where we maintain a list to track the smallest possible tail values for increasing subsequences of different lengths.\n- **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays help efficiently compute the number of 1s and 2s in any prefix or suffix of the array.\n- **Subarray Iteration**: By iterating over all possible subarrays, we evaluate the impact of reversing each subarray on the LNDS.\n- **Efficiency**: The approach ensures that we efficiently compute the necessary values without redundant calculations, making the solution feasible even for the upper constraint of `n = 2000`.",
