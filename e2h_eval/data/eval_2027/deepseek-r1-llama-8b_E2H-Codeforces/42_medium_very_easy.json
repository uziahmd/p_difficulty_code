Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов. В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают $$$0$$$ процентов.Найдите все такие целые числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно, что существует момент времени, в который оба прогресс-бара одновременно показывают это число. Выведите эти числа в порядке возрастания.\n\n## Input\nВ первой строке задано одно целое число $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — число копируемых файлов.Во второй строке заданы $$$n$$$ целых чисел $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 1000$$$) — размеры файлов в байтах в том порядке, в котором они будут копироваться.\n\n## Output\nВыведите в возрастающем порядке все числа от $$$0$$$ до $$$100$$$ включительно такие, что существует момент времени, в который на обоих прогресс-барах одновременно показывается это число.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', '4\\n1000 2 2 998', '6\\n170 130 400 256 30 100']\n\n### Output\n['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100', '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100', '0\\n50\\n99\\n100', '0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100']\n\n## Note\nВ первом тесте копируется всего один файл, поэтому оба прогресс-бара всегда показывают одинаковые значения.Во втором тесте первый прогресс-бар сразу же уйдёт вперёд, потом сбросится в ноль и начнёт догонять второй прогресс-бар заново. В конце копирования прогресс-бары некоторое время будут показывать одно и то же число.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is about two progress bars when copying files. Each file is copied in order, and after each byte is copied, both progress bars are updated. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file that's been copied. The second shows the overall percentage across all files.\n\nThe goal is to find all integers from 0 to 100 inclusive such that at some moment both progress bars show the same number. Then, output these numbers in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So for each possible x (number of bytes copied so far), I need to compute what the two progress bars would show and check if they are equal.\n\nWait, but how do I model the process? Because for each file, we copy it byte by byte, updating the progress bars each time a byte is added.\n\nLet me think: For each file i, which has size a_i, when we are copying the x-th byte of this file, the current progress for the first bar is floor(100 * x / a_i). The second bar is floor(100 * (sum of all previous a_j plus x) / total_sum), where sum is the sum of all a_j.\n\nBut wait, the sum of all a_j is the total size. So during the entire process, the second bar is the overall progress, considering all the files up to and including the current one.\n\nBut the files are processed one after another. So for each step, I can track the cumulative bytes copied for each file and the total bytes.\n\nWait, perhaps I should simulate the process step by step, keeping track of the current state of both progress bars. But since n can be up to 100 and each a_i up to 1000, the maximum total bytes is 100*1000=10^5. So simulating each byte is feasible, as 1e5 steps are manageable.\n\nYes, because 1e5 steps multiplied by 100 files is 1e7 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Compute the total_sum = sum(a)\n- Initialize current_total = 0\n- For each file in order:\n   - For each byte in the file (from 1 to a_i):\n      - Update the progress bars:\n         - current_file_progress = (x / a_i) * 100, floored.\n         - current_total += 1 (since each byte is 1 byte)\n         - current_total_percent = (current_total / total_sum)*100, floored.\n         - If current_file_progress == current_total_percent, add the value to a set.\n      - So for each step, after each byte, check if both progress bars are equal, and record that percentage.\n\nWait, but the progress bars are updated after each byte. So for each byte x (from 1 to a_i), we calculate the progress and see if the two bars match.\n\nSo, for each file i, for each x from 1 to a_i:\n   compute progress_i = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n   compute progress_total = floor(100 * (current_total + x) / total_sum)\n   Wait no: Wait, current_total is the sum of all previous bytes. So adding x, which is the current byte, gives the new current_total.\n\nWait, no. Because current_total starts at 0. For the first byte, x is 1. So for the first step, current_total is 1. Then, for the next byte in the file, x is 2, so current_total becomes 2, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because for the first file, after each byte, current_total increases by 1. So for the k-th byte of the file, current_total is k.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it as follows:\n\nInitialize current_total = 0\n\nFor each file in the list:\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n      current_file_progress = floor( (x / a_i) * 100 )\n      current_total += 1\n      current_total_percent = floor( (current_total / total_sum) * 100 )\n      if current_file_progress == current_total_percent:\n          add to the set.\n\nSo yes, for each byte, we compute the progress for the current file and the overall progress, then check if they are equal.\n\nThis way, for every single byte copied, we can track the progress bars and see if they match.\n\nOnce all bytes are processed, collect all the percentages that were equal at any step, and output them in order.\n\nNow, the steps to implement this:\n\n1. Read input: n, then a list of n integers.\n\n2. Compute total_sum = sum(a)\n\n3. Initialize a set to collect the matching percentages.\n\n4. current_total = 0\n\n5. For each file in a:\n   a_i = file's size\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n      progress_i = (x * 100) // a_i\n      current_total += 1\n      progress_total = (current_total * 100) // total_sum\n      if progress_i == progress_total:\n          add to the set.\n\n6. After processing all files, collect all elements in the set, sort them, and print each on a separate line.\n\nWait, but what about the initial state before any bytes are copied? Both progress bars are 0. So 0 is definitely included.\n\nSo the code will correctly include 0.\n\nTesting this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n1\n6\n\nSo, one file of size 6. The process is:\n\nx from 1 to 6.\n\nAt each step:\n\nx=1: progress_i=16 (100*1/6=16.666... floor is 16), current_total=1, progress_total= (1/6)*100=16.666..., floor is 16. So 16 is added.\n\nWait no, wait: for x=1, current_total becomes 1.\n\nSo progress_total is 1*100 /6 =16.666..., floor is 16. So progress_i is 16, progress_total is 16. So 16 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x=2: progress_i is 33, current_total is 2. progress_total is 33.333... floor 33. So 33 is added.\n\nx=3: progress_i 50, current_total 3: 50% (3/6=50%), progress_total is 50.\n\nSo 50 is added.\n\nx=4: progress_i 66.666... floor 66. current_total 4: 66.666... floor 66.\n\nSo 66 is added.\n\nx=5: progress_i 83.333... 83. current_total 5: 5/6 ~83.333% floor 83. So 83 is added.\n\nx=6: progress_i 100%. current_total 6: 100%. So 100 is added.\n\nSo the set includes 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWhich matches the first sample's output.\n\nAnother sample: Second test case.\n\nInput:\n2\n100 500\n\nTotal_sum is 600.\n\nProcessing first file (100):\n\nx from 1 to 100.\n\nAt x=1:\n\nprogress_i = 1% (100*1/100=1). current_total=1. progress_total = 1/600 *100 ~0.166%, floor 0. So 0 !=1. Not added.\n\nx=100:\n\ncurrent_total is 100. progress_i is 100%.\n\nprogress_total is 100/600 *100=16.666, floor 16.\n\nSo 100 vs 16: not equal.\n\nWait, but let's see for other steps.\n\nWait, perhaps during the first file's copying, the progress bars don't match except at the very beginning and end.\n\nWait, let's take x=100: progress_i is 100%, current_total is 100. progress_total is 100/600*100 = 16.666% → 16. So not equal.\n\nSo during the first file's processing, the only matching point is when both are 0.\n\nAfter that, the second file (500) is processed.\n\nx runs from 1 to 500.\n\nFor each x in 2nd file:\n\nprogress_i = (x * 100)/500 → x/5, floored.\n\ncurrent_total increases by 1 each time, starting from 100+1=101.\n\nprogress_total = (current_total) * 100 / 600 → (100 + x) * 100 /600.\n\nSo for each x in 1..500:\n\nWe have to compute progress_i and progress_total, check equality.\n\nLooking for points where x/5 == (100 +x)*100/(600).\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to simulate.\n\nBut perhaps during the second file's processing, there are multiple matching points.\n\nLike when x=95:\n\nprogress_i = 95/5=19 → 19%.\n\ncurrent_total = 100 +95 =195.\n\nprogress_total = 195/600*100 =32.5 →32.\n\nSo 19 vs 32: no.\n\nWait, but when x is 95, the progress_i is 19, progress_total is 32.\n\nWait, maybe when x is 96:\n\nprogress_i = 96/5=19.2 →19.\n\ncurrent_total=196 →196/600 *100=32.666 →32.\n\nNo match.\n\nx=97: progress_i 19.4→19. current_total=197 →32.83 →32. No.\n\nx=98: 19.6→19. current_total=198 →33%.\n\nSo progress_i is 19, progress_total is 33. Not equal.\n\nx=99: 19.8→19. current_total=199 → 199*100/600= 33.166 →33. So 19 vs 33: no.\n\nx=100: 20% →20. current_total=200 → 200/600*100=33.333 →33. So 20 vs 33: no.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample output, the second line is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nWait, perhaps during the second file's processing, the progress_i and progress_total cross at certain points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the second file's processing, when x is 95, 96, etc., the progress bars meet.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nWait, for x=95:\n\nprogress_i is 95/5=19.\n\ncurrent_total is 100+95=195.\n\nprogress_total is 195/600=0.325 →32.5% →32.\n\nSo 19 vs 32: no match.\n\nBut according to the sample output, 95 is present. So maybe during the second file's processing, when the progress_i equals the progress_total.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's think about the second test case:\n\nFiles are 100 and 500. So total is 600.\n\nWhen the first file is being copied:\n\nAt x=100, the progress_i is 100%, but progress_total is 100/600*100=16.666 →16. So no match.\n\nAfter that, the second file starts.\n\nAs x increases, the progress_i is (x/500)*100.\n\nThe progress_total is (100 + x)/600 *100, floored.\n\nWe need to find x where (x*100/500) = ((100+x)*100/600).\n\nWait, perhaps for some x, this equation holds.\n\nLet me solve for x:\n\nx * 100 /500 = (100 +x)*100 /600\n\nMultiply both sides by 500*600 to eliminate denominators:\n\n600 * 100 x = 500 * 100 (100 + x)\n\nSimplify:\n\n60000x = 50000 (100 +x)\n\n60000x = 5,000,000 +50000x\n\n60000x -50000x =5,000,000\n\n10,000x=5,000,000 → x=500.\n\nWait, x=500: progress_i is 100%, progress_total is (600/600)*100=100%.\n\nSo at x=500, both are 100.\n\nSo that's one point.\n\nBut the sample output says that 95 is also present. So maybe my equation is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, wait, the equation is:\n\n(x / 500) * 100 = ( (100 +x) /600 ) * 100\n\nSo x/5 = (100 +x)/6\n\nCross-multiplying: 6x =5*(100 +x)\n\n6x=500 +5x →x=500.\n\nAh, right, so x=500 is the solution.\n\nSo during the second file's processing, at x=500, both progress bars are 100%.\n\nBut why does the sample output have 95?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the sample output for the second test case is:\n\n0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100\n\nWhich implies that during the process, 95, 96, etc., are also matched.\n\nWait, perhaps during the second file's processing, after some bytes, the progress bars meet.\n\nWait, perhaps I should simulate the second test case step by step.\n\nLet's process the second test case step by step.\n\nTest case 2: a = [100,500], total_sum=600.\n\ncurrent_total=0.\n\nFirst file: 100 bytes.\n\nx runs from 1 to 100.\n\nx=1: progress_i=1, current_total=1 → progress_total= 1/600*100=0 → 0. So 1 vs 0: not equal.\n\nx=100: progress_i=100, current_total=100 → progress_total=100/600*100=16.666 →16. So 100 vs 16: no.\n\nSo nothing added except 0.\n\nNow, current_total is 100.\n\nSecond file: 500 bytes.\n\nx runs from 1 to 500.\n\nx=1:\n\nprogress_i= (1/500)*100=0.2 →0.\n\ncurrent_total=101.\n\nprogress_total=101/600*100=16.833 →16.\n\nSo 0 vs 16: no.\n\nx=2:\n\nprogress_i=0.4 →0.\n\ncurrent_total=102 →17. So 0 vs17: no.\n\n...\n\nx=95:\n\nprogress_i= 95/500 *100 =19.\n\ncurrent_total=100+95=195.\n\nprogress_total=195/600 *100=32.5 →32.\n\n19 !=32: no.\n\nx=96:\n\nprogress_i=19.2 →19.\n\ncurrent_total=196 →32.666 →32.\n\nStill no.\n\nx=97:19.4→19. current_total=197 →32.83 →32.\n\nx=98:19.6→19. current_total=198 →33. So 19 vs33: no.\n\nx=99:19.8→19. current_total=199 →33.166 →33. No.\n\nx=100:20 →20.\n\ncurrent_total=200 →200/600*100=33.333 →33.\n\n20 vs33: no.\n\nx=101:20.2 →20.\n\ncurrent_total=201 →33.5 →33.\n\nNo.\n\nx=195: 39 →39.\n\ncurrent_total=100+195=295.\n\nprogress_total=295/600*100=49.166 →49.\n\n39 vs49: no.\n\nx=200:40.\n\ncurrent_total=300.\n\nprogress_total=300/600*100=50.\n\n40 vs50: no.\n\nx=250:50.\n\ncurrent_total=650/600*100=108.333 →108.\n\n50 vs108: no.\n\nx=300:60.\n\ncurrent_total=400 →400/600*100=66.666 →66.\n\n60 vs66: no.\n\nx=350:70.\n\ncurrent_total=450 →75.\n\n70 vs75: no.\n\nx=400:80.\n\ncurrent_total=500 →500/600*100=83.333 →83.\n\n80 vs83: no.\n\nx=450:90.\n\ncurrent_total=550 →550/600*100=91.666 →91.\n\n90 vs91: no.\n\nx=480:96.\n\ncurrent_total=580 →580/600*100=96.666 →96.\n\n96 vs96: yes! So 96 is added.\n\nx=481:96.2 →96.\n\ncurrent_total=581 →96.833 →96.\n\nSo 96 vs96: yes. So 96 is added again.\n\nWait, but we're using a set, so it's only stored once.\n\nx=490:98.\n\ncurrent_total=590 →98.\n\n98 vs98: yes. So 98 is added.\n\nx=495:99.\n\ncurrent_total=595 →595/600*100=99.166 →99.\n\n99 vs99: yes. So 99 is added.\n\nx=500:100.\n\ncurrent_total=600 →600/600*100=100.\n\nSo 100 is added.\n\nSo during the second file's processing, at x=480, x=481, etc., the progress bars meet.\n\nSo the set includes 0, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nWait, but according to the sample output, the second line is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the set includes 95 as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a step where 95 is matched.\n\nWait, perhaps during the second file's processing, when x is 95, but the progress bars are 19 and 32, which doesn't match.\n\nSo why does the sample output have 95?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simulation.\n\nWait, perhaps the second file's processing isn't the only place where 95 is matched.\n\nWait, perhaps during the first file's processing, after some x, the progress bars meet.\n\nWait, first file is 100 bytes.\n\nx=95: progress_i=95/100 *100=95.\n\ncurrent_total=95.\n\nprogress_total=95/600 *100=15.833 →15.\n\n95 vs15: no.\n\nNo match.\n\nSo 95 is not added during the first file's processing.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps during the second file's processing, after x=95, but when x is less than 500, the progress bars meet.\n\nWait, for example, x=95:\n\nprogress_i=19.\n\ncurrent_total=195.\n\nprogress_total=195/600 *100=32.5 →32.\n\nNot equal.\n\nWhat about x=190:\n\nprogress_i=190/500*100=38.\n\ncurrent_total=100+190=290.\n\nprogress_total=290/600*100=48.333 →48.\n\n38 vs48: no.\n\nx=240:48.\n\ncurrent_total=340 →57.333 →57.\n\nNo.\n\nx=285:57.\n\ncurrent_total=395 →65.833 →65.\n\nNo.\n\nx=330:66.\n\ncurrent_total=530 →88.333 →88.\n\n66 vs88: no.\n\nx=380:76.\n\ncurrent_total=580 →96.666 →96.\n\n76 vs96: no.\n\nx=480:96.\n\ncurrent_total=580 →96.666 →96.\n\n96 vs96: yes.\n\nSo 96 is added.\n\nWait, but the sample output includes 95 as well. So I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the progress_i and progress_total for all x, and see if there's an x where they are equal.\n\nWait, perhaps during the second file's processing, for some x, the progress_i is 95, and progress_total is 95.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet me see:\n\nprogress_i = (x/500)*100.\n\nprogress_total = (100 +x)/600 *100.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n(x /500)*100 = (100 +x)/600 *100.\n\nCancel 100:\n\nx/500 = (100 +x)/600.\n\nMultiply both sides by 600*500:\n\n600x = 500(100 +x)\n\n600x =50000 +500x\n\n600x -500x=50000 →100x=50000 →x=500.\n\nSo x=500 is the only solution.\n\nSo during the second file's processing, the only x that satisfies is x=500.\n\nSo why does the sample output have 95 as part of the second test case?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"after copiying each byte\" — meaning after each individual byte, the progress bars are updated and their values are displayed. So, for example, after the first byte, the progress bars are updated and shown.\n\nSo for the second test case:\n\nAfter the first file (100 bytes) is completely copied, current_total is 100.\n\nThen, the second file (500 bytes) is copied.\n\nSo for x=1 in the second file, current_total becomes 101.\n\nprogress_i is 0.2 →0.\n\nprogress_total is 101/600*100 →16.833 →16.\n\nSo 0 vs16: no.\n\nBut perhaps during the second file's processing, when the progress_i is 95, the progress_total is also 95.\n\nWait, but according to the equation, that's only possible when x=500.\n\nSo why in the sample output for the second test case, 95 is present.\n\nAh! Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that during the copying process, after each byte, the progress bars are updated and their values are displayed.\n\nSo during the second file's processing, the progress bars may reach a point where both are 95.\n\nWait, perhaps when the second file's x is such that:\n\nprogress_i = (x/500)*100 →95.\n\nSo x=475.\n\nBecause 475/500 *100=95.\n\nAt x=475, current_total is 100+475=575.\n\nprogress_total is 575/600 *100=95.833 →95.\n\nSo progress_i is 95, progress_total is 95.\n\nSo 95 is added.\n\nAh! Oh right, that's correct.\n\nSo my earlier approach was incorrect because I didn't consider that during the second file's processing, after x=475, the progress_i is 95, and the progress_total is 95.833 →95.\n\nSo that's a match.\n\nSo for x=475 in the second file:\n\nprogress_i=475/500 *100=95.\n\ncurrent_total=100+475=575.\n\nprogress_total=575/600 *100=95.833 →95.\n\nSo both are 95: add to set.\n\nSimilarly, x=476:\n\nprogress_i=476/500*100=95.2 →95.\n\ncurrent_total=576.\n\nprogress_total=576/600*100=96 →96.\n\nSo 95 vs96: no.\n\nSo 95 is added.\n\nSo the set includes 95, 96, 97, 98,99,100.\n\nSo the sample output for the second test case is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nThus, my initial approach is correct, but I had to make sure to process all x for all files, and for each x, calculate both progress bars.\n\nSo the code needs to simulate each byte, compute the two progress bars, and add to the set whenever they match.\n\nNow, let's proceed to write the code.\n\nThe code steps:\n\nRead n, then read a list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set to collect the matching percentages.\n\ncurrent_total = 0.\n\nFor each file in a:\n\n   a_i = file's size.\n\n   for x in 1 to a_i:\n\n      progress_i = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n      current_total += 1\n\n      progress_total = (current_total * 100) // total_sum\n\n      if progress_i == progress_total:\n\n          add to the set.\n\nAfter processing all, collect the sorted list of the set.\n\nPrint each element on a separate line.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the second test case's output is '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100'.\n\nWhich is 7 lines, including 0 and 100.\n\nSo code should handle this.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All files are zero size? No, since a_i >=1.\n\n- Single file, which is 1000 bytes. So when x=1000, progress_i is 100, progress_total is 100.\n\nSo 0 and 100 are included.\n\nAnother edge case: when n=100, each a_i=1.\n\nThen, each step x=1,2,...,100.\n\nAt each step, progress_i is x*100, current_total is x.\n\nprogress_total is (x/100)*100= x.\n\nSo progress_i is x, progress_total is x. So all x from 1 to 100 will have progress_i=progress_total=x. So the set includes 0,1,2,...,100.\n\nAnother case: when the files are such that during the second file's processing, multiple x's cause progress_i and progress_total to be the same.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\nInitialize res as a set.\n\ncurrent_total =0.\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n   for x in range(1, ai+1):\n\n       progress_i = (x * 100) // ai\n\n       current_total +=1\n\n       progress_total = (current_total * 100) // total_sum\n\n       if progress_i == progress_total:\n\n           res.add(progress_i)\n\nres = sorted(res)\n\nfor num in res:\n\n   print(num)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first test case's output is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWhich is 7 numbers.\n\nYes, the code will capture all these.\n\nAnother test case: third sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n4\n\n170 130 400 256 30 100\n\nOutput:\n\n0\\n17\\n43\\n44\\n84\\n90\\n99\\n100\n\nWhich is 8 numbers.\n\nSo the code will process each step correctly.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nBut wait, the input format is given as ['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', ...], but in reality, in Python, reading from stdin, it's better to read via input().split().\n\nBut perhaps, the input is given as first line is n, followed by a line with n space-separated integers.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\ncurrent_total =0\n\nres = set()\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    for x in range(1, ai+1):\n\n        progress_i = (x * 100) // ai\n\n        current_total +=1\n\n        progress_total = (current_total * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if progress_i == progress_total:\n\n            res.add(progress_i)\n\n# Also, add 0 if not added yet.\n\nres.add(0)\n\n# Convert to sorted list.\n\nsorted_res = sorted(res)\n\nfor num in sorted_res:\n\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but in the first test case, the initial state is 0, which is captured when x=0?\n\nNo, because x starts from 1. So when current_total is 0, but x=0, the progress_i is 0, progress_total is 0.\n\nBut in the code, for the first file, x starts at 1.\n\nSo in the first test case, the initial state is 0, but the code adds 0 only when the first byte is processed.\n\nWait, no. Because initially, current_total is 0.\n\nIn the first file, x runs from 1 to 6.\n\nFor x=1, current_total becomes 1.\n\nSo the initial 0 is not captured.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, both progress bars are 0 at the beginning, before any copying. So 0 must be in the result.\n\nSo the code misses adding 0 unless it's encountered during processing.\n\nIn the first test case, the initial 0 is not added, but during the first byte, the progress_i is 16, progress_total is 16.\n\nSo 16 is added, but 0 is not.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first test case, the initial state is 0, but the code only checks after each byte.\n\nSo the initial 0 is not captured.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the initial state is included.\n\nThus, the code must add 0 explicitly.\n\nSo, in the code, after processing all, add 0 to the set.\n\nOtherwise, for the first test case, 0 is not included.\n\nSo, the code should add 0 to the set regardless of any processing.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first test case, 0 is already considered, but in the code, it's not added.\n\nBecause the initial state is before any processing, and the code starts processing with x=1.\n\nSo to include 0, the code must add it.\n\nSo, in the code, after all processing, add 0 to the set.\n\nSo, in the code, after the loop:\n\nres.add(0)\n\nBecause during the initial state, both progress bars are 0.\n\nThus, the modified code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a.\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\ncurrent_total =0\n\nres = {0}  # to include 0.\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    for x in 1 to ai:\n\n        compute progress_i and progress_total.\n\n        if equal, add to res.\n\nSo the code is fixed.\n\nThus, the code now correctly includes 0.\n\nTesting this change:\n\nIn the first test case, 0 is in the set.\n\nIn the second test case, 0 is already added.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's write the code accordingly.\n\nSo the code in Python is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the moments during which both progress bars (one showing the percentage of the current file copied and the other showing the overall percentage of all files copied) show the same value. We will simulate the process of copying each file byte by byte and track the progress of both bars.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Initialization:** Calculate the total size of all files combined. Initialize a set to keep track of the percentages where both progress bars match.\n3. **Simulating Copy Process:** For each file, iterate through each byte, updating the progress bars after each byte is copied.\n4. **Updating Progress Bars:** After each byte, compute the percentage for the current file and the overall percentage. If these values match, add the percentage to the set.\n5. **Handling Initial State:** Ensure the initial state (0%) is included in the result.\n6. **Output Results:** Sort the collected percentages and print them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\ncurrent_total = 0\nres = {0}  # Include 0 as it's the initial state\n\nfor ai in a:\n    for x in range(1, ai + 1):\n        progress_i = (x * 100) // ai\n        current_total += 1\n        progress_total = (current_total * 100) // total_sum\n        if progress_i == progress_total:\n            res.add(progress_i)\n\nsorted_res = sorted(res)\nfor num in sorted_res:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read and parsed into the number of files and their sizes.\n- **Total Sum Calculation:** The total size of all files is computed to determine the overall progress.\n- **Progress Simulation:** For each file, each byte is processed, and the progress bars are updated. The percentage of the current file and the overall progress are calculated and checked for equality.\n- **Set Usage:** A set is used to collect unique percentages where both progress bars match.\n- **Initial State Handling:** The initial state (0%) is explicitly added to ensure it is included in the result.\n- **Sorting and Output:** The collected percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks the progress of both bars and ensures all relevant percentages are captured, providing the correct solution to the problem.",
