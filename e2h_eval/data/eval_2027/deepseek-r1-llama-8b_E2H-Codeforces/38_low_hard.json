    "thought": "Okay, I'm trying to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding two things for a given p:\n\n1. The minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph.\n2. Among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand what each part means.\n\nFirst, a directed graph is called p-reachable if it has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Wait, no, wait: the definition says that an ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u≠v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So, for each such pair, it's counted as unidirectional.\n\nBut then, a p-reachable graph has exactly p such unidirectional ordered pairs where u < v. Or is it any ordered pair where u and v are reachable in both directions? No, no—wait, no. The problem says that a p-reachable graph contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh wait, no: wait, the description says that a directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) such that u != v, u can reach v, and v cannot reach u. Because that's what unidirectional pairs are. So, the count of such unidirectional pairs is p.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: A directed graph is called p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u ≠ v, there exists a path from u to v, and there are no paths from v to u. So, the p is the count of these unidirectional ordered pairs.\n\nSo, the task is to find the minimal number of nodes needed to create a graph that has exactly p such unidirectional ordered pairs.\n\nOnce we have that minimal number of nodes, among all such graphs, find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs. Wait, no: the problem says, \"let G denote a graph which maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs of nodes.\" So, among all possible graphs that have p unidirectional pairs and the minimal number of nodes, choose the one that has the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs. But wait, isn't that just the same graph? Because if you're already at the minimal node count, perhaps the maximum is achieved when as many edges as possible are unidirectional. Hmm, but I think the way the problem is phrased is that for each graph with the minimal node count, compute the number of unidirectional pairs, and then find the maximum such count across all possible such graphs.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe for the same minimal node count, some graphs have more unidirectional pairs than others. So we need to find, among all minimal-node graphs with exactly p unidirectional pairs, the one that has the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because the problem says, \"find this number\"—the number of unidirectional pairs in the optimal graph G.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Find the minimal n such that there exists a graph with n nodes, p unidirectional pairs, and it's p-reachable.\n- Then, among all such graphs (with n nodes and p unidirectional pairs), find the one that has the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs. And output that maximum.\n\nWait, but that's a bit confusing because the maximum possible would be the same as p, but perhaps not.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's look at the example given.\n\nIn the first test case, input is 3, output is 3 0.\n\nWait, for p=3, the minimal number of nodes is 3. And the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nHmm. So why is that?\n\nBecause in a 3-node graph, the maximum possible unidirectional pairs is zero? That seems counterintuitive. Wait, perhaps because all possible edges contribute to unidirectional pairs. Or perhaps in the minimal configuration, the graph is structured in a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal node count is determined by the structure of the graph that allows for exactly p unidirectional pairs. So, for p=3, the minimal n is 3, and the only way to arrange the edges is in a way that results in zero unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal n is determined by how the unidirectional pairs are arranged.\n\nLet me think: each unidirectional pair (u, v) implies that u can reach v, but v",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine two things for a given integer \\( p \\):\n1. The minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is \\( p \\)-reachable.\n2. Among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Unidirectional Pairs**: An unidirectional pair (u, v) means there is a path from u to v but no path from v to u. A graph is \\( p \\)-reachable if it has exactly \\( p \\) such pairs.\n\n2. **Graph Structure**: The minimal graph must be structured in a way that allows exactly \\( p \\) unidirectional pairs. For each \\( p \\), we can determine the smallest number of nodes \\( n \\) by analyzing patterns of reachable nodes.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimal \\( n \\) is determined, we need to structure the graph to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs within the constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\np = int(input())\n\nif p == 0:\n    print(\"0 0\")\nelse:\n    # Find the minimal n such that C(n-1, 2) >= p\n    # We need to find the smallest n where (n*(n-1))/2 >= p\n    # Since the maximal number of unidirectional pairs in a transitive tournament is floor((n-1)(n-2)/2)\n    # So for the first part, we need to find the minimal n where (n choose 2) >= p\n    # Wait, no: because in a complete DAG, each edge contributes to an unidirectional pair.\n    # But for the minimal n, perhaps it's based on triangular numbers.\n\n    # Let's think differently: the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the sum from 1 to k-1 is at least p, where k is the number of nodes.\n    # Because each node can have edges pointing to all previous nodes, contributing (k-1 choose 2) pairs.\n\n    # Wait, no. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs in a DAG is (k*(k-1))/2 - m, where m is the number of bidirectional edges.\n    # To get exactly p unidirectional pairs, perhaps the minimal n is such that (k choose 2) is as close as possible to p.\n\n    # Alternatively, for the minimal n, the structure is a complete DAG, meaning every possible directed edge from a lower-numbered node to a higher-numbered node exists.\n    # In this case, the number of unidirectional pairs is (n-1)*(n-2)/2.\n\n    # Wait, but the problem requires that the graph is p-reachable, which means it has exactly p unidirectional pairs. So the minimal n is such that (n-1)*(n-2)/2 >= p.\n\n    # Let's solve for n in (n-1)(n-2)/2 >= p.\n\n    # So for the minimal n, we can compute it by finding the smallest integer n where (n^2 - 3n + 2)/2 >= p.\n\n    # Let's solve the quadratic equation n^2 - 3n + 2 = 2p, so n^2 - 3n + (2 - 2p) = 0.\n\n    # Using quadratic formula: n = [3 ± sqrt(9 - 8p)] / 2. We take the positive root.\n\n    # So the minimal n is ceil((sqrt(9 - 8p) + 3)/2).\n\n    # However, for some p, like p=3, the minimal n is 3 because (3-1)*(3-2)/2 = 1 < 3. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\n    # Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\n    # Let me think about the example given: when p=3, the minimal n is 3. The maximum unidirectional pairs in this case is 0.\n\n    # So perhaps the minimal n is determined by the triangular number T(k) = k*(k-1)/2.\n\n    # For p=3, T(3)=3, so n=3.\n\n    # For p=6, T(4)=6, so n=4.\n\n    # So perhaps the minimal n is the smallest k such that T(k) >= p.\n\n    # Then, for the first part of the output, the minimal n is k.\n\n    # For the second part, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in a graph with k nodes is T(k) - m, where m is the number of bidirectional edges.\n\n    # Wait, no. To maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to minimize the number of bidirectional edges.\n\n    # In a complete DAG, all edges are unidirectional, so the number of unidirectional pairs is T(k) = k*(k-1)/2.\n\n    # But wait, in a DAG, you can't have cycles, so all edges are unidirectional. Thus, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is indeed T(k).\n\n    # But then why in the example p=3, the maximum is 0? That suggests that perhaps the initial understanding is incorrect.\n\n    # Maybe I'm misunderstanding what a p-reachable graph is. Oh wait, the problem says that a graph is p-reachable if it has exactly p unidirectional pairs. So the minimal n is determined by how many unidirectional pairs are needed.\n\n    # So, to find the minimal n such that the number of unidirectional pairs can be exactly p.\n\n    # Perhaps the structure that achieves exactly p unidirectional pairs is a chain, where each node points to the next one, forming a linear order.\n\n    # In a chain of n nodes, the number of unidirectional pairs is (n-1). So for p=3, n=4? No, wait: 3 unidirectional pairs would require 4 nodes? Or maybe not.\n\n    # Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the minimal n for different p values:\n\n    # For p=0: 0 nodes, because no edges can exist.\n    # For p=1: 2 nodes (A->B), so 1 unidirectional pair.\n    # For p=3: 4 nodes arranged in a chain A->B->C->D, giving 3 unidirectional pairs.\n    # Wait, but that would mean n=4 for p=3, but the example says n=3.\n\n    # This is conflicting with the example given. So perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\n    # Let's refer back to the example. For p=3, the output is 3 0. So the minimal n is 3, and the maximum unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\n    # How can a 3-node graph have 3 unidirectional pairs? It must have a certain structure.\n\n    # Let's think: each unidirectional pair requires a directed edge without a reverse edge.\n\n    # Suppose the graph is a cycle: A->B, B->C, C->A. Then, each pair forms a cycle. But this creates zero unidirectional pairs because each edge has a reverse edge.\n\n    # Alternatively, perhaps the graph is a complete DAG, but that would require more nodes.\n\n    # Alternatively, perhaps the minimal n is determined by the triangular number.\n\n    # Wait, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that (n-1)*(n-2)/2 >= p.\n\n    # For p=3: (2)(1)/2 = 1 <3 → n=3 is not sufficient. So perhaps n=4 is needed.\n\n    # But the example says n=3. So perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\n    # Maybe the minimal n is the smallest k such that the sum of the first (k-1) integers is >= p.\n\n    # Sum from 1 to k-1 is (k-1)*k/2.\n\n    # So for p=3: (2*3)/2=3 ≥3 → k=3.\n\n    # For p=6: (3*4)/2=6 →k=4.\n\n    # So the minimal n is k where (k-1)*k/2 >= p.\n\n    # So for p=3, n=3.\n\n    # Now, for the second part: among all graphs with n nodes and exactly p unidirectional pairs, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n    # Wait, that's confusing. Because if the graph has exactly p unidirectional pairs, then the maximum cannot exceed p. But in the example, p=3, the maximum is 0, which is less than p.\n\n    # So perhaps the problem is asking for the maximum number of unidirectional pairs that can be present in any graph that is p-reachable, i.e., has exactly p unidirectional pairs.\n\n    # So, the maximum number is p, but perhaps due to structural constraints, it's not possible to have all p pairs unidirectional.\n\n    # Therefore, the second part is to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in a graph with exactly p such pairs.\n\n    # So, for p=3, the only way to have exactly 3 unidirectional pairs is to have a structure that doesn't allow any additional unidirectional pairs. Hence, the maximum is 0.\n\n    # So, perhaps the minimal n is determined by the triangular number, and the maximum unidirectional pairs is p minus the number of edges that form cycles or other structures that prevent all pairs from being unidirectional.\n\n    # Given the complexity, perhaps the solution involves calculating the minimal n as the smallest integer k where (k choose 2) >= p, and the maximum unidirectional pairs is p.\n\n    # But according to the example, when p=3, the maximum is 0, which contradicts this.\n\n    # So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n    # 1. Minimal n is the smallest k such that (k choose 2) >= p.\n\n    # 2. The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (k-1)(k-2)/2, which is the maximum possible in a DAG.\n\n    # Wait, but then for p=3, k=3, and (3-1)(3-2)/2 = 1, which is less than p=3.\n\n    # This suggests that my initial approach is incorrect.\n\n    # Given the time constraints, I'll proceed to write the code based on the following observations:\n\n    # For p=0: n=0, max_uni=0.\n\n    # For p>0, find the smallest k such that k*(k-1)/2 >= p.\n\n    # The maximum unidirectional pairs is k*(k-1)/2 - m, where m is the number of bidirectional edges. To maximize uni pairs, set m as small as possible.\n\n    # So, the maximum is k*(k-1)/2.\n\n    # But in the example, when p=3, the minimal k is 3, and 3*(3-1)/2=3, which equals p=3. So the maximum should be 3. But the example shows 0.\n\n    # So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\n    # Another approach: for the graph to be p-reachable, it must have exactly p unidirectional pairs. To maximize the number of unidirectional pairs beyond p, we need to arrange the graph such that as many edges as possible are unidirectional.\n\n    # But perhaps the minimal n is such that the number of possible unidirectional pairs is at least p, and the maximum is the largest possible number of unidirectional pairs in a graph with exactly p.\n\n    # This is getting too abstract. Given the time, I'll proceed to implement the following:\n\n    # Calculate the minimal n as the smallest integer where (n-1)*n/2 >= p.\n\n    # The maximum unidirectional pairs is p.\n\n    # But according to the example, this isn't correct.\n\n    # So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n    # The minimal n is the smallest integer such that (n choose 2) >= p.\n\n    # The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (n-1)*(n-2)/2.\n\n    # For the example p=3:\n\n    # n=3: (3-1)*(3-2)/2=1 <3 → not enough.\n\n    # So perhaps I need to find the smallest n where (n-1)*(n-2)/2 >= p.\n\n    # For p=3: (2)(1)/2=1 <3 → n=3 is not enough. So n=4: (3)(2)/2=3 >=3.\n\n    # So minimal n=4.\n\n    # But the example says n=3.\n\n    # This is conflicting.\n\n    # Given the time, I'll proceed to write the code based on the following logic:\n\n    # If p is 0, output 0 0.\n\n    # Else, find the minimal n such that (n-1)*(n-2)/2 >= p.\n\n    # The maximum unidirectional pairs is the maximum possible in a DAG, which is (n-1)*(n-2)/2.\n\n    # But in the example, when p=3, n=3, and (3-1)(3-2)/2=1 <3, which contradicts.\n\n    # So perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal n such that the sum of the first (n-1) integers is >= p.\n\n    # Sum is n*(n-1)/2 >=p.\n\n    # So for p=3: 3 >=3 →n=3.\n\n    # For p=4: 3+2=5≥4→n=3.\n\n    # For p=6:3+2+1=6→n=4.\n\n    # So minimal n is the smallest integer where n(n-1)/2 >=p.\n\n    # Then, the maximum unidirectional pairs is (n-1)(n-2)/2.\n\n    # For example, p=3: n=3 →max_uni=1.\n\n    # But the sample expects 0.\n\n    # So perhaps the correct approach is that the minimal n is the smallest integer where n*(n-1)/2 >= p, and the maximum unidirectional pairs is p.\n\n    # But again, the sample contradicts.\n\n    # Given time constraints, I'll proceed to write the code as follows:\n\n    # For p=0: output 0 0.\n\n    # Else, find the minimal n where n*(n-1)/2 >=p.\n\n    # The maximum unidirectional pairs is (n-1)(n-2)/2.\n\n    # So the code will compute this.\n\n    # But according to the sample, for p=3, the output is 3 0.

So the approach is incorrect.\n\nAfter reconsidering, perhaps the minimal n is determined differently.

So n=4: (3 choose 2)=3 >=3.\n\nSo n=4, and maximum unidirectional pairs is 3.\n\nBut the sample expects 0.\n\nI think I've spent too much time on this, and perhaps the correct approach is to look for the minimal n where (n choose 2) >= p, and the maximum unidirectional pairs is (n choose 2) - (number of bidirectional edges). But I'm not making progress.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code as written, but it's clear that it doesn't fit the sample. So perhaps the correct approach is different.\n\nThe correct approach is:\n\nFor the minimal n, it's the smallest integer where (n-1 choose 2) >= p.\n\nThe maximum unidirectional pairs is (n-1 choose 2).\n\nFor p=3, (2 choose 2)=1 <3 →n=3 not sufficient. So n=4, (3 choose 2)=3 >=3.\n\nMaximum unidirectional pairs is 3.\n\nBut sample expects 0.\n\nSo perhaps the correct answer is that the maximum is 0 when p is a triangular number.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write the code as:\n\nRead p.\n\nIf p ==0: print 0 0.\n\nElse:\n\nFind the minimal n such that (n-1 choose 2) >= p.\n\nCompute max_uni = (n-1 choose 2).\n\nPrint n and max_uni.\n\nBut according to the sample, this is incorrect.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the minimal n is the smallest integer where (n-1)(n-2)/2 >= p.\n\nThen, the maximum unidirectional pairs is p.\n\nBut again, this doesn't fit the sample.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write the code as follows, acknowledging that it might not pass all test cases:\n\n```python\np = int(input())\n\nif p == 0:\n    print(\"0 0\")\nelse:\n    n = 0\n    while True:\n        if (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2 >= p:\n            break\n        n += 1\n    max_uni = (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2\n    print(f\"{n} {max_uni}\")\n```\n\nBut for p=3, this gives n=3, max_uni=1, which doesn't match the sample.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to find the minimal n such that (n-1 choose 2) >=p, and the maximum unidirectional pairs is (n-1 choose 2).\n\nBut in the sample, this would give for p=3: n=4, max_uni=3.\n\nBut the sample expects 0.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to find the minimal n such that (n choose 2) >=p, and the maximum unidirectional pairs is (n-1 choose 2).\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write the code as follows, which passes the sample.\n\nWhen p=3:\n\nThe minimal n is 3.\n\nThe maximum unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nSo, the code should compute n=3 and max_uni=0.\n\nHow?\n\nBecause the graph is a cycle where each node points to the next, forming a cycle of 3 nodes.\n\nIn this case, each pair is bidirectional, so no unidirectional pairs.\n\nThus, the maximum is 0.\n\nSo, the approach is to model the graph as a cycle when p is a triangular number.\n\nThus, the code needs to find whether p is a triangular number.\n\nIf p is a triangular number, then the minimal n is the corresponding k where k choose 2 =p.\n\nAnd the maximum unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nOtherwise, find the minimal n where n choose 2 >=p, and the maximum is (n-1 choose 2).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write the code as:\n\nRead p.\n\nIf p ==0: print 0 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute n as the smallest integer where n*(n-1)/2 >=p.\n\nIf (n-1)*(n-2)/2 ==p: then maximum is 0.\n\nElse: maximum is (n-1)*(n-2)/2.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write the code as:\n\nRead p.\n\nif p ==0:\n\n    print(0 0)\n\nelse:\n\n    n = 1\n\n    while True:\n\n        if n*(n-1)//2 >=p:\n\n            break\n\n        n +=1\n\n    # Now, check if p is a triangular number.\n\n    if (n-1)*(n-2)//2 ==p:\n\n        max_uni=0\n\n    else:\n\n        max_uni = (n-1)*(n-2)//2\n\n    print(f\"{n} {max_uni}\")\n\nBut for p=3:\n\nn=3, (3-1)(3-2)/2=1 !=3.\n\nSo max_uni=1.\n\nBut sample expects 0.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, I'm stuck and will proceed with the initial code, but it's clear that it doesn't fit the sample.\n\nFinal code:\n```python\np = int(input())\n\nif p == 0:\n    print(\"0 0\")\nelse:\n    # Find minimal n where n*(n-1)/2 >=p\n    n = 1\n    while True:\n        if n * (n - 1) // 2 >= p:\n            break\n        n += 1\n    max_uni = (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2\n    print(f\"{n} {max_uni}\")\n```\n\nThis code might not pass all test cases, but it's the best I can do for now.",
