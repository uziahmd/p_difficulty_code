You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about finding the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and also counting the number of ways to do this. The cycle must have more than one vertex, and each vertex in the cycle can appear at most once. Also, we can't add any loops or parallel edges.\n\nHmm. So the first thing I need to do is think about what conditions allow us to form such a cycle with the least edges added.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. **Graph Structure**: The given graph has n vertices and m edges. It's undirected, no loops, no multiple edges.\n\n2. **Cycle Requirements**:\n   - The cycle must be odd-length.\n   - It's a simple cycle (no repeated vertices).\n   - The cycle must consist of more than one vertex, so the minimal cycle we're looking for is a triangle (3 nodes).\n\n3. **Adding Edges**: We can add edges, but they must not create loops or duplicates. So each new edge connects two distinct, previously disconnected vertices.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal t, the number of edges needed to be added, and w, the number of ways to add t edges to form such a cycle.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nI think the key is to look for connected components in the graph because adding edges within a component might not require as many edges as connecting different components.\n\nWait, but the cycle could span multiple components. Hmm, maybe not. Because if a cycle spans multiple components, that implies that there are existing paths between them through other components, which isn't possible without some connection.\n\nWait, no. Because the graph is undirected and may have multiple connected components. For example, suppose I have two separate triangles. To make a cycle, perhaps I need to connect them somehow, but that would form a longer cycle.\n\nBut wait, for a cycle, all nodes must be in a single connected component. So perhaps the minimal way is to consider each connected component and see what it contributes to forming a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the connected components of the graph. Let's denote the connected components as C_1, C_2, ..., C_k.\n\nNow, for each connected component, what's its structure? Well, each component is a tree or contains cycles.\n\nWait, no. A connected component can have cycles, but if it's a tree, it doesn't have any cycles.\n\nWait, no: a connected component is a tree if it's acyclic. If it has cycles, it's not a tree.\n\nSo, for each connected component, if it already has a cycle, then perhaps it can contribute to the overall solution.\n\nWait, but the problem requires an odd-length cycle. So, if any connected component already has an odd cycle, then t=0, since we don't need to add any edges. But wait, the problem says that the graph is initially given, but maybe it's possible that the initial graph already has such a cycle.\n\nWait, let's read the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the output is t and w. So t is the minimal number of edges to add to form such a cycle, regardless of whether the graph already has one.\n\nWait no, the problem says, \"the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex.\"\n\nAh, so if the graph already has such a cycle, then t is zero, and w is 1 because you don't add any edges.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case is 4 4, edges 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3. So the connected components are {1,2,3}, {4}. Wait, no, 4 is connected to 2 and 3 via the edges. Wait, 4 is connected to 2 and 3, but 1 is connected to 2 and 3 as well. So all four nodes are in a single connected component. Does this component contain a cycle? Let's see. There are four nodes, and the edges form a sort of diamond shape. 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3. So 1 is connected to 2 and 3. 4 is connected to 2 and 3. So the subgraph formed by these nodes has a cycle: 1-2-4-3-1. That's a cycle of length 4, which is even. So the problem requires an odd-length cycle. So the sample output is t=1 and w=2. Hmm, so in that case, the initial graph does not have any odd-length cycle. So the minimal way is to add one edge.\n\nWait, in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and count the number of ways to achieve this. The cycle must consist of more than one vertex and each vertex can appear at most once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Connected Components**: First, we identify all connected components in the given graph. Each component is treated separately as we need to ensure that any added edges form a cycle within a single component.\n\n2. **Check for Existing Cycles**: For each connected component, check if it already contains an odd-length cycle. If any component does, the answer is immediate: `t = 0` (no edges needed) and `w = 1` (only one way).\n\n3. **Determine Minimum Edges for Odd Cycle**: If no component has an odd-length cycle, we need to determine the minimum edges required to form such a cycle. This involves analyzing the structure of each component to find the shortest path to forming an odd-length cycle by connecting components or adding edges within a component.\n\n4. **Count Ways to Form Cycle**: For each way of adding edges that forms an odd-length cycle, count the number of valid configurations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    m = int(input[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx])\n        v = int(input[idx+1])\n        edges[u].append(v)\n        edges[v].append(u)\n        idx +=2\n\n    # Function to check if a component has an odd cycle\n    def has_odd_cycle(component):\n        visited = [False] * (n+1)\n        color = [0] * (n+1)\n        q = deque()\n        q.append( (component[0], -1) )\n        visited[component[0]] = True\n        while q:\n            u, parent = q.popleft()\n            for v in edges[u]:\n                if not visited[v]:\n                    visited[v] = True\n                    color[v] = color[u] ^ 1\n                    q.append( (v, u) )\n                elif v != parent:\n                    if color[v] == color[u]:\n                        return True\n        return False\n\n    # Find all connected components\n    visited = [False]*(n+1)\n    components = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            q = deque()\n            q.append(i)\n            visited[i] = True\n            comp = []\n            while q:\n                u = q.popleft()\n                comp.append(u)\n                for v in edges[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        q.append(v)\n            components.append(comp)\n\n    # Check each component for existing odd cycle\n    found = False\n    for comp in components:\n        if has_odd_cycle(comp):\n            print(\"0 1\")\n            return\n\n    # Now, consider each component and see what needs to be done\n    # We need to find the minimal t and w across all possibilities\n\n    min_t = float('inf')\n    ways = 0\n\n    # Case 1: Create a triangle within a single component\n    for comp in components:\n        # Check if the component has at least 3 nodes and is connected\n        if len(comp) >=3:\n            # Check if there's a node with degree >=2, which allows forming a cycle\n            has_node_with_degree_ge2 = any(len(edges[u]) >=2 for u in comp)\n            if has_node_with_degree_ge2:\n                min_t = 1\n                ways = 0\n                # But wait, maybe there are multiple ways to add edges\n                # So we need to compute how many ways to form a triangle\n                # Not sure yet, let's think\n                # For example, in a star-shaped component, how many triangles can be formed\n                # Need to find all possible triplets of nodes that form a triangle\n                # Maybe it's better to compute the number of possible triangles that can be formed by adding one edge\n                # But for now, perhaps we can set min_t to 1 and ways to some value, then update later\n                # But this might not capture all cases, so perhaps it's better to handle all cases in a different way\n\n    # Another approach: For each component, compute the minimal edges needed and the number of ways, then take the overall minimum\n    # Let's think about each component and see what is needed\n    # For each component, determine whether it can contribute to forming an odd cycle with the minimal t\n    # Then among all possible contributions, find the one with the smallest t, and sum the ways accordingly\n\n    # So for each component, compute the minimal t_i and w_i to form an odd cycle in that component\n    # Then overall t = min(t_i), and w is sum of w_i where t_i == t\n\n    # So, let's process each component\n    t_list = []\n    w_list = []\n    for comp in components:\n        # Check if the component can form a cycle on its own\n        if has_odd_cycle(comp):\n            t_list.append(0)\n            w_list.append(1)\n            continue\n\n        # Else, check if the component can form a triangle by adding one edge\n        # A component can form a triangle if it has at least 3 nodes and has a path between any two pairs\n        # Wait, no.
