He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a certain number of vertices n can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph has specific construction rules. \n\nHmm, let me try to understand the structure. So initially, there's one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it, where k is greater than 1. Then, for each vertex that has only one edge (the leaves), we connect each to k new vertices. And importantly, this last step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the snowflake graph grows in layers. The first layer is the root with degree k. Each subsequent layer adds more nodes, each branching into k children.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this mathematically. Let's think about how the total number of vertices grows.\n\nLet me consider the process step by step. \n\nThe initial step has 1 node.\n\nStep 1: Add k children to the root. Total nodes = 1 + k.\n\nStep 2: For each of those k nodes, add k children each. So adding k*k nodes. Total now is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the step of adding to the leaves should be done at least once. So the minimal case is when after the first addition, we do the second step at least once. Or wait, no: the initial step is adding k children, then each leaf (which are the k nodes) each add k children. That's the minimal step beyond the initial.\n\nWait, the problem says that the initial step is adding k>1 children. Then, each vertex with degree 1 (so the ones added in the previous step) must add k new children. And this step must be done at least once. So the minimal structure is the root, which has k children, and each of those has k children. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k*k.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial step is adding k children. Then, each of those k children adds k children. So that's adding k*k. So the total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWait, but what if k=2? Then the minimal is 1+2+4=7. But according to the sample input, for n=9, the output is NO. Let me see.\n\nSample Input includes 9, which is not achievable because 9 isn't of the form 1 + 2 + 4=7, but wait 1+2+2*2=7. Oh right, but 9 is 3 squared plus something else?\n\nWait, no. The sample input shows that for n=13, the output is YES. So 13 must fit into some form.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is more complicated. Because in the initial steps, maybe the process can have multiple layers of expansion. Like, after adding the first level of leaves, each of those may have their own leaves, and so on. So the total number of nodes is the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWait, let me model the total number of nodes in the snowflake. Let's say that the process goes through m layers. The root is layer 0, layer 1 has k nodes, layer 2 has k^2, and so on until layer m. But wait, each layer after the root is built by expanding each node in the previous layer into k children. So the number of nodes in each layer is k^i, where i is the depth.\n\nBut the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, each of those adds another layer (k^2 nodes). Then each of those adds another (k^3), etc.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the step of adding to the leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has at least two layers beyond the root. So for example, if we have two steps of expansion beyond the root, the total nodes are 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut what if we do more steps? Like, three layers beyond the root: 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. Or even more.\n\nSo the general formula for the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m), where m is the number of expansion steps beyond the root. But wait, actually, each expansion step adds a new layer. So the total nodes after m expansion steps (each being the step of adding leaves to the current leaves) would be 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1} }? No, wait.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the construction:\n\n- Start with 1 node.\n\n- Add layer 1: 1 * k nodes. Now total is 1 + k.\n\n- Then, add layer 2: each node in layer 1 adds k nodes. So layer 2 has k^2 nodes. Total is 1 + k + k².\n\n- Then, add layer 3: each node in layer 2 adds k nodes. Layer 3 has k³ nodes. Total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nAnd so on. So the total is the sum from i=0 to m of k^i, where m is the number of layers. Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding layer 1, which is k nodes. So the sum is 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... +k^{m}) ), but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... + k^{m}), where m >=1. Because the initial root is 1, and each expansion step adds a new layer.\n\nWait, for example, when m=1: 1 +k*(1) = 1+k. But wait, the minimal structure requires that after adding the first layer, we must add at least one more layer. So the minimal is m=2: 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, no. Let's clarify:\n\nThe construction steps are:\n\n1. Initial root: 1 node.\n\n2. Add k children to it (step 1). Now, 1 +k nodes. At this point, each of these k nodes has degree 1.\n\n3. Then, perform the expansion step on each leaf (degree 1 node). So each adds k children. This is step 2. After this, each of the k nodes has k children, so they become internal nodes of degree k+1.\n\nSo after step 2, the total nodes are 1 +k +k².\n\nThis is the minimal snowflake, because the expansion step (step 2) was performed at least once.\n\nSo the snowflake can have more layers beyond that. For example, step 3: expand each leaf again, adding k^3 nodes, making total 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nBut wait, the leaves after step 2 are the k² nodes. So step 3 would add k^3 nodes.\n\nSo the total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is the sum from i=0 to m of k^i, where m >=2. Because the initial step is adding the first layer (i=1), and then each expansion adds a higher layer.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nThe total number of nodes is 1 (root) plus the sum of all the nodes added in each expansion step.\n\nEach expansion step adds a new layer of k^d nodes, where d starts from 1 and increases by 1 each step.\n\nSo for example:\n\n- Step 1 (after initial): add layer 1, k nodes. Total: 1 +k.\n\n- Step 2: add layer 2, k² nodes. Total: 1 +k +k².\n\n- Step 3: add layer 3, k³ nodes. Total: 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nBut the problem says that step 2 (the first expansion) must be done at least once. So the minimal is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for any snowflake, the total number of nodes is 1 +k*(s), where s is a sum of a geometric series starting from 1 and having terms up to some power.\n\nWait, no. Because each expansion adds a new term. So the total is 1 +k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m} ), where m >=1.\n\nBecause the initial step adds k (sum is 1), then each expansion adds k, k², etc.\n\nSo the total is S = 1 +k * ( (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ), where m is the number of expansion steps beyond the initial.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model it as S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^t, where t >=2. Because the initial step is adding k (layer 1), and the expansion steps add layer 2, 3, etc.\n\nWait, no. Because after the initial step, you have 1 +k. Then, adding layer 2 makes it 1 +k +k². So yes, the total is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^t, where t is the number of layers beyond the root.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is S = (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut since t must be at least 2 (because the expansion step is done at least once), so t >=2.\n\nWait, let's test with k=2.\n\nFor t=2: S = (2^3 -1)/(2-1) =7/1=7. Which matches 1+2+4=7.\n\nFor t=3: S=15, which is 1+2+4+8=15.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as S = (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1), where k>1 and t>=2.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input:\n\nn=6: Output is NO.\n\nWait, let's see possible k and t.\n\nIf k=2, t=2: S=7. Not 6.\n\nk=3: t=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Not 6.\n\nk=5: t=2: (5^3-1)/4=124/4=31. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe other t values.\n\nWait, maybe t can be larger. Or perhaps the snowflake can have varying expansion steps. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps another way to model it: the snowflake can have any number of layers, as long as it's at least two expansions beyond the root.\n\nSo for n=13, which is 1+3+9=13, which is (3^3-1)/(3-1)=26/2=13. So yes, k=3, t=2.\n\nSimilarly, n=15 is 1+2+4+8=15. So k=2, t=3.\n\nn=255: 255 = 256-1 = 2^8-1. So 2^8=256, 256-1=255. So (2^4 -1)/(2-1) =15, but that's for t=3. Wait, wait no: (2^4 -1)/(2-1) is 15, but 255 is 2^8-1. So 255 = 2^8-1, which can be written as (2^8-1)/(2-1) =255. So t=7.\n\nWait, so 255 = (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1), where k=2, t+1=8, t=7.\n\nYes, that fits. So 255 is acceptable.\n\nSo the approach is, for a given n, determine if n can be expressed as (k^{m} -1)/(k-1), where k>1 and m >=3 (since t >=2, m = t+1 >=3).\n\nWait, because t is the number of layers beyond the root, and each expansion step adds a new layer. So m is t+1, which is the exponent in the formula.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to check if there exists integers k>1 and m >=3 such that n = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nAdditionally, since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check this.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case, given n, check whether there exists a k>1 and m>=3 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nWe can precompute all possible m's, but since m can be up to log2(1e18) which is around 60, but for each m, we can try to find a k.\n\nWait, but for each m, we can compute k as the solution to the equation (k^m -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nWe can iterate over possible m starting from 3 upwards, and for each m, check if there exists an integer k>1 satisfying the equation.\n\nBut what's the maximum m we need to consider?\n\nSince k must be at least 2, for m=3: (2^3 -1)/(2-1) =7. So n must be at least 7 for m=3.\n\nBut for larger m, the value of (k^m -1)/(k-1) can get very big. So for each n, the maximum m we need to check is up to log_2(n) +1 or something like that.\n\nSo the algorithm steps for each n:\n\n1. If n < 7, return NO, because the minimal possible n is 7 (for k=2, m=3).\n\nWait, no. Wait for k=2, m=3: (8-1)/1=7. So 7 is the minimal possible n.\n\nBut wait, the sample input has n=6, which is less than 7, and returns NO.\n\nSo for n<7, the answer is NO.\n\n2. For n >=7, iterate m from 3 up to log_max, where log_max is such that 2^m <=n.\n\nWait, but for each m, we can compute the possible k.\n\nLet me see, for a given m, the equation is (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nThis can be rewritten as k^(m-1) + k^(m-2) + ... +k +1 =n.\n\nWhich is the sum of a geometric series.\n\nWe can note that for fixed m, the left-hand side is strictly increasing in k. So for each m, we can binary search for k in [2, ... ] to see if any k satisfies the equation.\n\nBut since m can be up to 60, and for each m, binary search is O(log n), it's manageable for t=1e4.\n\nSo for each n:\n\n- Check for m from 3 to log2(n) +1.\n\nWait, but how far do we need to go for m?\n\nWait, for a given m, the minimal possible n is achieved when k=2: (2^m -1)/(2-1)=2^m -1.\n\nSo for m such that 2^m -1 >n, m is too large.\n\nThus, the maximum m we need to consider is up to log2(n+1)+1.\n\nBecause 2^m <=n+1 implies m <= log2(n+1).\n\nSo for each n, we can loop m from 3 up to log2(n+1), which is about 60.\n\nFor each m, compute if there exists a k>1 such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i = n.\n\nBut how to compute k for a given m?\n\nWe can model it as a function f(k, m) = (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nWe can binary search for k in [2, n-1], but since m is small, perhaps we can find k quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find k numerically.\n\nWait, but for each m, the function f(k, m) increases as k increases.\n\nSo for a fixed m, f(k, m) is monotonic in k. So for each m, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nBut wait, let's see.\n\nFor example, for m=3:\n\nf(2,3)=1+2+4=7.\n\nf(3,3)=1+3+9=13.\n\nf(4,3)=1+4+16=21.\n\nSo for n=13, m=3 gives k=3.\n\nBut for n=14, m=3: we can see that between k=3 and k=4, f(k,3) increases from 13 to 21. So 14 isn't present.\n\nSo for each m, we can compute the lower and upper bounds for k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, compute k as the (m-th root) of n*(k-1) +1, but that's not straightforward.\n\nAnother approach is to use binary search for k in the range [2, n-1] for each m.\n\nBut since for each m, the binary search is O(log n), and m is up to 60, for t=1e4, the total operations are 1e4 *60 * log n, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 1e18, so log2(n) is about 60. So per test case, 60 binary searches, each taking 60 steps. 60*60=3600 steps per test case. For 1e4 test cases, 3.6e7 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nIf n <7: output NO.\n\nElse, for m from 3 to log2(n) +1:\n\n   Use binary search to find a k>1 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\n   If found, output YES.\n\nIf after all m's, no such k is found, output NO.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the binary search correctly for each m.\n\nBut how to compute (k^m -1)/(k-1) without causing integer overflow, especially for large k and m.\n\nWait, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not a problem.\n\nBut during the binary search, for each candidate k, we need to compute f(k, m) and see if it equals n.\n\nBut computing k^m for large m and k could be time-consuming. However, since m is up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but for binary search, the maximum k we need to check is n-1 (since for m=3, k=2 gives 7, k=3 gives 13, etc.)\n\nWait, but for a given m, the maximum possible k is such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) <=n.\n\nBut for m>=3, the minimal k is 2.\n\nSo for binary search, the low is 2, and the high is n-1.\n\nBut for each m, we can compute the minimal k and maximal k, but perhaps just setting high to n is sufficient.\n\nWait, but for m=3, k can be up to cube root of n, but for larger m, it's smaller.\n\nBut in the binary search, for each m and each mid, we can compute f(mid, m) and compare to n.\n\nSo, the steps for each m:\n\nlow=2\n\nhigh= n-1\n\nfound = False\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) //2\n\n   compute s = (mid^m -1)/(mid-1)\n\n   if s ==n: found=True; break\n\n   elif s <n: need to increase k, set low=mid+1\n\n   else: decrease k, set high=mid-1\n\nIf found, return True.\n\nBut wait, wait: for mid=1, (mid^m -1)/(mid-1) is undefined. But our low starts at 2, so mid will be >=2.\n\nWait, but for mid=1, the denominator is zero. So in our code, mid starts at 2.\n\nWait, but for mid=1, the formula is invalid, so our binary search starts at 2.\n\nBut for mid=1, the code won't be called because low is 2.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n\n    if n <7:\n\n        return False\n\n    max_m = log2(n) +1\n\n    for m in range(3, max_m +1):\n\n        low =2\n\n        high =n-1\n\n        while low <=high:\n\n            mid = (low + high)//2\n\n            # Compute sum = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^{m-1}\n\n            # Which is (mid^m -1)/(mid-1)\n\n            # We need to compute this and see if it equals n.\n\n            # To avoid overflow, perhaps compute step by step.\n\n            # But in Python, it's okay.\n\n            s = (mid**m -1)//(mid -1)\n\n            if s ==n:\n\n                return True\n\n            elif s <n:\n\n                # Need bigger mid\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut wait, wait: for m=3, mid=2: (8-1)/1=7.\n\nmid=3: (27-1)/2=13.\n\nmid=4: (64-1)/3=63/3=21.\n\nSo for m=3, and n=13, mid=3 would give s=13, which is equal to n.\n\nSo binary search works.\n\nBut for some cases, the computation may take longer, but as discussed earlier, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nLet's see each case.\n\nn=9:\n\nCheck m from 3 to log2(9)+1=4.\n\nFor m=3:\n\nCompute f(k,3) for various k.\n\nCheck if any k>1.\n\nFor k=2: f=7 <9.\n\nk=3: f=13>9.\n\nSo binary search would not find anything.\n\nFor m=4:\n\nFind k where 1 +k +k² +k³ =9.\n\nTry k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>9.\n\nk=1 is not allowed.\n\nNo.\n\nSo n=9 returns NO.\n\nn=1: <7: NO.\n\nn=2: same.\n\nn=3: same.\n\nn=6: same.\n\nn=13:\n\nm=3: k=3 gives 13: YES.\n\nn=15:\n\nCheck m=3: k=2 gives 7, k=3 gives13, k=4 gives 21. So 15 is not in m=3.\n\nCheck m=4: find k.\n\nCompute 1 +k +k² +k³ =15.\n\nTrying k=2: 15.\n\nYes! So m=4, k=2: 1+2+4+8=15.\n\nSo YES.\n\nn=255:\n\nCheck for m=3: 255= (k^3-1)/(k-1) → 255*(k-1)=k^3-1.\n\nLooking for k.\n\nBut 255 is 2^8-1. So for m=8:\n\nWait, wait, let's compute for m=8.\n\nBut wait, 255 = (2^8 -1)/(2-1) =255.\n\nSo m=8, k=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should find this.\n\nn=10101:\n\nWe need to check if any m>=3 and k>1 satisfy the condition.\n\nBut 10101 is a big number. Let's see:\n\nWhat's the maximum m? log2(10101) is about 13. So m ranges from 3 to 14.\n\nFor each m, binary search for k.\n\nBut for m=3:\n\nWe need 1 +k +k² =10101.\n\nk² +k -10100=0.\n\nSolving quadratic: k=(-1 + sqrt(1+40400))/2 = sqrt(40401)/2. sqrt(40401) is 201, so k=(200)/2=100.\n\nSo 1+100+100²=1+100+10000=10101. So yes, m=3, k=100.\n\nSo the code will find this.\n\nSo the sample output for 10101 is YES.\n\nWait, no: the sample output for 10101 is NO. Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the last test case is '1000000000000000000' and the output is NO.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recheck the sample input and output.\n\nThe sample input is:\n\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO','NO','NO','NO','YES','YES','YES','YES','NO']\n\nSo for n=10101, the output is YES.\n\nYes, according to the sample.\n\nSo according to the code, n=10101 should return YES.\n\nSo, the code seems to work.\n\nNow, let's think about the case where n is a perfect power.\n\nWait, for n=31: 31 is (5^3-1)/4 =124/4=31.\n\nSo m=3, k=5: 1+5+25=31.\n\nSo the code would return YES.\n\nAnother case: n=7: m=3, k=2: YES.\n\nn=13: m=3, k=3: YES.\n\nn=21: m=3, k=4: 1+4+16=21: YES.\n\nn=3: no.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut let's think about when n is (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and m>=3.\n\nWait, what about n= (k^m -1)/(k-1) where k= m?\n\nLike k=3, m=3: 13.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about n= (2^4 -1)/(2-1) =15: which is covered.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the next step is to write the code.\n\nBut wait, in Python, calculating mid^m for large m and mid can be slow. But for m up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but for m=60, mid=2: 2^60 is about 1e18, which is manageable in Python.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n <7: print NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute max_m as floor(log2(n)) +1.\n\n   for m in 3 to max_m inclusive:\n\n      perform binary search for k in [2, n-1].\n\n      compute s = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\n      if s ==n: return YES.\n\n   after all m, if none found, return NO.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each m, the binary search may take O(log n) steps. So for m up to 60, each binary search is 60 steps.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport math\n\nt=int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n=int(input())\n\n    if n <7:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    found=False\n\n    max_m = 1\n\n    while (2 ** max_m) <=n:\n\n        max_m +=1\n\n    max_m -=1\n\n    # Ensure that max_m is at least 3.\n\n    if max_m <3:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    for m in range(3, max_m+1):\n\n        low=2\n\n        high=n-1\n\n        while low <=high:\n\n            mid = (low + high)//2\n\n            # compute (mid^m -1) // (mid-1)\n\n            # but for mid=1, division is undefined, but mid >=2.\n\n            numerator = mid**m -1\n\n            denominator = mid -1\n\n            if denominator ==0:\n\n                # mid=1, but mid is >=2.\n\n                pass\n\n            else:\n\n                s = numerator // denominator\n\n            if s ==n:\n\n                found=True\n\n                break\n\n            elif s <n:\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nWait, but calculating mid^m for m=60 and mid=1e9 could be a problem, but in Python, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each m, we compute the maximum m as the largest such that 2^max_m <=n.\n\nWait, but for n=1e18, 2^60 is about 1e18, so max_m would be 60.\n\nBut wait, the code computes max_m as the maximum m such that 2^m <=n.\n\nBut for m=3, the maximum possible is up to 60.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut wait, what if m is larger than that? For example, if n is 255, which is 2^8-1, but 2^8 is 256>255. So the maximum m computed by the code is 7 (since 2^7=128 <=255, 2^8=256>255). So for m=8, the code won't loop.\n\nBut wait, in the case of n=255, it's (2^8-1)/(2-1)=255. So m=8.\n\nBut according to the code, m would be up to 7.\n\nThus, the code would miss this case.\n\nOh no! That's a problem.\n\nSo the initial approach is wrong. Because for n=255, the code would compute max_m as 7 (since 2^7=128 <=255, 2^8=256>255). So m=8 is not considered, but it's needed.\n\nThus, the code is incorrect.\n\nSo the approach to compute max_m as the maximum m where 2^m <=n is flawed.\n\nBecause for n=(k^m -1)/(k-1), it's possible that m is larger than log2(n).\n\nWait, for example, when k=3, m=3: n=13.\n\nlog2(13) is ~3.7, so m=3 is within 3.7.\n\nBut for n=255, which is 2^8-1, m=8, which is larger than log2(255) which is ~8.\n\nWait, no, 2^8 is 256, which is larger than 255. So log2(255) is about 7.99.\n\nSo the code would set max_m=7, but m=8 is required.\n\nThus, the code misses this case.\n\nSo the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo how to compute max_m correctly?\n\nWe need to ensure that m is at least up to the maximum possible value that can produce a sum that equals n.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that for the sum S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nThe sum S is >=k^{m-1} (since all terms except 1 are >=k^{m-1}).\n\nBut that's not quite helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, the minimal possible S is when k=2: S=2^m -1.\n\nThe maximal possible S for a given m is when k is as large as possible, but since k can be up to n-1, S can be up to (n-1)^m -1/(n-2), which is way larger than n.\n\nBut for our purposes, for each m, we need to check if there's a k where S =n.\n\nBut how to determine the maximum m that needs to be checked.\n\nWait, for a given m, the minimal possible S is 2^m -1.\n\nThus, for a given m, if 2^m -1 >n, then for that m, the minimal possible S is larger than n, so no k can satisfy S =n.\n\nSo the maximum m we need to consider is the maximum m where 2^m -1 <=n.\n\nBecause for m where 2^m -1 >n, the minimal S is already larger than n, so no solution.\n\nThus, to find max_m, we can compute the largest m where 2^m -1 <=n.\n\nBecause for any m larger than that, 2^m -1 >n, so no possible k can make S =n.\n\nSo for n=255, 2^8 -1=255. So m=8 is allowed.\n\nThus, for n=255, the code should consider m up to 8.\n\nSo the code's calculation of max_m is incorrect.\n\nSo how to compute max_m correctly.\n\nWe can calculate max_m as the largest m where 2^m -1 <=n.\n\nSo for n=255:\n\n2^8 -1=255 <=255: m=8.\n\n2^9-1=511>255: stop.\n\nThus, max_m=8.\n\nThus, in the code, for each test case, compute the maximum possible m as the largest integer m where 2^m -1 <=n.\n\nSo how to compute that.\n\nWe can compute m as the floor of log2(n+1).\n\nBecause 2^m <=n+1 → m= floor(log2(n+1)).\n\nBut wait, for n=255:\n\nlog2(255+1)=log2(256)=8.\n\nThus, m=8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for any n, the maximum m is floor(log2(n+1)).\n\nBut wait, for n=7: log2(8)=3. So m=3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nFor n=255, m=8.\n\nThus, the code should adjust the max_m calculation.\n\nSo the code should compute max_m as the floor of log2(n+1).\n\nThus, in code:\n\nimport math\n\nmax_m = int(math.log(n+1, 2))\n\nBut wait, what if n= (2^m -1), then log2(n+1) is exactly m.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for n=7: log2(8)=3 → m=3.\n\nFor n=15: log2(16)=4 → m=4.\n\nThus, the code needs to compute max_m as the integer part of log2(n+1).\n\nBut since in Python, the log function returns a float, we can compute it as:\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nwhile (2 ** (max_m +1)) <=n:\n\n    max_m +=1\n\nThus, for n=255:\n\nInitially, max_m=0.\n\nCheck 2^1=2 <=255: max_m=1.\n\n2^2=4<=255: max_m=2.\n\n...\n\n2^8=256>255: loop stops.\n\nThus, max_m=7.\n\nWait, no, wait.\n\nWait, in the loop:\n\nmax_m starts at 0.\n\nCheck if 2^(max_m +1) <=n.\n\nFor n=255:\n\n2^(0+1) =2 <=255 → max_m becomes 1.\n\nCheck 2^(1+1)=4 <=255 → max_m=2.\n\nContinue until 2^8=256>255 → loop stops.\n\nThus, the final max_m=7.\n\nBut for n=255, the correct max_m is 8.\n\nSo this approach is also incorrect.\n\nAh, because the condition is 2^(max_m +1) <=n.\n\nSo for n=255, 2^8=256>255, so the loop stops, giving max_m=7.\n\nBut for n=255, m=8 is needed.\n\nThus, the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, so perhaps the correct way to compute max_m is the maximum m such that 2^m -1 <=n.\n\nWhich can be found as the largest m where 2^m <=n+1.\n\nThus, the correct way is to compute m as the integer part of log2(n+1).\n\nIn code, for n=255, log2(256)=8 → m=8.\n\nSo the code should compute max_m as the integer part of log2(n+1).\n\nThus, in code:\n\nimport math\n\nmax_m = int(math.log(n+1, 2))\n\nBut due to floating point inaccuracies, perhaps using bit_length is better.\n\nWait, n+1 in binary is a 1 followed by zeros. The number of bits minus one is the exponent.\n\nFor example, 256 is 2^8, so its bit length is 9. So log2(256) is 8.\n\nThus, for any n, (n+1).bit_length() -1 gives the highest power of 2 less than or equal to n+1.\n\nWait, for example, n=255 → n+1=256 → bit_length is 9 → 9-1=8.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, in code:\n\nmax_m = (n+1).bit_length() -1\n\nBut wait, 2^max_m could be larger than n+1.\n\nNo, because (n+1).bit_length() is the number of bits required to represent n+1 in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.\n\nThus, 2^(bit_length-1) <=n+1 <2^bit_length.\n\nThus, (n+1).bit_length() -1 is the largest m such that 2^m <=n+1.\n\nThus, for n=255, (255+1).bit_length() is 9, so m=8.\n\nWhich is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph has specific construction rules which involve adding layers of nodes in a geometric progression.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A snowflake graph is constructed starting from a single root node.\n   - Each leaf node (nodes with only one connection) must add \\( k \\) new nodes, where \\( k > 1 \\).\n   - The minimal structure after the first expansion step results in \\( 1 + k + k^2 \\) nodes.\n   - We need to check if \\( n \\) can be expressed in the form \\( (k^m - 1) / (k - 1) \\) for some integers \\( k > 1 \\) and \\( m \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Mathematical Insight**:\n   - The total number of nodes in a snowflake graph can be represented as the sum of a geometric series.\n   - For a given \\( n \\), we need to check if it can be written as \\( S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^t \\) where \\( t \\geq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - For each \\( n \\), compute the maximum possible value of \\( m \\) such that \\( 2^m - 1 \\leq n \\). This helps limit the range of values we need to check.\n   - Use binary search to efficiently determine if there exists a valid \\( k \\) for each \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - For each test case, if \\( n \\) is less than 7, it's immediately \"NO\".\n   - For \\( n \\geq 7 \\), compute the maximum \\( m \\) using the bit length of \\( n + 1 \\).\n   - Iterate over possible values of \\( m \\) from 3 up to the computed maximum.\n   - For each \\( m \\), use binary search to check if there exists a valid \\( k \\) such that the sum of the geometric series equals \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_m = (n + 1).bit_length() - 1\n    if max_m < 3:\n        return False\n    for m in range(3, max_m + 1):\n        low = 2\n        high = n - 1\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if mid == 1:\n                s = m  # since 1^m is 1, sum is m*1?\n                pass\n            else:\n                try:\n                    numerator = mid ** m - 1\n                    denominator = mid - 1\n                    if denominator == 0:\n                        s = m  # shouldn't happen since mid >=2\n                    else:\n                        s = numerator // denominator\n                except OverflowError:\n                    s = float('inf')\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    if is_snowflake(n):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The function `is_snowflake` checks if a given \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph.\n- It first handles small values of \\( n \\) directly.\n- For larger values, it computes the maximum possible \\( m \\) using the bit length of \\( n + 1 \\).\n- For each \\( m \\), it performs a binary search to find a valid \\( k \\) such that the sum of the geometric series equals \\( n \\).\n- If any valid \\( k \\) is found for any \\( m \\), the function returns \"YES\"; otherwise, it returns \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( m \\) and uses binary search to quickly determine valid \\( k \\) values, ensuring the solution is both correct and efficient.",
