Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer, which can be positive, negative, or zero, but the absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But since some are missing, we need to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to achieve this.\n\nWait, no. Wait. The way the problem is phrased: Natasha hid all, but he found n. So the initial set is infinite, but he only found n. Now, he wants the sum of all found (the current n) plus any additional ones he finds to equal zero. Or wait, maybe the sum of the found cards plus the sum of the missing ones must be zero? Because that makes sense. Because he can find more cards to add to make the total sum zero.\n\nSo the question is, given the sum of the found cards, what's the minimal number of additional cards he needs to find such that their sum cancels out the current sum, without exceeding x in absolute value for each new card.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as: the sum S of the found cards is the target. We need to find a collection of k cards (each with absolute value ≤x) whose sum is -S. And we want the minimal possible k.\n\nBut wait, not exactly. Because Vanya can choose any additional cards, including those with values that are already present or others, as long as their absolute value is <=x.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. We need to find the smallest number of cards k, each of which can be any integer between -x and x (inclusive), such that their sum is equal to -S. But each card's absolute value can't exceed x.\n\nWait, but the problem says that initially, Vanya had infinitely many cards, each with any integer from -x to x. So when Natasha hid them, Vanya could have found any subset, but now he found some. So he can find more, but each new card must be within the allowed range.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given a target T = -sum(found), find the minimal k such that there exists a sequence of k numbers, each with absolute value ≤x, whose sum is T.\n\nSo our task is to compute the minimal k for this T.\n\nHmm. So how do we approach this?\n\nFirst, calculate the current sum S of the found cards. Then T = -S is the required sum from the additional cards.\n\nNow, we need to find the minimal k where k numbers, each in [-x, x], add up to T.\n\nWhat's the minimal possible k?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible sum achievable with k cards.\n\nEach card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative). So the maximum sum for k cards is k*x, the minimum is -k*x.\n\nSo for T to be achievable, it must satisfy |T| ≤ k * x.\n\nBut that's just a necessary condition, not sufficient.\n\nSo first, the minimal k must be at least the ceiling of |T| / x. Because each step can contribute at most x towards the sum.\n\nWait, no: For example, if T is 5 and x is 3. Then one card can't reach 5 because 3 <5. So you need two cards: 3+2=5, but wait, 2 is allowed. Or 3 + something else. Wait, no. Wait, 5 can be achieved by 3 + 2, but 2 is allowed as x is 3.\n\nWait, but in that case, the minimal k is 2.\n\nSo the minimal k is at least ceil(|T| / x). Because each card can contribute up to x towards the sum.\n\nSo the minimal possible k is the smallest integer such that k >= |T| / x and also, the sum can be formed with k cards.\n\nWait, but sometimes even if |T| is less than k*x, you might still not be able to form the sum.\n\nWait, no. Because you can adjust the signs. For example, if T is 4 and x is 3. Then with k=2, 3+1=4, but 1 is allowed. So yes, it's possible. So the condition |T| <= k*x is necessary and sufficient because you can distribute the sum across k terms, each up to x.\n\nWait, let's see another example. Suppose T=5, x=3. So |5|=5, which is greater than 3*1=3. So k must be at least 2. 3+2=5, but 2 is allowed. So yes, it's possible.\n\nAnother example: T=7, x=3. 3+3+1=7, but 1 is allowed. So k=3. Alternatively, 3+2+2=7. So yes, possible.\n\nWait, but wait: if T is 6 and x is 3, then k=2: 3+3=6. So it's okay.\n\nSo perhaps the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x), except when T is zero, but that's trivial.\n\nWait, but wait: what if T is zero? Then we don't need any additional cards. So the minimal k is zero.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Calculate S = sum of found cards.\n2. T = -S.\n3. If T is zero, return 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal k such that k >= |T| / x. Since k must be an integer, it's the ceiling of (|T| / x).\n\nWait, but let me test this logic with the examples provided.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S is (-1)+1+2 = 2. So T = -2.\n\nWe need to find the minimal k where k cards, each with |value| <=2, sum to -2.\n\nWait, wait no: because S is 2, so T is -2. So the sum of the additional cards should be -2.\n\nSo what's the minimal k?\n\nWell, for T=-2, |T|=2, x=2.\n\nSo |T| /x is 2/2=1. So k is 1. So the answer is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is (-2) + (-2) = -4. T is 4.\n\nx is 3.\n\nSo |T|=4. x=3. 4/3 is approx 1.333, so ceil is 2.\n\nCan we get 4 with 2 cards? 3+1=4, but 1 is allowed. So yes, possible. So k=2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: Let's say sum is 5, x=2.\n\nThen T is -5. |T|=5. x=2. 5/2=2.5, so ceil is 3. So 3 cards.\n\nIs it possible? 2+2+1=5, but 1 is allowed. So yes.\n\nWait, but wait: 2+2+1 is 5, but the sum of the three cards is 5, which is T=-5? No, wait, wait no: the sum of the additional cards is T, which is -S. Oh right, in this example, S is 5, so T is -5. So the sum of the added cards should be -5.\n\nWait, no! Wait, I think I got confused earlier.\n\nWait, the found cards' sum is S. Vanya wants the sum of all found cards (current and additional) to be zero. So S + sum(additional) = 0 → sum(additional) = -S.\n\nSo in the first example, sum of found is 2, so sum of additional is -2.\n\nIn the second example, sum of found is -4, so sum of additional is 4.\n\nSo for T=4, x=3.\n\nSo the minimal k is 2.\n\nSo back to the problem.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the sum S of the found cards.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal k as the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nBecause each card contributes up to x towards the sum.\n\nWait, but wait: what if T is 0? Then no additional cards are needed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of found cards.\n\nCompute S = sum of found cards.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T == 0 → print 0.\n\nElse, compute k = ceil( |T| / x )\n\nBut wait, wait: let me think about whether this always works.\n\nSuppose T is 6, x=3 → 6/3=2 → k=2. Sum is 3+3=6.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: T=5, x=3 → 5/3 ≈ 1.666 → ceil is 2. 3+2=5, but wait 2 is allowed.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about T=7, x=3: 7/3 ≈2.333 → ceil 3. 3+3+1=7, but 1 is allowed.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about T=4, x=3. 4/3 is 1.333 → ceil 2. 3+1=4. Yes.\n\nAnother edge case: T= x → k=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: T= x+1 → k=2.\n\nFor example, x=3, T=4 → k=2.\n\nWait, 3+1=4, but 1 is allowed. So yes.\n\nBut what if T is 3+3=6, x=3 → k=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula seems correct.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of integers.\n\nCompute S = sum of list.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero → print 0.\n\nElse, compute the absolute value of T → abs_T.\n\nCompute k = (abs_T + x - 1) // x → which is equivalent to ceiling division.\n\nPrint k.\n\nWait, let me test this.\n\nCase 1: T=2, x=2 → (2+2-1)//2= (3)//2=1 → correct.\n\nCase 2: T=4, x=3 → (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2 → correct.\n\nCase 3: T=5, x=2 →5+2-1=6 →6//2=3 → correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about the input format.\n\nThe input is two lines:\n\nThe first line has two integers, n and x.\n\nThe second line has n space-separated integers.\n\nSo in Python, we can read the first line, split into n and x.\n\nThen read the second line, split into list of integers, convert to integers, sum them.\n\nCompute T = -sum.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute k as (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nThen print k.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is two lines. So for example, in the first sample, the input is:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nWhich is two lines. So in code, the first line is n and x, the second is the list.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ns = sum(cards)\n\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    k = (abs(t) + x -1) // x\n\n    print(k)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nSum is 2, t is -2.\n\nabs(t) is 2.\n\nx is 2.\n\n(2+2-1)//2 =3//2=1 → correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nSum is -4, t is4.\n\nabs(t)=4.\n\nx=3.\n\n(4+3-1)//3=6//3=2 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the sum is 0, output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=2. t=-5. abs(t)=5.\n\n(5+2-1)//2=6//2=3. So 3 cards.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x=3. t=-3 → (3+3-1)/3=5//3=1. So 1 card.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nSo I think this will handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (both initially found and newly found) equals zero. Each card's value must be between -x and x inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: Compute the sum \\( S \\) of the values on the cards that Vanya has already found.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum \\( T \\) for the additional cards is the negative of \\( S \\) because we want the total sum (including new cards) to be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If \\( T \\) is zero, no additional cards are needed, so the result is 0.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Number of Cards**: If \\( T \\) is not zero, compute the absolute value of \\( T \\) and determine the minimum number of cards required. This is done using the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of \\( T \\) by \\( x \\). This ensures each card contributes as much as possible towards reaching the target sum without exceeding the allowed value range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = (abs(t) + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line reads the integers \\( n \\) (number of found cards) and \\( x \\) (maximum absolute value of any card). The second line reads the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum \\( S \\) of the found cards.\n3. **Target Sum Calculation**: Calculate \\( T \\) as the negative of \\( S \\).\n4. **Zero Check**: If \\( T \\) is zero, print 0 since no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: If \\( T \\) is non-zero, use ceiling division to determine the minimum number of cards required. This is done by adding \\( x - 1 \\) to the absolute value of \\( T \\) before performing integer division by \\( x \\).\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of additional cards needed to balance the sum to zero, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of input constraints.",
