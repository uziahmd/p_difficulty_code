    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of arrays of sets that satisfy certain conditions. Hmm. The main condition is that there exists a rearrangement of the array such that each set in the rearranged array is a child of the next one.\n\nWait, what's a child? Oh right, a set A is a child of B if for every x in A, x+1 is in B. So, for example, if A has 1, then B must have 2. If A has 3, B must have 4, and so on.\n\nSo the task is to find the number of possible arrays [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N] where each S_i is a subset of {1,2,...,K}, such that after some permutation, each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nHmm. So the arrays are considered different if any element differs. And the count needs to be modulo 998244353.\n\nLet me think about the approach here.\n\nI remember that when dealing with such problems, especially with permutations and sequences, dynamic programming can be useful. Also, perhaps inclusion-exclusion or combinatorics based on the constraints.\n\nFirst, let's think about the structure of valid arrays. Since after rearrangement, the sequence forms a chain where each is a child of the next, the overall structure must form a non-decreasing sequence in terms of the elements they contain. But wait, no—because the child condition requires that each element in S'_i is present as x+1 in S'_{i+1}. So the maximum element in S'_i must be less than or equal to the maximum element in S'_i+1 minus 1. Wait, not exactly. Because if S'_i has 1, then S'_{i+1} must have 2. If S'_i has 2, S'_{i+1} must have 3, etc. So the maximum element in S'_i could be anything, but the presence of any x implies the next set has x+1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to model each set as a bitmask of which elements are present. Then, the child condition imposes that for each bit set in the current mask, the next mask must have that same bit set in the next higher position. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, for each x in the current set, the next set must include x+1. So the next set can't have any gaps before a certain point.\n\nWait, maybe the way to model this is that the sets form a chain where each set includes all the required elements for the previous. For example, if S_i has x, then S_{i+1} must have x+1. So the presence of x in S_i implies the presence of x+1 in S_{i+1}.\n\nSo, the maximum element in S_i is M, then S_{i+1} can't have any elements less than M+1. Or wait, no. For example, if S_i has 1, then S_{i+1} must have 2. But S_{i+1} can also have 3, 4, etc., as long as 2 is present. So the maximum element in S_{i+1} can be anything >= 2, but it's allowed to have 2,3, etc.\n\nHmm. Maybe another approach: for each set in the array, determine the minimal required set for the next one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire array can be represented as a chain of increasing maxima. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input, N=2 and K=2. The output is 11.\n\nLooking at the note, there are various arrays possible. Each array has two sets, S1 and S2.\n\nWait, the total number of possible arrays without any constraint is (2^2) * (2^2) = 16. But since the order can be rearranged, perhaps we need to count the number of pairs where either S1 is a child of S2 or vice versa, and then multiply accordingly. Or maybe it's the number of unordered pairs where one is a child of the other, multiplied by the number of possible orderings.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem allows any rearrangement, so the array must be such that when arranged in some order, each consecutive pair meets the condition. So for N=2, the array can be any pair where either the first is a child of the second, or the second is a child of the first. Because the rearrangement can choose the order accordingly.\n\nWait, but for N=2, the array can be arranged in either order. So for each possible pair (A,B), the array [A,B] is acceptable only if A is a child of B or B is a child of A. Or more precisely, at least one of the two possibilities must hold.\n\nWait, no. Because the array is [S1, S2], and we can rearrange it as [S'_1, S'_2]. So the array is acceptable if there exists a permutation of [S1, S2] such that S'_1 is a child of S'_2. So for N=2, the array is acceptable if either S1 is a child of S2, or S2 is a child of S1.\n\nBecause then, we can arrange them in the order that satisfies the condition.\n\nSo for each pair (A,B), if either A is a child of B or B is a child of A, then the array [A,B] is acceptable.\n\nIn the first sample, N=2, K=2: the total number of such pairs is 11. So how?\n\nEach set can be any subset of {1,2}. There are 4 possible sets:\n\n- Empty set: {}\n- {1}: {1}\n- {2}: {2}\n- {1,2}: {1,2}\n\nNow, for each pair (A,B), check if either A is a child of B or B is a child of A.\n\nLet's list all possible pairs and count those that satisfy the condition.\n\nTotal possible pairs: 4*4=16.\n\nNow, which pairs are acceptable?\n\nFor a pair (A,B):\n\nCase 1: A is a child of B.\n\nWhat does that mean? For every x in A, x+1 is in B.\n\nSo:\n\nIf A is empty: yes, because there are no x in A. So any B will satisfy A is a child of B.\n\nSimilarly, if A is {1}, then B must contain 2.\n\nIf A is {2}, then B must contain 3. But since K=2, 3 is beyond K, so B cannot have it. So for A={2}, there is no B that satisfies A is a child of B.\n\nWait, but K is 2. So if A is {2}, then B must have 3, which is impossible. So in such cases, A can't be a child of B.\n\nSimilarly, if A is {1,2}, then B must contain 2 and 3. Again, 3 is impossible. So no B can make A a child.\n\nSo let's compute for each possible A and B whether A is a child of B or B is a child of A.\n\nEmpty set is a child of any B.\n\nSo for each A, count the number of B's where A is a child of B.\n\nThen, for each B, the same.\n\nWait, but for the pair (A,B) to be acceptable, it's sufficient that either A is a child of B OR B is a child of A.\n\nSo let's compute for each (A,B) whether this condition holds.\n\nLet me list all 16 possibilities.\n\n1. A={}, B={}\n   - A is child of B: yes.\n   So acceptable.\n\n2. A={}, B={1}\n   - A is child: yes.\n   Acceptable.\n\n3. A={}, B={2}\n   - A is child: yes.\n   Acceptable.\n\n4. A={}, B={1,2}\n   - A is child: yes.\n   Acceptable.\n\n5. A={1}, B={}\n   - B doesn't have 2. So A is not a child of B. Now, check if B is a child of A. B is empty, so yes.\n   So acceptable.\n\n6. A={1}, B={1}\n   - Check if A is child of B: does B have 2? No. So no.\n   Check if B is child of A: B is {1}. Does A have 2? No. So no.\n   So this pair is not acceptable.\n\n7. A={1}, B={2}\n   - A is child of B: yes, because 1 is in A, and 2 is in B.\n   So acceptable.\n\n8. A={1}, B={1,2}\n   - A is child of B: yes, since 2 is present.\n   So acceptable.\n\n9. A={2}, B={}\n   - A is not a child of B (since B has no 3). B is empty, so is B a child of A? Yes. Because empty set is a child of any set. So this pair is acceptable.\n\n10. A={2}, B={1}\n    - A is not a child of B (needs 3). B is not a child of A (B has 1, A has 2, so B has 1, which is x=0? Wait, no. Wait, the condition is for each x in B, x+1 is in A. So for B={1}, x=1 must be in A. A is {2}, which doesn't have 1. So B is not a child of A. So the pair is not acceptable.\n\n11. A={2}, B={2}\n    - A is not a child of B (needs 3). B is not a child of A (x=2 in B requires 3 in A, which isn't there). So not acceptable.\n\n12. A={2}, B={1,2}\n    - A is not a child of B (needs 3). B is not a child of A (B has 1, which is not in A). So no.\n\n13. A={1,2}, B={}\n    - A is not a child of B (needs 2 and 3). B is empty, so B is a child of A. So acceptable.\n\n14. A={1,2}, B={1}\n    - A is not a child of B (needs 2 and 3). B is {1}: check if B is child of A. B has 1, so A must have 2. Which it does. So yes. So acceptable.\n\n15. A={1,2}, B={2}\n    - A is not a child of B (needs 3). B has 2, so check if B is child of A. B has 2, so A must have 3. It doesn't. So no.\n\n16. A={1,2}, B={1,2}\n    - A is not a child of B (needs 3). B is not a child of A (B has 1 and 2; A must have 2 and 3. It lacks 3). So no.\n\nSo now, let's count how many of these 16 are acceptable.\n\nLooking at the above, the pairs that are acceptable are:\n\n1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,13,14.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n1: yes.\n\n2: yes.\n\n3: yes.\n\n4: yes.\n\n5: yes.\n\n6: no.\n\n7: yes.\n\n8: yes.\n\n9: yes.\n\n10: no.\n\n11: no.\n\n12: no.\n\n13: yes.\n\n14: yes.\n\n15: no.\n\n16: no.\n\nSo total acceptable pairs: 11.\n\nWhich matches the sample. So our initial approach is correct.\n\nSo the problem is, for general N and K, to count the number of arrays of N sets, each a subset of {1,..,K}, such that there exists a permutation where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nHmm. How do we model this for larger N?\n\nIdea: We can model the problem using DP, where dp[i][s] represents the number of ways to have the first i sets arranged in a particular way, ending with set s, where s is a subset that can be followed by another subset t if s is a child of t.\n\nWait, but considering all possible subsets would be too slow, since K can be up to 2e5. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Notice that the child condition implies that for each subset s, the next subset t must include all elements x+1 for each x in s. So t must be a superset of s + 1, where s+1 is the set {x+1 | x ∈ s}.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent each subset as the set of its elements, and track the minimal required elements for the next set.\n\nBut even that seems tricky.\n\nWait, but perhaps each subset can be represented as a bitmask, but with K up to 2e5, that's impossible.\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of tracking individual subsets, perhaps model the problem based on the maximum element in the subset, and the presence of certain elements.\n\nWait, but perhaps each subset can be uniquely determined by the maximal element m and the presence of all elements from 1 to m.\n\nWait, for a subset s, let m be the maximum element in s. Then, s must contain all elements from 1 to m. Because otherwise, suppose m is present, but some x < m is missing. Then, if s contains x, then s must have x+1, but if x+1 is not present, then s is not a child of any set containing x but not x+1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the condition is that for any x in s, x+1 must be in the next set. But for s itself, there's no such condition. So s can have any combination of elements, as long as when you arrange the sets in a certain order, each next set covers the required x+1.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe we can find a way to represent each subset s in terms of the elements it contains, and model transitions between subsets based on the child condition.\n\nBut considering the size of K, we need an O(K) solution.\n\nAnother thought: The problem requires that the array can be permuted into a sequence where each set is a child of the next. So the entire array must form a chain where each set is a subset that can be followed by another set in the chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering that each set in the array must be a subset of some superset in the chain. So the entire collection of sets must form a chain under the child relation.\n\nWait, but the array can be any permutation of the sets, as long as the permutation forms such a chain.\n\nWait, no. Because the array is a sequence of N sets, and their order can be rearranged into a chain. So the array's sets, regardless of order, must form a chain under the child condition.\n\nAh, right! Because the problem says \"there exists a way to rearrange the array into a chain\". So the array's sets must form a chain in some order, but the order within the array doesn't matter as long as such a rearrangement exists.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of multisets of N sets (allowing duplicates), such that the multiset can be arranged into a chain where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition.\n\nWait, but the order within the array can be arbitrary as long as a permutation exists. So the problem is equivalent to finding the number of multisets of N sets where all sets in the multiset form a chain when arranged in some order.\n\nSo, each multiset must consist of sets that can be ordered in a way where each set is a child of the next.\n\nThus, the problem becomes: find the number of multisets of N subsets of {1,...,K}, such that the subsets can be arranged in a linear order where each subset is a child of the next.\n\nHmm. So, the key is to model the subsets in a way that allows us to count the number of such multisets.\n\nAn alternative approach: For each subset s, define its \"next\" as the minimal subset t such that t is a child of s. Then, for a chain of subsets, each must be a subset of the next in this next relation.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal representation is to model each subset as a bitmask, but again, with K up to 2e5, that's impractical.\n\nWait, but maybe each subset can be uniquely determined by the elements it contains, and the minimal next subset can be found based on that.\n\nWait, perhaps each subset can be represented as the set of elements it contains, and the next subset must include all x+1 for each x in the current subset.\n\nSo, for a subset s, the next subset t must include all elements x+1 for x in s. Additionally, t can have any other elements beyond that.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternative idea: Think recursively. For a given chain of length N, the last subset can be any subset t. The previous subset must be a subset s such that s is a child of t. So for each t, the number of chains ending with t is the sum over all s that are children of t, of the number of chains of length N-1 ending with s.\n\nThis suggests a dynamic programming approach where dp[t] represents the number of chains of length l ending with t. But again, with K up to 2e5, this is not feasible.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the maximum element in each subset.\n\nLet me think: for a subset s, let m be the maximum element in s. Then, s must contain all elements from 1 to m.\n\nBecause, suppose m is in s. Then, for s to be a child of some t, t must have m+1. Similarly, if s has m, then any set that is a parent of s must include m+1.\n\nWait, but this is not necessarily true. For example, s could be {2}, and t could be {3}, making s a child of t. Here, m=2 in s, and t has 3.\n\nBut in s, m is 2, and s has 2. So s is a child of t if t includes 3. So yes, any subset s with maximum m must be followed by a subset that includes m+1.\n\nWait, but the next subset can have a maximum larger than m+1.\n\nSo, for any subset s, let m be its maximum. Then, any subset t that is a child of s must include m+1.\n\nMoreover, t can include any other elements, but must include m+1.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model the problem by the maximum element and the presence of certain elements.\n\nWait, perhaps each subset can be represented by the set of elements it contains, but we can model transitions based on the maximum element.\n\nAnother observation: For a subset s, the minimal subset t that is a child of s is t = s ∪ {m+1}, where m is the maximum element of s. However, t can have any other elements as well.\n\nBut again, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem in terms of the maximum element in each subset. For each possible m (from 0 to K), let f(m) be the number of subsets whose maximum element is m. Then, for each m, the next subset in the chain must have a maximum element of at least m+1.\n\nWait, no. Because if a subset s has maximum m, then any subset t that is a child of s must include m+1. So the maximum of t must be >= m+1.\n\nSo, for the chain, each step must increase the maximum by at least 1.\n\nSo, the chain of maximums must be strictly increasing by at least 1 each time.\n\nWait, that's an important insight. Because each step's maximum must be at least one more than the previous.\n\nSo, the maximum elements in the chain must form a sequence where each is at least 1 more than the previous.\n\nSo, for a chain of length N, the maximum elements must be a sequence m_1, m_2, ..., m_N where m_i < m_{i+1} for all i.\n\nWait, no. Because the maximum can jump by more than one. For example, if m_1 is 1, m_2 can be 3, as long as the subsets are compatible.\n\nWait, but in that case, the subset for m_2 must include 2 (since it's a child of the subset with m_1=1). So, the maximum of m_2 is 3, but it must include 2.\n\nSo, the maximum can't skip any numbers in the chain.\n\nWait, no. Because for a chain s_1 → s_2 → ... → s_N, each s_i must be a child of s_{i+1}.\n\nSo, s_i must include all x where x is in s_i. So, for s_1, any x in s_1 must be in s_2 + 1, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum elements in the chain must form a non-decreasing sequence where each step increases by at least 1.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the chain of subsets s_1, s_2, ..., s_N in order, where each s_i is a child of s_{i+1}.\n\nEach s_i is a subset of s_{i+1}'s required elements.\n\nWait, for s_i to be a child of s_{i+1}, for every x in s_i, x+1 must be in s_{i+1}.\n\nSo, s_i must be a subset of {x | x <= m} for some m, and s_{i+1} must include all x+1 in s_i, plus possibly others.\n\nSo, the maximum of s_i can be m, and the maximum of s_{i+1} can be any n >= m+1.\n\nBut s_{i+1} must include m+1.\n\nSo, the maximum can jump by any amount as long as it's at least m+1.\n\nSo, the maximums can form a non-decreasing sequence where each term is >= the previous + 1.\n\nSo, for example, m_1, m_2, ..., m_N must satisfy m_i < m_{i+1} for all i.\n\nBecause m_{i+1} >= m_i +1.\n\nSo, the maximums form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nThis is a crucial observation.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nCount the number of multisets of N subsets, each subset being a subset of {1,...,K}, such that the maximum elements in the subsets form a strictly increasing sequence.\n\nMoreover, each subset in the multiset must be compatible with the next in the sequence, meaning that for any two consecutive subsets s and t, if the maximum of s is m, then the maximum of t must be at least m+1, and t must include m+1.\n\nWait, no. Because the maximum of t can be any value >= m+1, but it must include m+1.\n\nSo, the subsets can be any subsets where their maximum is at least one more than the previous subset's maximum, and includes that next maximum.\n\nWait, but how do we model this for multiple steps?\n\nLet me think in terms of the maximums. Suppose we have a sequence of maximums m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N.\n\nFor each such sequence, how many ways are there to choose the subsets s_1, s_2, ..., s_N such that:\n\n- The maximum of s_i is m_i.\n\n- For each i, s_i is a subset of {1, 2, ..., m_i}.\n\n- For each i, s_{i+1} must contain m_i + 1.\n\nAdditionally, since the maximum of s_{i+1} is m_{i+1}, which is >= m_i + 1, and since s_{i+1} must include m_i+1, then the maximum of s_{i+1} is at least m_i+1.\n\nBut since m_{i+1} > m_i, the maximum of s_{i+1} is m_{i+1} >= m_i + 1.\n\nSo, for each such sequence of maximums m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, the number of ways is the product for each i of the number of subsets s_i with maximum exactly m_i, and including all elements from 1 to m_i, but not necessarily all.\n\nWait, no. Because the maximum is m_i, so s_i must include m_i, but can include any subset of {1, ..., m_i} that includes m_i.\n\nWait, no. Because if the maximum is m_i, then s_i can be any subset that includes m_i, and may include any elements less than m_i, but cannot include any elements greater than m_i.\n\nSo, the number of subsets with maximum m_i is 2^{m_i - 1}.\n\nBecause for each element from 1 to m_i-1, we can choose whether to include it or not. The m_i must be included.\n\nSo, for each m_i, the number of subsets is 2^{m_i - 1}.\n\nBut wait, when m_i is zero? No, because the subsets are non-empty in some cases, but in our problem, subsets can be empty.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the maximum of an empty subset is zero. Because the maximum of an empty set is undefined. Hmm, perhaps we need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, for the empty set, the maximum is zero. So, for m=0, the number of subsets is 1 (only the empty set).\n\nFor m >=1, the number of subsets with maximum exactly m is 2^{m-1}.\n\nSo, the number of subsets for a given m is:\n\nif m == 0: 1\n\nelse: 2^{m-1}\n\nSo, for each i, the number of choices for s_i is 2^{m_i-1}, provided that m_i >= m_{i-1} +1.\n\nSo, for a given sequence of m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N, the total number of subsets is the product of 2^{m_i - 1} for each i.\n\nBut how many such sequences are there?\n\nWe need to count the number of sequences m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N where 0 <= m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N <= K.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible m_N is K, since the subsets can't have elements larger than K.\n\nSo, the number of such sequences is equal to the number of ways to choose N distinct integers from 0 to K, in increasing order.\n\nWhich is C(K+1, N). Because we can include 0 as a possible m_i.\n\nWait, but wait: the maximum m can be K, so the number of possible m_i's is K+1 (from 0 to K). Choosing N distinct elements in order is C(K+1, N).\n\nSo, for each such sequence, the number of ways is the product of 2^{m_i -1}.\n\nThus, the total number of arrays is the sum over all possible sequences of m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N of the product of 2^{m_i -1}.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing this sum.\n\nNow, let's model this sum mathematically.\n\nLet’s denote the sum as S.\n\nWe can express S as the sum over all possible m_1, m_2, ..., m_N where 0 ≤ m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N ≤ K, and multiply for each m_i the term 2^{m_i-1}.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for large K and N?\n\nWe can model this as a combinatorial problem. Let's think of the exponents.\n\nEach m_i contributes an exponent of m_i - 1, so the product is 2^{(m_1 -1) + (m_2 -1) + ... + (m_N -1)} }.\n\nWhich is equal to 2^{(m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_N) - N}.\n\nSo, the sum S can be written as 2^{-N} multiplied by the sum over all sequences m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N of 2^{m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_N}.\n\nSo, S = (1/2^N) * sum_{m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_N} 2^{sum(m_i)}.\n\nHmm. Now, how to compute this sum.\n\nLet’s change variables: let x_i = m_i, and x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N. Then, the sum is over all combinations of x_i in [0, K], sorted in increasing order.\n\nWe can model this as a generating function. For each x_i, we have a weight of 2^x_i, and the generating function for each x is the sum over all possible x_i, with the constraint that x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N.\n\nThe coefficient of x^t in the generating function would give the sum of the products of 2^{x_i} for all sequences where the sum is t.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the sum can be represented as the product of polynomials for each position.\n\nWait, for each x, the weight is 2^x. So, the sum over all sequences is the sum over all x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N of product_{i=1 to N} 2^{x_i}.\n\nThis is equivalent to the product (1 + 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^K) choose something, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nThe sum is equal to the product for each position i, the sum of 2^{x_i} for x_i >= x_{i-1} +1.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum can be expressed as the product of (sum_{x} 2^x) ) for each position, but ensuring that x_i < x_j for i<j. Wait, no, because the positions are ordered.\n\nWait, the sum can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N} (2^{x_1} * 2^{x_2} * ... * 2^{x_N}) )\n\n= sum_{x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N} 2^{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_N}\n\n= sum_{x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N} 2^{sum x_i}\n\nSo, how can we compute this sum?\n\nThis is equivalent to the sum over all possible combinations of x_1, x_2, ..., x_N where x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N, and each x_i can be from 0 to K.\n\nWe can model this as follows: the sum is equal to the product (for each position) of the sum of 2^{x} for x >= current position.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this with generating functions.\n\nLet’s think about the generating function for selecting x_1, x_2, ..., x_N in increasing order.\n\nThe generating function is the coefficient of y^N in the product (sum_{x=0}^K 2^x * y^{x})^something.\n\nWait, no. Alternatively, the generating function for the sum over all sequences x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_N is the coefficient of y^N in the expansion of the product (1 + y + y^2 + ... + y^k)^n, but that doesn’t directly help.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think recursively. Let’s denote f(n, m) as the sum of the products for choosing n elements, where the last element is m.\n\nThen, the recurrence is:\n\nf(n, m) = sum_{t=0}^{m-1} f(n-1, t) * 2^m\n\nBecause for the nth element, we can choose any t < m, and multiply by 2^m.\n\nThe base case is f(1, m) = 2^m for m from 0 to K.\n\nSo, the total sum is sum_{m=0}^K f(N, m).\n\nBut for N and K up to 2e5, computing this with a straightforward DP is O(N*K), which is 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo, we need a mathematical formula to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet’s see if we can find a closed-form expression for f(n, m).\n\nLet’s expand the recurrence:\n\nf(n, m) = 2^m * (f(n-1, 0) + f(n-1, 1) + ... + f(n-1, m-1))\n\nLet’s denote S(n-1) = sum_{t=0}^{K} f(n-1, t)\n\nThen, f(n, m) = 2^m * (S(n-1) - sum_{t=m}^{K} f(n-1, t)) )\n\nWait, no. Because the sum t < m is sum_{t=0}^{m-1} f(n-1, t) = S(n-1) - sum_{t=m}^K f(n-1, t).\n\nSo, f(n, m) = 2^m * (S(n-1) - sum_{t=m}^K f(n-1, t)) )\n\nBut this still seems difficult to model.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a pattern or generating function approach.\n\nLet’s consider the generating function for f(n, m). Let G_n(x) = sum_{m=0}^K f(n, m) x^m.\n\nFrom the recurrence, f(n, m) = 2^m sum_{t=0}^{m-1} f(n-1, t).\n\nSo, sum_{m=0}^K f(n, m) x^m = sum_{m=0}^K [sum_{t=0}^{m-1} f(n-1, t)] 2^m x^m.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a convolution.\n\nWait, let's rewrite f(n, m) as:\n\nf(n, m) = 2^m * sum_{t=0}^{m-1} f(n-1, t)\n\nSo, G_n(x) = sum_{m=0}^K f(n, m) x^m = sum_{m=0}^K [sum_{t=0}^{m-1} f(n-1, t)] 2^m x^m.\n\nWe can split this into terms where m >= 1:\n\nG_n(x) = sum_{m=1}^K [sum_{t=0}^{m-1} f(n-1, t)] (2x)^m.\n\nNote that sum_{t=0}^{m-1} f(n-1, t) is the prefix sum of f(n-1, t) up to m-1.\n\nLet’s denote P(n-1, m) = sum_{t=0}^m f(n-1, t).\n\nThen, sum_{t=0}^{m-1} f(n-1, t) = P(n-1, m-1).\n\nSo, G_n(x) = sum_{m=1}^K P(n-1, m-1) (2x)^m.\n\nBut P(n-1, m-1) is the prefix sum up to m-1.\n\nSo, G_n(x) = 2x * sum_{m=1}^K P(n-1, m-1) (2x)^{m-1} }\n\nLet’s change variable: let k = m-1. So,\n\nG_n(x) = 2x * sum_{k=0}^{K-1} P(n-1, k) (2x)^k.\n\nBut sum_{k=0}^{K-1} P(n-1, k) (2x)^k is equal to sum_{k=0}^{K-1} [sum_{t=0}^k f(n-1, t)] (2x)^k.\n\nThis can be rewritten as sum_{t=0}^K f(n-1, t) sum_{k=t}^{K-1} (2x)^k.\n\nBecause for each t, f(n-1, t) appears in P(n-1, k) for all k >= t.\n\nSo,\n\nsum_{k=0}^{K-1} P(n-1, k) (2x)^k = sum_{t=0}^K f(n-1, t) sum_{k=t}^{K-1} (2x)^k.\n\nThe inner sum is a geometric series:\n\nsum_{k=t}^{K-1} (2x)^k = (2x)^t * (1 - (2x)^{K - t}) / (1 - 2x).\n\nAssuming 2x != 1.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nsum_{k=0}^{K-1} P(n-1, k) (2x)^k = sum_{t=0}^K f(n-1, t) * (2x)^t * (1 - (2x)^{K-t}) / (1 - 2x).\n\nThus,\n\nG_n(x) = 2x * [ sum_{t=0}^K f(n-1, t) * (2x)^t * (1 - (2x)^{K-t}) ) ] / (1 - 2x).\n\nBut sum_{t=0}^K f(n-1, t) is S(n-1), which is the sum of f(n-1, t",
