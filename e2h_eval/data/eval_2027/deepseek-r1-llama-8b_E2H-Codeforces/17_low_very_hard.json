He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the 2n-2 given strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of a secret string s of length n. The output should be a string where each character is 'P' if the corresponding input string is a prefix, 'S' if it's a suffix. And importantly, the number of 'P's and 'S's must be equal, but wait, no—the note says that in the example, the answer has equal counts. But looking back, the problem statement says: \"the number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'.\" So yes, exactly half should be P and half S. Because 2n-2 is even? Well, n is at least 2, so 2n-2 is at least 2, which is even when n=2 (since 2*2-2=2), but for n=3, 4 strings, which is even as well. Wait, 2n-2 for n=2 is 2, which is even. For n=3, 4, which is even. So yes, all cases will have an even number of strings, so their counts can be split equally.\n\nSo the task is to assign each of the 2n-2 strings as either prefix or suffix such that exactly half are P and half S, and for some possible s, the given strings are exactly all the prefixes and suffixes (each from lengths 1 to n-1) of s.\n\nBut how do we approach this?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the properties that the possible s must satisfy.\n\nFirst, for each possible s, the set of all its proper prefixes (lengths 1 to n-1) and the set of all its proper suffixes (lengths 1 to n-1) must form exactly the given list of strings.\n\nWait, but Ivan told us all the prefixes and suffixes, but not which are which. So our job is to partition the 2n-2 strings into two groups: those that are prefixes and those that are suffixes. And for the correct s, the prefixes and suffixes must match exactly.\n\nSo how can we find s, or determine the correct assignment of P and S?\n\nAnother thought: the correct s must have certain properties based on the given strings.\n\nFor example, the shortest prefix (length 1) must be a single character. Similarly for the shortest suffix.\n\nWait, but the given strings include all possible prefixes and suffixes of s. So for the length 1 strings, there are exactly two strings, one being a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nWait, no. Because for s of length n, the number of prefixes of length 1 is just one—each character in the first position. But according to the input, there are exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for length 1, there are two strings, which must be the two possible candidates for the first character of s. But since s has only one first character, that suggests that one of the two is a prefix (so it's the actual first character), and the other is a suffix (so it's the last character).\n\nSimilarly, for the length n-1, there are two strings: one is the prefix (s[0..n-2]) and the other is the suffix (s[1..n-1]).\n\nSo maybe the approach is to find all possible candidates for s, check for each candidate whether the given strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of that s, and then assign accordingly.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 100, so trying all possibilities might be computationally expensive. However, for n=100, the possible s can have 26^100 possibilities, which is way too big. So that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: We need to find a way to reconstruct s based on the given strings.\n\nLet's think about the structure of s. Let's denote s as a string of length n: s = s_1 s_2 ... s_n.\n\nFor each possible k from 1 to n-1, the prefix of length k is s_1...s_k, and the suffix of length k is s_{k+1 - (k)} ... s_n. Wait, no: the suffix of length k is the last k characters. So for k=1, it's s_n; for k=2, s_{n-1} s_n; etc.\n\nSo for each k, there are two strings: one is the prefix of length k, and the other is the suffix of length k.\n\nNow, the key observation is that for any k, the suffix of length k must be a substring that can be formed by appending to the prefix of length k.\n\nWait, more precisely: the suffix",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or a suffix of the secret string `s` of length `n`. The output should be a string where each character is 'P' if the corresponding input string is a prefix, and 'S' if it is a suffix.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Overlaps**: For each possible prefix of length `k`, check if there exists a corresponding suffix of the same length that can be formed by extending the prefix.

We reconstruct `s` by ensuring that each prefix can be extended to form a valid suffix. If the constructed string is consistent with all given inputs, we then assign 'P' or 'S' to each string based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of `s`. The result ensures that exactly half of the strings are marked as prefixes and the other half as suffixes.",
