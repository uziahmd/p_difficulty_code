She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has several tabs open in her browser and wants to close some of them. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nShe starts with n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can perform one of two actions:\n1. Move the cursor left or right. But she can't move beyond the currently available tabs because some may already be closed.\n2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position.\n\nHmm, right. So moving the cursor is an action that takes a second each, and closing also takes a second.\n\nThe challenge is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize the total time.\n\nLet's think about the steps she needs to take:\n\nFirst, she might need to move the cursor to certain positions to perform the close operations. Then, she performs the close, which immediately removes the necessary tabs. After that, she might need to move again if more tabs are to be closed.\n\nWait, but after closing, the available tabs change. So, for example, if she closes to the left of the cursor, the next moves can't go beyond the new left boundary (a), which would have been updated.\n\nSo, the plan is to model all possible paths and find the one that takes the least time.\n\nBut since n is up to 100, perhaps a BFS approach is feasible, as the state space isn't too big.\n\nWhat defines a state here?\n\nA state can be represented by:\n- The current position of the cursor.\n- The current left boundary (a) and right boundary (b). But wait, a and b are determined by the currently open tabs. So, initially, a=1, b=n. When you close some tabs, a and b adjust accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the state can be just the current cursor position, along with the current a and b, but that might complicate things.\n\nWait, but a and b are not variables we can track independently because they depend on which tabs are closed. So maybe it's better to model the state based on the current position and the remaining tabs.\n\nBut that could get complicated quickly.\n\nAnother approach: the problem can be broken down into the actions needed to close the required tabs. Let's see:\n\nWe need to close all tabs before l and all tabs after r.\n\nSo, the initial state is that all tabs are open. We need to close those less than l and greater than r.\n\nHow to do this efficiently.\n\nLet's think about the process:\n\n1. If there are tabs to the left of l (i.e., l > 1), she needs to close them. To do that, she can move the cursor to position l, then close the tabs to the left.\n\nSimilarly, if there are tabs to the right of r (i.e., r < n), she needs to close them. She can move the cursor to position r, then close the tabs to the right.\n\nBut she might do these in any order. For example, she might first close the left, then the right, or vice versa. Or she might close one side first, then move to the other side, then close.\n\nWait, but after closing, the available tabs change. So, for example, if she closes the right first, the new right boundary becomes r, so moving back to close the left would require moving from pos to l, but the left boundary might now be higher.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen she closes to the left of the cursor, the new a becomes the current position. Similarly, closing to the right sets the new b.\n\nFor example, suppose she is at position x, and she closes left. Then, the new a is x, so any tab before x is closed. Similarly, closing right makes the new b x.\n\nSo, after each close operation, the boundaries a and b are updated.\n\nThis suggests that the order in which she closes left and right could affect the movement steps.\n\nSo, let's outline possible scenarios:\n\nCase 1: No tabs to close on either side. Then, she doesn't need to do anything. Time is zero.\n\nCase 2: Only left tabs to close. So, she needs to move to l, then close left.\n\nCase 3: Only right tabs to close. She moves to r, then close right.\n\nCase 4: Both left and right tabs to close.\n\nIn this case, she can choose to close left first or right first.\n\nSo, for each of these options, calculate the time and choose the minimum.\n\nSo, the problem can be broken down into considering all possible orders of closing left and right.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's consider the steps involved when both left and right need to be closed.\n\nOption A: Close left first, then close right.\n\nSteps:\n- Move to l: cost is |pos - l| seconds.\n- Close left: +1 sec.\n- Now, the left boundary is l.\n- Then, move to r: cost is |l - r| seconds.\n- Close right: +1 sec.\nTotal: |pos-l| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nOption B: Close right first, then close left.\n\nSteps:\n- Move to r: |pos - r| seconds.\n- Close right: +1.\n- Now, right boundary is r.\n- Move to l: |r - l| seconds.\n- Close left: +1.\nTotal: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nCompare the two options and choose the one with minimal total steps.\n\nWait, but what about the movement steps? Because after closing one side, the movement to the other side is within the new a and b.\n\nWait, no. After closing, the a and b change. So, for example, after closing right, the new b is r. So, moving from r to l is possible because l is >= a (which was 1 before, but after closing right, a remains 1 unless the left is also closed. Wait no—closing right doesn't affect a. Closing left affects a.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the a and b as the current min and max of open tabs.\n\nInitially, a=1, b=n.\n\nWhen she closes to the left of the cursor, the new a is the current position. Similarly, closing to the right sets the new b.\n\nSo, for option A:\n\nAfter closing left, a becomes l. So, the available tabs are from l to b (n), but wait, no—because she only closed the left of l.\n\nWait, wait: when she is at position x and closes left, she closes all tabs before x. So, a becomes x.\n\nSimilarly, closing right at x closes all tabs after x, so b becomes x.\n\nSo, in the first step of option A: moving to l, then closing left.\n\nNow, a becomes l.\n\nSo, the available tabs are from l to b (which was n, but after closing right, it might have changed).\n\nWait, no. The right hasn't been closed yet. So after closing left, the a is l, and the b is still n.\n\nThen, she moves to r, which is within [l, n], so movement steps are r - l.\n\nThen, she closes right, which sets b to r.\n\nSo, the movement is possible.\n\nIn option B: she closes right first.\n\nShe moves to r, which is from pos to r, then closes right, setting b to r.\n\nThen, she needs to move to l, which is from r to l. The distance is r - l.\n\nThen, she closes left, setting a to l.\n\nSo, the movement steps are (r - l) in both cases.\n\nSo, the total steps for option A: |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - l| + r - l + 2.\n\nSimilarly, option B: |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - r| + r - l + 2.\n\nWhich of these is better depends on whether pos is closer to l or to r.\n\nSo, in general, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the minimal steps would be the minimum of:\n\nOption A: (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2.\n\nOption B: (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l) + 2.\n\nBut wait, another possibility is that she might need to move from pos to l, close left, then move to r, close right. Or the other way around.\n\nBut according to our earlier analysis, the steps are as above.\n\nSo, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the minimal steps are the minimum between option A and option B.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps there's another option where she can close one side, move to the other, then close.\n\nWait, but the movement after closing depends on the new a and b.\n\nWait, after closing left, a becomes l, so she can't move beyond that. So, if she needs to close the right, she must move within [l, r], assuming r is in the current [a, b], which is now [l, n]. So, yes, moving to r is possible.\n\nSo, the initial plan holds.\n\nNow, let's think about the case when only left or only right needs to be closed.\n\nIf only left needs to be closed, then the steps are:\n\nMove to l: steps are |pos - l|.\n\nClose left: 1 step.\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if only right needs to be closed, steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe algorithm can be structured as follows:\n\n1. Check if l > 1: if so, left needs to be closed.\n\n   Check if r < n: if so, right needs to be closed.\n\n2. Based on which sides need to be closed, compute the steps accordingly.\n\nSo, let's outline the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: No tabs to close. Output 0.\n\nCase 2: Only left to close.\n\n   Steps: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase 3: Only right to close.\n\n   Steps: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase 4: Both left and right to close.\n\n   Compute option A and option B, then take the minimum.\n\nSo, the code can be structured to handle these cases.\n\nWait, but let's test with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input: 6 3 2 4.\n\nSo, n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nLeft needs to be closed (since 2>1), right also needs to be closed (since 4<6).\n\nSo, option A: move to 2 (steps 1), close left (1), then move to 4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nOption B: move to 4 (1 step), close right (1), then move to 2 (2 steps), close left (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5. So same.\n\nSo, output is 5.\n\nSecond example: 6 3 1 3.\n\nSo, l=1, so no left to close. r=3, but 3 <6, so right needs to be closed.\n\nSo, steps are |3-3| +1 = 0+1=1.\n\nThird example:5 2 1 5.\n\nNo tabs to close, so output 0.\n\nYes, matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: say, n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nLeft needs to be closed (3>1). Right also needs to be closed (5<7).\n\nOption A: move from 4 to 3 (1 step), close left (1). Then move from 3 to 5 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nOption B: move to 5 (1 step), close right (1). Then move to 3 (2 steps), close left (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSame.\n\nAnother test case: n=10, pos=5, l=4, r=6.\n\nLeft needs to be closed, right as well.\n\nOption A: move from 5 to4 (1), close left (1). Move to6 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nOption B: move to6 (1), close right (1). Move to4 (2 steps), close left (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSame.\n\nWhat if pos is not between l and r?\n\nWait, like n=10, pos=2, l=3, r=7.\n\nWait, but l=3 is greater than pos=2. So, she needs to close the left (since 3>1, but wait, l=3 is the left end of the desired segment. So, she needs to close all tabs before 3, including 1 and 2.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nMove from 2 to3 (1), close left (1). Then, move to7 (4 steps), close right (1). Total 1+1+4+1=7.\n\nAlternatively, could she close the right first?\n\nShe needs to close right because r=7 <n=10.\n\nBut she's at 2. So, to close right, she needs to move to7, then close.\n\nThat's 5 steps (2->3,3->4,4->5,5->6,6->7) plus 1 for closing. Then, she's at7, a is3, b is10.\n\nThen, she needs to close left: move from7 to3 (4 steps), close left (1). Total 5+1+4+1=11. Which is worse.\n\nSo, the best is to close left first, then right.\n\nSo, the code correctly chooses the minimal option.\n\nAnother example: n=10, pos=8, l=5, r=7.\n\nSo, left needs to be closed (5>1), right as well (7<10).\n\nOption A: move to5 (3 steps), close left (1). Then move to7 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 3+1+2+1=7.\n\nOption B: move to7 (1 step), close right (1). Then move to5 (2 steps), close left (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSo, option B is better.\n\nBecause pos is 8, which is closer to7 than to5.\n\nSo, the code should pick the minimal of the two options.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the plan is to implement this logic.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l >1: left needs to be closed.\n\nCheck if r <n: right needs to be closed.\n\nIf neither, output 0.\n\nElse, if only left is needed: steps = |pos - l| + 1.\n\nElse if only right is needed: steps = |pos - r| + 1.\n\nElse (both needed):\n\nCompute optionA = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nCompute optionB = |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nTake the minimum of optionA and optionB.\n\nWait, but why is that?\n\nBecause in optionA, after moving to l and closing left, the distance to r is (r-l), since a is now l and b is n.\n\nIn optionB, after moving to r and closing right, the distance to l is (r-l), since a is 1, but after closing right, b is r. So, moving from r to l is r - l steps.\n\nWait, no: if you close right first, the a is still 1, but after closing right, the new b is r. So, when moving from r to l, the movement is allowed because l >= a (which is 1). So, the movement steps are (r - l).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as such.\n\nSo, let's write the code.\n\nRead the input line as four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    # compute optionA and optionB\n\n    optionA = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    optionB = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    print(min(optionA, optionB))\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n\nelse: # right_needed\n\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where both left and right are needed, is the movement from l to r (or r to l) always (r-l) steps?\n\nYes, because l <= r, and after closing left, a is l, so moving to r is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, after closing right, b is r, and moving to l is allowed.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: ['6 3 2 4']\n\nleft_needed: 2>1 → True.\n\nright_needed:4<6→ True.\n\noptionA: |3-2|=1; r-l=2. 1+2+2=5.\n\noptionB: |3-4|=1; 2. 1+2+2=5.\n\nmin is 5.\n\nSample 2: ['6 3 1 3']\n\nleft_needed:1>1? No.\n\nright_needed:3<6→ Yes.\n\nso steps: |3-3| +1 →0+1=1.\n\nSample3: ['5 2 1 5'] → left and right not needed. output 0.\n\nAnother test: n=10, pos=8, l=5, r=7.\n\nleft and right needed.\n\noptionA: |8-5|=3; r-l=2. 3+2+2=7.\n\noptionB: |8-7|=1; 2. 1+2+2=5.\n\nSo, min is 5.\n\nSo, code will output 5.\n\nAnother test: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\noptionA: |4-3|=1; 2 →1+2+2=5.\n\noptionB: |4-5|=1; 2 →1+2+2=5. min is 5.\n\nAnother test: pos is 2, l=3, r=7, n=10.\n\nleft_needed:3>1→yes.\n\nright_needed:7<10→yes.\n\noptionA: |2-3|=1 →1 + (7-3)=4 →1+4=5, plus 2 → total 7.\n\noptionB: |2-7|=5 →5 +4=9, plus2 →11. So, optionA is better.\n\nThus, code will output 7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother edge case: l = r. So, no tabs to close on either side except possibly if l is not 1 and r is not n.\n\nWait, no. For example, l=3, r=3, n=5.\n\nThen, she needs to close tabs 1 and 2 (if 3>1) and tabs 4,5 (if 3<5).\n\nSo, the code correctly identifies left and right needed.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and closures to minimize the total time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need to Close Tabs**: Determine if tabs need to be closed to the left of `l` (i.e., if `l > 1`) or to the right of `r` (i.e., if `r < n`).\n2. **Handle Special Cases**: If no tabs need to be closed, the result is 0. If only left or right tabs need to be closed, calculate the steps accordingly.\n3. **Calculate Optimal Steps for Both Sides**: When both left and right tabs need to be closed, consider two options:\n   - Close left first, then move to the right and close right.\n   - Close right first, then move to the left and close left.\n   Compute the total steps for both options and choose the minimum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n    print(0)\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n    optionA = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n    optionB = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n    print(min(optionA, optionB))\nelif left_needed:\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\nelse:\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Needs**: Check if tabs need closing on either side of the segment [l, r].\n- **No Closures Needed**: If both left and right are within the segment, output 0.\n- **Single Side Closure**: If only left or right tabs need closing, compute the steps to move to the required position and close.\n- **Both Sides Closure**: For both sides, compute the steps for both possible orders of closing (left first or right first) and choose the minimum.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimal steps required by considering all possible scenarios and choosing the optimal one.",
