Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But he can't find some, so we need to determine the minimal number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, let me break it down. The input gives us n, the number of found cards, and x, the maximum absolute value each card can have. Then there's a list of n integers which are the numbers on the found cards. We need to compute the minimum number of additional cards required so that the total sum is zero.\n\nWait, but wait: initially, Vanya had an infinite number of cards with each integer from -x to x. So when he loses some, the sum of the found ones plus the sum of the missing ones must be zero. Oh no, wait—no, the problem says Natasha hid all the cards, but Vanya found n of them. So the sum of the found cards is S. He needs the sum of all found plus the sum of the missing ones to be zero? Or does he need the sum of the found plus the sum of the missing to be zero?\n\nWait, no. The initial setup is that he has infinitely many cards. Then Natasha hid all of them, so now Vanya only has n found cards. But he can look for more. The question is: what is the minimal number of cards he needs to find (from the possible ones) so that the sum of all found cards (including these new ones) equals zero.\n\nSo the sum of the existing found cards plus the sum of the new found cards must be zero.\n\nAlternatively, the problem is: given S as the sum of the current found cards, find the smallest k such that there exists a subset of k numbers (each between -x and x) whose sum is equal to -S. And then, the minimal k is the answer.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. We need to find the minimal number of integers (each between -x and x) whose sum is -S. The goal is to find the smallest possible k.\n\nWait, but the sum of the new cards must be exactly -S. So the problem reduces to: find the smallest k where -S can be expressed as the sum of k numbers, each in [-x, x].\n\nSo the task is to compute the minimal k such that the target (-S) can be achieved with k terms, each term at most x in absolute value.\n\nSo how do we calculate this minimal k?\n\nLet's think about the target T = -S.\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of terms (k) such that T can be written as the sum of k terms, each of which is in [-x, x]. So each term can contribute at most x towards the target (if positive) or subtract at most x (if negative).\n\nWait, but the sign doesn't matter because each term can be positive or negative. So for the target T, the minimal k is determined by how much we can cover T with the maximum possible per step.\n\nI remember a similar problem where you have to reach a certain sum with the least number of steps, each step adding up to at most x. So the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| / x, but perhaps there are cases where it's not possible. Wait, but in our case, since the terms can be any combination of positive and negative, maybe it's always possible.\n\nWait, no. Because each term can contribute up to x towards the target. For example, if the target is T=5 and x=3, then the minimal k is 2: 3+2. But wait, but 2 is less than x. So 3 + 2 is allowed.\n\nWait, but 2 is within the allowed range. So in general, for a target T, the minimal k is ceil(abs(T)/x). Because each step can contribute at most x towards the target.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let's think again. Suppose T is 4 and x is 3. Then 3+1 is two steps, but 1 is allowed. So yes, k is 2.\n\nIf T is 5 and x is 3, then 3+2 is two steps, but 2 is allowed. So k is 2.\n\nWait, but wait: 5 can also be achieved with 3 + 1 +1: three steps. So the minimal is two.\n\nSo yeah, the minimal k is the minimal number of steps where each step contributes at most x towards the target. So the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| divided by x.\n\nBut wait, what about if T is zero? Then k is zero, since we don't need any cards.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S. If T is zero, return 0.\n3. Otherwise, compute the minimal k as the ceiling of |T| / x.\n\nWait, but wait another moment. What if T is something like 7 and x is 3. Then 3+4 is not allowed because 4 exceeds x. So you have to use 3 + 3 +1, which is 3 steps. Alternatively, 3*3 is 9, which is more than 7. Wait, no, that's not right. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The target is T, and each term can be at most x. So the minimal number of terms is the minimal k where k >= |T| / x. Because each term can contribute at most x towards the target. So if |T| is d, then each term can contribute up to x, so the minimal k is the smallest integer >= d/x.\n\nFor example:\n\nd=5, x=3 → 5/3=1.666..., so k=2.\n\nd=6, x=3 → 6/3=2 → k=2.\n\nd=7, x=3 → 7/3≈2.333 → k=3.\n\nBecause 3 *3 =9 is larger than 7, but 3+3+1=7, which requires 3 steps.\n\nWait, but 3+3+1 is 3 terms, which is 3 steps. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the formula is k = ceil(d / x), where d is the absolute value of T.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCompute S = sum of found cards.\n\nIf S is zero, then no more cards are needed.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nd = |T|.\n\nk = ceil(d / x).\n\nBut wait, what about when T is positive or negative? Well, because we take the absolute value, it doesn't matter.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to calculating this k.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nSum S = (-1 +1 +2) = 2.\n\nSo T = -2.\n\nd = 2.\n\nx=2.\n\nceil(2/2)=1. So output is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S = (-2)+(-2) = -4.\n\nT =4.\n\nd=4.\n\nx=3.\n\n4/3 is 1.333... → ceil is 2.\n\nWhich is the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: what if S is zero? Then we don't need any cards.\n\nAnother case: S=5, x=3.\n\nd=5, so 5/3=1.666 → ceil is 2.\n\nSo two cards, say 3 and 2 (sum 5, but wait, wait no: the sum is T =5, so the new cards should sum to 5. Wait, no: T is -S. So in this case, S is 5, so T is -5. So the new cards' sum must be -5. So to get -5, we can have two steps: 3*(-2) + (-1)*1 → no, that's not right. Wait, no: each new card can be any integer between -x and x. So for T=-5 and x=3, the minimal k is 2.\n\nWait, but 3 + (-3) is 0. That's not helpful. Wait, no: T is the sum of the new cards. So for T=-5, the new cards' sum must be -5.\n\nHow can we achieve that with minimal steps?\n\nEach step can contribute up to x towards the target. So for T=-5, x=3:\n\nIn each step, we can subtract up to 3. So 3 steps: subtract 3 each time. So 3 * (-3) = -9, which is less than -5. But that's more than necessary.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum can be achieved with two steps: 3 + (-8) is not possible, since each step can't exceed 3 in magnitude. So 3 steps: -3 + (-3) + (-3) = -9, which is too low.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the way to reach T.\n\nWait, T is the sum of the new cards. Each new card can be any integer between -x and x. So the sum is T = sum of k terms, each term a_i, where |a_i| <=x.\n\nSo for T=-5, x=3:\n\nWe can choose two terms: -3 and -2. Sum is -5.\n\nSo k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nAnother example: T=7, x=3.\n\n7 /3 is ~2.333 → ceil is 3.\n\nSo three terms: 3+3+1=7? No, but 1 is allowed. So yes.\n\nSo 3 steps.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of n integers.\n\nCompute S = sum of the list.\n\nIf S is zero: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nd = abs(T).\n\nCompute k = d // x.\n\nIf d % x !=0 → k +=1.\n\nPrint k.\n\nWait, but what about when T is zero?\n\nYes, that's handled.\n\nSo now, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: S=0.\n\nThen T=0. So no cards needed.\n\nCase 2: S=1, x=1.\n\nT=-1.\n\nd=1.\n\nk=1.\n\nCase3: S=10, x=3.\n\nd=10.\n\n10 /3 =3.333 → ceil to 4.\n\nBecause 3*3=9 <10, so need 4 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: S=0, output is 0.\n\nWhat about when T is larger than x, but the sum can't be achieved with minimal k?\n\nWait, no, because we can always adjust the signs.\n\nLike, for T=4, x=3: 3 +1 → two steps.\n\nBut 1 is allowed, so it's okay.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nSo let's implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n and x from the first line.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute S = sum of the list.\n\nIf S ==0: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nT = -S\n\nd = abs(T)\n\nk = d // x\n\nif d %x !=0:\n\n    k +=1\n\nprint(k)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first case:\n\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\nWait, wait, no, the input is given as two separate lines. So the first line is '3 2', second line is '-1 1 2'.\n\nSo in code, after reading the first line, split into n and x.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute sum.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ns = sum(cards)\n\nif s ==0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    t = -s\n\n    d = abs(t)\n\n    k = d //x\n\n    if d %x !=0:\n\n        k +=1\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the outputs are given as ['1', '2'], but the code would output 1 and 2 as integers, but the problem statement says to output a single number. So for each test case, print one number.\n\nSo yes, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nsum is 2 → t = -2 → d=2, x=2 → 2/2=1, so output 1.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nsum is -4 → t=4, x=3 →4//3=1, 4%3=1≠0 →k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card=[0]. sum is 0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, x=5, card=[5]. sum is 5 → t=-5 →d=5 →5/5=1 →k=1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=3, cards=[3,3]. sum is 6 →t=-6 →d=6. 6//3=2 →k=2.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=2, cards=[2,2]. sum 4 → t=-4 →d=4 →4/2=2 →k=2.\n\nBut wait, 4 can be done with two 2's: 2+2=4, but since T is -4, we need two -2's. So yes, two steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",

Thus, \\( T = -S \\).\n3. **Compute the Minimum Number of Cards**: The goal is to find the smallest number \\( k \\) such that \\( T \\) can be expressed as the sum of \\( k \\) integers, each between -x and x. This is equivalent to finding the smallest \\( k \\) where \\( |T| \\) can be divided by \\( x \\) in such a way that the quotient gives the number of steps needed.

The second line reads the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum \\( S \\) of the found cards.\n3. **Target Sum Calculation**: Calculate \\( T \\) as the negative of \\( S \\).\n4. **Determine Steps**: Calculate the minimum number of steps \\( k \\) required to reach the target sum \\( T \\) using the formula \\( k = \\lceil \\frac{|T|}{x} \\rceil \\).
