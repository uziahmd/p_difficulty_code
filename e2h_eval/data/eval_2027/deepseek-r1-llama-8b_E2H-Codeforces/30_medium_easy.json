    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a game where two players, Homer and Marge, take turns picking digits from a number A, which has 2n digits. Each player makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2, which are built by appending the digits they pick each turn. The output should be a string of 'H' and 'M' indicating who picks each digit in order.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is to find the optimal sequence of H and M such that both players make exactly n moves, and the resulting S1 and S2 are as large as possible in total.\n\nWait, but how do we determine what's the best way to split the digits between the two players? Because for each digit, choosing which player takes it affects the overall sum.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since the total prize is S1 + S2, but each digit is added to either S1 or S2, perhaps the optimal strategy is to assign the largest possible digits to the positions that contribute more to the sum.\n\nBut wait, each digit contributes based on its position in the respective player's number. For example, the first digit picked is the most significant in S1 if it's the first move, then the next is the second, etc.\n\nSo the key is to decide for each position (each digit) whether it's better to assign it to S1 or S2 in a way that maximizes the sum.\n\nWait, but each player has exactly n moves. So for each of the 2n digits, we need to assign them to one of the two players, ensuring that each gets exactly n digits.\n\nHmm. So it's similar to partitioning the digits into two groups of size n each, with the goal of maximizing the sum when each group is interpreted as a number.\n\nBut since the order matters because higher digits in earlier positions contribute more, the problem isn't just about selecting which digits go to whom, but also about the order in which they are selected. Oh wait, no—the order is determined by the original sequence of the digits, right? Because each move, the leftmost digit is taken. So the initial order of the digits determines the order in which they are picked. So the problem is not about permuting the digits but about deciding, for each step, whether the current digit is assigned to H or M.\n\nSo the main idea is that for each position i (from 0 to 2n-1), the digit at that position will be part of either S1 or S2. But the assignment depends on the choices made so far, because once a digit is taken, it can't be taken again.\n\nWait, but since the process is sequential—each turn, the leftmost digit is taken—the choice is whether to take it now or leave it for later. But the decision affects which digits are available for future steps.\n\nThis feels like a dynamic programming problem. Because at each step, the state would consist of how many digits each player has already taken, and which digits have been used.\n\nBut with n up to 18, the state space could be manageable. Let me think: for each step k (the number of digits taken so far, which is 0 to 2n), and for each possible count of H's taken so far (h) and M's taken so far (m). Wait, but h can range from 0 to n, m can range from 0 to n, and k = h + m. Hmm, but since the order of taking the digits is fixed (the leftmost at each step), the state needs to include which digits have been taken so far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a DP where the state is (current index, h, m), representing that we've taken h digits for H and m digits for M up to the current index, and the value is the maximum possible sum achievable from that point onwards.\n\nWait, but the sum is the sum of all digits assigned to H in their positions and those assigned to M in theirs. So perhaps the DP can track the current assignment of digits, but that's not feasible due to the size.\n\nWait, maybe another approach: the problem can be transformed into assigning each digit to H or M, with exactly n each, such that the sum of the contributions is maximized.\n\nEach digit's contribution depends on the position it's placed in. For example, the first digit assigned to H contributes d * 10^{n - h}, where h is the number of H digits after it. Similarly for M.\n\nWait, that might not be straightforward. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose we have the digits in order. We need to choose, for each digit, whether it goes to H or M, ensuring that each gets exactly n digits. The goal is to maximize the sum of S1 and S2.\n\nBut S1 is formed by the digits assigned to H, in the order they were picked. Similarly for S2.\n\nWait, but the order in which the digits are picked is the same as their order in A. So, for S1, the digits are the ones assigned to H in the order of their occurrence in A, but only for the times when H chose to take the current digit.\n\nSimilarly for S2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subset of n digits (in their original order) for H, and the remaining n for M, such that when concatenated in the order of A, their sum is maximized.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the selection is done in a way that each digit is considered in order, and the choice of taking it now or later affects the options.\n\nNo, wait. The digits are taken in the order they appear in A. For each position, the player whose turn it is takes the digit. So the decision is, for each step, whether to take the current digit for H or M, but once taken, it's gone.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the players take turns in determining who takes the next digit. So the initial decision is who goes first, but in the problem statement, they can choose any sequence of moves as long as each makes exactly n moves.\n\nWait, wait. No. Each player makes exactly n moves. So the total number of moves is 2n. So the sequence of H and M must be a string of length 2n, with exactly n H's and n M's.\n\nAh! So the entire sequence is a permutation of H and M, with exactly n of each. And the goal is to choose this permutation such that the sum of the numbers S1 and S2 is as large as possible.\n\nBut how do the digits get assigned? For each position in the string, if it's H, then the digit is taken by H, added to his number as the next digit. If it's M, then the digit is taken by M.\n\nWait, but the order of the digits is fixed as per A. So the first character of A is the first digit to be taken, the second is the next, etc., regardless of whether H or M takes it.\n\nSo the problem is: arrange the H and M in a 2n-length string, with exactly n of each, such that for each position i in 0..2n-1, if it's an H, then the digit A[i] is added to S1 as the next digit in S1; similarly for M.\n\nWait, no. Because S1 and S2 are built as sequences of digits. For S1, the first digit taken is the first H in the string, the second is the next H, etc. So the order in which H's occur in the string determines the order of the digits in S1.\n\nFor example, if the string is \"H M H M\", then S1 is [A[0], A[2]], and S2 is [A[1], A[3]].\n\nSo the problem becomes: choose a permutation of H and M of length 2n with exactly n H's and M's, such that when you process each character in order, the sum of the numbers formed by H's and M's is maximized.\n\nSo the key is to find the arrangement of H and M that gives the maximum sum when the digits are processed in order, with each H contributing to S1 and each M to S2.\n\nNow, the question is: how can we model this problem to compute the optimal arrangement?\n\nHmm. One approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem where the state represents:\n\n- Which digits have been processed so far.\n- How many H's and M's have been chosen so far.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 18, the total digits are 36. So the state would need to consider the current position, the number of H's and M's used so far, and perhaps some other information.\n\nWait, but the state doesn't need to know which specific digits have been used, just the count, because the digits are processed in a fixed order. So the state can be (position, h, m), where h is the number of H's used up to that position, m is the number of M's. Then, for each state, the transition is to choose whether to place an H or M at the current position, provided that h < n and m < n.\n\nWait, but in the string, the choices are fixed. So for each position i, the digit is A[i]. When we choose to place H at i, the digit A[i] is added to S1 as the next digit. Similarly for M.\n\nSo the value of the state is the maximum sum we can get starting from position i, given that h H's and m M's have been used so far.\n\nThus, the DP recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i][h][m] = max(\n    dp[i+1][h+1][m] + (value of adding A[i] to S1),\n    dp[i+1][h][m+1] + (value of adding A[i] to S2)\n)\n\nBut wait, the value added depends on the position within S1 or S2. Because the first digit taken by H is the most significant, the second is next, etc.\n\nSo for S1, the current digit is added as the (h+1)th digit. Similarly for S2, it's the (m+1)th digit.\n\nSo the contribution of A[i] to the sum is:\n\nif we choose H: A[i] * 10^{k}, where k is the number of digits remaining in S1 after this.\n\nSimilarly for M: A[i] * 10^{l}, where l is the number of digits remaining in S2 after this.\n\nWait, but that's complicated. Because the number of digits remaining in S1 depends on how many H's are chosen after the current position.\n\nAlternatively, for each step, when we choose to take the current digit as H, it's the (h_so_far + 1)th digit in S1. So the value contributed is A[i] multiplied by 10^{(n - h_so_far - 1)}.\n\nBecause S1 has n digits, and each new digit is added to the end. So the first digit (h=0) is multiplied by 10^(n-1), the second by 10^(n-2), etc.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nSo for a state (i, h, m), the contribution of choosing H is A[i] * 10^{n - h - 1}, plus the result of the next state. Similarly, for M, it's A[i] * 10^{n - m - 1} plus the next state.\n\nYes, that seems manageable.\n\nSo the DP approach is as follows:\n\n- The state is (current position, h, m), where h is the number of H's chosen so far, and m is the number of M's.\n\n- For each state, we can choose to assign H or M to the current position, provided that h < n and m < n.\n\n- The value of the state is the maximum sum achievable from this point onward.\n\n- The base case is when all positions are processed: dp[2n][n][n] = 0.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Precompute the powers of 10 for each possible position in S1 and S2.\n\n   For S1, the power is 10^{n - h - 1}, where h is the number of H's chosen before this step.\n\n   Similarly for S2, it's 10^{n - m - 1}.\n\n2. Initialize a DP table of size (2n+1) x (n+1) x (n+1), filled with -infinity except for the base case.\n\n3. Iterate over each position from 0 to 2n-1, and for each possible (h, m) state, compute the maximum sum by choosing H or M.\n\n4. Once the DP is filled, the answer is the path that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nBut wait, how do we reconstruct the path? Because we need to know which choices (H or M) were made at each step to reach the maximum sum.\n\nSo we'll need to track not just the maximum sum, but also the choices made. Or, alternatively, during the DP, we can store for each state the best choice (H or M) and the resulting sum.\n\nBut storing the path for each state may be memory-intensive. Alternatively, we can perform a BFS-like approach, updating the states and keeping track of the parent pointers.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to compute the DP table in a bottom-up manner and then backtrack from the final state to reconstruct the path.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, precompute the 10^x values. For S1, the exponent starts at (n-1) and decreases by 1 each time a new H is chosen. For S2, it's similar.\n\nWe can create a memoization table, say dp[i][h][m], which stores the maximum sum achievable from position i onwards, given that h H's and m M's have been used so far.\n\nThe initial state is dp[0][0][0], and we want to compute dp[0][0][0].\n\nWait, no. Because the initial state is at position 0, with h=0 and m=0. So the transitions start from there.\n\nSo the DP is built as follows:\n\nFor each position i from 0 to 2n-1:\n\n   For each possible h from 0 to min(n, i+1):\n\n      For each possible m from 0 to min(n, i+1 - h):\n\n          if h + m == i:\n\n              // Not sure about the exact constraints here.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, h, m such that h + m == i, and h <=n, m <=n.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to iterate is to process each position i in order, and for each possible h and m that sum up to i.\n\nWait, perhaps a triple loop: for i in 0..2n-1:\n\n   for h in 0..n:\n\n       for m in 0..min(n, i - h):\n\n           if h + m == i:\n\n               // compute possible transitions.\n\nBut this could be computationally expensive, especially for n=18, leading to 2n=36, and h and m up to 18 each. So the total states are 36 * 19 * 19 ≈ 13,684. That's manageable.\n\nSo for each state (i, h, m), we can compute the maximum sum by choosing to place H or M.\n\nIf we choose H, then the next state is (i+1, h+1, m), and the contribution is A[i] * 10^{n - h - 1}.\n\nIf we choose M, the contribution is A[i] * 10^{n - m - 1}.\n\nWe take the maximum of the two options, and update the DP table accordingly.\n\nOnce the DP table is filled, we can backtrack from (i=2n, h=n, m=n) to find the path that led to the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but how do we find the path? Because for each state, we need to remember which choice (H or M) was made to reach the maximum sum.\n\nSo perhaps we can have another table, say 'prev', which records for each (i, h, m) the choice that led to the maximum sum.\n\nSo during the DP computation, for each state, we choose the option that gives the maximum sum and record whether it was H or M.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, we can start from (i=2n, h=n, m=n) and backtrack through the 'prev' table to reconstruct the sequence of choices.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the input, n and the string A.\n\n2. Precompute the exponents for S1 and S2. For each position, the exponent is 10^{n - pos_in_S - 1}, where pos_in_S is the number of digits taken before this one in S1 or S2.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for S1, each new H adds to the position in S1. So for the first H, the exponent is 10^{n-1}, the next 10^{n-2}, etc.\n\nSimilarly for S2.\n\nSo we can precompute for each possible h and m, the exponent for the next H or M.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the exponent on the fly.\n\n3. Initialize the DP table. It can be a 2D array for each i, h, m. Or perhaps a 3D array.\n\nBut in Python, for n up to 18, a 3D array of 36 x 19 x 19 is manageable.\n\n4. Fill the DP table:\n\n   For i from 0 to 2n-1:\n\n       for h in 0 to min(n, i):\n\n           for m in 0 to min(n, i - h):\n\n               if h + m != i: continue\n\n               current_max = -infinity\n\n               // Option 1: choose H\n\n               if h < n:\n\n                   exponent = 10^(n - h - 1)\n\n                   new_sum = A[i] * exponent + dp[i+1][h+1][m]\n\n                   if new_sum > current_max:\n\n                       current_max = new_sum\n\n                       prev[(i, h, m)] = 'H'\n\n               // Option 2: choose M\n\n               if m < n:\n\n                   exponent = 10^(n - m - 1)\n\n                   new_sum = A[i] * exponent + dp[i+1][h][m+1]\n\n                   if new_sum > current_max:\n\n                       current_max = new_sum\n\n                       prev[(i, h, m)] = 'M'\n\n               dp[i][h][m] = current_max\n\n5. After filling the DP table, the maximum sum is dp[0][0][0]. Then, backtrack from (2n, n, n) to (0,0,0), collecting the choices into the result string.\n\nWait, but the backtracking starts from the end. So the initial state is (i=2n, h=n, m=n), and each step we look up the previous choice.\n\n6. Now, let's think about the base case. When i=2n, h=n, m=n: the sum is 0, as no more digits are left to process.\n\n7. Now, the problem is that the DP needs to correctly represent the maximum sum. Also, the initial state is dp[0][0][0], and the transitions are filled correctly.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is i=0, h=0, m=0.\n\nWait, no. Because for i=0, it's the first digit, and h and m are 0. So the initial state is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the initial and final states mixed. Let me think: the DP[i][h][m] represents the maximum sum obtainable from position i onwards, given that h H's and m M's have been used up to that point.\n\nSo, for the initial state, dp[0][0][0] is the maximum sum from the beginning, using 0 H's and 0 M's.\n\nWhen processing position 0, we can choose H or M, provided that h and m don't exceed n.\n\nSo the code outline is clear.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires the output to be a string of 'H' and 'M's, indicating the choices made at each step.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, read A as a string.\n\nInitialize the DP table as a 3-dimensional array. Since n can be up to 18, the DP will be of size (2n+1) x (n+1) x (n+1).\n\nBut in Python, initializing a 3D list can be a bit tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps for each i, h, m, we can store the maximum sum and the choice.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to separate the DP table (max sum) and the prev table (choices).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Precompute the exponents for each possible h and m.\n\nWait, but the exponents depend on the number of digits taken before. So for each H, the exponent is 10^{n - h' - 1}, where h' is the number of H's taken so far.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nSo, perhaps, for each state (i, h, m), when choosing H, the exponent is 10^{n - h' - 1}, where h' is h+1 (since we're adding this H).\n\nWait, no. Because h is the number of H's taken so far before processing this digit. So when choosing H, the new h' is h+1.\n\nSo the exponent is 10^{n - (h+1) - 1} = 10^{n - h - 2}.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for S1, the first H contributes to the 10^{n-1} place, the second to 10^{n-2}, etc.\n\nSo the exponent for the k-th H is 10^{n - k}.\n\nWait, yes. Because the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, ..., the nth by 10^0.\n\nSo, for a particular choice of H at position i, which is the (h+1)-th H, the exponent is 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first H is the 1st, exponent is 10^{n-1}. So for the (h+1)-th H, the exponent is 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nSo, when choosing H in state (i, h, m), the exponent is 10^{n - (h + 1)}.\n\nWait, but i is the current position being processed. So in the DP, for state (i, h, m), the next state after choosing H is (i+1, h+1, m). So, the digit A[i] is being added to S1 as the (h+1)th digit, which is multiplied by 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code, for each state (i, h, m), when choosing H, the contribution is A[i] * (10 ** (n - h - 1)), and the next state is (i+1, h+1, m).\n\nSimilarly, choosing M contributes A[i] * (10 ** (n - m - 1)), and the next state is (i+1, h, m+1).\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nImplement the DP with memoization.\n\nBut in Python, for n=18, 36*19*19 is manageable, so perhaps a memoization approach using recursion with memoization is possible, but for larger n, iterative DP is better.\n\nSo, let's proceed with an iterative approach.\n\nImplementing the DP:\n\nInitialize a 3D array dp[i][h][m], where i ranges from 0 to 2n, h and m from 0 to n.\n\nInitially, set all dp[i][h][m] to -infinity.\n\nSet dp[2n][n][n] = 0.\n\nThen, for i from 2n-1 down to 0:\n\n   for h in 0 to n:\n\n       for m in 0 to n:\n\n           if h + m != i: continue\n\n           if i == 2n-1:\n\n               // last digit, process it.\n\n               // but wait, in the loop, i is from 2n-1 down to 0.\n\n               // so for i=2n-1, it's the last digit.\n\n               // but how to handle it.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to loop i from 0 to 2n-1, and for each state, compute the next states.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to process the DP in order, starting from i=0 and building up.\n\nWait, perhaps processing in reverse order is better because the state depends on the next state.\n\nSo, to avoid overwriting the next state before it's computed, perhaps we should process i in reverse order.\n\nSo, for i in 0..2n-1:\n\n   for h in 0..n:\n\n       for m in 0..n:\n\n           if h + m != i: continue\n\n           // compute the maximum for this state.\n\nBut wait, this may not work because the next state is i+1, which hasn't been computed yet.\n\nHmm. Maybe the correct approach is to process i from 2n-1 down to 0.\n\nLet me think: for i = 2n-1, the next state is i+1 = 2n, which is the base case (sum 0).\n\nSo, for i = 2n-1, the state is (2n-1, h, m), where h + m = 2n-1.\n\nIn this state, choosing H is allowed only if h < n, and M if m <n.\n\nSo, for each (h, m) where h + m = 2n-1:\n\n   if h <n: the contribution is A[i] * 10^{n - h -1} + dp[2n][h+1][m]\n\n   else: can't choose H.\n\nSimilarly for M.\n\nSo, the processing can be done in reverse order, starting from i=2n-1 down to 0.\n\nThis way, when processing i, the next state i+1 has already been processed, so its value is available.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nn = ... \n\nA = ... \n\ndigits = list(A)\n\nfor i in range(2n, -1, -1):\n\n   for h in 0..n:\n\n       for m in 0..n:\n\n           if h + m != i: continue\n\n           if i == 2n:\n\n               dp[i][h][m] = 0\n\n           else:\n\n               // compute options.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsize = 2*n\n\n# Precompute the 10^x for each possible h and m.\n\nmax_h = n\n\nmax_m = n\n\ndp = [[[ -1 for _ in range(max_m +1)] for __ in range(max_h +1)] for ___ in range(size +1)]\n\nprev = [ [ [-1 for _ in range(max_m +1)] for __ in range(max_h +1)] for ___ in range(size +1) ]\n\n# Initialize base case.\n\ndp[size][n][n] = 0\n\nfor i in range(size-1, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in range(0, n+1):\n\n        for m in range(0, n+1):\n\n            if h + m != i:\n\n                continue\n\n            # Try both options.\n\n            max_val = -1\n\n            best_choice = ''\n\n            # Option 1: choose H.\n\n            if h < n:\n\n                exponent = 10 ** (n - h -1)\n\n                val = (int(digits[i])) * exponent\n\n                if h+1 <= n and m <= n:\n\n                    next_val = dp[i+1][h+1][m]\n\n                    total = val + next_val\n\n                    if total > max_val:\n\n                        max_val = total\n\n                        best_choice = 'H'\n\n            # Option 2: choose M.\n\n            if m < n:\n\n                exponent = 10 ** (n - m -1)\n\n                val = (int(digits[i])) * exponent\n\n                if h <= n and m+1 <=n:\n\n                    next_val = dp[i+1][h][m+1]\n\n                    total = val + next_val\n\n                    if total > max_val:\n\n                        max_val = total\n\n                        best_choice = 'M'\n\n            # Update the DP and prev.\n\n            dp[i][h][m] = max_val\n\n            prev[i][h][m] = best_choice\n\n# Now, reconstruct the path.\n\nresult = []\n\ni = 0\n\nh = 0\n\nm = 0\n\nwhile not (i == size and h ==n and m ==n):\n\n    # Find the best choice for (i, h, m).\n\n    choice = prev[i][h][m]\n\n    result.append(choice)\n\n    if choice == 'H':\n\n        h +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        m +=1\n\n    i +=1\n\nresult.reverse()\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n\nWait, but wait. When reconstructing, we start from the initial state (i=0, h=0, m=0), and for each step, append the choice, then update h or m, and i.\n\nBut the choices are stored in the prev table, which for each state, indicates whether H or M was chosen to reach that state.\n\nWait, no. Because the prev table for state (i, h, m) indicates the choice that was made to arrive at that state.\n\nBut when reconstructing, we need to go backwards. So, for each state, the choice that was made to arrive there is the choice that should be recorded.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to build the result in reverse order and then reverse it.\n\nLet me think:\n\nStart from i = size, h =n, m =n.\n\nThen, for each step, we look at the prev[i-1][h'][m'], and see what choice led to this state.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to backtrack from (size, n, n) to (0,0,0).\n\nWait, but for (size, n, n), the prev is undefined. So perhaps the initial step is to start from (0,0,0), and build the result in order.\n\nWait, no. Because the prev table for (i, h, m) gives the choice that was made to reach that state.\n\nSo, for (i, h, m), the choice was made to take either H or M at position i.\n\nSo, to reconstruct the path, we start from (i=0, h=0, m=0), and for each step, look up the choice made at position i, then move to (i+1, h+1, m) or (i+1, h, m+1), depending on the choice.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\nresult = []\ncurrent_i = 0\ncurrent_h = 0\ncurrent_m = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    if current_i == size and current_h ==n and current_m ==n:\n        break\n    choice = prev[current_i][current_h][current_m]\n    result.append(choice)\n    if choice == 'H':\n        current_h +=1\n    else:\n        current_m +=1\n    current_i +=1\n\nThen, reverse the result to get the correct order.\n\nWait, but wait: when you choose 'H' at position i, that digit is added to S1. So in the result string, the choice comes before the next position.\n\nWait, perhaps the reconstruction is correct as above.\n\nWait, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=2, A='9911'\n\nDigits: ['9','9','1','1']\n\nWhat's the expected output: 'HMHM'\n\nLet's see.\n\nProcessing:\n\nAt i=0, h=0, m=0: choose H (digit 9), contributes 90 to S1.\n\ni=1, h=1, m=0: choose M (digit 9), contributes 90 to S2.\n\ni=2, h=1, m=1: choose H (digit 1), contributes 1*10^(2-1-1) = 10^0 =1.\n\ni=3, h=2, m=1: choose M (digit 1), contributes 1*10^(2-1-1)=1.\n\nTotal S1: 91, S2:91. Sum is 182.\n\nBut wait, the sample output is 'HMHM'.\n\nSo the result string is H, M, H, M.\n\nWhich would correspond to the choices: H at 0, M at 1, H at 2, M at 3.\n\nWhich gives S1 =9 followed by 1: 91.\n\nS2=9 followed by 1: 91.\n\nSum is 182.\n\nBut what about alternative arrangements?\n\nAnother option: H at 0, H at 1, M at 2, M at 3.\n\nS1: 99, S2:11. Sum 110, which is less than 182.\n\nAnother option: H at 0, M at 1, M at 2, H at3.\n\nS1: 9 followed by 1, S2: 99. Sum is 1+9+9=19? No, wait, S1 is 91, S2 is 99. Sum is 190, which is higher than 182.\n\nWait, why is that not the case in the sample?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample. Let me check.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=2, A=9911.\n\nSample Output: HMHM.\n\nSo the choices are H, M, H, M.\n\nS1 is 9 (from first H) and 1 (third H): 91.\n\nS2 is 9 (second M) and 1 (fourth M): 91.\n\nSum is 182.\n\nAnother arrangement: H, M, M, H.\n\nThen S1 is 9,1 → 91.\n\nS2 is 9,1 → 91.\n\nSame sum.\n\nAnother arrangement: M, H, H, M.\n\nS1 is 9,1 →91.\n\nS2 is 9,1 →91.\n\nSame sum.\n\nSo the maximum sum is 182, and any of these arrangements gives that.\n\nBut according to the sample output, HMHM is one possible solution.\n\nSo, the DP approach correctly finds the maximum sum, and the path can vary as long as the sum is maximum.\n\nSo, the code should correctly compute the maximum sum and reconstruct the path.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the exponents correctly.\n\n- Making sure that the initial state is processed correctly.\n\n- Correctly handling the case when i=2n, h=n, m=n.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the DP, for each state (i, h, m), we have to consider whether h + m equals i, which is required.\n\nAlso, the exponents should be calculated as 10^(n - h -1) for H, etc.\n\nWait, but when h is 0, it's 10^(n-1). For h=1, it's 10^(n-2), etc.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting with the sample:\n\nn=2.\n\nAt i=0, h=0, m=0.\n\nChoosing H: contributes 9 * 10^(2-0-1) =9*10=90.\n\nNext state is i=1, h=1, m=0.\n\nAt i=1, h=1, m=0.\n\nOptions:\n\nChoose H: h+1=2 ≤2, so contributes 9 * 10^(2-1-1)=9*1=9. Next state i=2, h=2, m=0.\n\nBut since h=2 is equal to n=2, the next state can't choose H anymore.\n\nAt i=2, h=2, m=0: can only choose M.\n\nContribution is 1*10^(2-0-1)=10. Next state i=3, h=2, m=1.\n\nAt i=3, h=2, m=1: can choose M again.\n\nContribution is 1*10^(2-1-1)=1. Next state i=4, h=2, m=2.\n\nSum is 90 +9 +10 +1= 110.\n\nAlternatively, at i=1, h=1, m=0, choose M.\n\nContribution is 9*10^(2-0-1)=90. Next state i=2, h=1, m=1.\n\nAt i=2, h=1, m=1.\n\nChoose H: contributes 1*10^(2-1-1)=1. Next state i=3, h=2, m=1.\n\nChoose M: contributes 1*10^(2-1-1)=1. Next state i=4, h=2, m=2.\n\nSum is 90 (from i=0) +90 (from i=1) +1 (i=2) +1 (i=3) = 182.\n\nWhich is better.\n\nSo the DP would correctly choose the maximum path.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- All digits are zero: the best is any arrangement.\n\n- n=1: two digits. Choose which one is H and which is M.\n\n- Leading zeros are allowed, so the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: n=18, 36 digits. Need to compute efficiently.\n\nBut in Python, even for 36*19*19= 13,684 states, it's manageable.\n\nPotential optimizations:\n\nSince the digits are processed in order, the code can use memoization with lru_cache, but for n=18, it's manageable.\n\nBut implementing it iteratively is better for speed.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead n and A.\n\nCompute the digits as a list.\n\nInitialize dp and prev tables.\n\nFill the dp table in reverse order.\n\nReconstruct the path.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nWait, but in the code, for i in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, in a TV game to maximize their total prize. The game involves taking turns picking digits from a given number, ensuring each player makes exactly n moves. The goal is to find the sequence that maximizes the sum of the numbers formed by each player.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be broken down into selecting a sequence of moves (either 'H' or 'M') such that each player picks exactly n digits. The challenge is to maximize the sum of the numbers formed by the digits picked by each player.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a 3D DP array `dp[i][h][m]` where `i` is the current digit being processed, `h` is the number of digits picked by Homer so far, and `m` is the number of digits picked by Marge so far. The value at `dp[i][h][m]` represents the maximum sum achievable starting from position `i` with `h` and `m` digits picked so far.\n\n3. **State Transitions**: For each state `(i, h, m)`, we consider two transitions:\n   - Choosing 'H' at the current digit, which contributes to Homer's number.\n   - Choosing 'M' at the current digit, which contributes to Marge's number.\n\n4. **Backtracking**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from the final state to reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\ndigits = list(A)\nsize = 2 * n\n\n# Initialize DP table and previous choices\ndp = [[[-1 for _ in range(n + 1)] for __ in range(n + 1)] for ___ in range(size + 1)]\nprev = [[[-1 for _ in range(n + 1)] for __ in range(n + 1)] for ___ in range(size + 1)]\n\n# Base case: all digits processed, no more moves\ndp[size][n][n] = 0\n\nfor i in range(size - 1, -1, -1):\n    for h in range(n + 1):\n        for m in range(n + 1):\n            if h + m != i:\n                continue\n            max_val = -1\n            best_choice = ''\n            # Try choosing 'H' if possible\n            if h < n:\n                exponent = 10 ** (n - h - 1)\n                val = int(digits[i]) * exponent\n                next_h = h + 1\n                next_m = m\n                if dp[i + 1][next_h][next_m] != -1:\n                    total = val + dp[i + 1][next_h][next_m]\n                    if total > max_val:\n                        max_val = total\n                        best_choice = 'H'\n            # Try choosing 'M' if possible\n            if m < n:\n                exponent = 10 ** (n - m - 1)\n                val = int(digits[i]) * exponent\n                next_h = h\n                next_m = m + 1\n                if dp[i + 1][next_h][next_m] != -1:\n                    total = val + dp[i + 1][next_h][next_m]\n                    if total > max_val:\n                        max_val = total\n                        best_choice = 'M'\n            dp[i][h][m] = max_val\n            prev[i][h][m] = best_choice\n\n# Reconstruct the result\nresult = []\ncurrent_i = 0\ncurrent_h = 0\ncurrent_m = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    if current_i == size and current_h == n and current_m == n:\n        break\n    choice = prev[current_i][current_h][current_m]\n    result.append(choice)\n    if choice == 'H':\n        current_h += 1\n    else:\n        current_m += 1\n    current_i += 1\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` representing the number with 2n digits.\n2. **Initialization**: We initialize the DP table `dp` and a table `prev` to keep track of the optimal choice made at each state.\n3. **Filling DP Table**: We iterate over each digit position in reverse order, updating the DP table based on whether choosing 'H' or 'M' yields a higher sum.\n4. **Reconstructing the Path**: Starting from the initial state, we backtrack using the `prev` table to determine the optimal sequence of moves, ensuring each player makes exactly n moves.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal sequence of moves using dynamic programming, considering all possible states and transitions.",
