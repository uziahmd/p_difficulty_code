Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The conditions for an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All the other squares (the ones not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to check the diagonals. Then, check the rest of the grid.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the grid. Since n is odd, the grid is square with a center point. The two diagonals intersect at the center.\n\nSo for each grid, I need to:\n\n- Check that all the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) has the same character.\n- Check that all the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) has the same character.\n- Also, the two diagonals must have the same character as each other because they both form the X.\n- Then, all the other cells (non-diagonal) must have the same character, and this character must be different from the diagonal one.\n\nWait, no. Wait: the problem says that the diagonals must be the same, and the non-diagonal squares must be the same but different from the diagonal.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Check that the main diagonal is all the same character.\n2. Check that the anti-diagonal is all the same character.\n3. Ensure that these two are the same character.\n4. Check that all other cells are the same as each other, and that this is different from the diagonal/anti-diagonal character.\n\nSo how do I implement this?\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nThe input is n, followed by n lines each containing n characters. But wait, in the sample input, it's given as strings like '5\\nxooox\\n...' etc. So each line is a string, including the newline? Or is it that the input is read as a list where each element is a row, without the newline? Hmm, perhaps in Python, when we read via stdin, the newlines are stripped. So probably, the code will read n, then read n lines, each as a string without the trailing newline.\n\nSo the grid is a 2D array, where grid[i][j] is the j-th character of the i-th row.\n\nNext, for the diagonals:\n\nThe main diagonal runs from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). For each cell on this diagonal, check if all are the same.\n\nSimilarly, the anti-diagonal runs from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). Check all are same.\n\nIf either diagonal has varying characters, it's not an X.\n\nAlso, the two diagonals must have the same character.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, check the remaining cells.\n\nThe remaining cells are those not on either diagonal.\n\nFor each of these cells, check if they are all the same character, and that this character is different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read the grid as a list of strings, each string being a row.\n3. Check main diagonal:\n   a. Get all the characters on the main diagonal.\n   b. Check if all are the same.\n   c. If not, return NO.\n4. Check anti-diagonal:\n   a. Same as above.\n   b. Check if all same.\n   c. If not, return NO.\n5. Check if main and anti-diagonal have the same character. If not, return NO.\n6. Now, collect all the non-diagonal cells.\n7. Check if all non-diagonal cells are the same character.\n8. Also, ensure that this character is different from the diagonal's.\n9. If all these are true, output YES; else, NO.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=3.\n\nLike the sample input where it's 'YES'.\n\nIn that case, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nBoth diagonals must be same, say 'x'. Then the non-diagonals are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). These should all be same, say 'o', which is different from 'x'.\n\nAnother case: n=5.\n\nEach position on the diagonals must be same, and the non-diagonals must be same, but different.\n\nWhat if the grid is all same characters? Then the main and anti diagonals are same, but the non-diagonals are same as them, so it won't satisfy the condition. So in that case, output would be NO.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1. But according to the problem statement, n is at least 3, so n=3 is the smallest.\n\nWait, no. The problem says n is an odd number >=3. So n can be 3, 5, etc., up to 299.\n\nNow, implementing this.\n\nIn code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string, stored as a list called grid.\n\nThen, check main diagonal:\n\nchars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    chars.append(grid[i][i])\n\nif len(set(chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nSame for anti-diagonal:\n\nchars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    chars.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\nif len(set(chars)) !=1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nCheck if both diagonals have same character:\n\nif chars_main[0] != chars_anti[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nWait, but since the main diagonal is all same and the anti-diagonal is all same, their first elements are the same as all others, so just compare the first element of each.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, collect all non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i != j and i + j != n-1:\n            non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nWait, wait. Because in a square grid, for the anti-diagonal, the condition is i + j == n-1. So for the non-diagonal cells, it's i !=j and i +j != n-1.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if it's not on either diagonal, add to non_diag.\n\nOnce we have non_diag, check if all are same.\n\nIf non_diag is empty, which can only happen when n=1, but n >=3, so no.\n\nElse:\n\nfirst_non = non_diag[0]\nall_same = True\nfor c in non_diag:\n    if c != first_non:\n        all_same = False\n        break\n\nif not all_same:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif first_non == chars_main[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, wait.\n\nWait, the non-diagonal cells must be all same and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo after checking that all non-diagonal are same, we also check that this is not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif len(non_diag) >0:\n    first = non_diag[0]\n    for c in non_diag:\n        if c != first:\n            all_same = False\n            break\n    if not all_same:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n    if first == diag_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nWait, but what if n is such that the non-diagonal is empty? No, because n is at least 3, so for n=3, the non-diagonal has 3*(3-3)/2? Wait, n=3: total cells 9. Diagonals have 3 cells each (but overlapping at the center). So main diagonal has 3 cells, anti has 3, but the center is counted twice. So the non-diagonal has 9 - 3 -3 +1 =4 cells. Because 3+3-1=5, so 9-5=4.\n\nSo non_diag is always non-empty when n>=3.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\ndiag1 = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(diag1)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 - i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(anti_diag)) !=1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif diag1[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nfirst_non = non_diag[0]\nfor c in non_diag:\n    if c != first_non:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\nif first_non == diag1[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but wait. What if the non-diagonal is all same as each other, but same as the diagonal? Then it's invalid.\n\nSo in the last check, if first_non is same as diag1[0], output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now, test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nMain diagonal is x, o, o, o, x. Wait, no.\n\nWait, grid[0][0] is x.\n\ngrid[1][1] is o.\n\ngrid[2][2] is o.\n\ngrid[3][3] is o.\n\ngrid[4][4] is x.\n\nSo diag1 is ['x','o','o','o','x'] → not all same. So in the first check, it's invalid, so output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: w, s, w → not all same. So output NO.\n\nThird sample:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: x, p, x → not same, so output NO.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me look again.\n\nWait the third sample's input is:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nSo grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nMain diagonal is grid[0][0] = x, grid[1][1]=x, grid[2][2]=e. So x, x, e. Not all same. So the code correctly outputs NO.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me see:\n\nNo, the main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) → x, x, e. So not all same. So the code correctly returns NO.\n\nBut another case where the main and anti-diagonals are correct, but non-diagonals are same as each other but same as diagonals.\n\nLike:\n\nn=3\n\naba\nbab\naba\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, a → not same. So no.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\naaa\naaa\n\nDiagonals are aaa and aaa, same. Non-diagonal is all a. So the code will check:\n\nnon_diag is a, a, a. So first_non is a. Then check if a is same as diag1[0] (a). So in this case, it's same, so output NO.\n\nSo that case is correctly handled.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\nxox\noxo\nxox\n\nMain diagonal is x, o, x → not same.\n\nSo code would output NO.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\nxoo\noxo\nxoo\n\nMain diagonal: x, o, x → not same.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\nxox\noxo\nxox\n\nWait, main diagonal is x, o, x → not same.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nWait, let's think about a correct X.\n\nn=3:\n\nxox\noxo\nxox\n\nWait, main diagonal is x, o, x → not same. So no.\n\nWait, no. How about:\n\nn=3:\n\nxox\noxo\nxox → no.\n\nWait, no. Because the main diagonal isn't same.\n\nAh, wait, the main diagonal must be same.\n\nSo for a correct X, the main diagonal and anti-diagonal must be same.\n\nSo for n=3, the correct grid would be:\n\nx o o\n\no x o\n\no o x\n\nWait, no. That's not correct. Because the main diagonal is x, x, x (if all are x). Wait, no.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So in this case, they are all x.\n\nAnti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So also x.\n\nThe non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So they must all be same and not x.\n\nSo for example:\n\nx o o\no x o\no o x\n\nWait, no, the main diagonal is x, x, x. Anti-diagonal is x, x, x.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1)=o, (1,0)=o, (1,2)=o, (2,1)=o. So all o, which is different from x.\n\nSo this grid would be correct, so code should output YES.\n\nWait, let's simulate:\n\ndiag1 = [x, x, x] → all same.\n\nanti_diag = [x, x, x] → all same.\n\ndiag1[0] == anti_diag[0] → yes.\n\nnon_diag = o, o, o, o → all same.\n\nfirst_non = o.\n\nCompare to diag1[0] (x): o != x → proceed.\n\nSo code returns YES.\n\nAnother correct case.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these.\n\nNow, think about when n is larger, like 5.\n\nWe need to make sure that the code correctly handles all cells.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when n is 3 and all non-diagonal cells are same as each other but same as the diagonals.\n\nLike:\n\nx x x\nx x x\nx x x\n\nThen, diag1 is x, x, x → same.\n\nanti_diag is same.\n\nnon_diag is all x.\n\nSo first_non is x.\n\nThen, check if first_non == diag1[0]: yes. So output NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, main and anti-diagonal are 'x's, non-diagonal are 'o's.\n\nWhich should return YES.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nWhat about when some non-diagonal cells are different?\n\nLike, n=5:\n\nx x x x x\n\nx o o o x\n\nx o o o x\n\nx x x x x\n\nx o o o x\n\nx x x x x\n\nWait, main diagonal is all x.\n\nanti-diagonal is all x.\n\nnon-diagonal cells are o's except for some.\n\nWait, no, because in the second row, the cells are o's except the ends.\n\nWait, the non-diagonal cells include all positions except the main and anti-diagonals.\n\nSo in this case, the non-diagonal cells may have some o's but perhaps others are x. So the code would find that non_diag has varying characters and return NO.\n\nSo the code correctly handles that.\n\nNow, considering the performance.\n\nn can be up to 299, so the grid can be 299x299=89401 cells.\n\nThe code needs to process each cell once, which is manageable.\n\nNo problem with time constraints.\n\nPotential issues: reading the input correctly.\n\nIn Python, when using input().strip(), it removes any leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines. So each line is correctly read as a single string without the newline.\n\nThus, grid[i][j] gives the j-th character of the i-th row.\n\nAnother possible issue is when n is 1, but according to the problem statement, n is at least 3 and odd.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nMain diagonal is grid[0][0] = x, grid[1][1]=o, grid[2][2]=o, grid[3][3]=o, grid[4][4]=x → not all same. So code returns NO.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: w, s, w → not same. So code returns NO.\n\nSample3:\n\nInput:\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: x, p, e → not same. So code returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\nxox\noxo\nxox → main diagonal is x, o, x → not same. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3\n\nxoo\noxo\nxoo → main diagonal is x, o, o → not same. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case where it's correct:\n\nn=3\n\nxox\noxo\nxox → no, main diagonal varies.\n\nWait, another correct test case:\n\nn=3\n\nxoo\noxo\nxoo → main diagonal is x, o, o → not same. So no.\n\nAnother correct case:\n\nn=3\n\nxox\noxo\nxox → main diagonal is x, o, x → not same.\n\nWait, I'm struggling to find a correct case.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nn=3\n\nxox → row 0: x o x\n\noxo → row1: o x o\n\nxox → row2: x o x\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, x → same.\n\nAnti-diagonal: x, x, x → same.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1)=o, (1,0)=o, (1,2)=o, (2,1)=o. All same, and different from x.\n\nSo code should output YES.\n\nYes, so in code:\n\ndiag1 = ['x', 'x', 'x'] → same.\n\nanti_diag = ['x', 'x', 'x'] → same.\n\ndiag1[0] == anti_diag[0] → yes.\n\nnon_diag: ['o', 'o', 'o', 'o'] → same.\n\nfirst_non is 'o' != 'x' → yes.\n\nSo code returns YES.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nI think the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\". The conditions for an \"X\" are that both diagonals must have the same letter, and all other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: \n   - Extract the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and check if all its elements are the same.\n   - Extract the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) and check if all its elements are the same.\n3. **Compare Diagonals**: Ensure that the characters on both diagonals are the same.\n4. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Collect all non-diagonal cells and check if they are all the same character and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\ndiag1 = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    diag1.append(grid[i][i])\nif len(set(diag1)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nanti_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\nif len(set(anti_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check if diagonals have the same character\nif diag1[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Collect non-diagonal cells\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i != j and i + j != n - 1:\n            non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check if all non-diagonal are the same and different from diagonal\nfirst_non = non_diag[0]\nall_same = True\nfor c in non_diag:\n    if c != first_non:\n        all_same = False\n        break\nif not all_same or first_non == diag1[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The grid is read as a list of strings where each string represents a row.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: We iterate through the main diagonal and collect its characters.

If they are not all the same, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n4. **Diagonal Comparison**: The main and anti-diagonals must have the same character for the grid to potentially form an \"X\".\n5. **Non-Diagonal Check**: All non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal characters. If any of these conditions fail, the grid does not form an \"X\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all necessary conditions to determine if the grid forms the letter \"X\".",
