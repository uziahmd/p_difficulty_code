He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A creates a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So now the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C appends some 'c's to the end. The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C adds them. It can be equal to both.\n\nThe task is to check if a given string S could have resulted from this process.\n\nLet's think about what conditions the string must satisfy.\n\nFirst, the structure of the string must be in the form a...ab...bc...c. Because each step appends letters, so the order is strict: all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's. If the string doesn't follow this order, it's invalid.\n\nSo, the first condition is that the string should consist of a non-empty sequence of 'a's followed by a non-empty sequence of 'b's followed by a non-empty sequence of 'c's.\n\nIf this is not the case, we immediately return NO.\n\nNext, after verifying the order, let's consider the counts.\n\nLetâ€™s denote:\n- count_a = number of 'a's\n- count_b = number of 'b's\n- count_c = number of 'c's\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\nC appends count_c letters, which must be equal to either count_a or count_b (or both). But wait, the count_c is the number of 'c's added by C. However, since the original string (before C's addition) already had some 'a's and 'b's, the total count_a and count_b are fixed before C adds the 'c's.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nAh, no. When C appends, he appends some 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. So the string before C appends has count_a and count_b as the numbers of 'a's and 'b's respectively. So when C adds, count_c must be equal to either count_a or count_b. Or it can be equal to both.\n\nBut after C appends, the string will have count_c = either count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial string before C is S_ab, which is the string after A and B. So in that string, count_a is the number of 'a's, count_b is the number of 'b's. Then C appends count_c 'c's, which is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo the final count_c is equal to count_a or count_b, but perhaps even more than that: it's exactly equal to one of them.\n\nSo for the entire string, the following must hold:\n\ncount_c == count_a OR count_c == count_b.\n\nBut wait, is that the only condition? No, because in the problem statement, it says that C appends \"some number\" of 'c's, which is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. So the count_c must be exactly equal to count_a or exactly equal to count_b.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the string is correctly ordered: all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\n2. Compute the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n\n3. Check if count_c equals count_a or count_c equals count_b.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nWait, but what about the counts being zero? For example, after step 1, the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b', because B appends some 'b's after A's 'a's. So in the string S, count_a >=1, count_b >=1, and count_c >=1.\n\nWait, because in the problem statement, after B appends, there's at least one 'a' and 'b' in the string. Then C appends some 'c's (so count_c >=1). So all three counts must be at least 1.\n\nSo, for the given string S, the first thing to check is whether it's structured as a's followed by b's followed by c's, with each section having at least one character.\n\nSo, for example, if the string starts with 'a', then has 'b's, but no 'c's, that's invalid because C must have appended some 'c's.\n\nSimilarly, any string that doesn't have all three sections is invalid.\n\nSo, first, I'll split the string into",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific process involving appending characters in a particular order and quantity. The string must be structured such that it starts with 'a's, followed by 'b's, and ends with 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: Verify that the string is structured correctly, i.e., it should consist of one or more 'a's followed by one or more 'b's and ending with one or more 'c's.\n2. **Count Characters**: Calculate the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Check Conditions**: Ensure that the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is in the correct order: all a's, then b's, then c's.\n# Also, ensure there are at least one a, one b, and one c each.\nif not (s and s[0] == 'a' and s[-1] == 'c'):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nparts = []\ncurrent_char = None\nfor c in s:\n    if c == 'a':\n        if current_char != 'a':\n            parts.append('a')\n            current_char = 'a'\n        else:\n            parts.append('a')\n    elif c == 'b':\n        if current_char != 'b':\n            parts.append('b')\n            current_char = 'b'\n        else:\n            parts.append('b')\n    elif c == 'c':\n        if current_char != 'c':\n            parts.append('c')\n            current_char = 'c'\n        else:\n            parts.append('c')\n\nif len(parts) != 3 or parts[0] != 'a' or parts[1] != 'b' or parts[2] != 'c':\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\ncount_b = s.count('b')\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The string is checked to ensure it starts with 'a's, followed by 'b's, and ends with 'c's. If this structure is violated, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Character Counting**: We count how many 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are present in the string.\n3. **Validation**: The count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's for the string to be valid. If both conditions are satisfied, the result is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are efficiently checked, providing the correct result based on the given problem conditions.",
