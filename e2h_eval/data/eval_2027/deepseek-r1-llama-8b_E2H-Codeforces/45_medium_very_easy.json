There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where n players participate in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, right. So the tournament is a single-elimination bracket, but the structure isn't fixed. The organizers arrange the grid such that any two players can face each other only if their previous game counts differ by at most one.\n\nWait, so each time two players play, they must have either the same number of games or one more. Because each game they've won means they've advanced, so the number of games they've played is equal to the number of wins they have.\n\nThe winner of the tournament is the one who wins all their games. So we need to model the path of this winner through the tournament, ensuring that each opponent they face meets the condition on the number of games they've played.\n\nSo, what's the maximum possible games the winner can play?\n\nLet me think about some examples.\n\nIn the sample input 2: when there are 2 players, the winner plays once. So output is 1.\n\nSample input 3: 3 players. The winner can play two games. Like, first plays someone (they have zero games), then plays another. So the output is 2.\n\nFor 4 players, the maximum is 2. Wait, because after two wins, the player has played two games. But how does that work with the other players? Oh wait, maybe the structure is that the winner plays two games, each time facing someone who has either the same or one less number of games.\n\nWait, maybe the way to approach this is to model the number of games as a Fibonacci-like sequence. Because each step depends on the previous steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games is the largest k such that the sum of a certain series equals or exceeds n.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose the maximum number of games for a winner is f(k). How can we compute f(k)?\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games before. Because the winner has already played k games, and the opponent must have a difference of at most one.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the winner has played k games, meaning they've won k times. Each opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games before their match. Because when the winner plays them, their count increases by one.\n\nSo for each opponent in the k-th game, they had k-1 or k-2 games before.\n\nBut how do we model this? It's similar to the Fibonacci sequence because each step depends on the previous ones.\n\nWait, I remember a similar problem where the maximum number of games a player can win in a knockout tournament is related to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2, f(2) = 3, etc., but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's model it as a Fibonacci-like series. Let me think:\n\nThe maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest m where the sum of the m-th Fibonacci numbers is >=n.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as the minimal number of players required for the winner to play m games.\n\nLet's define s(m) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have m games.\n\nFor example:\n\nm=1: the winner plays one game. So s(1)=2.\n\nm=2: the winner plays two games. The first opponent has 0 games, the second must have either 1 or 0 games. Wait, but how many players do we need? Let's see:\n\nTo have the winner play 2 games, the second game's opponent must have played 1 game. So in the second round, the winner's opponent must have beaten someone else. So that opponent needs to have one game. So the total players needed are 3: winner, opponent in first game, opponent in second game.\n\nWait, no. Because the opponent in the second game could be someone who only played once before. So for m=2, s(2)=3.\n\nFor m=3: the third game's opponent must have played 2 or 1 games. So to get that opponent, you need at least s(2) + s(1) = 3+2=5? Or wait, maybe s(m) = s(m-1) + s(m-2). Hmm, that sounds like the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, let's compute s(m):\n\ns(1) = 2\n\ns(2) = 3 (because the winner plays 2 games: first against someone (1 game), then against someone else who has 1 game)\n\ns(3): To have the third game, the opponent must have 2 or 1 games. So the opponent for the third game must have 2 games. So that requires that in the second game, the opponent has 2 games. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each step m, the minimal number of players required is s(m) = s(m-1) + s(m-2).\n\nBecause for the m-th game, the opponent must have played either m-1 or m-2 games. So to get that opponent, we need the minimal number of players for m-1 and m-2 games, and add those together.\n\nWait, let me test this.\n\ns(1) = 2.\n\ns(2) = s(1) + s(0)? Or maybe s(2) = s(1) + s(1) - 1? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe s(m) is the minimal number of players required for the winner to have m games.\n\nSo for m=1: 2 players.\n\nFor m=2: The winner plays two games. In the first game, he plays someone (1 game). In the second game, he plays someone else who has 1 game. So how many players are needed? 3: winner, opponent in first game, opponent in second game.\n\nWait, but that's 3 players, which is s(2) = 3.\n\nFor m=3: The winner's third opponent must have played either 2 or 1 games.\n\nIf the third opponent has 2 games, then that opponent must have come from a subtree that required s(2) players (since the third game's opponent has 2 games, which is m=2). So the total players needed would be s(3) = s(2) + s(1) = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSimilarly, for m=4: s(4) = s(3) + s(2) = 5 + 3 = 8.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input, when n=10, the maximum m is 4. Because s(4) is 8, which is less than 10. Then 10 >= s(4), so m=4 is possible.\n\nYes, in the sample input, when n=10, the output is 4.\n\nSo the approach seems to be that for a given n, find the maximum m such that s(m) <= n.\n\nNow, the question is: how to compute s(m) up to a point where s(m) <= 1018.\n\nWait, let's compute s(m) values until s(m) exceeds 1018.\n\nLet me try:\n\ns(1) = 2\n\ns(2) = 3\n\ns(3) = s(2)+s(1) = 3+2=5\n\ns(4) = 5+3=8\n\ns(5) = 8+5=13\n\ns(6) = 13+8=21\n\ns(7)=21+13=34\n\ns(8)=34+21=55\n\ns(9)=55+34=89\n\ns(10)=89+55=144\n\ns(11)=144+89=233\n\ns(12)=233+144=377\n\ns(13)=377+233=610\n\ns(14)=610+377=987\n\ns(15)=987+610=1597\n\nWait, but n can be up to 1018. So for s(14)=987, which is less than 1018, and s(15)=1597 which is larger than 1018.\n\nSo for n=1018, the maximum m is 14 because s(14)=987<=1018<1597.\n\nSo the approach is to precompute s(m) until s(m) exceeds 1018, then for a given n, find the largest m where s(m) <=n.\n\nOnce we have m, that's the answer.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute s(m) values, starting from m=1, using the recurrence s(m) = s(m-1) + s(m-2).\n\n2. For each test case (each n), find the largest m such that s(m) <=n.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Compute s(m) until s(m) > n.\n\n- Find the largest m where s(m) <=n.\n\n- Output m.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, we can precompute all s(m) up to the maximum possible m where s(m) <=1018.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWe can precompute the s(m) list.\n\nInitialize s as a list, starting with s[0]=1 (but maybe not needed since m starts from 1).\n\nWait, wait, perhaps it's better to have s(1)=2, s(2)=3, etc.\n\nWait, let's code it as follows:\n\nCompute s in a list where s[0] = 1 (for m=0?), but maybe not. Alternatively, start with s(1) =2.\n\nBut regardless, in code, let's create a list s, where s[i] represents the minimal number of players needed for m=i games.\n\nSo for i from 1 onwards:\n\ns[i] = s[i-1] + s[i-2]\n\nWith base cases:\n\ns[1] = 2\n\ns[2] = 3\n\nThen, for each i>2, s[i] = s[i-1] + s[i-2].\n\nSo, in code, we can build this list.\n\nOnce we have the list, for a given n, find the maximum m such that s[m] <=n.\n\nSo for example, for n=2, s[1]=2 is equal, so m=1.\n\nn=3: s[2]=3, m=2.\n\nn=4: s[2]=3 <=4, so check s[3]=5>4, so m=2.\n\nn=10: s[4]=8<=10, and s[5]=13>10, so m=4.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute s list up to the point where s[m] exceeds 1018.\n\nFind the largest m where s[m] <=n.\n\nReturn m.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nWhat about n=1? Well, according to the problem statement, n is >=2.\n\nWhat about n=5: s[3]=5, so m=3.\n\nWait, but wait, for m=3, s(3)=5.\n\nSo for n=5, the maximum is 3.\n\nWhat about n=6: s(3)=5<=6, and s(4)=8>6, so m=3.\n\nWait, but wait, s(4) is 8. So for n=6, which is between s(3)=5 and s(4)=8, the maximum m is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, generate the s list.\n\nWe can start with s = [2, 3], but wait, s[0] is undefined, perhaps. So perhaps the code starts with m=1, s=2, m=2, s=3, then iterates.\n\nWait, in code:\n\ns = [0, 0]  # dummy for 0th index.\n\ns[1] = 2\n\ns[2] =3\n\nfor m in range(3, ...):\n\n    s.append(s[m-1] + s[m-2])\n\nWe'll continue until s[m] exceeds 1018.\n\nOnce we have this list, for each n, find the largest m where s[m] <=n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nread n.\n\nthen, iterate through the s list and find the maximum m.\n\nBut wait, the s list is built incrementally, so perhaps we can build it up to the maximum possible m, then for each n, find the largest m where s[m] <=n.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nCompute s list:\n\ns = [0, 2, 3]\n\nfor m in range(3, max_possible):\n\n    next_s = s[m-1] + s[m-2]\n\n    if next_s > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    s.append(next_s)\n\nThen, for a given n, iterate through the s list in reverse order to find the largest m where s[m] <=n.\n\nSo, in code, for each test case:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor m in reversed(range(1, len(s))):\n\n    if s[m] <=n:\n\n        max_games = m\n\n        break\n\nprint(max_games)\n\nWait, but wait, the s list starts from m=1, s[1]=2, s[2]=3, etc.\n\nSo in the code, s is a list where s[1] is 2, s[2] is 3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial code is:\n\ns = [0, 2, 3]\n\nfor m in range(3, 10000):\n\n    next_val = s[m-1] + s[m-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    s.append(next_val)\n\nThen, for a given n, we loop from len(s)-1 down to 1, and find the first m where s[m] <=n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nmax_m = 0\n\nfor m in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    if s[m] <=n:\n\n        max_m = m\n\n        break\n\nprint(max_m)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 2.\n\ns[1]=2 <=2, so m=1.\n\nSample Input 2:3.\n\ns[2]=3 <=3, m=2.\n\nSample Input 3:4.\n\ns[2]=3 <=4, and s[3]=5>4, so m=2.\n\nSample Input 4:10.\n\ns[4]=8 <=10, s[5]=13>10, so m=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\ns[3]=5<=5, so m=3.\n\nn=6: s[3]=5<=6, s[4]=8>6, so m=3.\n\nn=8: s[4]=8<=8, so m=4.\n\nn=9: s[4]=8<=9, s[5]=13>9, so m=4.\n\nn=13: s[5]=13<=13, m=5.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's think about the maximum possible n=1018.\n\nWe can compute s up to the point where s[m] <=1018.\n\nFrom earlier, s(14)=987, s(15)=1597.\n\nSo for n=1018, m=14.\n\nThus, the code would output 14.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nFirst, generate s:\n\ns = [0, 2, 3]\n\nm =3\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_s = s[m-1] + s[m-2]\n\n    if next_s > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    s.append(next_s)\n\n    m +=1\n\nBut wait, the initial s has s[1]=2, s[2]=3.\n\nThen, for m=3, next_s = s[2]+s[1}=3+2=5.\n\nAppend to s, now s is [0,2,3,5].\n\nThen m=4, next_s=5+3=8.\n\nAppend, s becomes [0,2,3,5,8].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\ns = [0, 2, 3]\n\nm =3\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = s[m-1] + s[m-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1018:\n\n        break\n\n    s.append(next_val)\n\n    m +=1\n\nThen, for n:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor current_m in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    if s[current_m] <=n:\n\n        max_games = current_m\n\n        break\n\nprint(max_games)\n\nWait, but wait, the s list may not have been filled beyond a certain point, but for n=1018, the s list will have enough elements.\n\nTesting for n=1018, the code will find s[14]=987, s[15]=1597.\n\nBut 987 <=1018 <1597, so the maximum m is 14.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only face each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is a single-elimination format where each game results in one player being eliminated. The key constraint is that two players can only face each other if their previous game counts differ by at most one.\n2. **Fibonacci-like Sequence Insight**: The minimal number of players required for the winner to play `m` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players needed for `m` games is the sum of the minimal players needed for `m-1` and `m-2` games.\n3. **Precomputation**: We precompute the minimal number of players required for the winner to play up to the maximum possible number of games (up to 1018). This is done using a list where each entry `s[m]` represents the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play `m` games.\n4. **Determine Maximum Games for Given n**: For a given number of players `n`, we find the largest `m` such that the minimal number of players required for `m` games is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = [0, 2, 3]\nm = 3\nwhile True:\n    next_val = s[m - 1] + s[m - 2]\n    if next_val > 1018:\n        break\n    s.append(next_val)\n    m += 1\n\nn = int(input())\nmax_games = 0\nfor current_m in range(len(s) - 1, 0, -1):\n    if s[current_m] <= n:\n        max_games = current_m\n        break\nprint(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: The list `s` is built such that each value `s[m]` is the sum of the two preceding values, starting from `s[1] = 2` and `s[2] = 3`. This continues until the value exceeds 1018.\n2. **Finding Maximum Games**: For a given `n`, we iterate through the precomputed list in reverse order to find the largest `m` where the minimal number of players required for `m` games is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the maximum number of games the winner can play by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence and precomputation, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limit of input constraints.",
