They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about reconstructing the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on some given roads. Each road has two numbers: the GCD and LCM of the two lawns it connects. My task is to determine if there's a possible arrangement of the mushroom counts that satisfies all these roads, and if so, output one such arrangement.\n\nHmm. So the input gives me n (number of lawns) and m (number of known roads). Then for each road, I have four numbers: u, v, g, l. These represent that the edge connects lawn u to v, and the GCD of their mushroom counts is g, LCM is l.\n\nWait, but wait—no, wait: the problem says that each edge between two lawns has two numbers written: GCD and LCM of the numbers on those two lawns. So for each edge, when you look at the two endpoints, their mushroom counts must have GCD equal to the first number and LCM equal to the second.\n\nBut wait, the GCD and LCM are related. Because for any two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So for each edge, we have that g * l must equal the product of the two values at the ends.\n\nSo for each edge (u, v), the product of the mushrooms at u and v is g * l.\n\nSo for each edge, the equation is:\n\nx_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nBut since x_u and x_v are positive integers, this gives us constraints.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding x_1, x_2, ..., x_n such that for every edge (u, v), x_u * x_v = g * l, where g and l are given for that edge.\n\nMoreover, the mushrooms' counts must be positive integers.\n\nNow, how do I model this?\n\nThis seems like a problem involving solving a system of multiplicative equations. Each equation is x_u * x_v = C, where C is g*l for that edge.\n\nSo the approach would be to model each x_i as a variable, and for each edge, set up an equation x_u * x_v = C.\n\nBut since variables are connected via multiple edges, we need to find a consistent assignment.\n\nThis looks similar to constraint satisfaction problems, perhaps like a graph with edges representing constraints on the product of nodes.\n\nSo how can I model this?\n\nAn idea is to model this as a system where each node's value is a variable, and edges impose that the product of the two variables equals a certain value.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be solved using a Union-Find data structure with some additional information. But Union-Find typically deals with additive relationships or disjoint sets. Here, the relationship is multiplicative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model each x_i in terms of a base value. For example, assign a variable to each connected component, and express other variables in terms of that base.\n\nLet me think: suppose we have a connected component of variables. We can pick one variable as a base, say x_a = k, then express all other variables in terms of k. But for each edge, the product must equal C, which may constrain k.\n\nWait, but how? Let's see.\n\nSuppose in a connected component, I pick x_a = k. Then for any edge (a, b), x_b must be C/(x_a) = C/k. Similarly, for an edge (b, c), x_c = C/(x_b) = C/(C/k) = k. Wait, that would imply x_c =k, which might not be compatible with other edges.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So perhaps each connected component must have all variables equal to the same value, or have a certain relationship.\n\nWait, let's think about a chain of edges:\n\na - (g1,l1) -> b\n\nb - (g2,l2) -> c\n\nThen, from a and b: x_a * x_b = g1*l1.\n\nFrom b and c: x_b * x_c = g2*l2.\n\nSubstituting x_b from the first equation into the second: x_a = (g1*l1)/x_b = (g1*l1)/(g2*l2/x_c).\n\nWait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps each connected component must have all variables equal to the same value, but that's only possible under certain conditions.\n\nWait, no. For example, consider a triangle:\n\na connected to b via (g, l), b connected to c via (g, l), and a connected to c via (g, l). Then, all three variables must be equal. Because x_a * x_b = C, x_b * x_c = C, x_a * x_c = C. Multiplying all three gives (x_a x_b x_c)^2 = C^3 → x_a x_b x_c = C^(3/2). Since x_a, x_b, x_c are integers, C must be a square. Also, x_a = x_b = x_c.\n\nBut in cases where the components are trees, perhaps variables can be different.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the variables in a way that for each connected component, the variables can be expressed in terms of a single variable, and the constraints can be checked.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\n1. Treat each connected component separately.\n2. For each component, choose a root node.\n3. Express each node's value in terms of the root's value.\n4. For each edge in the component, compute the expected value based on the root's value and check consistency.\n5. If any inconsistency is found, the entire system is invalid.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nEach node can have a parent, and a multiplier representing the factor by which the root's value is scaled to get the node's value. So for each node, x_node = k * multiplier, where k is the root's value.\n\nFor each edge (u, v, g, l), we have x_u * x_v = g * l. Substituting, (k_u * k_root) * (k_v * k_root) = g * l. Wait, no. Wait, if u's value is x_u = k_root * u_multiplier, and similarly for v, then x_u * x_v = (k_root * u_mult) * (k_root * v_mult) = k_root² * u_mult * v_mult. But for the edge (u, v), this must equal g*l.\n\nSo for each edge, we have:\n\nk_root^2 * (u_mult * v_mult) = g*l.\n\nWhich implies that (u_mult * v_mult) must be equal to (g*l) / (k_root^2).\n\nBut wait, this depends on k_root. So for each edge, the product u_mult * v_mult must equal (g*l)/(k_root^2), but k_root is determined based on the component's structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is as follows:\n\n- For each connected component, perform a BFS or DFS to assign multipliers to each node relative to the root.\n\n- Once all multipliers are assigned, for each edge in the component, compute the expected product of the two nodes' values and compare it to g*l.\n\n- If any edge doesn't satisfy this condition, the entire system is invalid.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Build the graph with edges representing the constraints.\n\n2. For each connected component:\n\n   a. Choose a root node.\n\n   b. Assign each node a multiplier, starting from the root (multiplier 1). For each child, the multiplier is determined based on the edge.\n\n   c. For each edge in the component, compute the product of the two nodes' values (based on root and multipliers) and check if it matches g*l.\n\n3. If all edges satisfy their constraints, output the values. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nWait, but how to handle the multipliers correctly. Let me think with an example.\n\nSuppose we have a tree:\n\nRoot is a.\n\nEdge a-b: x_a * x_b = C1.\n\nWe can set x_b = C1 / x_a.\n\nBut if another edge comes in, say a-c: x_a * x_c = C2.\n\nThen x_c is C2 / x_a.\n\nBut when processing edges that are not from the root, how do we handle them?\n\nWait, perhaps for each component, the variables form a tree, and during traversal, we assign multipliers to each node. For each edge, when moving from parent to child, the child's x is determined by the product.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is similar to building a directed graph, where each edge represents a constraint on the product.\n\nSo, for example, in a BFS traversal:\n\nWhen visiting node u, for each neighbor v:\n\nIf v is not visited yet, then the edge (u, v) tells us that x_u * x_v = C. So x_v = C / x_u.\n\nThus, when assigning multipliers, we can represent this as x_v = (C / x_u) = (C) * (1 / x_u) = C * (1 / (k_u * multiplier_u)).\n\nWait, but x_u is k_u * multiplier_u, right? Or wait, perhaps the root's multiplier is 1, so x_root is k.\n\nWait, perhaps each node's x can be written as x = k * m, where m is a multiplier relative to the root's value k.\n\nSo for node u, x_u = k * m_u.\n\nFor node v, x_v = k * m_v.\n\nThe edge (u, v) gives x_u * x_v = C, so (k m_u) * (k m_v) = C → k² m_u m_v = C.\n\nSimilarly, for other edges.\n\nSo the approach is to build for each connected component a system where all edges must satisfy this equation.\n\nSo, for each connected component, the process is:\n\n1. Assign a root node, say r. Set x_r = k. Then, for each node u in the component, x_u = k * m_u.\n\n2. For each edge in the component, (u, v, g, l):\n\n   The product x_u * x_v must be g * l.\n\n   Substituting, (k m_u) * (k m_v) = g * l → k² m_u m_v = g * l.\n\n   Rearranged: m_u m_v = (g*l)/(k²).\n\n3. Now, the idea is that m_u and m_v can be determined based on the path from the root.\n\n   But how?\n\n   Let's think about the BFS approach again.\n\n   When processing an edge (u, v) that hasn't been processed yet, and v is unvisited:\n\n   We can express m_v in terms of m_u.\n\n   From the equation: m_v = (g*l)/(k²) / m_u.\n\n   So m_v = (g*l) / (k² m_u).\n\n   But since m_v must be a rational number (since all x_i are integers, and k is a variable), perhaps we can represent m_u and m_v as fractions to avoid floating points.\n\n   Alternatively, since the initial k is unknown, perhaps we can treat m as a ratio of integers.\n\nWait, but k is the root's value. So for the entire component, the value of k must be such that for all edges, m_u and m_v are integers because x_u and x_v must be integers.\n\nHmm, but k is a variable, so perhaps we can represent m_u as a fraction (numerator, denominator), and then ensure that for each edge, the product of m_u and m_v equals (g*l)/(k²), which can be rewritten as m_u * m_v = (g*l)/(k²).\n\nWait, but this seems a bit complex. Maybe it's better to model everything in terms of k, and for each edge, track the required m_u and m_v.\n\nWait, perhaps the process is as follows:\n\n- For each connected component, choose a root, say r.\n\n- Assign x_r = k, and m_r = 1 (since m_r is k / x_r, which is k/k=1).\n\n- Then, for each edge (u, v, g, l), we have x_u * x_v = g*l. So (m_u k) * (m_v k) = g*l → m_u m_v k² = g*l.\n\n   So m_u m_v = (g*l) / k².\n\n- Now, for each edge in the BFS tree, when we visit a new node, we can compute its m value based on the parent's m.\n\nBut since k is a variable, perhaps we can find constraints on k.\n\nWait, but for each edge, (g*l) must be divisible by k². So k² must divide all (g*l) for edges in the component.\n\nWait, but how? Because each edge's (g*l) may have different factors.\n\nWait, perhaps for all edges in the component, (g*l) must be equal to a multiple of k² times the product of the multipliers along the path.\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too abstract. Let's try to think of an example.\n\nSuppose the component is a tree: A connected to B connected to C.\n\nEdges:\n\nA-B: G1=2, L1=6 → product is 12.\n\nB-C: G2=3, L2=8 → product is 24.\n\nSo for each edge:\n\nx_A * x_B = 12 → x_A = 12 / x_B.\n\nx_B * x_C =24 → x_C =24 /x_B.\n\nBut also, what about A-C? Well, in the initial map, there's no direct edge between A and C. So the x_A and x_C could be anything, as long as they are connected via B.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the roads are part of the original map, but Pasha has only m roads. So perhaps the given m roads are the only ones he knows, and the rest are not present. So our solution must satisfy all the given m roads, but the others may not exist. So the system is defined only by the given m edges.\n\nSo back to the example.\n\nIn this case, the system has:\n\nx_A * x_B =12\n\nx_B * x_C =24\n\nSo x_A =12/(x_B)\n\nx_C=24/(x_B)\n\nBut then, what about the constraints on x_A and x_C? There's no direct edge between them, so their product can be anything. However, in the problem, the mushrooms must be integers, but otherwise, they can vary.\n\nSo, in this case, the system is underdetermined. So we can choose any x_B, and then x_A and x_C are determined.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that all edges are satisfied, but if there are no other edges, then any x_B is possible as long as x_A and x_C are integers.\n\nBut in reality, for all edges, their constraints must be satisfied, but for non-edges, there's no constraint.\n\nSo the system is only constrained by the given edges.\n\nSo, going back to the approach: for each connected component, we can assign variables based on the edges, and check if the assignments are possible.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: each connected component is a bipartition. Each node's value is either k or l/k, depending on whether it's even or odd steps away from the root.\n\nWait, that's more applicable to additive constraints, but perhaps in multiplicative cases, it's similar.\n\nWait, perhaps for each connected component, all variables can be expressed as k raised to some exponent, multiplied by a constant. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering the problem as a system of equations where each equation is x_u * x_v = C, and trying to find x_i that satisfies all.\n\nThis is a nonlinear system of equations, which is challenging to solve.\n\nBut perhaps for each connected component, the system is solvable only if the product of all edges in the component can be expressed as a function of k squared.\n\nWait, perhaps for each component, all edges must have (g*l) equal to k squared times some product of multipliers. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each connected component, the product of all (g*l) along any cycle must be a perfect square.\n\nBecause, imagine a cycle in the component. For example, a triangle a-b-c-a.\n\nEach edge contributes a product equation:\n\nx_a * x_b = C1 → (k m_a) (k m_b) = C1 → k² m_a m_b = C1.\n\nx_b * x_c = C2 → k² m_b m_c = C2.\n\nx_a * x_c = C3 → k² m_a m_c = C3.\n\nMultiplying all three equations: (k^6)(m_a^2 m_b^2 m_c^2) )= C1 C2 C3.\n\nSo (k^3 m_a m_b m_c )^2 = C1 C2 C3.\n\nThus, C1 C2 C3 must be a perfect square.\n\nBut for a general connected component with cycles, any cycle's product must be a perfect square.\n\nWait, but the component may not be a tree. So for any cycle in the component, the product of the edges' (g*l) must be a perfect square.\n\nThis suggests that for each connected component, all cycles must satisfy that the product of their edges' (g*l) is a perfect square.\n\nIf this is not the case, the system is impossible.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For each connected component, check all cycles and ensure that the product of (g*l) along each cycle is a perfect square.\n\n2. Additionally, for each edge, the product (g*l) must be divisible by k squared, but since k is a variable, perhaps the constraints on k can be handled.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the above condition about cycles is necessary but not sufficient. It ensures that the system is consistent within the component, but we also need to assign the variables correctly.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternative approach: model the problem as a bipartite graph where each node's value is a variable, and each edge imposes a product constraint. Then, assign each variable in terms of a base variable, and check for consistency.\n\nHere's an outline:\n\n- For each connected component:\n\n   a. Pick a root node, say r. Assign x_r = k (some integer).\n\n   b. Use BFS or DFS to traverse the component, assigning each node's value as x = (product of edges along the path from r) / k.\n\n   c. For each edge in the component, compute the expected product of the two nodes and verify it equals the given (g*l).\n\n   d. If any edge fails this check, the system is invalid.\n\nBut how to manage the division and ensure that x is an integer.\n\nWait, but in the BFS approach, when visiting a node u through a parent p, the edge (p, u) has x_p * x_u = C. So x_u = C / x_p.\n\nBut x_p is already expressed in terms of k, so x_u can be expressed in terms of k as well.\n\nWait, perhaps each node can be represented as x_u = (C1 * C2 * ... * Cn) / (k^d), where d is the depth from the root, and C's are the products from each edge along the path.\n\nBut this might lead to fractional values, which must be integers.\n\nSo perhaps, for each component, the product of all C's along any cycle must be a perfect square, ensuring that the exponents of primes in the numerator and denominator are even.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the key.\n\nSo, for each connected component:\n\n- All cycles in the component must have a product of (g*l) equal to a perfect square.\n\nIf this is not satisfied, the system is impossible.\n\nOtherwise, the system can be solved by assigning each variable in terms of the root's value, ensuring that all edge constraints are met.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. For each connected component:\n\n   a. Check all cycles in the component and ensure that for each cycle, the product of the (g*l) values is a perfect square.\n\n   b. If any cycle's product is not a perfect square, output NO.\n\n2. Once all cycles are checked, assign variables in each component based on a root variable k.\n\n   a. For each node, x_u = (product of C's along the path from root) / k^d, where d is the depth.\n\n3. Ensure that all x_u are integers.\n\nWait, but step 2 might involve a lot of computation. How can I efficiently assign x_u and check that all edges are satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each connected component, after checking that all cycles are squares, assign a value to the root and compute all other variables in terms of it, ensuring that all edges are satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, for each connected component:\n\n- Assign a variable k (the root's x value).\n\n- For each node u, express x_u as a function of k and the edges along the path from the root.\n\n- For each edge (u, v), compute x_u * x_v and check if it equals the given (g*l). This will give an equation that must be satisfied by k.\n\n- Collect all such equations for the component and solve for k.\n\n- If a solution exists, proceed; else, return NO.\n\nBut solving for k could be tricky, especially since k must be a positive integer.\n\nLet's think about this in more detail.\n\nEach edge in the component gives an equation involving k:\n\nx_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nBut x_u and x_v are expressed in terms of k.\n\nSo, for each edge, substituting the expressions for x_u and x_v in terms of k, we get an equation in k.\n\nThese equations can be combined to form a system that must be satisfied by k.\n\nIf there are no edges, then k can be any positive integer, and the system is underdetermined.\n\nBut if there are edges, the system must have a solution for k.\n\nSo, for a component with edges, the approach is:\n\n1. For each node, express x_u in terms of k. For example, x_u = f_u(k), where f_u is a rational function.\n\n2. For each edge (u, v, g, l), substitute f_u(k) and f_v(k) into the equation f_u(k)*f_v(k) = g*l.\n\n3. Simplify the resulting equation to find possible k values.\n\n4. Collect all such equations and find a common k that satisfies all.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive. Perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: represent each x_u as a product of primes raised to certain exponents, and then model the constraints on the exponents.\n\nBut this might complicate things further.\n\nWait, perhaps for each component, the product of all (g*l) for edges in the component must be a perfect square. Because, when you multiply all the edge constraints together, you get x_u^d multiplied by other variables, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each edge gives x_u * x_v = C, the product over all edges in a cycle would result in C1 * C2 * ... * Cn = (x_a)^{something} * ... etc., which might have to be a square.\n\nWait, perhaps for a component, the product of all (g*l) for the edges in any cycle must be a perfect square. Because when you multiply all the edge equations around a cycle, the left-hand side becomes x_u * x_v * ... * x_v * x_u (for a cycle of length n), which is (x_u x_v ...)^{something}. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for a cycle, the product of the edges is (x_a x_b) * (x_b x_c) * ... * (x_z x_a) = product of C's. This equals (x_a x_b x_c ... x_z)^2. So the product of the C's must be a square.\n\nYes! That makes sense.\n\nSo, for any cycle in a connected component, the product of the (g*l) of the edges in the cycle must be a perfect square. Because the product on the left is (x_a x_b x_c ... x_z)^2, which is a square.\n\nThus, for each connected component, for every cycle, the product of the (g*l) of the edges in the cycle must be a perfect square.\n\nIf any cycle in any component fails this, the answer is NO.\n\nThis is a necessary condition.\n\nIs it sufficient?\n\nNot necessarily. Because even if all cycles are squares, the system may still be inconsistent. For example, imagine a component with a cycle and a tree branch, but the way the variables are assigned creates a conflict.\n\nBut perhaps this condition is sufficient. Or perhaps it's just a necessary condition, and more checks are needed.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed under the assumption that this condition is sufficient.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Check all cycles. For each cycle, compute the product of (g*l) of its edges. If any product is not a perfect square, output NO.\n\nOnce all cycles are checked, proceed to assign variables.\n\nBut how to assign variables?\n\nEach variable can be expressed as x_u = (product of C's along the path from root) / k^d, where k is the root's value.\n\nBut since x_u must be an integer, the denominator must divide the numerator.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each component, the product of all (g*l) for edges in the component must be a square. Because, considering that each edge contributes C = g*l, and the product of all C's in the component is (x_u1 x_u2 ... xn)^2, which is a square.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me see: in a tree, there are no cycles. So the product of all C's in the component is the product of x_u * x_v for each edge. But for a tree, the product is (x_root) multiplied by the product of x_v for children, etc. Not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each component, the product of all (g*l) edges must be a square.\n\nNo, because in a tree, there are no cycles, so the product of all edges is not necessarily a square.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nAnother angle: since each edge contributes x_u * x_v = C, the product of all C's in a connected component is equal to the product of all x_i squared (if the component is a tree with n nodes, then the product is x1^2 * x2^2 * ... * xn^2).\n\nWait, no. For a tree with n nodes, the number of edges is n-1. Each edge contributes x_u * x_v, which when multiplied across all edges, would involve each x_i exactly twice (since each node is connected to two edges except for leaves). So the product would be (x1 x2 ... xn)^2. Thus, the product of all C's in the component is a square.\n\nAh! So for a tree, the product of all (g*l) edges is a square.\n\nBut for a component with cycles, the product of all (g*l) edges would also be a square, because any cycle's product is a square.\n\nWait, but for a component with both cycles and trees, the product of all C's is the product of all cycles' squares times the product of the tree's edges (which is a square). So overall, it's a square.\n\nThus, for any connected component, the product of all (g*l) edges is a square.\n\nSo perhaps the necessary condition is that, for each component, the product of all (g*l) edges in the component is a square.\n\nWait, but in the example I thought earlier, a tree, the product of all C's is a square. And for a component with a cycle, the product is a square because the cycle's product is a square and the tree part's product is a square.\n\nThus, the condition that the product of all (g*l) edges in each connected component is a square is necessary.\n\nBut is it sufficient?\n\nWell, let's see. Suppose a component's product is a square, but during assignment, some x_u ends up being non-integer.\n\nBut how likely is that?\n\nWait, but if the product is a square, then perhaps the system can be satisfied.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each connected component, check if the product of all (g*l) edges is a square.\n\n   a. Compute the product of all (g*l) for edges in the component.\n\n   b. Check if this product is a perfect square.\n\n   c. If any component's product is not a square, output NO.\n\n2. If all components pass this check, proceed to assign variables.\n\n3. For each component, choose a root, assign x_root = k (some integer), and express all x_u in terms of k.\n\n   a. For each edge (u, v), x_u * x_v = C.\n\n   b. Express x_v = C / x_u.\n\n   c. Substitute x_u = (path product) / k^depth.\n\n   d. Ensure that x_v is integer.\n\n4. After assigning all variables, verify that all edges' constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to choose k?\n\nWait, perhaps k can be any positive integer, but for each component, the product of all (g*l) edges is a square, which may imply that k can be chosen as the square root of that product divided by something.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is as follows:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\na. Compute the product of all (g*l) edges in the component. Let's call this P.\n\nb. Since P is a square, let s = sqrt(P).\n\nc. Then, for the component, the root's value k can be chosen as s divided by the product of all the multipliers along the BFS tree.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, for each component, the product of all (g*l) is s², so s is fixed.\n\nThen, when assigning the variables, the root's value k can be set as s divided by the product of all the variables in the BFS tree.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: for each component, the product of all (g*l) edges is s². So s is fixed for the component.\n\nThen, for the component, the root's value k must be s divided by the product of the variables in the component's BFS tree.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think with an example.\n\nSuppose a component is a single node with no edges. Then, the product is 1, so s is 1. The root's value can be any positive integer, since there are no edges to constrain it.\n\nIn another example: a single edge connecting two nodes, with (g*l) = 4. So s=2. Then, x_a * x_b =4. So possible solutions are (1,4), (2,2), (4,1), etc.\n\nBut the component's product is 4, which is s²=4.\n\nSo in this case, the root can be assigned, say, 2, leading to x_b = 4/(2) = 2. So x_a=2, x_b=2.\n\nBut another possibility is to assign root as 4, x_b=1.\n\nSo the choice of k affects the variables.\n\nThus, the system has multiple possible solutions, but the problem allows any valid solution.\n\nSo, for the problem, once the product condition is satisfied, the system is solvable.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. For each connected component:\n\n   a. Compute the product of all (g*l) edges in the component.\n\n   b. Check if this product is a perfect square. If not, output NO.\n\n2. If all components pass, assign variables:\n\n   a. For each component, choose a root.\n\n   b. Perform a BFS or DFS to assign each node's value as a function of the root's value k.\n\n   c. For each edge, check that the product of the two nodes' values equals (g*l).\n\nBut wait, since the product of all (g*l) is a square, and the component's variables are assigned in terms of k, perhaps the product equations will always be satisfied.\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps during the assignment phase, it's sufficient to choose any k and assign variables accordingly.\n\nBut then, how to choose k?\n\nWell, since the variables can be any positive integers, perhaps k can be any positive integer. But to minimize computation, perhaps choosing k as the square root of the product divided by some term.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent each component's variables in terms of the root's value, and then assign k to be the product of all (g*l) edges in the component, divided by the product of all variables in the component.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps for each component, the root's value can be assigned as the square root of the product of all (g*l) edges.\n\nBut the product is s², so the square root is s.\n\nThus, for each component, assign the root's value as s, and then compute all other variables accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where a single edge has (g*l) =4, s=2. Assigning root as 2, then x_b=2, which satisfies x_a * x_b =4.\n\nAnother example: a component with two edges forming a cycle.\n\nSay edges (A-B with C1=4, B-C with C2=4, A-C with C3=16).\n\nThe product of all three edges is 4*4*16 = 256, which is 16². So s=16.\n\nAssign root as 16.\n\nThen, x_A =16.\n\nEdge A-B: x_A * x_B =4 → x_B =4 /16 =0.25. Which is not integer. So this approach would fail.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So my earlier assumption was incorrect.\n\nSo, in this case, the component's product is a square (256=16²), but assigning the root as 16 leads to non-integer x_B and x_C.\n\nSo the approach of setting the root's value as s (sqrt of the product) is not sufficient.\n\nThus, the condition that the product is a square is necessary but not sufficient. We need another condition.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for each component, the product of all (g*l) edges is a square, but the way the variables are connected may require that the product of certain paths is also a square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue arises when the component contains a cycle, and the way the variables are assigned causes fractional values.\n\nSo perhaps, for each component, the product of all (g*l) edges is a square, and the system can be solved by assigning variables in a way that all x_i are integers.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternative Idea: Model each variable as a product of primes, and for each edge, track the exponents of primes in the product.\n\nEach edge's (g*l) can be factorized into primes, and each edge contributes to the exponents of each prime in the variables.\n\nThus, for each component, each prime's exponent in the product of (g*l) edges must be even, ensuring that the variables can be assigned as integers.\n\nBut this is essentially the same as the product being a square.\n\nWait, but in the previous example, the product is 256=2^8, which is a square, but when the root is set to 2^4=16, the variables end up being 2^0, 2^2, etc., but when you have edges that force x_u * x_v = 4, which is 2^2.\n\nSo in that case, x_A is 16 (2^4), x_B is 0.25 (2^-2), which is not allowed.\n\nThus, the approach of setting the root to s may not work.\n\nSo perhaps, for each component, the system can be solved by setting the root's value as the square root of the product of all (g*l) edges, divided by the product of all the variables in the BFS tree.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a system of equations, and the variables can be expressed in terms of logarithms, but that's probably not helpful for programming purposes.\n\nAnother Idea: For each component, the variables can be expressed as multiples of a base variable. For example, x_u = k * m_u, where m_u is a rational number, and k is the root's value.\n\nThen, for each edge, x_u * x_v = g*l → (k m_u)(k m_v) = g*l → k² m_u m_v = g/l → m_u m_v = (g*l)/(k²).\n\nSince m_u and m_v are rational, for all edges in the component, the product of their (g*l) must be compatible.\n\nBut this seems similar to earlier thoughts.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct approach is to model each component as a system where:\n\n- All cycles' products of (g*l) are squares.\n\n- The product of all (g*l) in the component is a square.\n\n- And for each edge, (g*l) must be divisible by k², where k is the root's value.\n\nWait, but how to find k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables can be assigned in such a way that for each component, the variables are of the form k^e, where e is an integer exponent.\n\nBut this would limit the possibilities and may not capture all possible integer solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each variable can be expressed as a multiple of a base variable, but again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the best way is to proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. For each connected component, check if the product of all (g*l) edges is a square. If not, output NO.\n\n2. For each connected component:\n\n   a. Perform BFS to assign each node's value in terms of the root's value.\n\n   b. For each edge, compute the expected product and verify it against (g*l).\n\n   c. If any edge fails, output NO.\n\nBut how to assign the root's value?\n\nWait, perhaps the root's value can be chosen as 1, and then see if all variables are integers.\n\nBut in cases where the component is a tree with no cycles, this may work.\n\nBut",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to reconstruct the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on the given roads, which include the GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts at the endpoints.

The product of the GCD and LCM values along any cycle must be a perfect square.
