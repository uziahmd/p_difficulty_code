Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the direction of each edge in a flow network such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain conditions. The goal is to make sure that the maximum flow is correctly represented, and the graph doesn't have cycles.\n\nHmm. So, the given graph is undirected, and each edge has a certain capacity. We need to assign a direction to each edge (either ai→bi or bi→ai) such that:\n\n1. For every vertex v (excluding source and sink), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges.\n3. There are no cycles in the directed graph.\n\nWait, but how does this relate to maximum flow? Oh right, because the way we direct the edges should form a flow network where the max flow from source to sink is achieved, and all intermediate nodes are balanced (their in-degree equals out-degree).\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nI remember that in a flow network with these properties, the edges form what's called a \"flow conservation\" at each node except the source and sink. Also, the graph must be a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) since there can't be cycles.\n\nOne approach I recall is using a BFS-like method to determine the direction of each edge based on the levels or distances from the source. This is similar to how we find the level graph in a flow network for algorithms like Dinic's.\n\nWait, yes! The idea is to assign directions based on the levels of nodes. Nodes at an even level (from the source) will send flow downstream, and those at an odd level will receive. But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics here.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to model this as a graph where each edge's direction is determined by whether the edge is part of the residual graph's tree after a BFS from the source. That might work.\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll construct the graph, keeping track of all edges and their capacities.\n\nThen, I need to determine for each edge whether it goes from ai to bi or vice versa. To do this, perhaps I can assign a potential (or level) to each node, and then decide the direction based on whether moving from ai to bi would increase or decrease the potential.\n\nThis sounds familiar—like the concept of the gradient in a graph. So, if the potential of ai is less than bi, then the edge ai→bi would have flow; else, it's bi→ai.\n\nBut how do I compute these potentials? Well, the potential should satisfy that the sum of potentials for incoming edges minus outgoing equals the flow (but wait, maybe it's more about the residual graph). Hmm.\n\nWait, another approach: the problem is essentially to find a way to orient the edges such that the graph is a DAG and satisfies flow conservation at all internal nodes. So, perhaps we can model this as a directed acyclic graph and compute the direction accordingly.\n\nI think the correct way is to use a BFS starting from the source, assigning levels to each node. Then, for each edge (u, v), if u is at level k and v is at level k+1, the edge goes from u to v. Otherwise, it goes from v to u.\n\nBut wait, that might not always work because some edges could be between nodes of the same level, which would require careful handling.\n\nAlternatively, during the BFS, for each node, when you explore its edges, you mark the direction based on whether you're going deeper into the BFS tree.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Perform a BFS starting from the source (node 1). Assign a level (distance from source) to each node.\n2. For each edge (u, v) with capacity c:\n   - If level[u] < level[v], then the edge direction is u → v.\n   - Else, the direction is v → u.\n\nDoes this ensure that all internal nodes have equal in-degree and out-degree?\n\nWait, no. Because for any node v (not source or sink), the sum of outgoing edges' capacities should equal the sum of incoming edges' capacities. But just setting the direction based on levels might not directly satisfy this.\n\nBut perhaps the way the BFS is structured ensures this. Because each edge that goes from a lower level to a higher level contributes to the outgoing flow of the lower level node and incoming flow of the higher level node. For edges between same levels, they can be directed either way, but perhaps the sum condition is still satisfied.\n\nWait, but how does this handle multiple edges and ensuring the flow is conserved?\n\nHmm, perhaps another way: the edges that go from u to v (u's level is less than v's) contribute to the flow leaving u and entering v. Edges that go from v to u (v's level is less than u's) contribute to the flow leaving v and entering u. But for nodes at the same level, if both u and v are at the same level, then the direction could be either way. But how to choose that to satisfy the sum condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the BFS assigns levels such that the source is level 0, and each subsequent level increases by one. Then, for edges between nodes at the same level, the direction can be chosen arbitrarily, but in practice, perhaps it's better to set them as u→v if u comes before v in the BFS order, but that may not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way the BFS explores edges ensures that the directions are correct.\n\nWait, another thought: the process of building a BFS tree ensures that the parent of a node is the first node that reaches it. So, any edge from the parent to child is directed away from the source. But other edges, like those between same-level nodes or back edges, can be directed in a way that maintains the balance.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each node, the number of edges leaving it (outgoing) equals the number of edges entering it (incoming), except for the source and sink.\n\nBut how do we ensure that the sum of capacities also equals?\n\nHmm, perhaps the initial approach is to perform BFS and assign directions based on levels, and then see if that satisfies the flow conditions.\n\nLet me try an example.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n3 2 10\n1 2 10\n3 1 5\n\nAfter BFS from node 1 (level 0):\n\n- Node 1 is level 0.\n- Node 2 is level 1 (since it's connected directly to 1).\n- Node 3 is level 1 (connected to 1 via the third edge, which is 3-1).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the third edge is 3-1, which is bidirectional. So in BFS, when processing node 1, we look at its edges. One edge is to node 2 (so node 2 is level 1). Another is to node 3 (so node 3 is level 1).\n\nSo, during BFS, node 2 and 3 are both at level 1.\n\nNow, for each edge:\n\nEdge 3-2 with c=10: since both are at level 1, direction can be either way. So, perhaps we can choose 3→2 or 2→3.\n\nIn the sample output, for the first test case, the edges are directed as 3→2 (direction 1), 1→2 (direction 0), and 3→1 (direction 1). Wait, wait no. Wait the output is '1\\n0\\n1', which corresponds to the three edges in the order given.\n\nWait, the first edge in the input is 3 2 10. So di is 1, meaning direction is 3→2. Second edge is 1 2 10, di is 0, so 1→2. Third edge is 3 1 5, di is 1, so 3→1.\n\nSo, in this setup, node 3 has two outgoing edges: to 2 and to 1. Node 2 has one incoming (3→2) and one outgoing (1→2). Node 1 has one outgoing edge (to 2), and one incoming edge (3→1, but wait, node 1 is the source, so it shouldn't have any incoming edges.\n\nAh, that's a problem. In the sample, node 1 has an incoming edge from 3 with capacity 5. But according to the problem statement, the source (node 1) should have no incoming edges.\n\nWait, that suggests that my initial approach is incorrect, because in the sample solution, the edge 3→1 is allowed, but according to the problem statement, node 1 must have no incoming edges.\n\nSo, that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm. So, what's wrong with my initial idea?\n\nOh right, because the sample solution has the edge 3→1, which is directed towards node 1, the source. But according to the problem's second condition, the source must have no incoming edges. So, that's a problem.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, it says that 5 units pass directly from source to sink. Wait, the source is node 1, and the sink is node 3. So the edge 3→1 is actually from node 3 to node 1, which is the opposite of the direction. So perhaps that edge is being directed as 1→3, but in the sample output, it's directed as 3→1. How does that fit?\n\nWait, the sample output's third edge (3-1, c=5) is directed as 3→1. So node 1 is receiving 5 units from node 3. But according to the problem's conditions, node 1 (source) cannot have any incoming edges.\n\nThis seems contradictory. So perhaps I misunderstood the sample.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample note: It says that 10 units pass through the path, and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink. So the edge from source to sink is 1→3, which is present with c=5. So that edge must be directed as 1→3, but in the input, the third edge is 3-1 with c=5. So, in the output, the third edge is directed as 3→1, which is the reverse. So why does the source have an incoming edge?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sample analysis.\n\nWait, the first edge is 3-2, 10. So in the output, it's directed as 3→2. Second edge is 1-2, 10, directed as 1→2. Third edge is 3-1, 5, directed as 3→1. So node 1 is receiving 5 from 3. But according to the problem's condition, node 1 must have no incoming edges.\n\nWait, that can't be. So perhaps I've misunderstood the sample.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's output is different. Let me re-examine the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3\n3 2 10\n1 2 10\n3 1 5\n\nSample Output:\n\n1\n0\n1\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nEdge 1: 3→2 (di=1)\nEdge 2: 1→2 (di=0)\nEdge 3: 3→1 (di=1)\n\nSo, for node 1, it has an outgoing edge (edge 2) and an incoming edge (edge 3). But according to the problem, node 1 should have no incoming edges.\n\nSo that's a problem. That suggests that my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nAh, wait! The problem says that the directed graph should not have cycles. So, perhaps node 1 having an incoming edge is allowed if it's part of a DAG. But according to the problem's second condition, the source (node 1) must have no incoming edges. So, in the sample, the edge 3→1 is directed towards node 1, which is the source, thus violating the condition. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the sample. Let me check the sample note again.\n\nIn the note, it says that 10 units pass through the path, and 5 units pass directly from source to sink. So, the 5 units must be via the edge 1→3. But in the input, the third edge is 3-1 with c=5. So in the output, this edge is directed as 3→1. So, the flow is 5 units from 3 to 1, but that's into the source. That can't be correct.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the sample's output is incorrect, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample's output is the other way around. Maybe the third edge is directed as 1→3, which would allow the flow to go from source to sink.\n\nWait, but the sample output says for the third edge, di is 1, meaning direction is 3→1.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the edges are undirected. So each edge can be directed either way. The task is to find a direction for each edge such that:\n\n1. For each v (1 < v < n), in-degree equals out-degree.\n2. Source has no incoming edges.\n3. No cycles.\n\nSo, for the sample, the source is node 1, and the sink is node 3.\n\nSo, node 1 can only have outgoing edges.\n\nSo, in the sample, the third edge is 3-1. So, in the output, it must be directed as 1→3. Because otherwise, node 1 would have an incoming edge, which is not allowed.\n\nBut in the sample output, it's directed as 3→1, which would mean node 1 has an incoming edge of 5 units. That violates the condition.\n\nSo perhaps the sample output is wrong, but that can't be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in interpreting the sample's note. Let me read the note again.\n\nNote: In the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path ... and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nSo the 5 units are via the edge from source to sink. So that implies that the edge 1→3 is present, with c=5. But in the input, the third edge is 3-1, c=5. So in the output, the direction must be 1→3, which would make the flow from source to sink. But according to the sample output, the third edge is directed as 3→1, which is the opposite.\n\nThis is conflicting. So perhaps the sample output is incorrect, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is referring to the flow passing through 1→3, which is the edge from source to sink, and that's separate from the edge 3→1.\n\nWait, perhaps the 5 units flow through the edge 1→3, which is the third edge in the input. So the direction is 1→3, which would make the flow correct. But in the sample output, the third edge is directed as 3→1, which would not allow that.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nPerhaps the way to model the directions is to consider the edges as part of a BFS tree, but also ensure that the source doesn't have any incoming edges.\n\nWait, but perhaps the BFS approach isn't sufficient, and I need to consider the structure of the flow network.\n\nAnother approach: the problem requires that the directed graph is a DAG and satisfies flow conservation at each node except the source and sink.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to model the graph as a directed acyclic graph where all edges go from lower level to higher level in the BFS traversal. But that might not cover all cases.\n\nWait, but in the sample, node 3 is connected to node 1, which is the source. So in BFS, node 3 would be at level 1, same as node 2. So, the edge 3→1 would have direction 3→1, but that's into the source, which is invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps the BFS approach needs to be modified.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue is that in the BFS, the edges are considered in a way that the source is not revisited. So, any edges leading back to the source (like 3→1) should be directed towards the source, but that's invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to perform a BFS, but for edges that connect a node to a node with a lower level, we have to decide their direction to prevent creating incoming edges to the source.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to build the BFS tree, and then for edges not part of the tree (back edges), we can choose their direction such that the source doesn't have incoming edges.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated.\n\nAnother thought: the problem is similar to finding a DAG where the flow conservation holds. So, perhaps the way to model it is to find a way to orient the edges such that the graph is a DAG and the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution involves using the fact that the graph is a bipartitioned DAG, where each edge goes from a lower level to higher level.\n\nWait, but earlier that didn't work for the sample.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that for each edge, the direction is from the node with higher BFS level to the one with lower level. Or vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the levels. Let's think again.\n\nSuppose I perform a BFS starting from the source. Each node has a level, which is its distance from the source.\n\nFor an undirected edge u-v, if level[u] < level[v], then the edge is directed as u→v. Otherwise, it's directed as v→u.\n\nBut in the sample, node 1 is level 0. Node 2 and 3 are level 1. So, for edge 3-2: level[3]=1 == level[2]=1, so direction can be either way. Similarly, for edge 3-1: level[3]=1 > level[1]=0, so direction is 3→1.\n\nBut that gives node 1 an incoming edge, which is invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the problem requires that the graph forms a directed tree from the source to the sink, with each intermediate node having in-degree equal to out-degree. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that each node except the source and sink must have equal in-degree and out-degree. So, the graph must have an Eulerian trail from source to sink.\n\nWait, that rings a bell. Because for a directed graph to have an Eulerian trail, at most one node (the start) has out-degree = in-degree +1, at most one node (the end) has in-degree = out-degree +1, and all others have equal in and out degrees.\n\nSo, the directed graph must have an Eulerian trail from source to sink.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to constructing such a graph.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute the in-degree and out-degree for each node (except source and sink).\n2. Ensure that for each node, in-degree equals out-degree.\n3. Ensure that the graph has a path from source to sink without cycles.\n\nWait, but how to compute the direction of edges to achieve this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal in-degree and out-degree. The source has out-degree higher than in-degree, and the sink has in-degree higher than out-degree.\n\nWait, but how to determine the directions.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to model the graph as a directed graph where each edge is directed from the node with lower potential to the node with higher potential. But again, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to perform a BFS, assign levels, and for each edge, direct it from the node with the lower level to the higher level. Then, for edges between nodes of the same level, perhaps we can arbitrarily choose the direction, but ensure that the source has no incoming edges.\n\nWait, but how to manage that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to perform a BFS, and for edges that connect a node to a node with a lower level, we have to reverse their direction so that the edge points towards the source, but that seems counterintuitive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the level graph for the maximum flow. But I'm not familiar with that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for an algorithm or approach that can determine the direction of edges to satisfy the given conditions.\n\nUpon thinking, I recall that in a maximum flow network, the edges can be oriented such that the residual graph is a DAG, and this orientation can be found using a BFS-based approach, assigning directions based on the level of the nodes.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Assign a level to each node via BFS.\n- For each edge u-v, if level[u] < level[v], direct it u→v; else, v→u.\n\nThis ensures that the residual graph is a DAG, which allows for the maximum flow to be computed efficiently.\n\nBut in our problem, the edges are given with capacities, and we have to assign directions such that the sum of incoming and outgoing flows are equal for all internal nodes, and source has no incoming edges.\n\nWait, but in this approach, the source (level 0) will have edges directed away from it, and the sink (highest level) will have edges directed into it.\n\nSo, for internal nodes, their in-degree equals their out-degree in the directed graph.\n\nYes! Because for each node v (not source or sink), the edges coming into it are from nodes with lower levels (since level[v] is higher), and the edges going out are to nodes with higher levels. So, the in-degree equals the out-degree.\n\nWait, no. Because for nodes with the same level, the edges between them can be directed either way, which could affect the in-degree and out-degree.\n\nSo, for nodes at the same level, how to direct the edges.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to, for each edge between nodes of the same level, direct it from the node that was discovered earlier in BFS.\n\nWait, but in BFS, nodes are discovered in order of increasing level. So, for same-level nodes, the order in which they are visited can vary, but within the same level.\n\nSo, perhaps for same-level edges, we can direct them in a way that the direction is away from the node that was processed first in the BFS.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the direction can be arbitrary as long as the overall in-degree equals out-degree.\n\nBut in the sample case, the approach fails because node 1 has an incoming edge.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to perform a BFS and assign levels, then for each edge, direct it from the lower level to higher level, and for edges between same levels, direct them away from the node that is closer to the source.\n\nBut how to handle the edges that would create an incoming edge to the source.\n\nWait, perhaps the BFS approach will naturally not have any edges pointing back to the source.\n\nBecause in BFS, the source is processed first, and all its adjacent nodes are at level 1. Any edges from those nodes back to the source would have the same level, so according to the rule, the direction would be towards the source, but that would create an incoming edge to the source.\n\nWhich is not allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to treat the edges that connect to the source specially.\n\nWait, perhaps the BFS-based approach works for all edges except those connected to the source, which need to be directed away.\n\nSo, in the sample, the edge 3-1 is connected to the source. So, according to the BFS approach, since level[3] is 1 and level[1] is 0, the direction is 3→1, which is into the source. Which is invalid.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to fix this is to change the direction of edges that would point to the source.\n\nSo, for any edge u-v where v is the source, we must direct it as v→u, i.e., from the source to u.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the edge is 3→1, which is directed as 3→1, but that's into the source. So, perhaps we should reverse it.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is:\n\n- For each edge u-v, if u is the source, then the direction must be u→v.\n\nSimilarly, for edges where v is the source, direction must be v→u.\n\nWait, but that might not always be possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the edge connected to the source must be directed away from the source, regardless of levels.\n\nSo, in the sample, the edge 3-1 must be directed as 1→3.\n\nBut according to BFS levels, 3 is at level 1, 1 is at level 0. So, in the initial approach, it's directed as 3→1, which is bad.\n\nThus, perhaps the solution is to modify the BFS approach to handle the source's edges specially.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Perform a BFS starting from the source, assigning levels to each node.\n2. For each edge u-v:\n   a. If u is the source, direct it as u→v.\n   b. Else if v is the source, direct it as v→u.\n   c. Else, if level[u] < level[v], direct u→v.\n   d. Else, direct v→u.\n\nWait, but this might not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any edge that connects a node to the source, we have to direct it away from the source, regardless of levels.\n\nSo, for any edge (u, source), the direction must be u→source.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the source can't have incoming edges.\n\nWait, for any edge that connects a node to the source, the direction must be from the node to the source. So, the source can't have any incoming edges.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For any edge that connects to the source (i.e., one of the endpoints is 1), direct it away from the source. So, if the edge is u-1, then it's directed u→1.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because the source can't have any incoming edges. So, any edge connected to the source must be directed away from it.\n\nSo, for each edge that includes the source (u=1 or v=1), the direction is from the non-source node to the source.\n\nSo, in the sample, the third edge is 3-1. So, it must be directed as 3→1. But that causes node 1 to have an incoming edge, which is invalid.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nNo, wait, the source must have no incoming edges. So any edge connected to the source must be directed away from the source.\n\nThus, for any edge (u, 1), the direction must be u→1. But that would mean the source has an outgoing edge, which is allowed, but no incoming edges.\n\nSo, for the sample, the third edge is 3-1. So, in the output, it's directed as 3→1. But that means the source (node 1) has an incoming edge of 5 units, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, this is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the way the BFS is performed ensures that the edge is directed correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BFS approach is not the right way, and I need to think differently.\n\nAnother approach: Since the directed graph must be a DAG, and satisfy flow conservation, perhaps the correct way is to model the edges as part of a spanning tree where the source is the root, and all edges point away from the root.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case, as the graph may have multiple edges.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that for each node v (1 < v <n), the sum of incoming and outgoing edges are equal. So, the in-degree equals the out-degree for each internal node.\n\nThus, the directed graph must have an Eulerian trail from the source to the sink.\n\nWhich implies that the directed graph is connected, has exactly zero or two nodes with unequal in-degree and out-degree (the source and sink).\n\nSo, the source will have out-degree = in-degree + 1, and the sink will have in-degree = out-degree + 1. All other nodes have in-degree = out-degree.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding such a direction for each edge.\n\nSo, how to find such a direction.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to use a BFS-based approach to assign levels, then for each edge, direct it from the lower level to higher level. But as the sample shows, this may cause the source to have incoming edges.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct approach is to perform BFS, then for each edge, if it connects a node to the source, we must direct it away from the source.\n\nSo, modifying the BFS approach:\n\n1. Perform BFS from the source, assign levels.\n2. For each edge u-v:\n   a. If u is the source or v is the source:\n      i. Direct the edge away from the source. So, if u is the source, direction is u→v.\n      ii. Else, if v is the source, direction is v→u.\n   b. Else, if level[u] < level[v], direction is u→v.\n   c. Else, direction is v→u.\n\nDoes this help with the sample?\n\nIn the sample, the third edge is 3-1. So, since 1 is the source, the direction is 3→1. But that creates an incoming edge to the source, which is invalid.\n\nHmm, this approach doesn't solve the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in the BFS approach, the edge from 3 to 1 is directed towards the source, which is invalid. Thus, perhaps we need to reverse this edge.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BFS approach should be modified to avoid including the source in the level assignment.\n\nWait, perhaps the BFS starts at the source, but all edges connected to the source are directed away, and the rest are directed based on levels.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n- For any edge connected to the source, direct it away from the source. So, the source's edges are all outgoing.\n\n- For other edges, direct them from lower level to higher level.\n\nThus, for the sample:\n\nEdge 3-1 is connected to the source, so direction is 3→1.\n\nBut that brings us back to the problem where node 1 has an incoming edge.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct way is to not include edges connected to the source in the BFS, as they are handled separately.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Separate the edges into two categories: those connected to the source, and others.\n\n2. For edges connected to the source, direct them away from the source.\n\n3. For other edges, perform BFS from the source, assign levels, and direct them from lower level to higher level.\n\nThis way, the source's edges are handled first, and other edges are directed according to levels.\n\nIn the sample:\n\n- Edge 3-1 is connected to the source. So, it's directed as 3→1.\n\n- Edge 1-2 is not connected to the source (both ends are not the source?), no. Wait, the edge is 1-2, so it's connected to the source. So, it's directed as 1→2.\n\n- Edge 3-2 is not connected to the source. So, during BFS, node 3 is at level 1, node 2 is at level 1. So, the edge can be directed either way.\n\nIn the sample, the direction is 3→2.\n\nThus, the directions are:\n\n1→2 (edge 2), 3→1 (edge 3), 3→2 (edge 1).\n\nWait, but node 1 now has an incoming edge from 3, which is invalid.\n\nSo, this approach is still flawed.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the solution is to model the graph as a tree, with the source as root, and all edges directed away from the source. But that's only possible if the graph is a tree, which it's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to perform a BFS, but for edges that would create an incoming edge to the source, reverse them.\n\nSo, after performing the BFS and directing edges based on levels, check if any edges are directed towards the source. If so, reverse them.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the BFS should be modified to ignore edges that would create incoming edges to the source.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to perform BFS, and for each edge, if it leads to the source, we don't process it, and instead, we have to direct it away.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The problem requires that the directed graph is a DAG, and the source has no incoming edges. So, the source must have all its edges directed away from it.\n\nThus, for any edge (u, v) where u is the source, it must be directed as u→v.\n\nFor edges where v is the source, it must be directed as v→u.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the edge is 3-1. So, the source is 1, so the edge must be directed as 1→3.\n\nWhich would allow the flow to go from source to sink.\n\nThus, in the sample, the third edge must be directed as 1→3, not 3→1.\n\nWhich aligns with the sample note that 5 units pass directly from source to sink.\n\nSo, how to handle this.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor any edge (u, v), if either u or v is the source, then the direction is from the non-source node to the source.\n\nOtherwise, the direction is based on BFS levels.\n\nSo, in the sample, the third edge is 3-1. Since 1 is the source, the direction is 3→1, but that brings flow into the source. Which is invalid.\n\nWait, that's a contradiction.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to always direct edges away from the source, regardless of the other end.\n\nThus, for any edge (u, v), if u is the source, then the direction is u→v. If v is the source, then the direction is v→u.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the third edge is 3-1, so direction is 1→3, which is correct.\n\nBut according to the sample output, it's directed as 3→1.\n\nSo, I'm clearly missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should refer to the problem's note.\n\nThe note says that 5 units pass directly from source to sink. So, the edge 1→3 exists, which is the third edge in the input.\n\nThus, in the output, the third edge must be directed as 1→3, which is di=0 (since the input is 3 1 5, and di=0 means 1→3).\n\nBut according to the sample output, the third edge's di is 1, which would be 3→1.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample output is wrong, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the sample input.\n\nWait, the third edge is 3 1 5. So, the output is 1, meaning 3→1.\n\nBut according to the note, 5 units pass from source to sink via that edge. So, the direction must be 1→3, which would be di=0.\n\nThus, the sample output's third line is incorrect.\n\nBut that can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note refers to a different edge.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is referring to the edge from 1 to 2, which is 10 units.\n\nNo, that's part of the path.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nMaybe the correct way is to realize that the BFS approach is insufficient, and that the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nWe can model the problem as finding a way to assign directions to the edges such that:\n\n- The source has no incoming edges.\n- The graph is a DAG.\n- For each internal node, in-degree equals out-degree.\n\nThis is exactly the definition of an Eulerian trail from the source to the sink. So, the directed graph must have an Eulerian trail.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding such a direction for each edge.\n\nTo find this, perhaps the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. Compute for each node, the in-degree and out-degree.\n\n2. Ensure that all internal nodes have equal in and out degrees.\n\n3. Ensure that the graph is a DAG.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nWait, but the problem states that a solution always exists.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find a way to assign directions such that the in-degree equals out-degree for all internal nodes, and the source has no incoming edges, and the sink has no outgoing edges.\n\nThus, the algorithm could be:\n\n- For each edge, decide the direction such that:\n\n   a. If the edge is connected to the source, direct it away.\n\n   b. For other edges, direct them in a way that the in-degree and out-degree are balanced.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Use the fact that the graph is connected and assign directions such that the in-degree and out-degree for each node (except source and sink) are equal.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- For each edge, if it connects the source to another node, direct it away from the source.\n\n- For other edges, perform a BFS and assign directions based on the levels.\n\nBut in the sample, this approach would direct the third edge into the source, which is invalid.\n\nThus, perhaps the correct way is to:\n\n- For any edge that connects to the source, direct it away.\n\n- For other edges, perform BFS and direct them from lower to higher levels.\n\nThus, in the sample:\n\n- Edge 3-1 is connected to the source, so directed as 3→1. But that's into the source, which is invalid.\n\nThus,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the direction of each edge in a flow network such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain conditions: the source has no incoming edges, the sink has no outgoing edges, and for every other node, the sum of incoming edges equals the sum of outgoing edges. Additionally, the graph must be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Perform BFS starting from the source node to assign levels to each node.
