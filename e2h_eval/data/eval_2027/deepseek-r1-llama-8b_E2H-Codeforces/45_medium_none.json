There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where n players participate in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, so for example, when n=2, there's only one game, so the output is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games: first against someone, then against another. But wait, how does that work? Because after the first game, the winner has one game played. Then, the next opponent must have either 0 or 1 game played. Since the tournament is knockout, the next opponent would have just come from their own matches. So maybe the structure allows for that.\n\nLet me think about how the tournament grid is arranged. The main thing is that the winner can't have too many games because each opponent they face must have a similar number of games played.\n\nWait, what's the maximum possible games? It seems like this is similar to building a binary tree where each node represents a game, and the depth of the tree would determine the maximum number of games the winner plays. But with the additional constraint about the difference in games between two players before they face each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this problem is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because each time, the number of players required grows in a way similar to Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet me think about small values:\n\nn=2: 1 game.\nn=3: 2 games.\nn=4: 2 games? Or is it more?\nWait, no. Wait for n=4, the maximum is 2. Because the winner could beat two others, but maybe not more. Or wait, let's see the sample input given: for n=10, the output is 4. How does that happen?\n\nWait, the note explains that for n=4, the answer is 2. Because the winner can't play against all three others. So in that case, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the maximum number of games is the largest m such that the sum of the first m Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, maybe it's the maximum m where F(m+2) <= n, where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=2, etc. Because each step requires adding the previous two steps.\n\nWait, let's try to model this. Let's say the maximum number of games the winner can play is k. Then, to reach k games, the number of required players is something like the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Because each new opponent requires that their previous game count is either k-1 or k-2, leading to a Fibonacci-like progression.\n\nFor example, for k=1: you need 2 players (Fibonacci 3 is 2).\nFor k=2: you need 3 players (Fibonacci 4 is 3).\nWait, wait, maybe not exactly, but let's see:\n\nWait, for k=1, the minimum players needed are 2 (since 2 players, one game).\nFor k=2, the minimum is 3. Because the winner plays two games, each time facing someone who has either 0 or 1 games. So in the first game, the opponent has 0. Then, in the second game, the opponent must have 1 game, meaning they won once. So the total is 3 players.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of players required for k games is Fib(k+2). Let me check:\n\nk=1: Fib(3)=2 → correct.\nk=2: Fib(4)=3 → correct.\nk=3: Fib(5)=5. So for 5 players, the winner can have 3 games.\nWait, how? Let's see:\n\nPlayers: 5.\n\nRound 1: 5/2 = 2 matches, 2 winners.\nRound 2: 2 matches again, but wait, the structure might be different.\n\nBut perhaps the way the matches are arranged is such that the winner's path requires that each step adds a certain number of players.\n\nSo, for k games, the minimal number of players is Fib(k+2). So to find the maximum k where Fib(k+2) ≤ n.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nGiven the sample input:\n\nn=10: the output is 4.\n\nWhat is Fib(6) = 8, Fib(7)=13.\n\nSo for k=4: Fib(6)=8 ≤10. And Fib(7)=13>10. So yes, the maximum is 4.\n\nAnother sample: n=4.\n\nFib(6)=8>4. So the maximum k where Fib(k+2)<=4 is k=2, since Fib(4)=3<=4, and Fib(5)=5>4. So output is 2.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: Fib(4)=3<=3, Fib(5)=5>3. So k=2.\n\nWait, but earlier when n=3, the maximum is 2, which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems to be: compute the maximum k where Fib(k+2) ≤n. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute Fibonacci numbers until Fib(k) exceeds 1e6 or something, but for n up to 1018, we don't need to go very far.\n\n2. Find the largest k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate the Fibonacci sequence, starting with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=2, Fib(3)=3, Fib(4)=5, Fib(5)=8, etc.\n\nWait, wait, let's clarify the Fibonacci sequence indices. Maybe I should define the sequence as follows:\n\nLet’s define Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=2, Fib(3)=3, Fib(4)=5, Fib(5)=8, etc.\n\nWait, wait, no. Let me think again. Let me see:\n\nIf k=1: requires 2 players (Fib(3)=2).\n\nk=2: requires 3 players (Fib(4)=3).\n\nk=3: requires 5 players (Fib(5)=5).\n\nk=4: requires 8 players (Fib(6)=8).\n\nSo, the minimal players needed for k games is Fib(k+2).\n\nThus, for each n, the maximum k is the largest integer where Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute the Fibonacci sequence until Fib(k+2) > n. Then the maximum k is the last k where Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nSo, to implement this, I can precompute the Fibonacci numbers, and for each n, find the maximum k.\n\nHow to compute Fib numbers up to n=1018?\n\nLet's calculate the Fib numbers until they exceed 1018.\n\nLet me list them:\n\nFib(1) = 1\n\nFib(2) = 2\n\nFib(3) = 3\n\nFib(4) = 5\n\nFib(5) = 8\n\nFib(6) = 13\n\nFib(7) = 21\n\nFib(8) = 34\n\nFib(9) = 55\n\nFib(10) = 89\n\nFib(11) = 144\n\nFib(12) = 233\n\nFib(13) = 377\n\nFib(14) = 610\n\nFib(15) = 987\n\nFib(16) = 1597\n\nSo for n=1018, Fib(15)=987 ≤1018, Fib(16)=1597>1018. So the maximum k is 15-2=13? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is k = the index minus 2.\n\nWait, Fib(k+2) ≤n. So for Fib(15)=987, which is for k=13. Because 15-2=13.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFib(1) corresponds to k= -1? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial Fib numbers are considered as Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, etc. Or perhaps my indexing is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model Fib(0) = 0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for k=1, the minimal players is 2. Which is Fib(3)=2.\n\nSo the mapping is k → Fib(k+2).\n\nSo for k=1: Fib(3)=2.\n\nk=2: Fib(4)=3.\n\nk=3: Fib(5)=5.\n\nSo on.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Precompute Fib numbers until we reach Fib(m) > 1018.\n\n- For each n, find the maximum k where Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nSo for n=1018, the maximum k is the largest such that Fib(k+2) ≤1018.\n\nLooking back, Fib(15)=987, Fib(16)=1597.\n\nSo 987 ≤1018 <1597.\n\nThus, k+2=15 → k=13.\n\nSo the maximum is 13 games.\n\nWait, but what about n=987? Then k+2=15, so k=13.\n\nWait, but for n=1597, k+2=16 →k=14.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as:\n\nGenerate Fib numbers up to beyond 1018.\n\nFor each n, iterate through the Fib list, and find the largest Fib[i] ≤n. Then k = i-2.\n\nBut wait, for Fib[i], the corresponding k is i-2.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\ni=3 → Fib[3]=2 → k=1.\n\ni=4 →3 →k=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n1. Generate a list of Fibonacci numbers starting from Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, etc., until Fib(m) exceeds 1018.\n\n2. For each n, find the largest Fib[i] ≤n. Then, the maximum k is i-2.\n\n3. If no such Fib[i] exists (which can't happen since Fib starts at 2 and n≥2), return 0.\n\nWait, but for n=2, Fib[3]=2 is the first entry, so i=3, k=1. Correct.\n\nNow, how to generate the Fib list.\n\nInitialize a list fibs, with Fib[3]=2, Fib[4]=3, etc. So:\n\nfib_list = [2, 3, 5, 8, ... ]\n\nWait, no, better to start with Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to generate the Fibonacci sequence starting from 0,1, and then each subsequent term is the sum of previous two.\n\nOnce I have this list, I can loop through it and for each n, find the maximum Fib[i] that is <=n.\n\nThen, the maximum k is i-2, because Fib[i] corresponds to k+2 = i.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the indexes.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nLet me reindex the Fibonacci sequence as follows:\n\nfibs = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...]\n\nWhere fibs[0] =0, fibs[1]=1, fibs[2]=1, fibs[3]=2, fibs[4]=3, etc.\n\nSo, for a given n, the maximum i where fibs[i] <=n.\n\nThen, the maximum k is i-2.\n\nBecause:\n\ni=3 → fibs[3]=2 → k=1.\n\ni=4 →3 →k=2.\n\ni=5→5→k=3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, n=10.\n\nLooking for the largest i where fibs[i] <=10.\n\nfibs[6]=13>10. So i=5, fibs[5]=5≤10. So k=5-2=3? Wait, but in the sample input for n=10, the output is 4.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, wait no. Because according to the sample, when n=10, the maximum k is 4.\n\nBut according to this method, i=5 gives k=3, but perhaps I'm missing higher i.\n\nWait, perhaps my Fibonacci indexing is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let's re-examine the problem.\n\nWe need to find the largest m such that the sum of Fib(1) + Fib(2) + ... + Fib(m) <=n.\n\nNo, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required for the maximum games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number.\n\nSo for k=4, the minimal number of players is Fib(6)=8.\n\nSo for n=10, Fib(6)=8 <=10, Fib(7)=13>10.\n\nThus, the maximum k is 4.\n\nSo in this case, the index is 6, which is for k=4.\n\nSo the index in the Fibonacci list is 6, which gives k=4.\n\nSo how does this fit into the earlier idea?\n\nIn this case, the maximum i where fibs[i] <=n is 6, and k=4.\n\nSo perhaps the formula is k = i-2, but wait, i is 6, so 6-2=4. Yes.\n\nSo in the earlier example for n=10, the i is 6, and k=4.\n\nSo, the approach is to find the largest i where fibs[i] <=n, then k=i-2.\n\nSo, for n=10, fibs[6]=8<=10, fibs[7]=13>10. So i=6, k=4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers, starting from 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ..., until the number exceeds 1018.\n\n2. For each input n, find the largest i where fibs[i] <=n.\n\n3. The maximum number of games is k = i-2.\n\nSo, now, the code needs to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to 1018.\n\nLet me think about how to generate this list.\n\nI can generate it iteratively:\n\nfibs = [0, 1]  # fibs[0]=0, fibs[1]=1.\n\nfor i in range(2, some_max):\n    next_fib = fibs[i-1] + fibs[i-2]\n    if next_fib > 1018:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nWait, but wait, fibs[2] should be 1, fibs[3]=2, etc.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nfibs[0] =0\n\nfibs[1]=1\n\nfibs[2]=fibs[1]+fibs[0}=1+0=1.\n\nfibs[3}=fibs[2]+fibs[1}=1+1=2.\n\nfibs[4}=fibs[3}+fibs[2}=2+1=3.\n\nfibs[5}=5, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nGenerate the Fibonacci sequence, starting with 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, etc., until the next number exceeds 1018.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for each n, find the largest i where fibs[i] <=n.\n\nThen, k = i-2.\n\nBut wait, what if n is exactly fibs[i]? Then it's fine.\n\nSo, for example, n=8.\n\nfibs[6}=8.\n\ni=6, so k=4.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about n=5? fibs[5}=5.\n\ni=5, k=3.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet me think: for n=5, the maximum games is 3.\n\nBecause:\n\nPlayers 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nArrange the tournament such that the winner plays 3 games.\n\nHow?\n\nRound 1: 5 players, arrange into 2 matches. Winners are 1, 3, 5.\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is that the winner can play against opponents in a way that their previous game counts are within 1.\n\nSo, the first game: player A vs B.\n\nA wins, so A has 1 game, B is out.\n\nSecond game: A vs C. C has 0 games. So A has 2 games.\n\nThird game: A vs D. D has 0 games. So A has 3 games.\n\nWait, but D must have played 0 games before, which implies he hasn't played any previous matches.\n\nBut in a knockout tournament, that's impossible because each player except the winner loses once.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games is determined by the Fibonacci-based approach, regardless of the actual tournament arrangement.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. However, the sample inputs match this approach.\n\nSo, for the code, I'll proceed with this logic.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the Fibonacci list as described.\n\nFind the largest i where fibs[i] <=n.\n\nCompute k = i-2.\n\nIf k is negative (like n=1, but n>=2), but n can't be 1.\n\nWait, but n starts from 2.\n\nSo for n=2, fibs[3]=2, i=3, k=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code can be structured as:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the Fibonacci list up to 1018.\n\nLoop through the fibs list, starting from the end, to find the largest i where fibs[i] <=n.\n\nSet k=i-2.\n\nPrint k.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 2 → Output 1.\n\nfibs[3]=2 <=2, so i=3, k=1.\n\nSample Input 2: 3 → i=4, fibs[4]=3 <=3. k=2.\n\nSample Input 3:4 → fibs[5]=5>4. So the largest i is 4, fibs[4]=3<=4. k=4-2=2.\n\nSample Input 4:10 → fibs[6]=8<=10, fibs[7]=13>10. So i=6, k=4.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nfibs[5]=5<=5. i=5, k=3.\n\nYes.\n\nn=6:\n\nfibs[5]=5<=6, fibs[6]=8>6. So i=5, k=3.\n\nYes.\n\nn=8: i=6, k=4.\n\nn=9: same as 8.\n\nn=13: i=7, fibs[7}=13<=13. k=5.\n\nSo, for n=13, the maximum is 5 games.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nIn Python, read n.\n\nGenerate the fibs list.\n\nFind the largest i.\n\nCompute k.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nFirst, generate fibs.\n\nInitialize fibs as [0, 1].\n\nThen, while the next fib is <=1018, add to the list.\n\nWait, but wait, the fibs list starts with 0,1,1,2,3,5, etc.\n\nWait, for i >=2, fibs[i] = fibs[i-1] + fibs[i-2].\n\nSo, code:\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n    if next_fib > 1018:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nSo, for i in the list, fibs[i] is the ith number.\n\nWait, but in Python, the list starts at 0, so the index is 0-based.\n\nWait, for fibs = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...], the indexes are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...\n\nSo, for i=3, fibs[3]=2.\n\nThus, for a given n, find the largest i where fibs[i] <=n.\n\nOnce i is found, k = i-2.\n\nSo, for n=2, i=3, k=1.\n\nFor n=3, i=4, k=2.\n\nFor n=4, i=4, k=2.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\n# Generate the Fibonacci list up to 1018\nfibs = [0, 1]\nwhile True:\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n    if next_fib > 1018:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\n# Now, find the largest i where fibs[i] <=n\nmax_i = 0\nfor i in range(len(fibs)-1, -1, -1):\n    if fibs[i] <=n:\n        max_i = i\n        break\n\nif max_i ==0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    k = max_i -2\n    print(k)\n\nWait, but wait. For n=2, the code will loop from len(fibs)-1 down to 0.\n\nfibs is [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...]. So for n=2, the first i where fibs[i]<=2 is 3. So max_i=3.\n\nThen, k=3-2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nfibs[5]=5 <=5. So max_i=5. k=3.\n\nAnother test case: n=6.\n\nfibs[5]=5<=6. fibs[6}=8>6. So max_i=5. k=3.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about n=1? According to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nWait, but in the code, the loop starts from len(fibs)-1, which is the last index.\n\nSo for n=2, it finds i=3.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about n=1? Well, the code would output 0, but n is at least 2.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nInput: 2 → output 1.\n\nInput:3 → output 2.\n\nInput:4 → output 2.\n\nInput:10 → output4.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the problem can be approached using the Fibonacci sequence. The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Thus, the goal is to find the largest `k` such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to the number of players `n`.\n\n1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate Fibonacci numbers up to the point where the next number exceeds 1018, which is the maximum possible value of `n`.\n2. **Find the Maximum k**: For a given `n`, find the largest index `i` in the generated Fibonacci list such that the Fibonacci number at that index is less than or equal to `n`.
