Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about candles and figuring out how many hours they can burn for. The process goes like this: each candle burns for an hour and then goes out. But Vasily is smart because he can take 'b' number of burned-out candles and make a new one. So the question is, what's the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, let's think about the example given. For instance, when a is 4 and b is 2, the output is 7. How does that work? \n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Now he has 4 stubs. He can exchange them for 4/2 = 2 new candles. Burning those adds 2 more hours, making total 6. Now he has 2 stubs left from these. But wait, 2 is equal to b, so he can make another candle. That's one more hour, bringing the total to 7. Oh right, because after burning the two, he gets two more stubs which again make one candle, adding another hour.\n\nSo the process is: every time you have enough stubs to make a new candle, you do so, and repeat until you don't have enough anymore.\n\nSo the algorithm should be something like:\n\n1. Start with 'a' candles.\n2. Burn all of them, adding 'a' hours.\n3. Collect the stubs (which is 'a').\n4. While the number of stubs >= b:\n   a. Make as many new candles as possible from the stubs. So new_candles = stubs // b.\n   b. Add new_candles to the total hours.\n   c. Update the stubs: stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles. Because after using some stubs, the remainder plus the new_candles (which when burned will add to the stubs) gives the next stubs count.\n5. Repeat step 4 until stubs < b.\n\nWait, let's model this mathematically. The initial a gives a hours. Then each time, we can create new_candles = s // b, where s is the current stubs. The new_candles are added to the total. Then, the new stubs are (s % b) + new_candles, because each new candle, when burned, will contribute one stub.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total=4, stubs=4.\n\nLoop:\n\nstubs=4 >=2 → new=2, total=6. Stubs now is 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nLoop again: stubs=2 >=2 → new=1, total=7. Stubs becomes 0 +1=1.\n\nNow stubs=1 <2, loop ends.\n\nSo total is 7, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\nInitial total=6, stubs=6.\n\nLoop: stubs=6//3=2, total becomes 8. Stubs becomes 0 +2=2.\n\nLoop again: 2 <3, done.\n\nSo total is 8, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if a=5, b=5. Initial total=5. Stubs=5.\n\nThen 5//5=1, total 6. Stubs becomes 0+1=1. No more loops. So total is 6.\n\nWhat if a=10, b=3.\n\nStubs starts at 10.\n\nFirst loop: 10//3=3, total 13. Stubs =1 (10%3=1) +3=4.\n\nSecond loop:4//3=1, total 14. Stubs=1 (4%3=1)+1=2.\n\nNo more loops. So total is 14.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the code needs to read a and b, compute this.\n\nIn Python, the steps would be:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nCompute total = a\n\nstubs = a\n\nloop while stubs >=b:\n\n   new = stubs // b\n\n   total += new\n\n   stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nOnce loop ends, print total.\n\nSo the code structure is straightforward.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as a single line with two integers separated by space. So in Python, we can read it via input().split().\n\nBut wait, looking at the note, the input is presented as ['4 2', '6 3'], but in reality, the problem statement says the input is a single line with two integers. So perhaps the actual input is a string like \"4 2\".\n\nSo code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, compute as described.\n\nFinally, print(total).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a.\n\nstubs = a.\n\nloop while stubs >=b:\n\n   new = stubs // b\n\n   total += new\n\n   stubs = (stubs % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should handle all cases.\n\nTesting edge cases:\n\nCase where a is less than b.\n\nLike a=2, b=3.\n\nTotal is 2. Stubs=2, which is less than 3. So output is 2.\n\nAnother case: a=0? Well, according to the constraints, a is at least 1, so no need to handle that.\n\nWhat if b is 1? Wait, but the problem says b is at least 2. So no.\n\nWait, the input constraints are 1 ≤ a ≤1000; 2 ≤ b ≤1000. So no, b can't be 1.\n\nSo no issues there.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can create new candles from the stubs of burned-out ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`, which will burn for `a` hours.\n2. **Stub Collection**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs, which equals the number of initial candles `a`.\n3. **Recycle Stubs**: Use a loop to repeatedly convert the collected stubs into new candles. Each iteration:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made from the current stubs.\n   - Add the number of new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the count of stubs to reflect the remainder after making new candles plus the new stubs from the newly burned candles.\n4. **Termination**: The loop continues until there are not enough stubs left to make a new candle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new_candles = stubs // b\n    total += new_candles\n    stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `a` and `b`.\n- **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` burns for `a` hours.\n- **Loop for Recycling**: While there are enough stubs to make new candles:\n  - Compute how many new candles can be made from the current stubs.\n  - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n  - Update the stub count to include any leftover stubs from making new candles plus the stubs from the newly burned candles.\n- **Output Result**: Print the total hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum illumination time by leveraging the ability to recycle stubs into new candles, ensuring optimal use of resources.",
