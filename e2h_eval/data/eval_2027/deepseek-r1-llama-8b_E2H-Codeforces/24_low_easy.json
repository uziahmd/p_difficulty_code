She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has several tabs open in her browser and wants to close some of them. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nShe starts with n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can perform one of two actions:\n1. Move the cursor left or right. But she can't move beyond the currently available tabs because some may already be closed.\n2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position.\n\nSo, for example, if she's at position i, closing to the left would close all tabs before i, but only those that haven't been closed yet. Similarly for the right.\n\nHmm, so the process involves moving the cursor to certain positions and then performing the close operations.\n\nThe task is to find the minimal time (seconds) needed to do this.\n\nFirst, let's think about when no tabs need to be closed. Like, if l=1 and r=n, meaning all tabs are needed. Then the answer is 0, because nothing needs to be done.\n\nBut in other cases, we need to figure out how many moves and closes are required.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nWe need to determine whether any tabs to the left of l need to be closed, and whether any tabs to the right of r need to be closed.\n\nFor each of these regions (left and right), we'll calculate the steps needed to close them.\n\nWait, but the order might matter. For instance, maybe it's better to close the left first, then the right, or vice versa. Or perhaps not both, depending on the situation.\n\nWait, wait. No, because the problem says she needs to leave exactly the tabs from l to r. So any tabs outside this range must be closed. So regardless of order, both left and right regions need to be handled.\n\nWait, but perhaps in some cases, one of them doesn't require any action. For example, if l=1, then there are no tabs to the left that need to be closed. Similarly, if r =n, no tabs to the right need to be closed.\n\nSo, the first step is to determine whether the left region (tabs less than l) need to be closed and the right region (tabs more than r) need to be closed.\n\nLet's formalize:\n\nLeftClose = (l > 1)\nRightClose = (r < n)\n\nSo, for each of these, if true, we have to plan the steps.\n\nNow, for each direction (left and right), we need to compute the steps required.\n\nLet's think about the left side first.\n\nIf we need to close tabs to the left of l, then:\n\n- The cursor must be moved to a position where, when we close left, all those tabs are closed.\n- The position to close left is l, because closing to the left of l would close everything before l.\n\nSimilarly, for the right side, the cursor must be moved to r to close everything to the right.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because the problem says, when you close left, you close [a, i-1], where a is the current min unclosed tab. So, if you're at position i, and you close left, all tabs before i (that are still open) get closed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the description says:\n\nWhen you close left, you close all tabs with indices from [a, i-1], where a is the min index of unclosed tabs. So, after moving to i, closing left will close all tabs before i (including any that were not closed before).\n\nSo, to close all the left tabs (those less than l), you need to have the cursor at l, because then when you close left, all tabs before l (which are the ones to be closed) will be closed.\n\nSimilarly, to close all the right tabs (those greater than r), you need to be at r, then close right.\n\nSo, the steps for each part are as follows:\n\nFor the left side:\n\n1. Move the cursor from pos to l.\n2. Close left.\n\nBut wait, what if l is to the left of pos? Or to the right?\n\nWait, the initial cursor is at pos. So, to reach l, which could be to the left or right of pos.\n\nSame for r.\n\nWait, no. Because l is the leftmost tab to keep. So, if l is to the left of pos, the cursor might have to move left. Similarly, if l is to the right of pos, it has to move right.\n\nWait, but wait: the movement is limited by the current state",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the steps required to move the cursor and close the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closing Tabs**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` or to the right of `r` that need to be closed. This is based on whether `l > 1` (tabs to the left) and whether `r < n` (tabs to the right).\n\n2. **Calculate Steps for Left Closure**:\n   - If there are tabs to the left of `l`, calculate the steps to move the cursor from its current position to `l` and then close the left tabs.\n   - The number of moves is the absolute difference between the current position and `l`.\n   - Add one second to close the left tabs.\n\n3. **Calculate Steps for Right Closure**:\n   - Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of `r`, calculate the steps to move the cursor from `l` (after closing left tabs) to `r` and then close the right tabs.\n   - The number of moves is the absolute difference between `l` and `r`.\n   - Add one second to close the right tabs.\n\n4. **Sum the Steps**: Sum the steps for both left and right closures to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_close = l > 1\nright_close = r < n\n\ntime = 0\n\nif left_close:\n    # Move to l and close left\n    move = abs(pos - l)\n    time += move + 1  # moves + close left\n\nif right_close:\n    # After moving to l, move to r and close right\n    move = abs(l - r)\n    time += move + 1  # moves + close right\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input consists of four integers representing the number of tabs, the initial cursor position, and the segment [l, r].\n- **Determine Closures**: Check if tabs need to be closed to the left of `l` or to the right of `r`.\n- **Movement Calculation**: Calculate the steps required to move the cursor to the necessary positions and perform the closure actions.\n- **Output the Result**: Print the total time required to close all unnecessary tabs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps needed by considering each necessary movement and closure action separately and summing them up.",
