Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases. Each base must have exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base. So, it's a perfect matching between R rebels and B bases.\n\nBut there's an additional condition: the straight paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. So, no two paths can cross each other in the galaxy plane.\n\nHmm. So, I need to determine if such a matching exists.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input consists of R spaceships and B bases. The coordinates are given, and no three points are colinear, which probably helps because it reduces some cases where lines could overlap.\n\nThe output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether a valid matching exists.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Read the input correctly.\n2. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases.\n3. For each matching, check if any two paths intersect.\n4. If any matching satisfies that no paths intersect, output \"Yes\".\n5. If none do after checking all possibilities, output \"No\".\n\nWait, but wait. The number of matchings depends on the minimum of R and B. Oh, wait no, since R and B can be up to 10 each. But if R != B, then it's impossible to have a perfect matching. So first, I should check if R == B. Because each spaceship must assign to a base, and vice versa.\n\nWait, the problem says R and B are the numbers of spaceships and bases. So for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible, so output \"No\".\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe first line has R and B, with 1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10. Then, R lines for the spaceships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nSo the assignment is a perfect matching only if R equals B. So the first thing I should check is whether R equals B. If not, immediately output \"No\".\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first example, R=3, B=3. So yes. In the second example, R=2, B=1. So output is \"No\" because you can't have a perfect matching when R != B.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if R != B. If so, output \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, assuming R = B, we need to find a bijection between spaceships and bases such that no two edges (paths) cross.\n\nSo, how to model this?\n\nEach base is connected to one spaceship, and the line between them shouldn't intersect with any other such line.\n\nSo, for the current matching, I need to ensure that for every pair of edges, they don't intersect.\n\nHow can I represent this? Well, perhaps for each possible permutation of assigning spaceships to bases, I can check all pairs of edges to see if any intersect.\n\nIf any permutation passes this test, then output \"Yes\"; otherwise, \"No\".\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- If R != B: output \"No\".\n- Else, generate all possible permutations of assigning R spaceships to B bases (since R = B, it's all possible bijections).\n- For each permutation, check if all edges (lines) are non-intersecting.\n- If any permutation satisfies this, return \"Yes\"; else, \"No\".\n\nBut wait, how do I represent the edges and check for intersections?\n\nFor each permutation, the edges are the lines connecting each spaceship to its assigned base. So, for each such edge, I need to ensure that any two edges do not cross.\n\nSo, for each permutation, for every pair of edges, compute whether they intersect. If any pair does, then this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo, for a given permutation, the process is:\n\nLoop over all i < j, check if edge i and edge j cross. If any do, this permutation is invalid.\n\nIf all edges are non-crossing, then this permutation is acceptable.\n\nNow, the question is: How to efficiently check if two lines (edges) intersect.\n\nBut the points are given as (xi, yi) for spaceships and (uj, vj) for bases.\n\nWait, the edges are from a spaceship to a base. So, for each pair of edges, say edge1 is from spaceship A to base B, and edge2 is from spaceship C to base D. We need to see if these two lines cross each other.\n\nSo, to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect, except that AB is a line from a spaceship to its base, and CD is another such line.\n\nWait, but in our case, each edge is a line segment between two points: one is a spaceship, the other is a base.\n\nSo, the function I need is: given two line segments, each defined by two points, check if they intersect (not just touch, but actually cross).\n\nBut wait, the problem says 'any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship' do not intersect. So, two line segments AB and CD (where A is a base and B is a spaceship; C is a base, D is a spaceship) are part of the paths. So, the path is from base to spaceship, which is a line segment between those two points.\n\nSo, the function is: for two line segments, do they intersect, including their endpoints?\n\nWait, but the problem says that no two paths should intersect. So, any two line segments representing paths should not cross each other. So, even if they share an endpoint, it's allowed.\n\nWait, no. Because if two paths share a common point, like both passing through the same base, then their paths would meet at that base. But the problem states that no two paths should intersect. So, perhaps the definition of 'intersect' here includes sharing a common point, except when it's the same path.\n\nWait, the note says that no three points are on the same line. So, any two line segments cannot share an endpoint except for their own start and end points.\n\nWait, no. Each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned exactly one spaceship. So, each line is unique. So, two different lines can't have a common point because that would imply a spaceship is assigned to two bases or a base is assigned to two spaceships.\n\nBut wait, the input says that no two points coincide, and no three are on the same line. So, each line is unique, and no three lines will be concurrent except at their endpoints.\n\nWait, but in terms of line segments, two different lines (spaceship to base) may have their own line segments cross each other somewhere in the middle.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we need to check that for all pairs of line segments, they do not intersect anywhere except possibly at their endpoints.\n\nBut since all line segments are between a spaceship and a base, and each is unique, two different line segments can't share a common point except if it's their own start and end. So, when checking for intersection, it's sufficient to check whether two line segments cross each other in the middle.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nI think I can write a function that takes two line segments and returns True if they intersect (excluding endpoints), and False otherwise.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to include the endpoints in the check. Because, if two line segments share a common endpoint, that's allowed since they are different lines.\n\nWait, no. Because in the matching, each base is assigned exactly one spaceship. So, two line segments (base1 to ship1 and base2 to ship2) cannot share a common point unless they are the same line, which is not possible since each base is unique.\n\nSo, the line segments are all distinct and do not share any endpoints except their own.\n\nThus, two different line segments can't share an endpoint. So, when checking for intersection, it's sufficient to check if their line segments cross in the middle.\n\nSo, the function for checking two line segments for intersection (excluding endpoints) can be implemented.\n\nBut how to implement that function.\n\nI remember that in computational geometry, the standard way to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect is to use the cross product to determine if the segments straddle each other.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the orientation of the four points to determine if the segments cross.\n\nLet me recall the algorithm:\n\nGiven two line segments AB and CD, to determine if they intersect:\n\n1. Compute the orientations of the four points: o1 = orientation(A,B,D), o2 = orientation(A,C,D), o3 = orientation(B,C,D), o4 = orientation(B,D,C). Wait, maybe I should refer to the standard approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute whether the two line segments AB and CD intersect using the following steps:\n\na. Check if the points of AB and CD are collinear. Since in this problem, no three points are colinear, this isn't necessary except for the general case.\n\nb. Find the intersection point of the two lines. If they are parallel, they don't intersect unless they are the same line, which they aren't in our case.\n\nc. Once the intersection point is found, check if it lies within both line segments.\n\nBut since no three points are colinear, the lines won't be overlapping except in the case where they are the same line.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is:\n\nCompute whether the two line segments AB and CD intersect properly (i.e., not at their endpoints) using the standard method.\n\nAn alternative method is to compute the bounding boxes. If the bounding boxes of the two line segments do not overlap, then they don't intersect. Otherwise, they might.\n\nThen, for the bounding boxes that do overlap, perform a more detailed check.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way in code is to implement the standard line segment intersection algorithm.\n\nI remember that the standard algorithm involves computing the cross products to determine whether the segments cross each other.\n\nLet me try to write a function that takes two line segments, each represented by two points, and returns True if they intersect (excluding endpoints), else False.\n\nSo, for line segment 1: p1, p2.\n\nLine segment 2: q1, q2.\n\nWe can compute the orientation of various points to determine if the segments cross.\n\nThe algorithm goes something like this:\n\nCompute the four orientations needed for the general case.\n\nIf the segments are AB and CD, then:\n\n- Check if points C and D are on opposite sides of AB. Similarly for A and B with respect to CD.\n\nBut perhaps the precise steps are:\n\nFunction ccw(A, B, C):\n\n    returns:\n\n        0 if colinear,\n\n        1 if clockwise (A->B->C is clockwise),\n\n        2 if counter-clockwise.\n\nSimilarly for other functions.\n\nThen, the lines AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB, and\n\n- The points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nBut also, considering the order of the points.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct condition is that the two line segments intersect if and only if:\n\n- The orientations of (p1, p2, q1) and (p1, p2, q2) are different, and\n\n- The orientations of (q1, q2, p1) and (q1, q2, p2) are different.\n\nBecause that implies that the two line segments cross each other.\n\nWait, no, because that would require that q1 and q2 are on opposite sides of AB, and p1 and p2 are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nSo, the function would be something like:\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n\n    p1, p2 = s1\n\n    q1, q2 = s2\n\n    # Compute orientation for all four points\n\n    def ccw(a, b, c):\n\n        val = (b[0] - a[0])*(c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1])*(c[0] - a[0])\n\n        if val == 0:\n\n            return 0 # colinear\n\n        return 1 if val > 0 else 2 # clock or counter\n\n    o1 = ccw(p1, p2, q1)\n\n    o2 = ccw(p1, p2, q2)\n\n    o3 = ccw(q1, q2, p1)\n\n    o4 = ccw(q1, q2, p2)\n\n    # General case: the segments intersect in their interiors\n\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: one endpoint on the other line\n\n    # Check if q1 is on AB, but not equal to p1 or p2.\n\n    if (o1 == 0 and on_segment(p1, q1, p2)):\n\n        return False # they meet at q1, but q1 is not an endpoint.\n\n    if (o2 == 0 and on_segment(p1, q2, p2)):\n\n        return False\n\n    if (o3 == 0 and on_segment(q1, p1, q2)):\n\n        return False\n\n    if (o4 == 0 and on_segment(q1, p2, q2)):\n\n        return False\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but wait. Since in our problem, all points are distinct and no three are colinear, the case where a segment's endpoint lies on another segment is only possible if it's exactly one of the endpoints. But since each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship, the line segments are between a unique set of points, so the only way for a line segment to have a shared endpoint is if it's the same segment, which isn't the case.\n\nWait, but in our problem, the line segments are between spaceships and bases, which are all unique. So, two different line segments cannot share an endpoint. So, the only time two segments share a point is if it's their own endpoints, which are unique.\n\nTherefore, in our problem, the function can safely ignore the special cases where a point lies on another segment, except for the case where the entire segment is on top of each other, which is impossible in our setup.\n\nWait, but in the code, perhaps the function should still account for all possibilities, but given the constraints, the general case is sufficient.\n\nWait, no. Because suppose two segments cross exactly at a point that is an endpoint for one segment, but not the other. For example, segment AB ends at point B, which is the starting point of segment BC. So, the line AB and BC meet at point B, which is an endpoint.\n\nIn our problem, this would imply that two different line segments share a common endpoint, but that's impossible because each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base.\n\nWait, no. Because in the matching, each base is connected to exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship is connected to exactly one base. So, two different line segments can't share a common point, because that would imply two different assignments.\n\nSo, in the problem's context, two line segments cannot share a common endpoint. So, the only way two segments can intersect is if their internal points cross.\n\nTherefore, in the function, the general case is sufficient.\n\nSo, the function can be simplified to just check whether the two line segments cross each other in their interiors, excluding endpoints.\n\nThus, the function can be written as follows:\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n\n    (p1, p2) = s1\n\n    (q1, q2) = s2\n\n    def ccw(a, b, c):\n\n        val = (b[0] - a[0]) * (c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1]) * (c[0] - a[0])\n\n        if val == 0:\n\n            return 0\n\n        return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\n    o1 = ccw(p1, p2, q1)\n\n    o2 = ccw(p1, p2, q2)\n\n    o3 = ccw(q1, q2, p1)\n\n    o4 = ccw(q1, q2, p2)\n\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but wait: if the two segments are colinear, but do not overlap except at their endpoints, which in our problem is not possible. So, perhaps the function is sufficient.\n\nBut let me think about some test cases.\n\nCase 1: Two segments cross each other in the middle.\n\nLike:\n\ns1 is from (0,0) to (2,2)\n\ns2 is from (0,2) to (2,0)\n\nThese cross at (1,1). So, the function should return True.\n\nCase 2: Two segments are parallel and do not cross.\n\nLike s1 from (0,0) to (1,1), s2 from (0,1) to (1,2). These are parallel and do not intersect. The function should return False.\n\nCase 3: Two segments are the same line but in opposite directions. But in our problem, this is impossible because each point is unique.\n\nSo, the function should handle these cases.\n\nAnother test case: what if one segment is entirely contained within the other? Like s1 is (0,0) to (2,2), s2 is (1,1) to (1,1). Well, in our problem, since all points are unique, this can't happen.\n\nSo, the function should work.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Read R and B.\n\n2. If R != B, output \"No\".\n\n3. Else, read R spaceship coordinates, then B base coordinates.\n\n4. Generate all possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases.\n\n5. For each permutation, create the list of line segments (each spaceship is connected to a base according to the permutation).\n\n6. For each such list, check all pairs of line segments for intersection.\n\n7. If any permutation has no intersections, output \"Yes\".\n\n8. If all permutations have at least one intersection, output \"No\".\n\nNow, the main challenge is generating all possible permutations and checking each one.\n\nBut since R and B are up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! which is about 3.6 million. That's manageable for Python.\n\nSo, the plan is feasible.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\n- Read R and B.\n\n- If R != B: print No.\n\n- Else, read R spaceship points, then B base points.\n\n- For each permutation of the spaceship indices assigned to base indices:\n\n   - Create the list of line segments.\n\n   - For each pair of line segments in this list, check if they intersect.\n\n   - If any pair intersects, this permutation is invalid.\n\n   - If no pairs intersect, then this permutation is valid: return Yes.\n\n- After checking all permutations, if none are valid: return No.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef readints():\n\n    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nR, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nif R != B:\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\n    exit()\n\nships = []\n\nfor _ in range(R):\n\n    x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    ships.append( (x, y) )\n\nbases = []\n\nfor _ in range(B):\n\n    x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    bases.append( (x, y) )\n\ndef ccw(a, b, c):\n\n    val = (b[0] - a[0])*(c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1])*(c[0] - a[0])\n\n    if val == 0:\n\n        return 0\n\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef on_segment(a, b, c):\n\n    # Check if c is on the line segment ab\n\n    if min(a[0], b[0]) <= c[0] <= max(a[0], b[0]) and min(a[1], b[1]) <= c[1] <= max(a[1], b[1]):\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n\n    (p1, p2) = s1\n\n    (q1, q2) = s2\n\n    o1 = ccw(p1, p2, q1)\n\n    o2 = ccw(p1, p2, q2)\n\n    o3 = ccw(q1, q2, p1)\n\n    o4 = ccw(q1, q2, p2)\n\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n\n        return True\n\n    # Check if any endpoint lies on the other segment\n\n    # Check if q1 is on p1p2, and it's not an endpoint\n\n    if o1 == 0 and on_segment(p1, p2, q1):\n\n        return False\n\n    if o2 == 0 and on_segment(p1, p2, q2):\n\n        return False\n\n    if o3 == 0 and on_segment(q1, q2, p1):\n\n        return False\n\n    if o4 == 0 and on_segment(q1, q2, p2):\n\n        return False\n\n    return False\n\n# Now, generate all possible permutations of bases for the ships\n\nfor perm in permutations(range(R)):\n\n    # perm is a tuple of R indices, representing the mapping from ships to bases.\n\n    # Create the list of segments.\n\n    segments = []\n\n    for i in range(R):\n\n        # Assign ship i to base perm[i]\n\n        segments.append( (ships[i], bases[perm[i]]) )\n\n    # Now, check all pairs of segments for intersection.\n\n    valid = True\n\n    for i in range(len(segments)):\n\n        for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n\n            seg_i = segments[i]\n\n            seg_j = segments[j]\n\n            if segments_intersect(seg_i, seg_j):\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            break\n\n    if valid:\n\n        print(\"Yes\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"No\")\n\nWait, but wait. There's a mistake here.\n\nIn the code above, the 'perm' is a permutation of the indices of the ships. So, for each ship index i, it's assigned to the base at perm[i]. So, the list of segments is built accordingly.\n\nBut wait, the 'bases' list is the list of all bases. So, the perm[i] is the index into this list.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, for each permutation, the code creates the segments.\n\nThen, for each pair of segments in the current permutation, it checks if they intersect.\n\nIf any pair does, the permutation is invalid.\n\nElse, it's a valid matching.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, let's test it against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, the first line is '3 3\\n...' which is R=3, B=3.\n\nSo, the code reads R=3, B=3.\n\nThen, reads 3 ship coordinates:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nThen, reads 3 base coordinates:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWait, no. Looking at the sample input:\n\nThe input seems to be presented as a string, but in the actual code, I think the input is read as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains R and B.\n\nThen R lines for spaceships.\n\nThen B lines for bases.\n\nSo, the sample input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThen, the second part:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nWait, no. Or perhaps the input is given as two separate parts, but in the sample, the user wrote:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWhich suggests that the first part is the first 3 + 3 lines, and the second part is the next 2 + 1 lines.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a mistake in how the sample input is written. But in any case, the code should read R and B, then read R lines of ships, then B lines of bases.\n\nSo, in the sample input, R=3, B=3.\n\nShips are:\n\n(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\nBases are:\n\n(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\nThen, the second sample input is R=2, B=1, so output is \"No\".\n\nSo, for the first case, the code should output \"Yes\".\n\nSo, in the code, for each permutation of 0,1,2, the segments are checked.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the 'perm' is a permutation of range(R), which is 0,1,2.\n\nSo, for each permutation, ship 0 is assigned to base perm[0], etc.\n\nIn the sample, one possible valid permutation is:\n\nship 0 (0,0) → base 2 (2,2)\n\nship 1 (2,0) → base 0 (-2,1)\n\nship 2 (3,1) → base 1 (0,3)\n\nSo, the segments are:\n\n(0,0) → (2,2): line from (0,0) to (2,2)\n\n(2,0) → (-2,1): line from (2,0) to (-2,1)\n\n(3,1) → (0,3): line from (3,1) to (0,3)\n\nDo these segments intersect?\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nSegment 0-2 and 1-0:\n\nWait, the segments are:\n\nSeg0: (0,0)-(2,2)\n\nSeg1: (2,0)-(-2,1)\n\nDo they intersect?\n\nLet me compute.\n\nSeg0 is from (0,0) to (2,2). Seg1 is from (2,0) to (-2,1).\n\nDo these two segments cross?\n\nLooking at the lines:\n\nLine of Seg0: y = x.\n\nLine of Seg1: from (2,0) to (-2,1). The slope is (1-0)/(-2-2) = 1/(-4) = -1/4.\n\nEquation: y = (-1/4)(x - 2) → y = (-1/4)x + 0.5.\n\nAt x=2, y=0. At x=-2, y= (-1/4)*(-2) + 0.5 → 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.\n\nSo, the line of Seg1 is y = (-1/4)x + 0.5.\n\nSeg0 is y=x.\n\nSet equal:\n\nx = (-1/4)x + 0.5 → x + (1/4)x = 0.5 → (5/4)x = 0.5 → x = (0.5 *4)/5 = 0.4.\n\ny=0.4.\n\nSo, the intersection is at (0.4, 0.4).\n\nNow, is this point on both segments?\n\nSeg0: from (0,0) to (2,2). 0.4 is between 0 and 2, yes.\n\nSeg1: from (2,0) to (-2,1). So, the x ranges from 2 to -2. 0.4 is less than 2, so it's beyond the start of the segment.\n\nWait, wait. The segment for Seg1 is from (2,0) to (-2,1). So, x starts at 2 and decreases to -2. So, 0.4 is between 2 and -2? No, because 0.4 is less than 2, but greater than -2.\n\nWait, the x-coordinate of Seg1 is moving from 2 to -2, so the x ranges from 2 down to -2. So, 0.4 is within that range.\n\nSo, the intersection is within both segments.\n\nThus, the two segments do intersect, so this permutation would be invalid.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, they have a valid permutation. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the permutation.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the assignment is in order. So, ship 0 → base 0, ship 1 → base 1, ship 2 → base 2.\n\nSo, the segments are:\n\nShip0 (0,0) → Base0 (-2,1)\n\nShip1 (2,0) → Base1 (0,3)\n\nShip2 (3,1) → Base2 (2,2)\n\nWait, let's see if these segments cross each other.\n\nCheck each pair:\n\nSeg0: (0,0) → (-2,1)\n\nSeg1: (2,0) → (0,3)\n\nSeg2: (3,1) → (2,2)\n\nCheck Seg0 and Seg1:\n\nSeg0 is from (0,0) to (-2,1). Line equation: slope is (1-0)/(-2-0) = -0.5.\n\nEquation: y = -0.5x.\n\nSeg1 is from (2,0) to (0,3). Slope is (3-0)/(0-2) = -1.5.\n\nEquation: y = -1.5(x - 2) → y = -1.5x + 3.\n\nFind intersection:\n\n-0.5x = -1.5x +3 → 1x = 3 → x=3.\n\nAt x=3, y= -0.5*3 = -1.5.\n\nBut Seg0 is from (0,0) to (-2,1). x ranges from 0 to -2. So, x=3 is outside this range.\n\nThus, the segments do not intersect.\n\nCheck Seg0 and Seg2:\n\nSeg0: (0,0) → (-2,1)\n\nSeg2: (3,1) → (2,2)\n\nSlope of Seg0: -0.5.\n\nSlope of Seg2: (2-1)/(2-3) = 1/-1 = -1.\n\nLines: Seg0 is y = -0.5x.\n\nSeg2 is from (3,1) to (2,2). Equation is y = -x +4.\n\nIntersection: -0.5x = -x +4 → 0.5x =4 → x=8, y= -4. Which is far from both segments. So no intersection.\n\nCheck Seg1 and Seg2:\n\nSeg1: (2,0) → (0,3). Line equation y = -1.5x + 3.\n\nSeg2: (3,1) → (2,2). Line equation: y = -x +4.\n\nSet equal: -1.5x +3 = -x +4 → -0.5x = 1 → x= -2.\n\ny = 2.\n\nBut Seg2 is from x=3 to 2. So x=-2 is outside. So no intersection.\n\nSo, all pairs are non-intersecting. Thus, this permutation is valid.\n\nThus, the code should find this permutation.\n\nSo, in the code, for this particular permutation, the code would create segments as:\n\nsegments = [ ((0,0), (-2,1)), ((2,0), (0,3)), ((3,1), (2,2)) ]\n\nThen, for each pair (i,j):\n\ni=0, j=1: check if segments 0 and 1 intersect.\n\nAs above, they do not.\n\ni=0, j=2: segments 0 and 2 do not intersect.\n\ni=1, j=2: segments 1 and 2 do not intersect.\n\nThus, valid remains True, so the code outputs \"Yes\".\n\nThus, the code works for this case.\n\nBut why in the earlier analysis, the code was considering a different permutation that resulted in intersecting segments?\n\nBecause in that case, the permutation was not the one used in the sample solution.\n\nThus, the code correctly identifies that there exists at least one permutation that satisfies the conditions.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the second sample input:\n\nR=2, B=1.\n\nSo, R != B, output is \"No\".\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother test case: R=1, B=1.\n\nOnly one possible permutation. Check if the single segment doesn't cross anything. Since there's only one segment, no intersections. So, output is \"Yes\".\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2.\n\nSuppose ships are at (0,0) and (2,2), bases at (1,1) and (3,3).\n\nIn any permutation, the two segments are either from ship0→base0 and ship1→base1, which would be from (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,2) to (3,3). These two lines are parallel and don't intersect.\n\nOr, ship0→base1 and ship1→base0. Segments are from (0,0) to (3,3) and (2,2) to (1,1). These cross at (1.5, 1.5). So, the segments would intersect.\n\nThus, the first permutation is valid, so output is \"Yes\".\n\nThus, the code should correctly output \"Yes\".\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect in the galaxy plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Perfect Matching**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, it's impossible to form a perfect matching, so the answer is \"No\".\n2. **Generate Permutations**: If R equals B, generate all possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases.\n3. **Check for Non-Intersecting Paths**: For each permutation, create a list of line segments representing the paths from spaceships to their assigned bases. Check each pair of these line segments to see if they intersect.\n4. **Determine Validity**: If any permutation results in no intersecting paths, print \"Yes\". If all permutations result in at least one intersection, print \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ndef ccw(a, b, c):\n    val = (b[0] - a[0]) * (c[1] - a[1]) - (b[1] - a[1]) * (c[0] - a[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef on_segment(a, b, c):\n    if (min(a[0], b[0]) <= c[0] <= max(a[0], b[0])) and (min(a[1], b[1]) <= c[1] <= max(a[1], b[1])):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n    (p1, p2) = s1\n    (q1, q2) = s2\n\n    o1 = ccw(p1, p2, q1)\n    o2 = ccw(p1, p2, q2)\n    o3 = ccw(q1, q2, p1)\n    o4 = ccw(q1, q2, p2)\n\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    if o1 == 0 and on_segment(p1, p2, q1):\n        return False\n    if o2 == 0 and on_segment(p1, p2, q2):\n        return False\n    if o3 == 0 and on_segment(q1, q2, p1):\n        return False\n    if o4 == 0 and on_segment(q1, q2, p2):\n        return False\n\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    R, B = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n\n    for perm in permutations(range(R)):\n        segments = []\n        for i in range(R):\n            segments.append((ships[i], bases[perm[i]]))\n        \n        valid = True\n        for i in range(len(segments)):\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(segments)):\n                if segments_intersect(segments[i], segments[j]):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        \n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). It then reads the coordinates of the spaceships and bases.\n2. **Checking for Perfect Matching**: If R is not equal to B, it immediately prints \"No\".\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Using permutations, it generates all possible ways to assign spaceships to bases.\n4. **Checking Segments**: For each permutation, it creates line segments between spaceships and their assigned bases. It then checks each pair of these segments to see if they intersect using the `segments_intersect` function.\n5. **Output Result**: If any permutation results in non-intersecting segments, it prints \"Yes\". If none do, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible assignments are checked efficiently, leveraging the constraints given (R and B up to 10) to ensure the solution is feasible within reasonable time limits.",
