The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of their fans is maximized. Each district i has 2^i fans. We need to remove exactly k districts, and after removing them, all the remaining should be reachable from each other, meaning they form a single connected tree.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to find a connected subtree of size n - k that includes as many high-fan districts as possible. Since 2^i grows exponentially, the higher-numbered districts contribute way more to the total than the lower ones. So, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, provided they form a connected component.\n\nWait, but how? Because the tree is arbitrary. So maybe we can model this by finding the minimal number of nodes to remove to maximize the sum. Wait, no— the problem requires removing exactly k nodes, and we have to choose which ones.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal approach is to find a subtree where the sum of 2^i for the included nodes is as large as possible, and the number of included nodes is exactly (n - k). But wait, since n and k can be up to 1e6, we need an efficient algorithm.\n\nLet me think: the structure of the tree doesn't matter in terms of the connections because any node can be connected via its path. So what's important is the set of nodes we include, which must form a connected subtree. The maximum sum is achieved by including as many as possible of the largest 2^i terms.\n\nBut wait, maybe not necessarily all the highest-numbered nodes because they might form a chain that requires including some lower-numbered nodes as well. Or perhaps the minimal subtree that connects the highest nodes is the best.\n\nWait, another angle: the maximum sum is achieved by including all the nodes except the smallest possible number of nodes that are in the minimal \"chain\" that allows the largest possible nodes to be kept.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as choosing a certain root and then pruning branches that are too costly to keep.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The goal is to select a connected subset of nodes S with |S| = n -k. The sum of 2^i for i in S is maximized.\n\nEach node contributes 2^i, which is much larger for higher i. So we want as many high i nodes as possible in S. But S must be connected.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal solution is to find the largest possible subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, but that's connected.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to find a subtree where the sum is maximum, which would consist of the highest (n -k) nodes arranged in such a way that they form a connected subtree. But that's not always possible because the tree's structure may require including some lower nodes if they are on the paths between higher nodes.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal way is to find a path in the tree that starts at the highest node, then includes the next highest, and so on, ensuring that each step adds the next highest node, but only if the necessary parent is present.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to find a subtree that includes all the highest (n -k) nodes, but connected in a way that forms a connected subtree. However, it's possible that the tree's structure forces us to include some lower nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find a subtree where the sum of the nodes is as large as possible. Since each node contributes exponentially more as i increases, the optimal is to include the largest possible nodes.\n\nAnother idea: the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree of size s = n -k. To maximize the sum, we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So perhaps the strategy is to find a subtree that starts from the highest node and includes as many high nodes as possible, without including any low-numbered nodes unless necessary.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to find a path in the tree that includes the top (s) nodes, but arranged in a way that they are connected.\n\nWait, but how do we determine which nodes to include?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as selecting a subtree where the sum of 2^i is maximum, given that exactly s = n -k nodes are included.\n\nLet me think of the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3. So s=3.\n\nThe tree structure is:\n\nLooking at the edges:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n2-3\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\nSo the tree looks like this:\n\n1 is connected to 2, which is connected to 3, 4, 6. 6 is also connected to 5.\n\nSo the nodes are 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nThe optimal is to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the total number of fans. Each district contributes exponentially more fans as its number increases, so our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure Insight**: The given districts form a tree structure. Removing k districts will leave a connected subtree. To maximize the sum of fans, we need to include as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: We can use a greedy approach to find the optimal subtree. Start from the highest-numbered district and move downwards, ensuring each included district connects us to the next highest possible district.\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to explore the tree starting from the highest-numbered district. Track visited districts to avoid cycles and ensure we only include necessary lower-numbered districts.\n4. **Exclusion List**: Maintain a list of districts to exclude. Initially, all districts are included except those we need to remove. Adjust this list as we traverse the tree to ensure the subtree remains connected and includes the maximum possible high-numbered districts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    result = [i for i in range(1, n+1)]\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    q = deque()\n    start = n\n    visited[start] = True\n    q.append(start)\n    excluded = set()\n    \n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                q.append(v)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            excluded.add(i)\n    \n    to_remove = []\n    for i in sorted(result):\n        if i not in excluded:\n            to_remove.append(i)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, to_remove[:k])))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts `n` and the number of districts to remove `k`. The tree structure is built using an adjacency list.\n2. **Initial Setup**: We initialize a list of all districts and a queue for BFS starting from the highest-numbered district `n`.\n3. **BFS Traversal**: Using BFS, we explore the tree starting from `n`, marking each visited district. This helps in identifying the minimal subtree needed to keep the higher-numbered districts connected.\n4. **Determine Exclusions**: After BFS, districts that are not part of the BFS path (and thus not essential for keeping the higher-numbered districts connected) are marked for exclusion.\n5. **Generate Result**: Finally, we generate the list of districts to remove, ensuring exactly `k` districts are removed, prioritizing the lowest-numbered districts if necessary.\n\nThis approach ensures that we keep the highest possible sum of fans by including the most valuable districts while maintaining connectivity through BFS traversal.",
