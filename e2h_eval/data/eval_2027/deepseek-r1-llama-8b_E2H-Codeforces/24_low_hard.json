She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has several tabs open in her browser and wants to close some of them. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nShe starts with n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can perform one of two actions:\n1. Move the cursor left or right. But she can't move beyond the currently available tabs because some may already be closed.\n2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position.\n\nSo the challenge is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and close operations to minimize the time.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial state. All tabs are open, so a=1, b=n. The cursor is at pos.\n\nShe needs to end up with tabs l to r. So any tabs before l must be closed, and any after r must be closed.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Decide whether to close left, right, or both.\n   - If l > 1, then we need to close all tabs to the left of l.\n   - If r < n, then we need to close all tabs to the right of r.\n\n2. For each of these, calculate the minimal steps required.\n\nBut wait, the order might matter. For example, maybe it's better to close the left first, then the right, or vice versa, depending on their positions relative to the starting cursor position.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to calculate all possible scenarios and choose the one with the minimal time.\n\nLet's outline the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: Both left and right need to be closed.\n   - We need to decide whether to close left first or right first, and compute the minimal steps for each scenario.\n\nCase 2: Only left needs to be closed.\n   - Compute steps for just closing left.\n\nCase 3: Only right needs to be closed.\n   - Compute steps for just closing right.\n\nCase 4: No tabs need to be closed (l=1 and r=n). Then the answer is 0.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Determine if we need to close left (if l > 1), and/or right (if r < n).\n- For each needed closure, calculate the steps required, considering the path taken and the current cursor position.\n\nNow, let's model each operation.\n\nFor moving the cursor:\n\nWhen moving, each step takes 1 second. So the distance between the current position and the target position is the number of steps needed.\n\nFor closing:\n\nClosing all tabs to the left of the cursor takes 1 second. Similarly for the right.\n\nWait, no—when you close left, it's all tabs to the left of the current position. Similarly for right.\n\nWait, but when you close left, you can only close from a (the leftmost open tab) to i-1. So the actual tabs that get closed depend on the current a and b, which change as tabs are closed.\n\nBut during the process, a and b can change. For example, when you close left, a becomes the next available tab to the right.\n\nWait, no. When you close all tabs to the left of i, the new a becomes i, since all tabs before i are now closed. Similarly, closing right would set b to i.\n\nSo, for example, if initially a=1 and b=6, and the cursor is at 3. If she closes left, then a becomes 3, and the available tabs are 3-6. If she then moves to 5 and closes right, b becomes 5, leaving only 3-5.\n\nSo, the steps involve moving to certain positions and then performing close operations, which affects a and b for subsequent steps.\n\nThis suggests that the order of operations matters because a and b change after each close.\n\nTherefore, to model this correctly, we need to consider the sequence of moves and close operations, updating a and b as we go.\n\nBut given that n is up to 100, perhaps a brute-force approach is feasible.\n\nWait, but for n=100, trying all possible sequences is not practical. So we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: find the minimal steps for each possible scenario (like, do we need to close left, right, both, none) and then compute the minimal steps among those possibilities.\n\nLet me outline the steps needed for each case.\n\nFirst, check if l>1 and r<n. Then, both left and right need to be closed.\n\nIf l == 1 and r ==n: nothing to do.\n\nElse, for each of the two",
