Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The conditions for an 'X' are a bit specific. \n\nHmm, the grid is n x n where n is odd. So, for example, when n is 3, the grid has 3 rows and 3 columns.\n\nWhat's the condition? Well, the diagonals must have the same letter, and all the other squares (non-diagonal) must be the same letter which is different from the diagonal ones.\n\nLet me break this down.\n\nFirst, check the two main diagonals. Both should consist entirely of the same character. Also, these two characters must be the same as each other because otherwise, even if both diagonals are the same but different from each other, that wouldn't form an X.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: on both diagonals, the letters are the same. So the first and second diagonal must have the same letter. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x's, then the other diagonal must also be all 'x's.\n\nThen, all the non-diagonal squares must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letter.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n2. Check the two diagonals:\n   a. For each cell in the main diagonal (i == j), collect the characters.\n   b. Similarly for the anti-diagonal (i + j == n-1).\n   c. All characters in both diagonals must be the same.\n3. Then, check that all the non-diagonal cells are the same, and this character is different from the diagonal one.\n\nWait, but what if the grid is larger than 3? Like n=5. Then the center is part of both diagonals, which is fine.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n. Then, the next n lines are the grid.\n\nIn Python, we can read each line, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nSo, the grid can be stored as a list of lists. Or perhaps a list of strings, where each string represents a row.\n\nYes, because for each row, we can process it as a string.\n\nSo, the grid is a list where each element is a string representing a row.\n\nNow, step 2: checking the diagonals.\n\nFor each row i (starting from 0), the main diagonal is grid[i][i]. The anti-diagonal is grid[i][n-1 - i].\n\nSo, for all i, we check grid[i][i] and grid[i][n-1-i].\n\nWe need to collect all the characters from both diagonals and see if they are all the same.\n\nWait, no. Because the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal should each have all the same characters, and both must be the same as each other.\n\nSo first, get the main diagonal's characters. They must all be the same. Same for the anti-diagonal. And the main diagonal's character must equal the anti-diagonal's.\n\nIf either of these conditions fails, then it's not an 'X'.\n\nOnce the diagonals are confirmed to be the same character, say 'd', then we need to check the rest of the grid.\n\nThe rest of the cells (non-diagonal) must all be the same, and this must be a different character from 'd'.\n\nSo, how do we check the rest?\n\nLoop through each cell (i,j). If (i==j or i + j == n-1), skip it (since it's on the diagonal). Otherwise, collect the character.\n\nAll these collected characters must be the same, and they must not be equal to 'd'.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n lines into grid.\n3. Check the main and anti-diagonals:\n   a. For each i, check grid[i][i] and grid[i][n-1-i].\n   b. Collect all main_diag_chars = [grid[i][i] for i in 0..n-1]\n      Similarly, anti_diag_chars = [grid[i][n-1-i] for i in 0..n-1]\n   c. Check that all elements in main_diag_chars are the same, same for anti_diag_chars.\n   d. Check that the main and anti-diag chars are equal.\n4. If any of these checks fail, output NO.\n5. Else, proceed to check the other cells:\n   a. For each cell (i,j) not on either diagonal:\n      collect the char.\n   b. All such chars must be the same.\n   c. And this char must be different from the diagonal char.\n6. If all conditions are met, output YES; else, NO.\n\nBut wait, for step 3, what if n is 3? Then the main diag is 0,0; 1,1; 2,2. Anti-diag is 0,2; 1,1; 2,0. So the center cell is part of both.\n\nBut in code, for each i, we check both positions.\n\nWait, but in the case where n is 5, the center is (2,2), which is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo, during the initial check, the code will correctly handle that.\n\nNow, some test cases.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nSample Output: NO\n\nBecause the diagonals are not all the same.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nMain diagonal: positions (0,0)=x, (1,1)=o, (2,2)=o, (3,3)=o, (4,4)=x.\n\nSo main diagonal is x, o, o, o, x. These are not all same.\n\nSo it fails step 3, thus output NO.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: w, s, w. So not all same.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the main diagonal is row 0, col 0: 'w'; row 1, col 1: 's'; row 2, col 2: 'w'. So the main diag is ['w', 's', 'w'] → not same.\n\nSo output is NO? But sample output says for the second input, it's YES.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the sample.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nWait, so the second input is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nSo grid[0] is \"wsw\", grid[1] is \"sws\", grid[2] is \"wsw\".\n\nSo main diagonal is grid[0][0] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][2] = 'w' → all 'w's.\n\nAnti-diagonal is grid[0][2] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][0] = 'w' → all 'w's.\n\nSo main and anti-diag are same. Now, the rest of the cells:\n\nPositions (0,1): 's'; (1,0): 's'; (1,2): 's'; (2,1): 's'.\n\nSo all non-diagonal cells are 's's. And 's' is different from 'w'. So this meets the conditions, hence output is YES.\n\nAh, okay, so my earlier reasoning was correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: x, p, x → not same. So fails step 3 → output NO.\n\nSo, the code needs to correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, thinking about the code.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, read n lines. Each line is a string, perhaps with leading/trailing spaces, but according to the input description, each line is n letters.\n\nSo, for each line, we can strip the newline, but perhaps just take the entire line.\n\nSo, grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)].\n\nNow, for the diagonals:\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\nThen, check if all elements in main_diag are the same.\n\nSimilarly for anti_diag.\n\nAlso, check if main_diag[0] == anti_diag[0].\n\nIf any of these is false, output NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for the non-diagonal cells:\n\ndiag_char = main_diag[0]\n\nother_chars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(other_chars) == 0:\n    # This would be when n=1, but n is >=3, so no.\nelse:\n    # Check if all same and != diag_char.\n    first_other = other_chars[0]\n    if all(c == first_other for c in other_chars) and first_other != diag_char:\n        output YES\n    else:\n        output NO\n\nWait, but for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4 in number: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So for n=3, the other_chars list will have 4 elements.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nCase where n=3 and the grid is:\n\naaa\naaa\naaa\n\nThen, main diag is a,a,a, anti diag is a,a,a → same.\n\nOther chars are all a's → same as diag_char. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid is:\n\naba\nbab\naba\n\nMain diag: a, b, a → not same. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=5, grid is filled with 'x's except the diagonals are 'x's and others are 'y's.\n\nWait, no. Because the non-diagonal must be same and different from the diagonal.\n\nSo, for n=5, the grid must have all the diagonals as 'x's, and all non-diagonal as 'y's, and 'y' != 'x'.\n\nSo, that would be a valid 'X'.\n\nNow, what about when n=1? Well, the problem says n is at least 3, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Off-by-one errors in the indices when checking the anti-diagonal.\n- Forgetting that the center cell is part of both diagonals, but since it's included in both, that's handled.\n\nImplementing the code.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck the diagonals.\n\nIf diagonals are same and same for both, proceed.\n\nElse, print NO.\n\nElse, collect all non-diagonal chars.\n\nCheck if they are all same and different from diagonal.\n\nIf yes, print YES, else NO.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmain_diag = []\nanti_diag = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    main_diag.append(grid[i][i])\n    anti_diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n\n# Check main_diag is same\nif not all(c == main_diag[0] for c in main_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti_diag is same\nif not all(c == anti_diag[0] for c in anti_diag):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check main_diag and anti_diag are same\nif main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\ndiag_char = main_diag[0]\n\nother_chars = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not other_chars:\n    # Not possible since n >=3, so other_chars exists\n    pass\n\nother_char = other_chars[0]\nif all(c == other_char for c in other_chars) and other_char != diag_char:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if other_chars is empty? Well, when n is 3, there are 4 cells, which are non-diagonal. So other_chars will have 4 elements.\n\nBut for n=3, the code is correct.\n\nWhat about when n=5? The other_chars will have 25 - 5*2 + 1 = 21 elements (since the center is counted in both diagonals once).\n\nWait, no. For n=5, the main diag has 5 cells, the anti-diag has 5 cells, but the center cell is in both. So total diagonal cells are 5+5-1=9. So non-diagonal is 25-9=16.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, in n=5, the main diagonal is 5 cells (i=0,1,2,3,4). The anti-diagonal is also 5 cells, but the center (2,2) is shared. So total diagonal cells are 5+5-1=9. So non-diagonal cells are 25-9=16.\n\nSo the code correctly collects 16 other_chars.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nTesting against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5.\n\nEach line is:\n\nxooox → row 0\noxoxo → row1\nsoxoo → row2\noxoxo → row3\nxooox → row4\n\nMain diag: [0][0] = 'x', [1][1]='o', [2][2]='o', [3][3]='o', [4][4]='x'\n\nSo main_diag is ['x','o','o','o','x']. Not all same. So code prints 'NO'.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3.\n\nLines are:\n\nwsw → row0: 'w','s','w'\nsws → row1: 's','w','s'\nwsw → row2: 'w','s','w'\n\nMain diag: 'w', 'w', 'w' → same.\nAnti diag: 'w', 'w', 'w' → same.\nmain_diag[0] == anti_diag[0], yes.\n\nOther chars: (0,1)='s', (1,0)='s', (1,2)='s', (2,1)='s' → all 's's. 's' != 'w' → yes.\n\nSo output 'YES'.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=3.\n\nGrid:\n\nxpx → row0: 'x','p','x'\npxp → row1: 'p','x','p'\nxpe → row2: 'x','p','e'\n\nMain diag: row0[0]=x, row1[1]=x, row2[2]=e. So not same. So code exits early with 'NO'.\n\nThus, code works for samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\naaa\naaa\naaa\n\nMain diag is a, a, a. anti diag is a,a,a.\n\nOther chars are all a's. So other_char is a, same as diag_char. So condition fails. Output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\naba\nbab\naba\n\nMain diag: a, b, a → not same. Output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\naba\naca\naba\n\nMain diag: a, a, a → same.\n\nAnti diag: a, a, a → same.\n\nOther chars: (0,1)='b'; (1,0)='c'; (1,2)='c'; (2,1)='b'. So other_chars = ['b','c','c','b'] → not all same. So output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nSuppose the grid is:\n\nx o o o o\no x o x o\no o x o o\no x o x o\no o o x o\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think of an X.\n\nWait, the diagonals are all 'x's, and the others are all 'y's.\n\nWait, perhaps for n=5:\n\nRow 0: x y y y y\nRow 1: y x y y y\nRow 2: y y x y y\nRow 3: y y y x y\nRow 4: y y y y x\n\nNo, that's not an X. Because the diagonals are x's, but the other cells are y's.\n\nSo code should return YES.\n\nSo, the code will collect the main and anti-diags as 'x's, same.\n\nOther chars: all 'y's, which are different from 'x's. So output 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nRows:\n\nxyx\nyxy\nxyx\n\nMain diag: x, x, x → same.\n\nAnti diag: x, x, x → same.\n\nOther chars: y's. So output 'YES'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid is:\n\nx y x\ny x y\nx y x\n\nSo main diag is x, x, x. anti diag is x, x, x. Others are y's. So output 'YES'.\n\nSo code correctly handles.\n\nNow, what about when n=3 and the diagonals are same, but the other chars are not same.\n\nLike:\n\nx y x\ny y y\nx y x\n\nMain diag: x, y, x → not same. So output 'NO'.\n\nSo code correctly returns 'NO'.\n\nI think the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, implementing it in Python.\n\nWait, but in the code, after reading the grid, for each i in 0..n-1, grid[i][i] is main_diag.\n\nSame for grid[i][n-1 -i] is anti_diag.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
