Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the numeric value modulo 1e9+7. Hmm, right. So Andrew starts with a string s, which consists of digits. Then, for each query, which is in the form \"di->ti\", we replace every occurrence of digit di in the current string s with the substring ti. After all the queries, we need to compute the resulting number modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do the substitutions work? Because each substitution affects the string, and each subsequent substitution is applied to the already transformed string. So the order of the queries matters a lot. We can't process them in reverse or anything; they must be applied in the given order.\n\nThe tricky part here is that each substitution could potentially change multiple digits at once, especially since each substitution replaces a single digit with a possibly multi-digit string. For example, if the current string has '2', and a query says replace '2' with '00', then after that substitution, any '2's will become '00's, which themselves can be substituted again if another query targets '0'.\n\nSo how do we model this efficiently?\n\nHmm, the initial approach might be to process each query one by one, applying the substitution to the current string. But wait, for each query, we'd have to replace every occurrence of di in s with ti. But since the substitutions are done in sequence, each substitution affects the next.\n\nBut for n up to 105, and each substitution potentially affecting the entire string, this seems manageable. However, for each substitution, replacing every occurrence of di with ti could take O(N) time, where N is the length of the string. Since n is up to 105, and each substitution can involve a string of up to 105 characters (since the sum of ti lengths is 105), the total operations would be around 105 * 100, which is manageable.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think: instead of actually modifying the string each time, maybe we can represent the substitutions in a way that allows us to compute the final string quickly. Like, for each digit, track what it gets replaced with, considering the order of substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the substitutions as a function. For each digit d, we can keep a mapping of what it becomes after all substitutions. But the problem is that the substitutions are processed in order, and each substitution can affect multiple digits, including those that were introduced by previous substitutions.\n\nWait, no. Each substitution is processed sequentially, so each substitution only affects the current state of the string. So for example, if the first substitution is \"2->00\", then the second substitution might be \"0->5\". So any 0s in the string after the first substitution would get replaced by 5. So the order is crucial.\n\nSo processing each substitution step by step is necessary. But doing this naively by modifying the string each time could be computationally expensive for large strings, but given the constraints (s is up to 105 characters, and each substitution could add more), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut wait, for each substitution, the replacement is done for every occurrence of di in the current string. So for a substitution, the time complexity is O(len(s)), because for each character in s, we check if it's equal to di, and if so, replace it with ti. But in the worst case, each substitution could double the length of the string. So for 105 substitutions, each potentially doubling the length, the string could become very long—like 2^105, which is way too big.\n\nWait, but the initial string is up to 105 characters, and each substitution can add up to 105 characters per substitution. So for 105 substitutions, each adding 105, the total length could be up to 105*105=11025, which is manageable.\n\nWait, no. Because for each substitution, the replacement string ti can be longer than the original di. For example, if di is '2' and ti is '0000', then each '2' is replaced by four '0's. So the string can grow exponentially.\n\nBut the maximum possible length after 105 substitutions is 105 * (some factor). Wait, let's see: each substitution can multiply the length by up to the length of ti. But since the sum of ti lengths across all substitutions is 105, the maximum possible length of the string after all substitutions is 105 * 105 = 11025, but that's if each substitution adds a single character each time. But if some substitution adds multiple, like ti being 105 characters, then the string can reach 105 * 105 = 11025, which is manageable in Python.\n\nSo perhaps the straightforward approach is feasible: process each substitution step by step, modifying the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then compute the resulting numeric value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). Each query specifies replacing a digit with another substring, and these replacements are applied in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Read the initial string `s` and the number of queries `n`.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given substring. This is done step-by-step to ensure each substitution affects the subsequent ones correctly.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a number and compute its remainder when divided by \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\n\ncurrent_s = s\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().split('->')\n    di = parts[0]\n    ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n    new_s = []\n    for c in current_s:\n        if c == di:\n            new_s.append(ti)\n        else:\n            new_s.append(c)\n    current_s = ''.join(new_s)\n\n# Now compute the numeric value mod MOD\nresult = 0\nfor c in current_s:\n    result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from the input.\n2. **Processing Each Query**: For each query, split it into the digit `di` to be replaced and the substring `ti`. Iterate through each character in the current string, replacing `di` with `ti` where found.\n3. **Building the Result String**: After processing all queries, the resulting string is built by iterating through each character and computing the numeric value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n4. **Efficiency Considerations**: The approach ensures that each substitution is applied correctly in sequence, handling potential exponential growth in the string length due to substitutions, but within manageable limits given the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes each substitution and computes the final result using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.",
