    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a certain number of vertices n can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph has specific construction rules. \n\nHmm, let me try to understand the structure. So initially, there's one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it, where k is greater than 1. Then, for each vertex that has only one edge (the leaves), we connect each to k new vertices. And importantly, this last step must be done at least once. So the minimal case would have two layers: the root with k children, and each of those children having k children, but wait no—no, the initial step adds k children, then each of them must add their own k children, but this step is done at least once. So in the minimal case, after adding the first layer, we do the second step once.\n\nWait, let me think again. The process is:\n\n1. Start with 1 node.\n2. Add k nodes connected to it. Now, total nodes are 1 + k.\n3. For each node that has degree 1 (so the k nodes just added), add k new nodes connected to each. So each of these k nodes becomes a parent to k new nodes. So each such node contributes k new nodes.\n\nBut wait, this step is done at least once. So the minimal case is when we perform this step once. So the structure would be like a star with two layers. The root has k children, each of which has k children, making the total nodes 1 + k + k*k = 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but wait: No, because the step is done at least once. So for the minimal case, it's the initial step plus one more step. So the minimal case is when the tree has depth 2. So the total nodes would be 1 (root) + k (first layer) + k * k (second layer) = 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but looking at the example given in the problem statement. For k=4, the smallest possible snowflake has 1 +4 +4*4= 21 nodes. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the general formula for the number of nodes in a snowflake is 1 + k*(m) + k^m, where m is the number of times the second step is performed. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is a rooted tree where each node in the first layer has exactly m children, and all nodes beyond the first layer are leaves. Or wait, no. Because according to the problem statement, each leaf (nodes with degree 1) must undergo the process of adding k children. So the process is recursive.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake is a tree where every internal node (except the root) has exactly k children. No, that can't be right because the root has k children, but each of those has k children, and so on. But in that case, the tree is a perfect k-ary tree of some depth d ≥2. Because the root is depth 0, its children are depth 1, and so on. So the total number of nodes would be the sum of k^d for d from 0 to t, where t is the depth.\n\nWait, but in our case, the process requires that after the initial step (adding the first layer of k nodes), each node in that layer must have their own k children. So the tree must have at least two layers beyond the root. So the minimal depth is 2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 (root) + k (depth 1) + k² (depth 2) + ... + k^m (depth m), where m ≥2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the step where each node with degree 1 adds k children must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when the tree has depth 2. So for a snowflake to exist with n nodes, n must be equal to the sum of a geometric series of some k>1, with at least three terms (since root, layer 1, layer 2).\n\nWait, no. Wait, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². For m=3, it's 1 +k +k² +k³, etc. So the total nodes is S = 1 + k*(1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}) ), since each step adds a layer of k^i nodes. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nRoot: 1 node.\n\nLayer 1: k nodes.\n\nLayer 2: each of the k nodes has k children, so k².\n\nLayer 3: each of the k² nodes has k children, so k³.\n\nAnd so on until m layers beyond the root.\n\nSo the total is 1 + k + k² + ... +k^m.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial step is adding the first layer (layer 1). Then, each leaf (layer 1) must add their own layer (layer 2). Then, each leaf of layer 2 must add their own layer (layer 3), and so on, but this step is done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have layer 2. So the minimal total is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the sum is S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of layers beyond the root. Since m ≥2, because the step is done at least once, meaning that after layer 1, we add at least one more layer.\n\nWait, no. Because m represents the number of layers beyond the root. So for the minimal case, m is 1: root (layer 0), layer 1 (k nodes), layer 2 (k² nodes). So the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but in that case, m=2: the sum is 1 +k +k². So m is the number of layers beyond the root. So the sum is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m} k^i = 1 + (k*(k^m -1))/(k-1)).\n\nAlternatively, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) -1? No, wait: the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So if m is the maximum depth, then the sum is that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's take an example. For k=2, the minimal case is 1+2+4=7 nodes. So for m=2, the sum is 1+2+4=7. Which is (2^3 -1)/(2-1) =7.\n\nYes, correct. So in general, S = (k^{d} -1)/(k-1), where d is the depth of the tree. Since the tree is a perfect k-ary tree of depth d, where d ≥2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: Given n, determine whether there exists an integer k>1 and an integer d≥2 such that n equals (k^{d} -1)/(k-1).\n\nOur task is to check for each n whether such k and d exist.\n\nSo the steps for each test case would be:\n\n1. For the given n, iterate over possible values of d starting from 2 upwards. For each d, compute whether there exists a k>1 such that (k^{d} -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nWait, but the maximum possible d for a given n is limited. For example, when k=2, the maximum d is log2(n) +1. For larger k, d can be smaller.\n\nSo for each n, we can loop d from 2 up to log_2(n) (since for larger d, k would be smaller, but we can handle that by checking d up to 60 or so, because 2^60 is about 1e18, which is manageable.\n\nFor each d in 2..60, we can try to find a k>1 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about solving for k given d.\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i = n\n\nWait, because (k^d -1)/(k-1) is the sum of a geometric series from k^0 to k^{d-1}.\n\nYes, because (k^d -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nSo, for a given d, we can compute n and see if n can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series of length d, with ratio k>1.\n\nSo for each d starting from 2 up to 60, we can perform a binary search for k in [2, ... ,n], but that's too slow. Alternatively, for each d, we can try to find k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each d, we can try to find k numerically.\n\nBut another approach is to note that for a fixed d, the sum s(k) increases with k. So for a given d, the sum s(k) increases as k increases. So for each d, we can binary search for k in [2, ... , some upper bound], and check if s(k) equals n.\n\nBut what's the upper bound for k for a given d? Well, for a given d, the sum s(k) is at least 1 +2 +4 +...+2^{d-1}=2^d -1. So for a given d, if n < 2^d -1, then no solution for k>=2. But wait, no, because for d=2, 2^d -1=3, but for k=2, sum is 1+2=3.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d, the minimum possible sum is 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... +2^{d-1} }=2^d -1. So if n is less than 2^d -1, then no solution for that d.\n\nWait, but that's only true when d is such that 2^{d} -1 <=n. For example, d=2: min sum is 3. So if n is 4, for d=2, the min sum is 3, but 4 is larger. So perhaps for each d, we can compute the lower bound for k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each d, the minimal sum is when k=2, which is 2^d -1. So for each d, if 2^d -1 >n, then no solution for that d.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nLoop d from 2 to max_depth (like 60):\n\n   Compute lower = 2^d -1.\n\n   If lower >n: break, since for higher d, lower will be even bigger.\n\n   Else:\n\n      We need to find a k>1 such that s(k,d) =n, where s(k,d) is the sum of d terms, each term being k^i for i from 0 to d-1.\n\nBut wait, s(k,d) is (k^d -1)/(k-1). So for a given d, we can model this as f(k) = (k^d -1)/(k-1) -n=0.\n\nWe can perform a binary search for k in [2, ... , something], but what is the upper limit for k?\n\nWell, for a fixed d, s(k) increases as k increases. So for a given d and n, if s(2,d) >n, then no solution. Otherwise, we can binary search between 2 and some upper bound.\n\nWait, but s(2,d) is 2^d -1, which we already checked earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps for each d, the maximum possible k is such that s(k,d) <=n.\n\nWait, but for each d, the function s(k) increases as k increases. So for a given d, if s(2,d) >n, then no solution. Else, we can binary search for k in [2, ... ,k_max], where k_max is the maximum possible k for this d.\n\nWait, but for a given d, the maximum possible k could be up to something like cube root of n, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a given d, the sum s(k) is at least d*2^{d-1}, since each term in the sum is at least 2^{i}. Wait, that might not hold for larger k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given d, the maximum k is such that the sum doesn't exceed n. So for a binary search, the lower bound is 2, upper bound can be something like n^(1/(d-1)).\n\nBecause for large k, the sum s(k) is dominated by the last term, which is k^{d-1}. So k^{d-1} is roughly n, so k is around n^(1/(d-1)). So the upper bound for k can be set as min( (n)^(1/(d-1)) +1, some other limit).\n\nBut for binary search, setting the upper bound to 1e9 or something might be acceptable, but for t=1e4, and d up to 60, that would be 1e4 *60 *log(1e9) which is manageable.\n\nWait, but 1e4 *60 is 6e5 operations, each with log(1e9) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n, loop d from 2 to 60:\n\n   compute s(2,d) = 2^d -1.\n\n   if s(2,d) >n: skip, because for higher d, s(2,d) will be even larger.\n\n   else:\n\n      compute low=2, high= some upper limit (like n^(1/(d-1)) +2).\n\n      perform binary search for k in [low, high] such that s(k,d) ==n.\n\n      if found, return YES.\n\nIf after all d's, no such k is found, return NO.\n\nNow, the key is to implement the binary search correctly.\n\nBut calculating s(k,d) for a given k and d could be problematic because for large d and k, the numbers can get very big, leading to integer overflows or inaccuracies.\n\nIn Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, but computation time could be an issue for very large exponents.\n\nWait, but for d up to 60, and k up to say 1e9, the calculation of k^d could be very expensive, but for 1e4 test cases, it's manageable because each binary search is logarithmic.\n\nBut wait, wait: when d is 60, and k is 2, then k^d is 1e18, which is the maximum n allowed. So for higher d's, the maximum k is 2.\n\nSo for each d, the binary search's high can be determined based on d.\n\nWait, for d=2, the maximum k is sqrt(n) +1.\n\nWait, no, for d=2, s(k,2) =1 +k. So 1 +k =n =>k =n-1. So high can be n-1.\n\nBut for d=3, s(k,3)=1 +k +k² =n. So k² is about n, so k is about sqrt(n).\n\nSo for a given d, the maximum possible k is such that s(k,d) <=n.\n\nBut for binary search, perhaps we can compute for each k, s(k,d) and compare to n.\n\nBut computing s(k,d) could be computationally intensive for large d and k, but in Python, it's manageable as long as the exponent isn't too big.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that for each d, the sum s(k,d) can be computed incrementally and compared to n without having to compute k^d directly, which could be expensive.\n\nWait, perhaps in the binary search, for a given mid value, we can compute the sum step by step and stop early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nYes, that's a good idea. Because for large d, computing k^d might be too big, but if during the sum computation we notice that the current sum is already larger than n, we can break early and return that it's too big.\n\nSo the steps for each d:\n\nCompute low=2, high=upper_bound.\n\nWhile low <=high:\n\n   mid = (low + high)//2\n\n   compute sum_s = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^{d-1}\n\n   but compute this step by step, and if at any point sum_s exceeds n, break and return that mid is too big.\n\n   if sum_s ==n: return True.\n\n   else if sum_s <n: low=mid +1.\n\n   else: high=mid -1.\n\nSo for each mid, compute the sum step by step.\n\nThis way, even for large d, the computation is manageable.\n\nSo now, putting it all together:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n <3: output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      for d in 2 to 60:\n\n          compute s(2,d) =2^d -1.\n\n          if s(2,d) >n: continue to next d.\n\n          else:\n\n              compute low=2, high= ?\n\n              what's the upper limit for high?\n\n              Well, for d=2: high can be up to n-1, but for larger d, it's better to compute high as the minimal between (n)^(1/(d-1)) +2 and some limit.\n\n              But to avoid complications, perhaps set high to min( (n)^(1/(d-1)) +2, n )\n\n              Because for d >=2, the maximum possible k is when k^(d-1) is about n.\n\n              So for binary search, set high as min( (n)^(1/(d-1)) +2, n )\n\n              Then perform binary search:\n\n                  while low <=high:\n\n                      mid = (low +high) //2\n\n                      compute s = sum_{i=0}^{d-1} mid^i\n\n                          Initialize s=1, current=1.\n\n                          for i in 1 to d-1:\n\n                              current *= mid\n\n                              s += current\n\n                              if s >n: break.\n\n                          if after all steps, s ==n: return YES.\n\n                          else if s <n: low=mid +1.\n\n                          else: high=mid -1.\n\n              if found: return YES.\n\n      after all d's: return NO.\n\nWait, but wait: for d=2, s(k,2) =1 +k. So n must be >=3.\n\nSo for n=3, d=2, k=2: 1+2=3, which is valid.\n\nSo for each n, start by checking d=2 first, which is the minimal possible.\n\nBut in code, for each d from 2 to 60, we'll perform this check.\n\nNow, what about n=1: impossible, since k>1 and d>=2. So sum is at least 1+2+4=7. So n=1 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, n=2 is invalid.\n\nSo in code, if n <3, output NO.\n\nAnother thing to consider: for d=60, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is the maximum n. So for d=60, the only possible k is 2, because 2^60-1 is 1e18, which is the maximum n.\n\nSo for d=60, we can compute s(2,60) and see if it's equal to n.\n\nBut for d=60, the sum is 1 +2 +4 + ... + 2^59 = 2^60 -1. So for n=2^60 -1, it's valid.\n\nSo in code, for each d from 2 to 60, compute s(2,d) and see if it's equal to n. If yes, then output YES.\n\nWait, but for d=2, s(2,2)=3.\n\nSo for n=3, it's valid.\n\nBut for n=4, it's also possible that for d=3, k=2: 1+2+4=7, which is more than 4. So no.\n\nWait, but for d=2, n=4 is 1 +k =4 →k=3. So yes, for d=2, k=3, sum is 4.\n\nSo n=4 is valid.\n\nWait, so the algorithm correctly captures this.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\nSample Output:\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nLet's walk through each n:\n\nn=9: Check for d from 2 to 60.\n\nd=2: 1 +k=9 →k=8. So s(8,2)=9. So YES. But sample output is NO.\n\nWait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, the sample output for n=9 is 'NO', but according to our reasoning, d=2 and k=8 gives sum 9, which is a valid snowflake. So why is the sample output NO?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the initial step is adding k>1 new vertices, then each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (so the new ones) must add k new vertices, and this step is done at least once.\n\nWait, so the minimal snowflake is the root plus the first layer plus the second layer. So for d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nAh! Oh right, I made a mistake earlier. So the snowflake is a tree of depth d, where d is the number of layers beyond the root. So the minimal depth is 2, meaning that the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo my previous approach was wrong. Because the sum for a snowflake is not (k^d -1)/(k-1), but rather (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) -k^d.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sum for a snowflake is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m}, where m is the maximum depth, and m >=2.\n\nWait, no, the initial step adds k nodes. Then each of those k nodes adds k nodes. So after two steps, the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nThen, each of the new nodes (the k² ones) must add k nodes each, making the sum 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nWait, no: the initial step is step 1: add k nodes. Step 2: each of those k nodes adds k nodes. So after step 2, the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nStep 3: each of the k² nodes adds k nodes, sum becomes 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nAnd so on. So the sum after m steps (each step being the addition of a new layer) is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the step must be done at least once. So the minimal sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the sum is S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥2.\n\nWait, no: because the initial step adds the first layer, and the step is done at least once, which is adding the second layer. So the minimal sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the sum is S = sum_{i=0}^m k^i, with m≥2.\n\nSo for example, for k=4, the minimal sum is 1+4+16=21.\n\nSo in the sample input, n=9: does any k>1 and m≥2 exist such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i =9?\n\nCheck d=m+1? Or perhaps I'm getting confused with the indices.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express it: the sum is S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m≥2.\n\nSo for d=3: S =1 +k +k².\n\nWait, for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for n=9, can it be written as 1 +k +k² for some k>1?\n\nSo 1 +k +k² =9 →k² +k -8=0 →k=( -1 ±sqrt(33))/2. So positive solution is (sqrt(33)-1)/2 ≈ (5.744-1)/2≈2.37. Not integer. So no solution for d=3.\n\nWhat about d=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ =9.\n\nCheck possible k:\n\nk=2: 1+2+4+8=15>9.\n\nk=1: sum is 4, but k>1.\n\nNo.\n\nd=2: sum is 1 +k =9 →k=8.\n\nWhich would make the sum 9, but that's for m=1, which is the initial step plus zero additional steps. Because for d=2, m=1, but the problem requires the step to be done at least once.\n\nWait, so the sum for m=2 is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for d=2, it's m=1, which is the initial step only. So the step is not done at least once.\n\nSo in our problem, the sum must be at least 1 +k +k².\n\nThus, for a snowflake, the sum is S =1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥2.\n\nSo for n=9, the possible sums are:\n\nm=2: 1 +k +k²=9 →k≈2.37 →invalid.\n\nm=3:1 +k +k² +k³=9.\n\nTesting k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>9.\n\nk=1: sum is 4.\n\nNo solution.\n\nThus, n=9 is invalid. Hence the sample output is 'NO'.\n\nSo the mistake was in the initial understanding of the problem: the sum is not (k^d-1)/(k-1), but rather the sum up to m terms, where m≥2.\n\nSo the correct approach is to find for a given n, whether there exists k>1 and m≥2 such that 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m =n.\n\nSo the equation is sum_{i=0}^m k^i =n.\n\nThus, for each test case n, we need to find if there exists k>1 and m≥2, such that n is equal to the sum of a geometric series with m+1 terms, first term 1, ratio k>1.\n\nSo the plan is adjusted:\n\nFor each n:\n\n   if n < 1 +2 +4=7: output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      for m in 2 to 60:\n\n          compute the sum s=1 +k +k² + ... +k^m.\n\n          So for each possible m, find if there exists k>1 such that s=n.\n\nBut since m can be up to 60, for each m, we can perform a binary search for k.\n\nBut wait, m is the number of terms beyond the first. Or wait, m is the highest exponent.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to loop m from 2 to log2(n), since for larger m, the sum will be larger.\n\nWait, but for each m, the sum s must be at least 1 +2 +4 + ... +2^m.\n\nWhich is 2^{m+1} -1.\n\nSo for each m, if 2^{m+1} -1 >n: no solution for this m.\n\nElse, we can proceed.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n <7: output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      for m in 2 to 60:\n\n          compute s_min = 2^{m+1} -1.\n\n          if s_min >n: continue.\n\n          else:\n\n              perform binary search for k in [2, ... ] to see if sum_{i=0}^m k^i =n.\n\n              if found: output YES.\n\n      after all m, output NO.\n\nSo now, for each m from 2 to 60:\n\n   compute s_min = 2^{m+1} -1.\n\n   if s_min >n: skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      compute the minimal k is 2, and maximal k is such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i ≤n.\n\n      but since the sum increases with k, we can binary search for k.\n\n      For each candidate k, compute the sum.\n\nBut for large m and k, the sum could be huge, so we need to compute it efficiently.\n\nSo the binary search for k would be between 2 and some upper bound.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k for a given m and n?\n\nThe sum is s(k,m) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWe can approximate this as k^m ≤ s(k,m) ≤k^{m+1}.\n\nBut for a given n, and m, the maximum possible k is such that k^m <=n.\n\nWait, no, because the sum is larger than k^m.\n\nSo the maximum possible k is such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) <=n.\n\nBut finding k is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, we can perform a binary search for k in [2, ... , n^(1/m)].\n\nBecause for large k, the sum is dominated by k^m.\n\nSo for binary search, the high can be set to min(n^(1/m)+1, something like 1e9), but in practice, for each m, the upper bound is manageable.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can compute the high as 2, and double it until the sum exceeds n.\n\nWait, but for m=2 and n=9, the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nWe can see that for k=2, sum is 7; for k=3, sum is 13. So for n=9, the binary search for m=2 would look for k between 2 and 3.\n\nBut since 7<9<13, no exact match.\n\nSo in code, for each m:\n\n   compute low=2, high=2.\n\n   while s(high, m) <n:\n\n       high *=2\n\n   then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\ndef is_valid(n):\n    if n <7:\n        return False\n    for m in range(2, 61):\n        # Compute s_min = 2^{m+1} -1\n        s_min = (1 << (m+1)) -1\n        if s_min >n:\n            continue\n        # Binary search for k\n        low =2\n        high=2\n        while True:\n            s = sum_series(high, m)\n            if s <n:\n                if high > 1e18:\n                    break\n                high *=2\n            else:\n                break\n        # Now perform binary search\n        while low <=high:\n            mid = (low +high)//2\n            s = sum_series(mid, m)\n            if s ==n:\n                return True\n            elif s <n:\n                low = mid +1\n            else:\n                high = mid -1\n    return False\n\ndef sum_series(k, m):\n    if m ==0:\n        return 1\n    s =1\n    current =1\n    for i in range(1, m+1):\n        current *=k\n        s += current\n        if s >1e18*2:  # Avoid overflow in case of very large numbers\n            return s\n    return s\n\nBut wait, for m up to 60, and k up to 1e18, this function may take a lot of steps. So for m=60, and k=2, the loop runs 60 times, which is manageable.\n\nSo for each m, the binary search is O(log(max_k)), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=9.\n\nCheck for m=2:\n\nsum(k,2) =1 +k +k² =9.\n\nLooking for k where 1 +k +k²=9.\n\nTry k=2: 1+2+4=7 <9.\n\nk=3:1+3+9=13>9. So no solution.\n\nm=3:\n\nsum(k,3)=1 +k +k² +k³=9.\n\nk=2:1+2+4+8=15>9.\n\nk=1:4<9, but k>1.\n\nNo solution.\n\nThus, n=9 returns NO.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6.\n\nCheck for m=2:\n\nsum=1 +k +k²=6.\n\nk=1: sum is 3 <6.\n\nk=2: 7>6.\n\nNo solution.\n\nm=3:\n\nsum=1 +k +k² +k³=6.\n\nk=1: sum=4 <6.\n\nk=2: sum=15>6.\n\nNo.\n\nBut wait, what about m=1? No, because the step must be done at least once.\n\nWait, but for m=2, sum is 1 +k +k²=6.\n\nWe have to find integer k>1.\n\nCheck k=2: 7>6.\n\nk=1: sum is 3.\n\nNo.\n\nThus, n=6 is invalid. But the sample output says 'YES' for n=6.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the sample input includes 6, and the sample output is 'YES'. So according to the problem statement, it should be possible.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's definition of the snowflake.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake is built in such a way that after the initial step, the leaves can choose to add their own children or not, but the problem states that each leaf must add their own children at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when the initial step is done, then each of the leaves adds their own children once.\n\nSo the minimal sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nWait, but for n=6, perhaps it can be formed with m=2, k=2.\n\nWait, 1+2+4=7>6. So no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m=1: but the step must be done at least once.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for m=1, but that would mean that the step is done zero times.\n\nSo no, it's invalid.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake can be constructed in a way that the initial step is done, and then some leaves add their children, others don't. But the problem says that each vertex that is connected by only one edge must add their children, and this step is done at least once.\n\nWait, perhaps the step is done at least once globally, but not for every leaf.\n\nNo, the problem statement says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the step is done at least once, but it's unclear whether it's done for all leaves or just at least one.\n\nWait, perhaps the step is done once, but for a subset of leaves.\n\nWait, that complicates things.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial step is to connect the root to k new nodes. Then, the step is done at least once, which probably refers to all leaves adding their children. Because otherwise, the structure would not be a regular tree.\n\nBut perhaps the problem allows for the step to be done at least once for any subset of leaves, not necessarily all.\n\nBut that's unclear.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo perhaps the step is done once, but for all current leaves.\n\nSo in the minimal case, the root is connected to k leaves. Then, each of those k leaves adds k children. So the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut for n=6, can we have a sum of 6?\n\nWait, perhaps n=6 can be achieved with a different structure. Maybe the root is connected to 5 nodes. Then, each of those 5 nodes adds 1 child. Wait, no, because k must be >1.\n\nWait, no, because k is fixed for the entire snowflake.\n\nWait, perhaps k can vary for different layers, but the problem states that all new nodes added in the same step have the same k.\n\nSo each step uses the same k.\n\nThus, the initial step is to add k=2 nodes, then each of those adds 2 nodes. Sum is 7.\n\nBut 7 is larger than 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the step is done multiple times.\n\nWait, but for n=6, perhaps it's possible with m=3, k=1, but k must be >1.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that the step is done at least once, but not necessarily that all leaves are processed in each step",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices \\( n \\) can form a snowflake graph as defined by Rudolf. The snowflake graph is constructed by starting with one vertex and recursively adding layers of vertices such that each new layer has \\( k \\) more vertices than the previous layer, where \\( k > 1 \\). The process must be done at least once beyond the initial step.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The snowflake graph is a rooted tree where each internal node (except the root) has exactly \\( k \\) children. The total number of vertices in such a tree can be represented by the sum of a geometric series. Specifically, for a depth \\( m \\) (where \\( m \\geq 2 \\)), the total number of vertices is given by \\( S = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\).\n\n2. **Check for Valid Snowflake**: For each \\( n \\), we need to check if there exists an integer \\( k > 1 \\) and an integer \\( m \\geq 2 \\) such that \\( n \\) can be expressed as the sum of the geometric series \\( 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m \\).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: For each possible depth \\( m \\) from 2 to 60, we perform a binary search for \\( k \\) within a reasonable range to check if the sum of the series equals \\( n \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_depth = 60\n    for m in range(2, max_depth + 1):\n        # Calculate minimal sum for m+1 layers (k=2)\n        s_min = (1 << (m + 1)) - 1\n        if s_min > n:\n            continue\n        # Binary search for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        while True:\n            s = 0\n            current = 1\n            overflow = False\n            for i in range(m + 1):\n                if s > n:\n                    overflow = True\n                    break\n                s += current\n                if s > n:\n                    overflow = True\n                current *= high\n                if current > n and i < m:\n                    # Further multiplication will only increase, so break\n                    break\n            if overflow:\n                break\n            if s < n:\n                if high > 1e18:\n                    break\n                high *= 2\n            else:\n                break\n        # Now perform binary search between low and high\n        left, right = low, high\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            s = 0\n            current = 1\n            for i in range(m + 1):\n                if s > n:\n                    break\n                s += current\n                if s > n:\n                    break\n                current *= mid\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    for i in range(1, t+1):\n        n = int(input[i])\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Small \\( n \\)**: If \\( n \\) is less than 7, it immediately returns \"NO\" because the smallest valid snowflake has 7 vertices.\n3. **Loop Through Depths**: For each possible depth \\( m \\) from 2 to 60, compute the minimum possible sum for \\( k = 2 \\).
