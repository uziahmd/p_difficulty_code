Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square of letters forms an 'X'. The conditions are specific. Valera's paper is a square with side length n (n is odd). We need to check if the letters form an X. \n\nHmm, what's the criteria for an X? From the description, on both diagonals, all letters must be the same. And all the other squares (the ones not on either diagonal) must contain the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, right. So the first step is to identify the two diagonals. For a square matrix, the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left.\n\nSo, for each cell in these diagonals, they must all be the same character. Let's call this 'c1'. Then, all the other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same as each other but different from c1. Let's call this 'c2'.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I'll read the input. The input is n followed by n lines, each containing n characters. Since the input is given as a string, I need to parse it correctly. Each line represents a row of the grid.\n\nOnce I have the grid, I need to extract the main and anti-diagonals. For example, in a 5x5 grid:\n\nPositions on the main diagonal are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4).\nAnti-diagonal: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nWait, but in the sample input, one of them is 3x3. Like the second sample has 3x3 grid. So for a 3x3, main diagonal is [0][0], [1][1], [2][2]. Anti-diagonal is [0][2], [1][1], [2][0].\n\nSo, for each grid, I can collect the main and anti-diagonal elements.\n\nBut wait, the main and anti-diagonals intersect at the center, especially when n is odd. So for n=5, the center is (2,2), which is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo, for the X shape, all elements in both diagonals must be the same. That includes the center. So the main and anti-diagonal must be entirely the same character.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n2. Collect all the main diagonal elements into a list.\n3. Collect all the anti-diagonal elements into another list.\n4. Check if all elements in both diagonals are the same. If not, immediately return NO.\n5. Then, check that all non-diagonal elements are the same as each other and different from the diagonal character.\n\nWait, but for the non-diagonal elements, they should all be the same. So perhaps we can check that all of them are equal to a single value, which is different from the diagonal's value.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead each line, stripping any newlines or spaces, and store as a list of lists or a 2D list.\n\nThen, collect main_diag and anti_diag.\n\nFor main_diag, for i in 0 to n-1, add grid[i][i].\nFor anti_diag, for i in 0 to n-1, add grid[i][n-1 -i].\n\nCheck if all elements in main_diag are the same and all in anti_diag are the same. But wait, the condition says that both diagonals must consist of the same letters. So the main and anti-diagonals must be the same character.\n\nWait no, the problem statement says that both diagonals must consist of the same letters. So for example, if main_diag is all 'x's, then anti_diag must also be all 'x's.\n\nBecause in the X, both diagonals are the same. So first, check that all main_diag are same, say c1. Then check that all anti_diag are same and equal to c1.\n\nIf that's not the case, output NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, for all other cells (non-diagonal), check that they are all the same, say c2, and c2 != c1.\n\nIf all those conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, get main_diag and anti_diag:\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)]\n\nThen, check if main_diag consists of all same chars.\n\nSimilarly for anti_diag.\n\nAnd if main_diag[0] != anti_diag[0], then it's invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because both diagonals must consist of the same character. So main_diag must be all same as each other, and anti_diag must be all same as main_diag.\n\nSo:\n\nif len(main_diag) == 0:  # Not possible since n >=3.\n    pass\nelse:\n    c1 = main_diag[0]\n    if any(ch != c1 for ch in main_diag):\n        # main diag not same\n        return NO\n    if any(ch != c1 for ch in anti_diag):\n        # anti diag not same as main\n        return NO\n\nThen, for the non-diagonal cells, collect all of them and see if they are all same, and different from c1.\n\nHow to collect the non-diagonal cells?\n\nLoop through each cell (i,j), and if (i,j) is not on either diagonal.\n\nWhich cells are on the diagonals?\n\nA cell is on main diagonal if i == j.\n\nA cell is on anti-diagonal if i + j == n-1.\n\nSo for all i, j where i !=j and i + j != n-1.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1 → part of a diagonal.\n\nElse: part of non-diagonal.\n\nSo, collect all such cells' characters.\n\nNow, for these non-diagonal cells, check that all are same, and different from c1.\n\nSo, collect all non-diagonal characters into a list.\n\nIf the list is empty? Well, n can be 3, so non-diagonal cells are the four corners except the center.\n\nWait, for n=3:\n\ncells are:\n\n(0,0) → main diag.\n\n(0,2) → anti diag.\n\n(1,1) → both.\n\n(2,0) → anti diag.\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells are none. Wait, no.\n\nWait, for n=3:\n\ncells are:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nMain diag: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)\n\nAnti diag: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)\n\nSo, non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So four cells.\n\nSo for n=3, non-diagonal exists.\n\nSo in code, for n>=3, non-diagonal exists.\n\nSo in code:\n\nnon_diag_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n            continue\n        non_diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if all elements in non_diag_chars are same, and not equal to c1.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, the grid is 5x5.\n\nLet me see:\n\nMain diagonal: positions (0,0)=x, (1,1)=o, (2,2)=o, (3,3)=o, (4,4)=x.\n\nWait, the first row is 'xooox' → [x, o, o, o, x]\n\nSecond row is 'oxoxo' → [o, x, o, x, o]\n\nThird row 'soxoo' → s, o, x, o, o\n\nFourth row 'oxoxo' → o, x, o, x, o\n\nFifth row 'xooox' → x, o, o, o, x.\n\nMain diagonal:\n\ngrid[0][0] = x\n\ngrid[1][1] = x\n\ngrid[2][2] = x\n\ngrid[3][3] = x\n\ngrid[4][4] = x.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, for the second row, 'oxoxo' is indexes 0-4.\n\nAt (1,1): 'x'.\n\nYes.\n\nThird row: 'soxoo' → (2,2) is 'x'.\n\nFourth row: 'oxoxo' → (3,3) is 'x'.\n\nFifth row: 'xooox' → (4,4) is 'x'.\n\nSo main_diag is ['x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x'] → all same.\n\nAnti-diag:\n\ngrid[0][4] is 'x'\n\ngrid[1][3] is 'x'\n\ngrid[2][2] is 'x'\n\ngrid[3][1] is 'x'\n\ngrid[4][0] is 'x'\n\nSo anti-diag is also all 'x's.\n\nSo both diagonals are same.\n\nNow, non-diagonal cells:\n\nWe need to collect all cells not on the diagonals.\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\nFor i=0, j=1: 'o'\n\ni=0, j=2: 'o'\n\ni=0, j=3: 'o'\n\ni=1, j=0: 'o'\n\ni=1, j=2: 'o'\n\ni=1, j=3: 'o'\n\ni=2, j=0: 's'\n\ni=2, j=1: 'o'\n\ni=2, j=3: 'o'\n\ni=3, j=0: 'o'\n\ni=3, j=1: 'x'\n\ni=3, j=2: 'o'\n\ni=4, j=1: 'o'\n\nWait, wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait for n=5, i ranges from 0-4, j same.\n\nFor each cell, check if i == j or i +j ==4.\n\nIf not, collect the char.\n\nSo for i=0:\n\nj=0 → yes.\n\nj=1 → 0+1=1 ≠4 → collect.\n\nj=2 → 0+2=2≠4 → collect.\n\nj=3 → 0+3=3≠4 → collect.\n\nj=4 → yes.\n\nSo for i=0, collect j=1,2,3.\n\nChars are 'o','o','o'.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=0 → 1+0=1≠4 → collect 'o'.\n\nj=1 → yes.\n\nj=2 → 1+2=3≠4 → 'o'.\n\nj=3 → 1+3=4 → yes.\n\nj=4 → 1+4=5≠4 → 'o'.\n\nSo collect 'o' (j=0), 'o' (j=2), 'o' (j=4).\n\ni=2:\n\nj=0 → 2+0=2≠4 → 's'.\n\nj=1 → 2+1=3≠4 → 'o'.\n\nj=2 → yes.\n\nj=3 → 2+3=5≠4 → 'o'.\n\nj=4 → 2+4=6≠4 → 'o'.\n\nCollect 's','o','o','o'.\n\ni=3:\n\nj=0 → 3+0=3≠4 → 'o'.\n\nj=1 →3+1=4 → yes.\n\nj=2 →3+2=5≠4 → 'o'.\n\nj=3 → yes.\n\nj=4 →3+4=7≠4 → 'o'.\n\nCollect 'o' (j=0), 'o' (j=2), 'o' (j=4).\n\ni=4:\n\nj=0 →4+0=4 → yes.\n\nj=1 →4+1=5≠4 → 'o'.\n\nj=2 →4+2=6≠4 → 'o'.\n\nj=3 →4+3=7≠4 → 'o'.\n\nj=4 → yes.\n\nSo collect 'o' (j=1), 'o'(j=2), 'o'(j=3).\n\nPutting all collected chars together:\n\nFrom i=0: o, o, o.\n\ni=1: o, o, o.\n\ni=2: s, o, o, o.\n\ni=3: o, o, o.\n\ni=4: o, o, o.\n\nSo the list is: o, o, o, o, o, o, o, s, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o, o.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\ni=0: 3 o's.\n\ni=1: 3 o's.\n\ni=2: 4 o's (including s? Wait, no. Wait, for i=2, j runs 0-4.\n\nSo for i=2, j=0 is s.\n\nOthers are o.\n\nSo i=2 contributes s, o, o, o.\n\nSo total 4 elements.\n\nSimilarly, i=3: 3 o's.\n\ni=4: 3 o's.\n\nTotal non-diagonal elements: 3+3+4+3+3 = 16.\n\nIn this list, are all the same? No. Because there's an 's' in there.\n\nSo the non-diagonal cells include 's' and 'o's. So they are not all the same. Thus, the overall condition is not met, so output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nWait, no, the input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nSo main_diag is grid[0][0] = w, grid[1][1]=w, grid[2][2]=w.\n\nAnti_diag: grid[0][2]=w, grid[1][1]=w, grid[2][0]=w.\n\nSo both diagonals are 'w's.\n\nNow, non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nTheir values: s, s, s, s.\n\nSo all same, and different from 'w'.\n\nThus, output is YES.\n\nThird sample:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid is:\n\nRow0: x p x\n\nRow1: p x p\n\nRow2: x p e\n\nMain diag: x, x, e.\n\nWait, no:\n\ngrid[0][0] = x.\n\ngrid[1][1] = x.\n\ngrid[2][2] = e.\n\nSo main_diag is [x, x, e] → not all same. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nThus, the samples are handled correctly.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nImplementing in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is provided as a string. So the first line is n, then n lines.\n\nBut the way the input is given is as a list of strings, each representing the rows.\n\nWait, the user wrote the input as ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWait, but that's the input in the problem statement, but in reality, the actual input is given via standard input, which would be a single string, split into lines.\n\nSo in code, I'll read the entire input as a string, split it into lines, and process each line.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nRead next n lines, each line is a row.\n\nStore the grid as a list of lists, each element is a character.\n\nThen perform the checks as discussed.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)]\n\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 -i] for i in range(n)]\n\n# Check if main_diag and anti_diag are all same and equal\nif not (all(c == main_diag[0] for c in main_diag)):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nif not (all(c == main_diag[0] for c in anti_diag)):\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check non-diagonal cells\nnon_diag = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n            continue\n        non_diag.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diag:\n    # Only possible when n=1, but n >=3, so no\n    pass\n\n# Check if all non_diag are same and not equal to main_diag[0]\nif not non_diag:\n    # All cells are on diagonals. So only possible if n=1, but n is >=3 and odd. So this case won't happen.\n    # So for n=3, non_diag exists.\n    # So no need to handle this case.\n    pass\nelse:\n    c_non_diag = non_diag[0]\n    if any(c != c_non_diag for c in non_diag) or c_non_diag == main_diag[0]:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but wait: for n=3, the non_diag is 4 cells. So code will handle it.\n\nTesting the code.\n\nSample 1: The non_diag has s and o's. So condition fails, output NO.\n\nSample 2: non_diag are all 's's, which are not equal to 'w's. So output YES.\n\nSample 3: main_diag has x, x, e. So not all same, output NO.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid where diagonals are 'a's, non-diagonal are 'b's.\n\nOutput YES.\n\nWhat about when non-diagonal are not all same? Output NO.\n\nAlso, what if the non-diagonal cells have a mix of 'a's and 'b's, but the diagonals are 'a's.\n\nThen output is NO.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nn=3, all non-diagonal are 'a's, diagonals are 'b's.\n\nOutput YES.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, diagonals are 'a's, non-diagonal are 'a's.\n\nThen the condition requires non-diagonal to be different from diagonals. So output NO.\n\nThus, code seems correct.\n",
