He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A creates a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So after this step, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C then appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C added them. It can also be equal to both.\n\nSo the string should consist of a sequence of 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's. But wait, noâ€”because B appends 'b's to the end of A's string, which already has 'a's. Then C appends 'c's to the end of that, so the entire string is a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nBut wait, what about other characters? No, because the string is only made up of a, b, c. So the structure must be a's first, then b's, then c's. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nSo the first condition is that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. If any other character appears out of order, it's a NO.\n\nWait, but the string could have a's, then b's, then c's, but with all possible cases. For example, if there are no a's, that's invalid because the initial steps require at least one a and one b after B adds them. Also, after C appends c's, there must be at least one c.\n\nSo the string must start with one or more a's, then one or more b's, then one or more c's. So the string cannot have any a's after the b's or any b's after the c's.\n\nSo the first check is: does the string have the correct order of a's, then b's, then c's without any interleaving?\n\nIf not, output is NO.\n\nOnce the order is correct, we proceed.\n\nThen, we need to count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n\nLet's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string\ncount_b = number of b's in the string\ncount_c = number of c's in the string\n\nWe know that after A and B, the string has at least one a and one b. Then, C adds some c's. The count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. Or, perhaps, equal to both.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" So, count_c (after appending) must be equal to count_a OR count_b.\n\nWait, but before C appends, the string has count_a a's, count_b b's, and zero c's. So when C appends, he adds some number of c's, say x. So the total count_c becomes x.\n\nThe condition is x = count_a OR x = count_b.\n\nBut wait, in the note for the third example, the number of 'c's equals the number of 'b's. So that's allowed.\n\nSo, the count_c after C's addition must be equal to either count_a or count_b (or both).\n\nAdditionally, since C appends at least one c (since the string after B's step has at least one a and one b), count_c must be >= 1.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, \"appends some number of letters 'c'\". Does \"some\" mean zero or more? Or at least one?\n\nLooking back: the problem says, \"C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\nSo, the number of c's is equal to count_a or count_b. So x is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut since count_a is the number of a's in the string before C appends, which is at least 1, and count_b is also at least 1.\n\nSo, count_c after appending is x = count_a or x = count_b.\n\nBut x can't be zero because in the process, C appends some c's. Wait, does \"appends some\" mean at least one? Because if the number of c's was zero before, adding zero would mean C didn't append any. But the problem says \"appends some\", which implies at least one.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"appends some number of letters 'c'\". The wording here suggests that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in a particular order. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must consist of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's and then 'c's without any interleaving or deviation from this order.\n2. **Count Characters**: After ensuring the correct order, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Additionally, both 'a's and 'b's must be present in the string, and at least one 'c' must be added.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is in the correct order: all a's, then all b's, then all c's\nif not s or not all(c == s[0] for c in s):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Split the string into groups of a's, b's, and c's\n    parts = []\n    current = s[0]\n    count = 1\n    for c in s[1:]:\n        if c == current:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            parts.append((current, count))\n            current = c\n            count = 1\n    parts.append((current, count))\n    \n    # Check if there are exactly three parts: a's, b's, c's\n    if len(parts) != 3:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        a_count, b_count, c_count = parts[0][1], parts[1][1], parts[2][1]\n        \n        # Check if there are at least one a and one b before adding c's\n        if a_count < 1 or b_count < 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            # Check if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count\n            if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The code first checks if the string starts with 'a', followed by 'b', and ends with 'c'. If any other order is detected, it immediately returns \"NO\".\n2. **Character Counting**: The string is split into groups of consecutive 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. Each group's count is recorded.\n3. **Validation**: The counts are checked to ensure there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. The number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's for the string to be valid.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the string meets all the required conditions specified in the problem statement.",
