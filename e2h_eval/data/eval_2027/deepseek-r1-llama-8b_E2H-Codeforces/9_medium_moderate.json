Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting souvenirs such that their total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is maximized. Petya has n souvenirs, each with a weight between 1 and 3, and a cost. We need to choose a subset where the sum of weights is ≤m, and the sum of costs is as large as possible.\n\nHmm, the constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So we need an efficient solution, probably O(n*m) is too slow. Wait, but n is 1e5 and m is 3e5, which gives 3e10 operations—way too much. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches. Since the weights are small (only 1,2,3), perhaps we can group them by weight and handle each group separately.\n\nYes, for each weight class (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each possible count of taking items from each weight, we can compute the maximum cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nWait, but how do we combine the counts from each weight? Because the sum of 1*count1 + 2*count2 +3*count3 must be ≤m.\n\nThis sounds like a variation of the knapsack problem, but since the weights are limited, maybe we can find a way to model it efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible number of items taken from weight 3, we can precompute the best possible combinations of 2s and 1s that fit into the remaining weight.\n\nAlternatively, since the weights are small, perhaps we can model the problem using dynamic programming where dp[i][j] represents the maximum cost when considering the first i items, and the current weight used is j.\n\nBut with n=1e5, even O(n*m) is not feasible. So we need a way to reduce the problem's dimensionality.\n\nWait, maybe for each weight class, we can compute a list of prefix sums, sorted by cost. For example, for weight 1, the prefix sum would give the maximum cost for taking k items of weight 1. Similarly for weights 2 and 3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem reduces to choosing a certain number of items from each weight such that the total weight is within m, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nSo let's denote:\n\n- a[k] = maximum cost of taking k items from weight 1.\n- b[k] = maximum cost of taking k items from weight 2.\n- c[k] = maximum cost of taking k items from weight 3.\n\nThen, for all possible k1, k2, k3 such that 1*k1 + 2*k2 +3*k3 ≤m, we need to find the maximum a[k1]+b[k2]+c[k3].\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the maximum over all possible k1, k2, k3?\n\nGiven that m is up to 3e5, but the individual k's can't be more than certain limits. For example, for weight 3, the maximum possible k3 is floor(m/3). Similarly for others.\n\nBut even so, trying all possible combinations isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible number of weight 3 items, say k3, we can compute the maximum number of weight 2 and 1 items that can fit into the remaining weight (m - 3*k3). Then, for each k3, find the best possible (k2, k1) such that 2*k2 +k1 ≤ rem = m -3*k3.\n\nSimilarly, for each k3, we can compute the best possible (k2, k1) pair.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Sort each weight group in descending order of cost.\n2. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n3. Iterate over all possible k3 (from 0 to max_k3), then for each k3, calculate the remaining weight rem = m -3*k3.\n   a. If rem <0, skip.\n   b. Then, for the remaining rem, find the best combination of k2 and k1 such that 2*k2 +k1 ≤ rem.\n   c. To find the best (k2, k1), perhaps for each possible k2, find the maximum k1 that fits into rem -2*k2, and take the maximum a[k1] +b[k2].\n\nBut even this might be time-consuming if done naively because for each k3, we'd have to loop through k2 up to rem//2.\n\nWait, but rem can be up to 3e5, and k3 can be up to 1e5 as well. So 1e5 * 3e5 is 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the approach needs optimization. Maybe for each k3, we can find the optimal k2 quickly.\n\nWait, another idea: For a given rem, the 2*k2 +k1 <= rem can be rewritten as k1 <= rem - 2*k2.\n\nBut since k1 is the number of weight 1 items, and each contributes 1 to the weight, the maximum possible k1 is rem -2*k2.\n\nSo for each k2, we can take min(rem - 2*k2, len(a)) items of weight 1, and sum with b[k2].\n\nBut again, iterating over all possible k2 for each k3 is O(k3_max * k2_max), which is too slow.\n\nWe need a way to, given rem, find the best (k2, k1) pair where 2k2 +k1 ≤ rem, and maximize a[k1] + b[k2].\n\nWait, but the a array is sorted in descending order, so for a given rem, perhaps we can precompute the maximum possible a[k1] for any possible k1.\n\nWait, let's think differently. For a fixed rem, we can express it as 2*k2 +k1 ≤ rem.\n\nWe can precompute for each possible k2, the maximum a[k1] where k1 ≤ rem - 2*k2.\n\nBut how? The a array is already sorted, so for a given x, the maximum a[k1] for k1 ≤x is just a[x], provided x is within the length of a.\n\nWait, yes! Because a is the prefix sum of the sorted list. So for any x, a[x] is the maximum sum for taking x items of weight 1.\n\nSo for a given rem, the maximum a[k1] for k1 ≤ (rem - 2*k2) is a[ min( rem - 2*k2, len(a)-1 ) ].\n\nTherefore, for each k3, we can iterate over possible k2, compute rem = m - 3*k3, then compute the maximum possible a[ min( rem - 2*k2, len_a ) ] + b[k2], but only if 2*k2 ≤ rem.\n\nBut this is still O(k3_max * k2_max), which is too slow.\n\nSo perhaps we can find a way to, for each rem, find the best k2 quickly.\n\nWait, let's think about it: For a fixed rem, we can precompute the best possible b[k2] + a[ min( rem - 2*k2, len_a ) ].\n\nLet me denote this as f(k2) = b[k2] + a[ min( rem - 2*k2, len_a ) ].\n\nWe need to find the k2 that maximizes f(k2).\n\nBut how can we find this maximum quickly?\n\nHmm, note that for each k2, the term rem -2k2 decreases as k2 increases. So the a part depends on how much rem is left after taking k2 items of weight 2.\n\nBut how does f(k2) behave? It's possible that f(k2) first increases and then decreases, making it unimodal. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a sliding window approach or binary search.\n\nWait, but the function f(k2) may not be monotonic, so binary search might not work directly.\n\nAnother idea: For each k3, rem is fixed. We can find all possible k2 where 2*k2 ≤ rem, and then for each possible k2, compute the best possible a[k1]. But even then, for each k3, we have to process a lot of k2's.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can precompute for each possible rem, the best combination of k2 and k1.\n\nBut rem can be up to 3e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo here's an outline of the steps:\n\n1. Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weight: w1, w2, w3.\n\n2. For each group, sort the items in descending order of cost, then compute their prefix sums. So a[k] is the maximum cost for taking exactly k items of weight 1, etc.\n\n3. Compute the maximum possible k3 for weight 3. For each k3 from 0 to min( len(w3), m//3 ), do:\n\n   a. Compute rem = m - 3*k3. If rem <0, skip.\n\n   b. Now, for this rem, find the maximum possible (b[k2] + a[k1]) where 2*k2 +k1 ≤ rem.\n\n   c. To find this maximum, for each possible k2, compute the maximum a[k1] for k1 ≤ rem - 2*k2. Then add b[k2].\n\n   d. Keep track of the overall maximum.\n\nBut again, the issue is how to compute step 3b efficiently.\n\nAlternative approach for step 3b: For a given rem, the sum 2k2 +k1 ≤ rem can be rewritten as k1 ≤ rem - 2k2. So for each k2, the maximum k1 is min( rem - 2k2, len_a -1 ). So the sum is b[k2] + a[ min( rem - 2k2, len_a ) ].\n\nWe need to find the maximum of this expression over all valid k2.\n\nBut iterating k2 from 0 to min( len_b, rem//2 ) is O(1e5) per k3, and k3 is up to 1e5 as well, which is 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, I need a smarter way. Let me think about the possible k2 and how 2k2 relates to rem.\n\nSince 2k2 can vary from 0 to rem (but no more than len_b * 2?), perhaps for each rem, we can find the best k2 in O(1) time.\n\nWait, another idea: For a given rem, we can consider that the maximum possible k2 is rem // 2. So for each rem, the k2 can range from 0 to min( len_b, rem//2 ).\n\nBut even then, for each k3, it's O(1e5) operations, which is too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can precompute for each possible rem, the best possible combination of k2 and k1.\n\nWait, but rem can be up to 3e5, and for each rem, we need to find the best (k2, k1) where 2k2 +k1 ≤ rem.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe using dynamic programming.\n\nWait, here's an alternative plan:\n\nCompute for all possible k2 and k1, the sum 2k2 +k1, and store the maximum a[k1] + b[k2] for each possible sum s.\n\nThen, for each k3, the maximum s is rem = m -3*k3. The maximum a + b for s' ≤ rem is the answer for this k3.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each s, compute the maximum a[k1] + b[k2] where 2k2 +k1 ≤s.\n\nIf we can precompute this for all s up to 3e5, then for each k3, we can look up the value for rem and add it to c[k3].\n\nBut how to precompute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think: For each possible s, the maximum sum is the maximum of (b[k2] + a[min(s - 2k2, len_a)]) for all k2 where 2k2 ≤s.\n\nThis seems similar to a convolution problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each k2, the maximum a is known for any s >= 2k2. So for each k2, the contribution is b[k2] plus a up to (s-2k2).\n\nSo, for each k2, we can add to all s >=2k2, the value b[k2] + a up to (s -2k2).\n\nBut again, doing this for each k2 is O(n), which may be acceptable if the number of k2 is manageable.\n\nWait, but len_b can be up to 1e5, and for each k2, we can contribute to s starting from 2k2 up to some maximum.\n\nSo for each k2, the minimum s is 2k2, and the maximum s is len_a + 2k2.\n\nFor each s in [2k2, 2k2 + len_a], the contribution is b[k2] + a[ min( s-2k2, len_a ) ].\n\nSo for each k2, we can update an array dp[s] as the maximum between its current value and b[k2] + a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\nThis can be done in O( len_a ) per k2, which is 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, that won't work.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the a array is non-decreasing (since each item is added in cost order), for a given s, the maximum a[ min( s-2k2, len_a ) ] is the maximum a up to s-2k2.\n\nWhich is a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\nSo for each k2, the best a is fixed for any s >=2k2.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. For a specific k2, when s increases beyond 2k2, the a part can take more items, up to len_a.\n\nSo for each k2, the maximum contribution for s is b[k2] + a[ min(s -2k2, len_a) ].\n\nSo for each k2, the maximum s is len_a + 2k2.\n\nSo for each k2, the range of s that can be improved is from 2k2 to 2k2 + len_a.\n\nBut again, for each k2, updating this entire range is O(len_a), which is 1e5*1e5=1e10 operations.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of processing each k2, we can find a way to represent the best possible a and b combinations for each s.\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible s, the maximum a[k1] +b[k2] for 2k2 +k1 ≤s is equal to the maximum of (b[k2] + a[ min(s - 2k2, len_a) ]) for all k2 such that 2k2 ≤s.\n\nBut perhaps we can find for each s, the optimal k2 that maximizes this expression.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(k2) = b[k2] + a[ min(s -2k2, len_a) ].\n\nWe need to find the maximum of f(k2) over k2.\n\nWhat's the behavior of f(k2)? As k2 increases, 2k2 increases, so s-2k2 decreases. a[ ... ] will decrease or stay the same because a is a prefix sum array in non-increasing order (since items are sorted by cost).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the a array is the prefix sum of the sorted list, so a[k1] is the sum of the top k1 items. So a[k1] is non-decreasing as k1 increases.\n\nWait, wait. No. Wait, if you take more items, the sum should be larger. So a[k1] is non-decreasing.\n\nSo for a fixed s, as k2 increases, s-2k2 decreases, so the a part is a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ] which is non-increasing.\n\nSo f(k2) = b[k2] + a[ ... ].\n\nBut since a is non-decreasing, but s-2k2 is decreasing, the a part is non-increasing as k2 increases.\n\nBut b[k2] could be increasing or not, depending on the items.\n\nHmm, but the sum could have a maximum somewhere. Maybe the function f(k2) is unimodal, meaning it first increases, reaches a peak, then decreases. If that's the case, we can use ternary search on k2 to find the optimal value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given s, the optimal k2 can be found efficiently.\n\nWait, but for each s, we'd need to find the optimal k2. But s can be up to 3e5, which is manageable if we can find a way to compute this for each s quickly.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum f(k2) for each s can be found by considering all possible k2 where 2k2 is as small as possible, but the a part is as large as possible.\n\nAlternatively, for a given s, the optimal k2 is the one that maximizes b[k2] + a[s' - 2k2], where s' is min(s, len_a + 2k2).\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think of another angle.\n\nWhat if I precompute for each possible s, the maximum possible a[k1] + b[k2], where 2k2 +k1 <=s.\n\nTo compute this, perhaps I can iterate s from 0 to max_rem, and for each s, keep track of the best possible (k2, k1).\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, another Idea: Let's precompute for each possible s, the best possible a[k1] + b[k2], where 2k2 +k1 <=s.\n\nWe can model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each s, the best is the maximum of either including a new item of weight 2 or not.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps for each s, we can compute the best possible (k2, k1) pair.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, let's think about s as the sum of 2k2 +k1. So for s=0, the best is 0. For s=1, the best is a[1] if available. For s=2, it's max(a[2], b[1]). For s=3, it's max(b[1]+a[1], a[3], c[1]).\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's create an array dp where dp[s] represents the maximum a[k1] +b[k2] for 2k2 +k1 <=s.\n\nWe can initialize dp[0] =0, and for each s from 1 to max_rem, compute dp[s] as the maximum of dp[s-1] (not taking any new items) or (for items of weight 2 or 1).\n\nWait, but how to incorporate adding a new item of weight 2 or 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model the problem as:\n\nFor each possible s, the maximum a + b is either:\n\n- The maximum for s-1, plus not taking anything new.\n\nOR\n\n- Taking a new weight 2 item, which requires that 2 <=s, and then adding the best possible a for s-2.\n\nOR\n\n- Taking a new weight 1 item, which requires that 1<=s, and adding the best possible a for s-1.\n\nWait, but that's not accurate because the a array is built for exactly k items, not for any k up to a certain number.\n\nSo perhaps the standard knapsack approach doesn't apply here directly.\n\nWait, maybe the approach is to compute for each s, the maximum a[k1] +b[k2] where 2k2 +k1 <=s.\n\nWe can model this as follows:\n\nInitialize dp as an array where dp[s] is the maximum sum for sum s.\n\nInitially, dp[0] =0.\n\nFor each s from 1 to max_rem:\n\n   dp[s] = max( dp[s-1],  # not taking anything new\n                  max( b[k2] + a[min(s-2*k2, len_a)] ) for all k2 where 2k2 <=s )\n\nBut again, for each s, finding the optimal k2 is expensive.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each s, the optimal k2 can be found by trying all possible k2 up to s//2, which is again O(1e5) per s, leading to 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's precompute for each possible k2, the maximum a[k1] for various values of s.\n\nWait, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the weight 2 items can be handled in a way that allows us to compute the best possible a[k1] for each possible residual weight.\n\nFor example, for each k2, the residual weight is s-2k2, and the maximum a[k1] for k1 <= residual.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute a helper array that for each possible residual weight r, gives the maximum a[k1] for k1 <=r.\n\nWait, but the a array is already a prefix sum, so for any r, the maximum a[k1] for k1<=r is a[r], if r <= len_a. Otherwise, it's a[len_a].\n\nWait, but for a given k2, the residual is s-2k2. So the a part is a[ min( s-2k2, len_a ) ].\n\nSo for each s, the maximum a part is a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\nBut how to find the best k2 for each s.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, the optimal k2 is such that 2k2 is as large as possible but s-2k2 is as large as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a line equation.\n\nEach k2 contributes a point in a 2D plane where 2k2 + a_part = s. The a_part is a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, the best k2 is the one that maximizes b[k2] + a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\nBut this is a function that's hard to model.\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, the optimal k2 is around s/(2 +1) or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal k2 is such that 2k2 is as close as possible to s - x, where x is the maximum a can contribute.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's precompute for each possible k2, the maximum a is a[ len_a ] if 2k2 <= s - len_a.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal k2 for a given s is the one where s-2k2 is as large as possible, but also, b[k2] is as large as possible.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the function f(k2) = b[k2] + a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ] is concave, which would allow us to use ternary search to find the maximum.\n\nIf f(k2) is unimodal, then ternary search can find the maximum in O(log len_b) steps per s.\n\nBut for each s, this would take O(log len_b) steps, each requiring O(1) time.\n\nBut len_b can be up to 1e5, so log len_b is about 17 steps.\n\nAnd s can be up to 3e5, giving 3e5 * 17 = 5.1e6 operations, which is manageable.\n\nSo this could be a feasible approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess the a, b, c arrays.\n\n2. Precompute for each s, the maximum a + b where 2k2 +k1 <=s.\n\n   a. For each s, perform a ternary search on k2 in [0, min(len_b, s//2)] to find the k2 that maximizes f(k2) = b[k2] + a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\n   b. Store the maximum f(k2) for each s.\n\n3. Then, for each k3, compute rem = m -3*k3. If rem <0, skip. Else, get the maximum a + b for rem, add c[k3], and keep track of the global maximum.\n\nThis approach could work.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the steps in detail.\n\nFirst, preprocessing a, b, c:\n\nSort each group in descending order of cost, compute their prefix sums.\n\nFor a, which is weight 1, the prefix sum a[k] is the sum of the top k items of weight 1.\n\nSame for b and c.\n\nThen, for each s from 0 to max_rem (which is up to 3e5), compute the maximum a + b.\n\nWe'll create an array max_ab where max_ab[s] is the maximum a + b for 2k2 +k1 <=s.\n\nTo compute max_ab[s], we can use ternary search on k2 for each s.\n\nNow, for each s, we can try different k2 and compute f(k2) = b[k2] + a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\nBut how to determine the possible k2 for each s? Well, k2 can't be larger than min(len_b, s//2), because 2k2 can't exceed s.\n\nSo for each s, we can perform ternary search on k2 in [0, min(len_b, s//2)].\n\nBut why would the function f(k2) be unimodal? Because as k2 increases, 2k2 increases, so s-2k2 decreases. Since a is a prefix sum, the a part is a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ], which is non-increasing as k2 increases. So f(k2) = b[k2] + a_part.\n\nBut b[k2] could be non-monotonic. So the function may not be unimodal.\n\nWait, that complicates things. So ternary search may not work if the function isn't unimodal.\n\nHmm, perhaps the function isn't necessarily unimodal. So ternary search may fail.\n\nIn that case, what's another approach?\n\nWait, perhaps for each s, the best k2 is somewhere around s / (2 + a's contribution per weight 2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can precompute for each possible k2, the maximum s where 2k2 +k1 <=s, and then for each s, record the maximum a +b.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear path.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the maximum for a given s is achieved when k2 is such that 2k2 is as large as possible, but b[k2] is as high as possible, while the a part is also as high as possible.\n\nWait, but without knowing the relationship between b and a, it's hard to find.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given s, the optimal k2 is the one that maximizes b[k2] + a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\nBut since a is non-decreasing, for a given s, as k2 increases, a part decreases. So the function f(k2) = b[k2] + a[...] may have a single peak, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative Idea: What if we precompute for each possible k2, the maximum a for s >= 2k2 +k1.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k2, the best a for a given s is a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\nSo for each k2, the contribution to s is b[k2] + a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\nBut again, for each s, finding the best k2 is challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k2, we can compute the range of s where 2k2 <=s, and for each s, track the maximum a + b.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's note that the a array is non-decreasing, and for each k2, the a part is non-increasing as k2 increases.\n\nSo for a fixed s, f(k2) = b[k2] + a[ min(s-2k2, len_a) ].\n\nAs k2 increases, the a part decreases, but the b part may increase or decrease.\n\nBut if the a part decreases faster than the b part increases, the function could have a single peak.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is convex, making it suitable for ternary search.\n\nBut without knowing the actual data, it's hard to tell.\n\nAssuming that f(k2) is unimodal, we can proceed with ternary search.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each s, perform a ternary search on k2 in [0, min(len_b, s//2)] to find the k2 that maximizes f(k2).\n\nBut since s can be up to 3e5, and for each s, ternary search takes O(log len_b) steps, this could be manageable.\n\nBut implementing this requires handling each s and performing the ternary search.\n\nBut now, how to implement this in code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum can be found for each s by trying all possible k2 in a small window around s/(2+1), but that's speculative.\n\nWait, but for each s, the optimal k2 is likely not too far from s/(2 + average a per weight 1).\n\nBut again, this is not certain.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's precompute for each k2, the maximum a for all possible s >=2k2. Then, for each k2, and for each s, the maximum a is known.\n\nBut I'm not seeing how to use this.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I should proceed with the initial approach of iterating over each k3 and for each k3, find the best k2 and k1 quickly.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nWait, for each k3, rem = m-3*k3.\n\nIf rem <0, skip.\n\nElse, the problem is to find the maximum a[k1] +b[k2] where 2k2 +k1 <= rem.\n\nWe can precompute for each rem, the maximum a +b.\n\nBut how to precompute this for all possible rem.\n\nWait, but rem can be up to 3e5. So for rem from 0 to 3e5, we can compute the maximum a +b for 2k2 +k1 <= rem.\n\nBut computing this for all rem would take O(3e5 * len_b) time, which is 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations—too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I can precompute for each possible rem, the best k2.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum a +b for a given rem can be computed in O(1) time using some precomputed data.\n\nWait, let's think about the a and b arrays.\n\nBecause a is sorted in a way that a[k1] is the maximum sum for exactly k1 items, the a array is non-decreasing.\n\nSimilarly, the b array is non-decreasing.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the a array is non-decreasing because each item added increases the sum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for a given rem, the best a[k1] is a[ min( rem - 2k2, len_a ) ].\n\nBut to maximize a[k1] +b[k2], perhaps the best is to take as many high-value b[k2] as possible, and then fill the remaining weight with a[k1].\n\nBut again, it's not clear.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given rem, the best k2 is the one that gives the highest b[k2] + a[ rem - 2k2 ] (assuming rem-2k2 is within a's length).\n\nBut how to find this k2 quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each rem, the optimal k2 is the one that maximizes b[k2] + a[ rem-2k2 ].\n\nBut rem-2k2 can't be negative.\n\nSo for each rem, the optimal k2 is in 0 <=k2 <= min( len_b, rem//2 ).\n\nBut how to find this k2 quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a function f(k2) = b[k2] + a[ min( rem-2k2, len_a ) ].\n\nWe need to find the k2 that maximizes f(k2).\n\nBut since a is non-decreasing and b is non-decreasing, perhaps f(k2) is unimodal.\n\nWait, for each k2, as k2 increases:\n\n- 2k2 increases, so rem-2k2 decreases. So a[ ... ] is non-increasing.\n\n- b[k2] increases, assuming the items are sorted in descending order.\n\nSo f(k2) is the sum of a non-increasing function and a non-decreasing function. So f(k2) could have a single peak.\n\nThus, f(k2) is unimodal, and ternary search can be applied.\n\nSo for each rem, we can perform a ternary search on k2 to find the maximum f(k2).\n\nThis would take O(log len_b) steps per rem.\n\nBut rem can be up to 3e5, and for each k3, rem can be up to 3e5.\n\nWait, but the approach for each k3 is:\n\n- Compute rem = m-3*k3.\n\n- If rem <0, skip.\n\n- Else, for rem, find the best k2 via ternary search.\n\nBut this would require for each k3 to perform a ternary search on k2, which is O(log len_b) steps.\n\nThe total time would be O( (len_c) * (log len_b) ), where len_c is the number of possible k3.\n\nWait, len_c is up to len_w3, which is up to 1e5.\n\nSo 1e5 * 17 = 1.7e6 steps, which is manageable.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Separate the items into three lists based on weight.\n\n2. Sort each list in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute the prefix sums a, b, c for each list.\n\n4. For each k3 from 0 to min( len_c, m//3 ), compute rem = m-3*k3.\n\n   a. If rem <0, skip.\n\n   b. Use ternary search to find the optimal k2 in [0, min(len_b, rem//2) ].\n\n   c. Compute the best a + b for rem, add to c[k3], and track the maximum.\n\nSo now, the steps to code this.\n\nBut wait, in code, how to implement the ternary search.\n\nImplementing ternary search:\n\nFor a given rem, we need to find the k2 in [0, K_max] where K_max = min( len_b, rem//2 ).\n\nDefine low=0, high=K_max.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid1 = low + (high - low)//3\n\n   mid2 = high - (high - low)//3\n\n   compute f(mid1) and f(mid2)\n\n   compare which is larger, adjust low and high accordingly.\n\nAfter the loop, check f(low), f(high), and possibly a few other points around to find the maximum.\n\nBut for functions that may plateau, sometimes checking all points in a small window around the found maximum is necessary.\n\nSo in code, for each rem, perform the ternary search, and then check a few nearby k2's to ensure the maximum is found.\n\nOnce the maximum for this rem is found, add c[k3], and track the global maximum.\n\nSo now, putting this together.\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen, read each of the n items, and separate them into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums a, b, c.\n\nFor a:\n\na[0] =0.\n\nfor i in 1 to len(w1):\n\n   a[i] = a[i-1] + w1[i-1].cost\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nCompute len_a = len(w1), len_b = len(w2), len_c = len(w3).\n\nmax_total =0.\n\nfor k3 in 0 to min( len_c, m//3 ):\n\n   rem = m -3*k3\n\n   if rem <0:\n\n       continue\n\n   K_max = min( len_b, rem//2 )\n\n   # Now find the best k2 in [0, K_max]\n\n   # perform ternary search\n\n   low =0\n\n   high = K_max\n\n   best_f =0\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) //2\n\n       # compute f(mid)\n\n       if 2*mid > rem:\n\n           current_a = a[len_a]\n\n       else:\n\n           current_a = a[ rem - 2*mid ]\n\n       # but rem -2*mid could be larger than len_a\n\n       # wait, no. rem -2*mid could be larger than len_a, but then a is a prefix sum, so a[len_a] is the maximum.\n\n       current_a = a[ min( rem -2*mid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry without exceeding a given weight limit. The souvenirs are categorized by their weights (1, 2, or 3), and we need to efficiently determine the optimal combination of these souvenirs to achieve the highest cost.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Categorize Souvenirs**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, or 3).\n2. **Sort and Compute Prefix Sums**: For each group, sort the souvenirs in descending order of cost and compute prefix sums. This allows us to quickly determine the maximum cost for taking a certain number of items from each group.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Combinations**: For each possible number of weight-3 souvenirs, compute the remaining weight capacity. Use ternary search to find the optimal number of weight-2 souvenirs that maximize the total cost within the remaining weight capacity, and then use the best possible weight-1 souvenirs to fill the remaining weight.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n, m = int(input[idx]), int(input[idx+1])\n    idx +=2\n    \n    w1 = []\n    w2 = []\n    w3 = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        wi = int(input[idx])\n        ci = int(input[idx+1])\n        idx +=2\n        if wi ==1:\n            w1.append(ci)\n        elif wi ==2:\n            w2.append(ci)\n        else:\n            w3.append(ci)\n    \n    # Sort and compute prefix sums\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    a = [0]\n    for c in w1:\n        a.append(a[-1] + c)\n    len_a = len(a) -1\n    \n    b = [0]\n    for c in w2:\n        b.append(b[-1] + c)\n    len_b = len(b) -1\n    \n    c = [0]\n    for c_val in w3:\n        c.append(c[-1] + c_val)\n    len_c = len(c) -1\n    \n    max_total =0\n    \n    # Iterate over possible k3\n    max_k3 = min(len_c, m//3)\n    for k3 in range(max_k3 +1):\n        rem = m -
