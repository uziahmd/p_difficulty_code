Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases. Each base must have exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base. So, it's a perfect matching between R rebels and B bases.\n\nBut there's an additional condition: the straight paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. So, no two paths can cross each other in the galaxy plane.\n\nHmm. So, I need to determine if such a matching exists.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input consists of R spaceships and B bases. The coordinates are given, and no three points are colinear, which probably helps because it reduces some cases where lines could overlap.\n\nThe output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether a valid matching exists.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Read the input correctly.\n2. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases.\n3. For each matching, check if any two paths (from base to ship) intersect.\n4. If there's at least one matching with no intersecting paths, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, \"No\".\n\nWait, but what if R != B? Oh, the problem says it's guaranteed that no three points are colinear, but I should check the initial constraints. Oh right, the problem statement says 1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10. So, for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Because each spaceship is assigned to a unique base. So, if R != B, then it's automatically impossible. Wait, no: the first line has R and B, and the next R lines are ships, then B lines are bases. So, if R != B, then it's impossible to have a perfect matching, so the answer is \"No\" regardless.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: it says \"R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases\". So, the assignment is a perfect matching. That requires R = B, otherwise, you can't have a bijection. So, in the code, first thing: if R != B, output \"No\".\n\nSo, that's the first condition to check.\n\nNow, assuming R == B, proceed.\n\nNext, for each possible permutation of the bases, assign each base to a spaceship, and check if any two edges (base to spaceship) intersect.\n\nWait, but checking all permutations would be O(R! ), which for R=10 is 3,628,800 iterations. But considering that R is up to 10, that's manageable, right?\n\nBecause 10! is around 3.6 million, which is acceptable for a Python solution.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check if R != B: if yes, output No.\n\nElse:\n\n- Generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship).\n\n- For each permutation:\n\n   - For each base i, create a line segment from base_i to ship_perm[i].\n\n   - Check if any two line segments intersect.\n\n   - If the permutation has no intersecting segments, return Yes.\n\nIf none of the permutations satisfy this, output No.\n\nSo, the main part is to implement the line segment intersection check efficiently.\n\nBut wait, how do we represent the line segments? Each base is a point, each spaceship is another point. So for a permutation, each base is connected to a spaceship.\n\nWe need to check if any two such connections (lines) cross each other.\n\nSo, for each pair of line segments in the current permutation, check for intersection.\n\nBut since it's a permutation, each line is from a base to a unique spaceship. So, for a permutation, the number of line segments is equal to B (since R=B). So, for each permutation, the number of pairs of line segments is C(B, 2) = B*(B-1)/2.\n\nFor B=10, that's 45 per permutation. Multiply by 3.6e6 permutations: 3.6e6 * 45 = ~162 million operations. Hmm, that might be a bit slow for Python, but perhaps manageable with optimizations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to optimize the line segment intersection check.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's represent all the points. We'll have two lists: ships and bases, each containing their coordinates as tuples.\n\nThen, for each permutation of the bases, we can create a list where each base index is mapped to a ship index.\n\nWait, perhaps the permutation can be represented as a list where the ith element is the index of the spaceship assigned to the i-th base. So, for example, if the permutation is [2,0,1], it means base 0 is assigned to ship 2, base 1 to ship 0, etc.\n\nWait, no, maybe it's better to represent the permutation as a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign each Rebel spaceship to a base such that no two paths from the bases to their assigned spaceships intersect. This requires finding a perfect matching between spaceships and bases without any intersecting segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading and Initial Checks**: Read the input values and check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If they are not equal, output \"No\" immediately since a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each permutation of the bases, represent the assignment as a mapping from each base to a spaceship.\n3. **Check for Intersecting Segments**: For each permutation, check if any two line segments connecting bases to their assigned spaceships intersect. If a permutation exists where no segments intersect, output \"Yes\". If all permutations result in intersections, output \"No\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef readints():\n    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ndef cross(o, a, b):\n    return (a[0]-o[0])*(b[1]-o[1]) - (a[1]-o[1])*(b[0]-o[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, e1, s2, e2):\n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n    A, B = sorted([s1, s2], key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    C, D = sorted([e1, e2], key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    if ccw(A, B, C) * ccw(A, B, D) > 0:\n        return True\n    if ccw(C, D, A) * ccw(C, D, B) > 0:\n        return True\n    if ccw(A, C, B) * ccw(A, C, D) > 0:\n        return True\n    if ccw(B, D, A) * ccw(B, D, C) > 0:\n        return True\n    if A == C or A == D or B == C or B == D:\n        return False\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    R_B = data[0].split()\n    R = int(R_B[0])\n    B = int(R_B[1])\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    \n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, data[_+1].split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n    \n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, data[R+1 + _].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n    \n    for perm in permutations(range(B)):\n        ship_assigned = [None] * B\n        conflict = False\n        for i in range(B):\n            ship_assigned[i] = perm[i]\n        \n        segments = []\n        for i in range(B):\n            s = (ships[ship_assigned[i]])\n            b = bases[i]\n            segments.append((b, s))\n        \n        for i in range(len(segments)):\n            for j in range(i+1, len(segments)):\n                seg1 = segments[i]\n                seg2 = segments[j]\n                b1, s1 = seg1\n                b2, s2 = seg2\n                if segments_intersect(b1, s1, b2, s2):\n                    conflict = True\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                break\n        \n        if not conflict:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    \n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution reads the input and checks if the number of spaceships matches the number of bases. It then generates all permutations of bases to find a valid assignment. For each permutation, it checks if any two line segments intersect using the cross product method to determine if segments cross. If a valid permutation is found, it outputs \"Yes\"; otherwise, it outputs \"No\" after checking all permutations. This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the existence of a non-intersecting perfect matching.",
