A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain resources: drink, lime slices, and salt. I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on these resources.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nWe have n friends. They bought k bottles of drink, each with l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n\nThey also have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices are c * d.\n\nFor salt, they have p grams.\n\nEach toast per friend needs nl milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters for each toast. So for each toast across all friends, the total drink used is n * nl. Similarly, each toast uses one slice per friend, so for each toast, it's n slices. And for salt, each toast uses np grams per friend, so again, multiplied by n.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Calculate the total resources available.\n2. Determine how many toasts can be made based on each resource.\n3. The maximum number of toasts is the minimum of these three values, divided by the number of friends (n), but wait, no: because each toast per person requires those resources. Hmm, let me think again.\n\nWait, each toast that each friend makes uses their own resources. So for one toast round, each of the n friends uses one slice of lime, one portion of drink (nl), and np grams of salt. So for each toast, the group uses n * nl drink, n slices, and n * np salt.\n\nSo the total number of toast rounds possible is limited by the drink, limes, and salt.\n\nBut we can model it as:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\nEach toast round consumes:\ndrink_needed = n * nl\nlime_needed = n\nsalt_needed = n * np\n\nSo the maximum number of toast rounds t is such that:\n\nt <= total_drink / drink_needed\nt <= total_lime_slices / lime_needed\nt <= total_salt / salt_needed\n\nThen, the maximum t is the minimum of those three.\n\nOnce we find t, since each friend makes t toasts, but the question asks how many toasts each can make, which is exactly t.\n\nWait, no. Because each toast round is a toast for each friend. So for example, if t is 2, each friend makes 2 toasts.\n\nSo the answer is t.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input helps here.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nk=4 bottles, each l=5ml → total drink is 20ml.\n\nc=10 limes, each cut into d=8 slices → 80 slices.\n\np=100 grams salt.\n\nEach friend needs nl=3ml per toast, so per toast round, each friend uses 3ml, so total drink per round is 3 * 3 =9ml? Wait no, wait. No, wait: each friend makes one toast, using nl ml each. So for a single toast round, all friends drink together. So the total drink per round is n * nl.\n\nSimilarly, for salt, each toast round uses n * np grams.\n\nSo in the sample, for drink: 4*5=20ml. How many toast rounds can be done?\n\nEach toast round uses 3 * 3 =9ml? Wait no, wait: n is 3, each needs 3ml per toast. So 3 * 3 =9ml per toast round.\n\nWait, no: each friend needs nl per toast, so for one toast round (each friend making one toast), total drink is n * nl. So 3 * 3 =9ml per toast.\n\nSo 20 /9 is approximately 2.22, so 2 full toast rounds.\n\nFor limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each → 80 slices. Each toast round needs 3 slices (n=3). So 80 /3 is 26.666, so 26 toast rounds. But wait, wait: no, that's not correct. Because each toast round uses n slices, right? So for each toast, each friend uses one slice. So per toast round, n slices are used.\n\nIn the sample, 80 slices /3 per toast round gives 26.666, so 26 toast rounds.\n\nSalt: 100 grams per toast round (3 friends each needing 1 gram). So 100 /3 is 33.333, so 33 toast rounds.\n\nSo the limiting factor is the drink, which allows only 2 toast rounds. So each friend can make 2 toasts.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute t as the minimum of:\n\n- (total_drink) / (n * nl)\n- (total_lime_slices) / n\n- (total_salt) / (n * np)\n\nBut wait, wait, what if any of these divisions result in a fractional value? We have to take the floor, because you can't have a fraction of a toast round.\n\nSo we have to compute t as the minimum of the integer division of each of these values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute total_drink = k * l\n2. Compute total_lime_slices = c * d\n3. Compute total_salt = p\n4. For drink: each toast round needs n * nl. So max_toast_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n5. For limes: each toast round needs n slices. So max_toast_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n6. For salt: each toast round needs n * np. So max_toast_by_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n7. The maximum possible t is the minimum of these three values.\n8. Output t.\n\nWait, but let's test this logic against the sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → 20ml.\n\nnl=3. So n * nl =9ml per toast round.\n\n20//9 is 2, which is correct.\n\nLimes: c*d=10*8=80. Divided by n=3 → 80//3=26.\n\nSalt: p=100, n*np=3*1=3 → 100//3=33.\n\nMinimum of 2,26,33 is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: second input.\n\nInput is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10 → 1000ml.\n\nc=1, d=19 →19 slices.\n\np=90.\n\nnl=4, np=3.\n\nDrink: each toast round needs 5*4=20ml. 1000 /20=50.\n\nLimes: 19 slices needed per toast round (n=5). So 19/5=3.8 → 3.\n\nSalt: 5*3=15 per toast round. 90//15=6.\n\nSo min(50,3,6)=3. So output is 3.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → 1,000,000ml.\n\nc=25, d=23 →575 slices.\n\np=1.\n\nnl=50, np=1.\n\nDrink per toast round: 10*50=500ml. 1e6 /500 =2000.\n\nLimes: 575 /10=57.\n\nSalt: 10*1=10 per toast. 1//10 is 0.\n\nSo the minimum is 0. So output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the third sample.\n\nSo the logic seems solid.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: All resources allow zero toasts.\n\nLike when n=1, k=0, but wait, according to the input constraints, all numbers are positive integers. So k is at least 1.\n\nWait, no. The problem statement says \"positive integers\", so k >=1, etc. So perhaps in some cases, like when the required per toast is more than the available.\n\nE.g., n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=2, np=2.\n\nTotal_drink=1. per toast round, 1*2=2ml needed. So 1//2=0.\n\nSo output is 0.\n\nAnother case: when some resources are sufficient but others are not.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the 8 integers: n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = n * nl\nmax_t_drink = total_drink // toast_drink\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntoast_lime = n\nmax_t_lime = total_lime // toast_lime\n\ntotal_salt = p\ntoast_salt = n * np\nmax_t_salt = total_salt // toast_salt\n\nt = min(max_t_drink, max_t_lime, max_t_salt)\n\nPrint t as an integer.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute each variable as above.\n\nThen compute t as the minimum of the three.\n\nPrint t.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nTesting:\n\nLet me test with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → 20.\n\ntoast_drink = 3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\nc=10, d=8 →80.\n\ntoast_lime=3 →80//3=26.\n\np=100, np=1 →3*1=3 →100//3=33.\n\nmin(2,26,33) →2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 →1000.\n\ntoast_drink=5*4=20 →1000//20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 →19.\n\ntoast_lime=5 →19//5=3.\n\np=90, np=3 →5*3=15 →90//15=6.\n\nmin(50,3,6)=3.\n\nSample3:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 →1e6.\n\ntoast_drink=10*50=500 →1e6//500=2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 →575.\n\ntoast_lime=10 →575//10=57.\n\np=1, np=1 →10*1=10 →1//10=0.\n\nmin(2000,57,0)=0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, k=1, l=5, c=1, d=1, p=5, nl=5, np=5.\n\ntotal_drink=5, toast_drink=5 →1.\n\nlimes: 1//1=1.\n\nsalt:5//5=1.\n\nt=1.\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, k=2, l=5 →10ml.\n\nnl=3 → toast_drink=6. 10//6=1.\n\nc=2, d=3 →6 slices.\n\ntoast_lime=2 →6//2=3.\n\np=3, np=1 →2 per toast →3//2=1.\n\nSo min(1,3,1) is 1.\n\nSo each can make 1 toast.\n\nSo the code should handle all these correctly.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nWe can read the input as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute all variables.\n\nHandle the cases where any division is zero.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = n * nl\nmax_t_drink = total_drink // toast_drink\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntoast_lime = n\nmax_t_lime = total_lime // toast_lime\n\ntotal_salt = p\ntoast_salt = n * np\nmax_t_salt = total_salt // toast_salt\n\nt = min(max_t_drink, max_t_lime, max_t_salt)\n\nprint(t)\n\nWait, but what if any of the toast_drink, toast_lime, or toast_salt is zero? Well, since n is at least 1, and nl, np are at least 1, so toast_drink and toast_salt are at least 1*1=1. So no division by zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting it with the samples should give the correct outputs.\n\nSo the final code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource, and the goal is to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, one lime slice per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend.
