Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and lanterns on a street. The street is straight, from 0 to l in length. There are n lanterns placed at various points along this street. Each lantern lights up all points within a distance d of it. We need to find the minimal d such that the entire street is lit.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to determine the smallest possible radius d so that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, let's think about the input. The first line gives n and l. Then the next line has n integers, each representing the position of a lantern ai.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input, there are 7 lanterns at positions 15,5,3,7,9,14,0 on a street of length 15. The output is 2.5. Another sample is when two lanterns are both at 2 and 5 on a street of length 5. The minimal d is 2, because the first covers [0,4] and the second covers [3,5], together covering the entire street.\n\nAlright, so how do we approach this?\n\nI think the key is to model the problem as covering intervals. Each lantern, when given a radius d, will cover an interval [ai - d, ai + d], but this interval must not go beyond 0 or l. So the effective coverage is from max(0, ai-d) to min(l, ai+d).\n\nOur task is to choose d such that the union of all these intervals is exactly [0, l]. We want the smallest possible d where this is true.\n\nBut since d is what we're trying to find, perhaps a binary search approach would work here. Because as d increases, the covered area can only get larger, so the minimal d is the smallest value where the coverage includes the entire street.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the steps could be:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions. This might help in efficiently checking coverage later.\n2. Use binary search on d. For each candidate d, check if the union of all intervals covers [0, l].\n3. The minimal d is the smallest value that satisfies this condition.\n\nWait, but how do we compute whether a certain d is sufficient? Let's think about the process.\n\nWhen sorted, the lanterns are in order. The idea is to track the coverage as we move from left to right. We start at 0. For each lantern, we see how far it can cover to the right. If the current right coverage is less than l, then we proceed to the next lantern. But if after processing all lanterns, the right coverage hasn't reached l, then this d is too small.\n\nWait, no. Actually, perhaps the way to check is to find the maximum reach. Let me think: sort the lanterns in increasing order. Then, the first lantern's coverage starts at 0, and extends to ai[0]+d. The next lantern's coverage starts at ai[1]-d, but maybe it's already covered by the previous one. So, we can keep track of the furthest point we've covered so far.\n\nInitially, the covered region is from 0 to (ai[0] + d). Then, for each subsequent lantern, the earliest it can contribute is ai[i] - d. If this is beyond the current covered end, then the new end becomes max(current_end, ai[i] + d). But wait, no: actually, the coverage from this lantern is [ai[i] -d, ai[i]+d], but if ai[i] -d is less than the current end, then this lantern doesn't add any new coverage beyond the current end. However, if ai[i] +d is beyond the current end, then the new end is ai[i] +d.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model it as follows:\n\nSort the lanterns in increasing order of ai.\n\nInitialize current_max = 0.\n\nFor each ai in sorted list:\n    left = max(ai -d, current_max)\n    right = ai +d\n    if right > current_max:\n        current_max = right\n    if current_max >= l:\n        break\n\nAfter processing all lanterns, if current_max >= l, then d is sufficient.\n\nWait, but wait: the first lantern's coverage starts at 0, but if its right is less than l, then the next lantern comes into play. So the algorithm is:\n\ncurrent_max = 0\n\nfor each ai in sorted list:\n    the current lantern can cover from (ai -d) to (ai +d)\n    but since the street starts at 0, the actual start is max(0, ai -d)\n    the end is min(l, ai +d)\n    now, the union of all these ranges needs to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius \\( d \\) such that all lanterns cover the entire street from 0 to \\( l \\). The approach involves using binary search to efficiently find the smallest \\( d \\) that ensures complete coverage.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: Start by sorting the positions of the lanterns. This helps in efficiently checking the coverage as we move from left to right on the street.\n2. **Binary Search on \\( d \\)**: Use binary search to find the minimum \\( d \\). For each candidate \\( d \\), check if the union of intervals covered by the lanterns includes the entire street.\n3. **Check Coverage**: For each candidate \\( d \\) during the binary search, simulate the coverage by iterating through the sorted lantern positions and keeping track of the furthest point covered so far. If at any point the furthest point is beyond \\( l \\), the current \\( d \\) is sufficient.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef minimal_d(n, l, a):\n    a = sorted(a)\n    left = 0.0\n    right = float('inf')\n    # Binary search boundaries\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] - left > 1e-9:\n            left = a[i] - (right - left)/2 + left\n        else:\n            left = max(left, a[i] - (right - left)/2)\n        if a[i] + (right - left)/2 > right:\n            right = a[i] + (right - left)/2\n        else:\n            right = min(right, a[i] + (right - left)/2)\n    \n    # Now perform binary search between left and right\n    eps = 1e-10\n    for _ in range(100):\n        mid = (left + right) / 2\n        covered = 0.0\n        max_reach = 0.0\n        for pos in a:\n            start = max(pos - mid, 0.0)\n            end = min(pos + mid, l)\n            if start > covered:\n                covered = start\n            if end > max_reach:\n                max_reach = end\n            if max_reach >= l:\n                break\n        if max_reach >= l - eps:\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid\n    return round(right, 10)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    l = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    a_float = [float(x) for x in a]\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(minimal_d(n, l, a_float)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting**: The lantern positions are sorted to facilitate a linear scan and coverage check.\n2. **Binary Search**: The binary search is used over the possible values of \\( d \\). The search space is initially set based on the maximum possible spread of the lanterns.\n3. **Coverage Check**: For each midpoint \\( d \\) during the binary search, the algorithm checks if the union of intervals covered by the lanterns covers the entire street. If it does, \\( d \\) is adjusted to potentially find a smaller valid \\( d \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimal \\( d \\) using binary search combined with a linear scan, making the solution both optimal and efficient.",
