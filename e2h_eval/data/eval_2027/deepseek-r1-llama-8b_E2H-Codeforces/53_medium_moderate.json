    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The substrings can overlap. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the approach. So, the problem is similar to finding the longest repeated substring, but with the condition that it occurs at least twice. How do I approach this efficiently?\n\nFirst, I remember that for such problems, a sliding window technique combined with hashing or using a suffix tree might be useful. But since the string length is up to 100, maybe an O(n^2) solution would suffice, as 100 squared is 10,000 which is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each possible substring length, starting from the maximum possible down to 1, check if any substring of that length appears more than once. Once we find the maximum length where this is true, return it.\n\nHow do I implement this? Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Iterate over all possible lengths l, starting from the maximum possible (length of string -1) down to 1.\n   For each length l:\n   a. Generate all possible substrings of length l.\n   b. Use a set to keep track of these substrings.\n   c. If any substring occurs more than once, then return l as the answer.\n\nWait, no. Because for each l, we need to check whether there exists at least two occurrences of some substring of length l. So, for each l, collect all substrings of length l, and see if any appears more than once.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently do that? For each l, loop through the string, extract each substring of length l, and store them in a set. Then, if the number of unique substrings is less than the number of possible substrings (which is len(string) - l + 1), then there must be duplicates.\n\nWait, no. Because for each l, the number of possible substrings is (n - l + 1). So, if n - l +1 > the number of unique substrings found, that means there are duplicates. So, for each l, compute the number of unique substrings. If it's less than (n - l +1), then return l as the maximum length.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor l in range from min_possible (which is the maximum possible) down to 1:\n   Create a set of substrings of length l.\n   If the size of this set is less than (n - l + 1), then return l as the result.\n\nBecause once we find the largest l where this condition holds, we can stop and output it.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\nInput: 'abcd'\nOutput: 0\nBecause all substrings are unique. So for l=3, the number of substrings is 2 ('abc' and 'bcd'), both unique. So no duplicates. Similarly for l=2, 3 substrings, all unique. So the maximum is 0.\n\nSample 2:\nInput: 'ababa'\nOutput: 3\nCheck for l=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba' → 2, unique. So no duplicates.\nl=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So 'aba' appears twice. So set size is 2, which is less than 5-3+1=3. So yes, return 3.\n\nAnother sample: 'zzz' → output is 2. Substrings of length 2 are 'zz' and 'zz' → set size is 1, which is less than 2. So l=2 is the answer.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string. Then, for each possible l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\nFor each l:\n   substrs = set()\n   for i in range(0, len(s) - l +1):\n       substr = s[i:i+l]\n       substrs.add(substr)\n   if len(substrs) < (len(s) - l +1):\n       print(l)\n       exit\n\nIf no l found, print 0.\n\nWait, but when l is 0? No, because l starts from len(s)-1 down to 1. Wait, no: for a string of length n, the maximum possible l is n-1. Because for l=n, you can't have two occurrences as the string is only once.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the maximum possible l is the maximum possible such that the substring can appear at least twice. So for example, in 'aaaaa', the maximum l is 4, because 'aaaa' appears at positions 0 and 1, 0 and 2, etc.\n\nSo for a string of length n, l can be up to n-1.\n\nSo in code, the loop should start from l_max = len(s) -1, then l_max-1, ..., down to 1.\n\nWait, but in the case where the entire string is the same character, like 'zzz' (n=3). The maximum l is 2, since 'zz' appears twice.\n\nWait, len(s) is 3. So for l=2: 3-2+1=2 substrings. So if the set has 1, which is less than 2, so yes.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nRead the string:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen, for l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\nWait, but len(s) could be 1. For example, input 'a', then the output is 0.\n\nWait, but in the loop, len(s)-1 is 0, and the range starts from 0, but the step is -1. So the loop won't execute. So for len(s)=1, the code correctly outputs 0.\n\nSo the code can handle that.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nmax_length = 0\n\nfor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        seen.add(substr)\n        # Check if we've already seen this substring before\n        # But wait, this approach will not work, because adding to the set and checking after each addition isn't efficient. Instead, after collecting all substrings of length l, compare the size of the set to (len(s) - l +1).\n\n    # After collecting all substrings:\n    if len(seen) < (len(s) - l +1):\n        max_length = l\n        print(max_length)\n        exit()\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in code, for each l, we generate all substrings of length l, add to a set, then check if the size of the set is less than the number of possible substrings.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    substr_set = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        substr_set.add(substr)\n    if len(substr_set) < (n - l + 1):\n        print(l)\n        exit()\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in the case where the entire string is the same, like 'aaaaa', the first l checked is 4, which is len(s)-1=4. The number of substrings is 2 (positions 0-4 and 1-5?), wait no.\n\nWait, for 'aaaaa', len is 5. For l=4, the number of possible substrings is 5-4+1=2: 'aaaa' and 'aaaa' (from index 0 and 1). So the set size is 1, which is less than 2. So l=4 is the answer.\n\nSo the code returns 4, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababa' (n=5). For l=3: substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). So the set has 'aba', 'bab' → size 2. Number of substrings is 5-3+1=3. 2<3 → yes, so return 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWhat about the edge case when the string is empty? Well, the problem states the string is non-empty.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aa' → output is 1, because 'a' appears twice.\n\nIn code, for l=1: substrings are 'a' and 'a' → set size 1. Number of substrings is 2, so 1<2 → yes, so return 1.\n\nAnother case: 'abab' → for l=2, substrings are 'ab', 'ba', 'ab' → set size 2. Number of substrings is 3. So 2<3 → yes. So the maximum is 2.\n\nWait, but what about the maximum possible l in this case? Let's see:\n\nn=4.\n\nLoop starts with l=3: substrings are 'aba' and 'bab' → 2 substrings, unique. So no.\n\nThen l=2: as above, returns 2.\n\nSo correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nWait, but what about when the entire string is unique except for the last two characters? Like 'abcdab'.\n\nWait, len is 6. The maximum l is 5: substrings are 'abcda' and 'bcdab' → both unique. So no.\n\nThen l=4: substrings are 'abcd', 'bcda', 'cdab' → all unique. So no.\n\nl=3: substrings are 'abc', 'bcd', 'cda', 'dab' → all unique. So no.\n\nl=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd', 'da', 'ab' → 'ab' appears twice. So set size is 4. Number of substrings is 5. 4 <5 → yes. So return 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n\nSo now, to write the Python code accordingly.\n\nThe code will read the string, loop l from len(s)-1 down to 1, for each l, create a set of all substrings of length l, check if the size is less than the expected number of substrings (n-l+1). If so, output l and exit. If none found, output 0.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n",
