And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is probably not going to work because that would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved. For each possible window of size k, I need to sum those k elements, then add all those sums together, and divide by the number of windows, which is (n - k + 1). So the total sum is the sum of all consecutive k-length subarrays.\n\nWait, but if I do this naively, like for each window, iterate from i to i+k-1, and sum them, that's O(nk) time. But for n=2e5 and k=2e5, that's 4e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way to calculate the sum of all k-length windows. Oh right! I remember there's a sliding window technique where you can compute the sum efficiently by maintaining a running total.\n\nHere's how it works: I start by computing the sum of the first k elements. Then, for each subsequent window, I subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element entering. This way, each step is O(1), making the entire process O(n).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this to a total sum variable.\n3. Slide the window by one each time:\n   a. Subtract the element exiting the window (i.e., the one at position i-k+1)\n   b. Add the new element entering the window (i.e., position i)\n   c. Add this new sum to the total.\n4. After processing all windows, divide the total by the number of windows to get the average.\n5. Output the average with sufficient precision.\n\nBut wait, what about when n equals k? Then there's only one window, so the average is just the sum divided by 1.\n\nLet me test this logic with the example given.\n\nIn the third example input:\n8 2\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo n=8, k=2. The number of windows is 7.\n\nSumming all consecutive pairs:\n1+2 =3\n2+4=6\n4+100000=100004\n100000+123=100123\n123+456=579\n456+789=1245\n789+1=790\n\nAdding all these: 3+6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201960, +790=202, 750? Wait, maybe I should calculate it step by step.\n\nWait, no. Let me list all the sums:\n\n[3,6,100004, 100123, 579, 1245, 790]\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n3 +6 =9\n9 +100004 =100013\n100013 +100123 =200136\n200136 +579 =200715\n200715 +1245 =201960\n201960 +790 =202,750?\n\nWait, 201960 +790 is 202,750? Let me check: 201,960 + 790 is 202,750. Yes.\n\nThen the average is 202750 /7 = let's see: 202750 ÷7 = 28964.2857142857... which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the sliding window approach works.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nThe input is two lines. The first line has n and k. The second line has the a array.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample inputs, sometimes the second line is a single line of multiple numbers. So I need to read the entire line as a list.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, check if the length of a is equal to n. Because sometimes, the user might accidentally give extra numbers, but in this problem, the input is correct as per the problem statement.\n\nOnce I have a, proceed.\n\nCompute the sum for the first window (from index 0 to k-1):\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal = current_sum\n\nThen, for i in range(1, n -k +1):\n\n   current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks based on given data. Each week is defined as k consecutive days, and we need to consider all such windows in the given n days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: The key insight is to use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each window of size k. This avoids the O(nk) complexity of a naive approach and reduces it to O(n).\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first window of size k.\n3. **Window Sliding**: For each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This allows us to maintain a running total efficiently.\n4. **Average Calculation**: After computing the sum of all windows, divide by the number of windows to get the average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / (n - k + 1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers n and k, followed by a list of integers representing sleep times for n days.\n2. **Initial Window Sum**: Calculate the sum of the first window of size k.\n3. **Sliding Window Update**: For each subsequent window, update the current sum by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that has entered the window. This is done in constant time for each step.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: Accumulate the sum of all windows and then compute the average by dividing the total sum by the number of windows.\n5. **Output**: Print the average with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure accuracy within the required tolerance.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
