The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Xenia and her tasks in a ringroad of houses. The houses are arranged in a circle, numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Traffic is one-way, also clockwise. Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. For each task i, she must be in house ai by the time she completes all tasks with numbers less than i. So the order of the tasks matters because she has to process them in the order given.\n\nHmm, I need to find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first test case, n=4, m=3, and the tasks are 3,2,3. The optimal path is 1 → 2 →3 →4 →1 →2 →3. That's 6 steps.\n\nWait, why is that the case? Let's see:\n\nShe starts at 1. The first task is 3, but since that's not her current position, she can't do it yet. She proceeds to 2 (time 1), then 3 (time 2). But wait, that's the second step. Then she needs to go to 4 (step 3), then back to 1 (step 4), then 2 (step5), and finally 3 (step6). Oh, right, because the third task is 3, which is after 2. So she has to reach 3 after handling task 2.\n\nI think the key is to figure out the earliest time she can reach each required house for each task, considering that she might have to loop around the ring.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model the movement and track the times when she arrives at each house, ensuring that for each task ai, she is present by the time she has processed all earlier tasks.\n\nWait, but how to model the movement optimally? It feels like a problem where we need to compute the latest required arrival time for each position and then determine the maximum distance she has to move from one point to another.\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose we sort the tasks in the order they are given. For each task i, we need to be at a_i by the time we finish processing all tasks up to i. So, the time taken to get to a_i for the first time, plus any loops needed due to previous tasks.\n\nBut how to model the movement between these positions. Since it's a ring, moving from a lower-numbered house to a higher-numbered one takes (a_i - current) steps, while moving from a higher-numbered to a lower takes (n - current + a_i) steps.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the positions in the order they appear in the tasks and keep track of the earliest possible time she can be at each position.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the tasks are in a certain order, and for each task, we need to be there by a certain time.\n\nWait, maybe the solution is to track the time when she arrives at each house. Starting from 1, then for each task, she goes from her current position to the next task's position, and updates the current time.\n\nBut wait, the problem says she can have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house, so perhaps she can process them without leaving. Like, if she's already at a house, she doesn't need to move.\n\nSo the idea is: process each task in the order given, and for each task, move from the previous position to the current task's position, and calculate the time taken.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because sometimes she might have to loop around the ring multiple times, depending on the arrangement of the tasks.\n\nHmm, perhaps the optimal path is to always move as far as possible in the clockwise direction, which would minimize the total steps.\n\nWait, no. Because sometimes, you have to go through a longer path because of the order of tasks. For example, in the first sample, she had to go from 3 to 4, then back to 1, then to 2, then to 3 again.\n\nSo the approach is to simulate the movement, keeping track of the current position and the time taken so far.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n- Initialize current_time = 0, current_position = 1.\n- Sort the tasks in the order they are given. Wait, no, the order is fixed as per the input. So we process each task in the given order, but for each task, we have to make sure that by the time we reach it, all previous tasks have been done.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is as follows:\n\nFor each task i in 1..m:\n\n- The task is to be at a_i at some point before or at the time when all tasks j <",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks if she starts at house number 1 and moves clockwise around a ring of houses. Each move between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Xenia must complete each task in the given order, meaning she must be present at the specified house for each task by the time she completes all previous tasks. The ring structure means moving from a higher-numbered house to a lower-numbered house wraps around the ring.\n2. **Intuition**: For each task, calculate the minimum time required to reach the target house from the current position, considering the ring structure. The key is to keep track of the current position and the cumulative time taken so far.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Start at house 1 with initial time 0.\n   - For each task in order, compute the shortest path from the current position to the target house.\n   - Update the current position and the total time taken.\n4. **Complexity**: The algorithm processes each task exactly once, resulting in a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = list(map(int, input().split()))\ncurrent_pos = 1\ntime = 0\n\nfor a in tasks:\n    # Compute the distance from current_pos to a\n    if a >= current_pos:\n        dist = a - current_pos\n    else:\n        dist = (n - current_pos) + a\n    time += dist\n    current_pos = a\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with time 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, determine the shortest path from the current position to the target house. If the target house is ahead (clockwise), the distance is the difference. If it's behind, wrap around the ring and add the remaining distance.\n- **Update Time and Position**: After each move, update the total time and current position.\n- **Output**: Print the total time after completing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that Xenia completes each task in the minimum possible time by always moving optimally around the ring.",
