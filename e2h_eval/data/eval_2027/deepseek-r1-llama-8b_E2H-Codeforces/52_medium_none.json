Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for exactly one hour and then goes out. But the smart part is that he can collect the burned candles and turn them into new ones. Specifically, every 'b' burned candles can be made into a new candle. The goal is to find out how many hours in total he can keep the candles burning by acting optimally.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. So initially, he has 'a' candles. Each of those burns for an hour, adding to the total time. Then, after they burn out, he collects the remains. For each group of 'b' burned candles, he gets one new candle, which then also burns for an hour. But when that new candle burns, it again becomes a burned candle, which he can use again if possible.\n\nWait, right. So the process is: burn all current candles, collect the remains, exchange them for new candles as much as possible, repeat until he can't make any more.\n\nSo the approach is to simulate this process step by step. Let me think about the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial 'a' candles.\n2. Burn them all, adding 'a' hours to the total.\n3. Collect 'a' burned candles.\n4. Exchange them for as many new candles as possible: new_candles = a // b.\n5. Add the number of new candles to the total hours (since each new candle burns for 1 hour).\n6. Now, the new_candles are added to the remaining burned candles. So the total burned is new_candles + (a % b), but wait, no— because when you make new_candles, each contributes to one more burned candle. So after exchanging, the new_candles will each burn for an hour, adding their count to the total burned.\n\nWait, maybe a better way to model this is:\n\n- total_hours = a\n- current_burned = a\n- while current_burned >= b:\n    new_candles = current_burned // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    current_burned = (current_burned % b) + new_candles  # Because the new candles are now burned and contribute to the count.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nFor example, let's take the first sample input: 4 2.\n\nInitial a=4, so total_hours =4. current_burned=4.\n\nNow, 4 >=2, so new_candles =4//2=2. Add 2 to total_hours, making it 6.\n\ncurrent_burned becomes 4%2=0, plus 2 new candles burned, so 2.\n\nNext loop: 2 >=2? Yes. new_candles=1. Add 1, total becomes 7.\n\ncurrent_burned is 2%2=0 +1=1. Now, 1 <2, so loop stops. Total is 7, which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 3.\n\na=6, total=6. current_burned=6.\n\n6/3=2. Add 2, total 8. current_burned is 0+2=2, which is less than 3. So total is 8, correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total = a, current = a.\n\nLoop:\n\nwhile current >= b:\n    new = current // b\n    total += new\n    current = (current % b) + new\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if a is less than b?\n\nLike a=3, b=5.\n\nTotal would be 3. No new candles, since 3<5.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5.\n\nBurn 5 candles, total is 5. Then, 5//5=1 new candle. So add 1, total 6. Then, 1 new candle is burned, adds another hour. So total 7.\n\nWait, wait: Wait, no. After the first 5 candles, current is 5. new=1. So total becomes 5+1=6. Then, current is (5 mod 5)=0 +1=1. Now, 1 <5, so loop ends. So total is 6, not 7. Oh right, because the new candle is burned and contributes to the current count, but only once. So yes, 6 is correct.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nAfter the first 5, you get 1 new candle. Burn that, which adds 1 hour. So 5+1=6.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=3.\n\nInitial current=10. new=3 (since 10//3=3). total becomes 13. current is 10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nNow, 4 >=3: new=1. total 14. current is 4%3=1 +1=2. 2 <3, done. So total is 14.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n10 -> 10 hours, 10 burned.\n\nnew = 3, so 3 more hours. Now, total 13. current is 10 -3*3=1, plus 3 (burned from new candles) =4.\n\nThen, 4 gives 1 new candle, adding 1 hour, total 14. current is 4-3=1 +1=2. No more.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nSo now, the plan is to read a and b from input, compute this.\n\nIn Python, the code will be straightforward.\n\nRead the input line, split into two integers a and b.\n\nCompute as per the algorithm above.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nFirst, read the input. Since the input is given as a single line with two integers, we can do:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nInitialize total = a.\n\ncurrent = a.\n\nloop while current >= b:\n\n    new = current // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    current = current % b + new\n\nOnce the loop ends, print(total).\n\nThat should handle all cases.\n\nTesting with sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal starts at 4.\n\ncurrent =4 >=2.\n\nnew=2, total=6.\n\ncurrent=0+2=2.\n\nAgain, current >=2: new=1, total=7.\n\ncurrent=0+1=1.\n\nLoop ends. Output 7.\n\nSample 2: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6.\n\ncurrent=6 >=3: new=2, total=8.\n\ncurrent=0+2=2. 2<3. Done. Output 8.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5.\n\ntotal=5.\n\ncurrent=5 >=5: new=1, total=6.\n\ncurrent=0+1=1. Loop ends. Output 6.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=5.\n\ntotal=3. current=3 <5. Output 3.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=3.\n\nAs before, output is 14.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, considering the constraints: a can be up to 1000, same for b. The loop will run at most a certain number of times.\n\nBut even if a is 1000 and b is 2, each iteration reduces the current by a factor of b, so the number of iterations is O(log a), which is very efficient.\n\nSo the code is efficient and handles all cases.\n\nThus, the Python code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can create new candles from the remains of burned ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` candles, each burning for exactly one hour.\n2. **Burn Candles and Collect Remains**: Burn all initial candles, which gives us `a` hours of light and `a` burned candles.\n3. **Recycle Burned Candles**: Use the burned candles to create new ones. Every `b` burned candles can be recycled into one new candle.\n4. **Repeat Until Exhaustion**: Continue recycling until there are not enough burned candles left to make a new one. Each new candle burns for an hour and then adds to the count of burned candles for potential future recycling.\n\nThe algorithm efficiently computes the total hours by iteratively converting burned candles into new ones and keeping track of the total hours until no more conversions are possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n    new = current // b\n    total += new\n    current = current % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers, `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (number of burned candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Initialization**: Start with `total` hours set to `a` because all initial candles burn for an hour.\n3. **Loop for Recycling**: In each iteration, check if the current number of burned candles is enough to make at least one new candle. If so, compute how many new candles can be made, add this number to the total hours, and update the count of burned candles to reflect the new ones just burned.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The loop continues until the number of burned candles is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis approach ensures that every possible hour of illumination is accounted for, both from the initial candles and those created through recycling, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
