The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where a frog starts at position 0 and can jump either +a or -b each time. For each x from 0 to m, I need to compute f(x), which is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach without going outside [0, x]. Then, sum all these f(x) values.\n\nHmm, let's think about how the frog moves. The frog's movement depends on the steps it takes. Since each step can be either adding a or subtracting b, the reachable positions are combinations of multiples of a and b.\n\nWait, but wait: the frog can't go beyond 0 or x. So for a given x, we need to find all possible positions k that satisfy certain conditions.\n\nFirst, I should model what positions are reachable. Let's consider the possible reachable positions as a set. Starting from 0, each move adds a or subtracts b. But since the frog can't go below 0, any step that would take it negative is not allowed. Similarly, steps that would take it beyond x are also forbidden.\n\nSo for each x, the frog can make jumps that result in positions within 0 to x.\n\nBut calculating f(x) for each x up to m could be computationally expensive if done naively, especially since m can be up to 1e9. So I need an efficient way to compute the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x).\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem.\n\nThe key observation here is that the frog's reachable positions form some kind of pattern or interval as x increases. So maybe for certain ranges of x, the value of f(x) doesn't change, or changes in a predictable way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each x, the maximum reachable position is some function of x, and the number of reachable positions can be determined based on that.\n\nWait, another approach: the frog's movement can be considered as moving along the number line, with each step adding a or subtracting b. But due to the constraints, the frog cannot go below 0 or above x.\n\nSo the reachable positions are all the numbers that can be expressed as 0 + k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, such that 0 ≤ k*a - l*b ≤ x.\n\nBut this seems tricky to model. Maybe it's better to model the possible reachable positions as a graph, but considering that the frog can't exceed x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the set of reachable positions forms a certain structure. For example, the minimal and maximal reachable positions for a given x.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal reachable position is 0 minus some multiple of b, but constrained by 0. But since the frog can't go below 0, the minimal is max(0, ...). Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the reachable positions are those that can be written as k * a - l * b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the resulting position is between 0 and x inclusive.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding, for each x, the number of such k and l that satisfy 0 ≤ k*a - l*b ≤ x.\n\nBut computing this directly is computationally heavy for large x.\n\nWait, but perhaps the set of reachable positions is periodic in some way. Like, after a certain point, adding more a's or subtracting more b's just cycles through a fixed set of positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position in a certain range once x is sufficiently large.\n\nWait, let's think about the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Let g = gcd(a, b). Then, the frog's movement can only reach positions that are multiples of g. Because each step changes the position by a or -b, which are both multiples of g.\n\nSo the positions the frog can reach are all multiples of g within some interval.\n\nThat's an important insight. So for the frog, the reachable positions are exactly the numbers of the form t*g, where t is an integer, and t*g is within [0, x].\n\nSo, for each x, f(x) is equal to the number of such t's where t*g is between 0 and x, and there exists some way to reach t*g.\n\nWait, but not necessarily every multiple of g is reachable. It depends on whether a and b allow reaching that position via their steps.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that the frog can reach a position if it can somehow reach it starting from 0. So, for the frog to reach position k, there must exist non-negative integers p and q such that p*a - q*b = k.\n\nBut since a and b are fixed, the set of reachable positions is the set of all integers that can be written as p*a - q*b for p, q ≥ 0.\n\nBut this is equivalent to the subgroup generated by a and -b in integers. So the reachable positions are all multiples of d",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the function f(x) for each x from 0 to m, where f(x) represents the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line starting from position 0. The frog can jump either forward by 'a' units or backward by 'b' units, but it must stay within the interval [0, x].\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog's movement is constrained by the jumps it can make. Each jump either adds 'a' or subtracts 'b', leading to a set of reachable positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 'a' and 'b'.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of gcd(a, b). Let's denote this gcd as 'g'. Thus, the reachable positions are of the form t * g, where t is an integer.\n\n3. **Reachable Range**: For each x, the frog can reach positions from 0 up to the maximum reachable position within the interval [0, x]. The maximum reachable position without considering the interval is determined by the frog's jumps.\n\n4. **Summing f(x)**: For each x, f(x) is the count of reachable positions. To efficiently compute the sum from 0 to m, we need to determine the ranges where f(x) remains constant and then compute the contribution of these ranges.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    m, a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    g = math.gcd(a, b)\n    if g == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # The minimal step is g, so the reachable points are all multiples of g.\n    \n    # The frog can reach any point in the interval [min_reachable, max_reachable]\n    # But since it's constrained by x, for each x, min_reachable is max(0, ...), and max_reachable is min(x, ...)\n    \n    # We need to find for each x, how many multiples of g are between 0 and x, but also considering the frog's movement constraints.\n    \n    # The frog can't move beyond x or below 0.\n    # The minimal reachable position is 0, but if the frog can go negative, but it's clamped at 0.\n    \n    # However, the movement is such that the frog can reach any multiple of g up to certain limits.\n    \n    # Let's think about the possible positions the frog can reach without considering the interval [0, x].\n    # These positions are all integers k where k = p*a - q*b for p, q >= 0.\n    \n    # The minimal positive reachable position is 0, but it's possible that the frog can't reach some multiples of g due to the movement constraints.\n    \n    # To simplify, let's consider that the frog can reach any multiple of g that is within the interval [0, x + max(a, b)].\n    \n    # Wait, perhaps the key is to find the minimal and maximal reachable positions for each x.\n    \n    # Alternatively, the reachable positions are all multiples of g that are >= 0 and <= x + a.\n    \n    # Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the problem by finding the earliest x where the frog can reach any multiple of g up to x.\n    \n    # Let's compute the minimal x_min such that the frog can reach any multiple of g up to x_min.\n    \n    # Compute the minimal x where the frog can reach every multiple of g up to x.\n    \n    # This would be when x >= (k_max)*g, where k_max is determined by the steps.\n    \n    # Alternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of g once x is large enough.\n    \n    # So for x >= (some value), f(x) is the count of all multiples of g up to x.\n    \n    # Let's find the minimal x where f(x) becomes equal to floor((x)/g) + 1.\n    \n    # Then, for x < x0, f(x) may be less than that.\n    \n    # We need to find x0 such that for x >= x0, f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1.\n    \n    # So the sum can be broken into two parts: x < x0 where f(x) varies, and x >= x0 where f(x) is floor(x/g) + 1.\n    \n    # Compute x0 as the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of g up to x.\n    \n    # To find x0, note that the frog can reach any multiple of g if it can make a series of jumps that bring it to that position.\n    \n    # The frog can reach any multiple of g once x is large enough because the frog can adjust its jumps to reach those positions.\n    \n    # Therefore, for x >= x0, f(x) = (x // g) + 1.\n    \n    # Now, we need to compute the sum of f(x) for x from 0 to m.\n    \n    # For x >= x0, the sum can be computed directly as the sum of (x // g + 1) from x= x0 to m.\n    \n    # For x < x0, we need to compute f(x) manually.\n    \n    # But how do we compute x0?\n    \n    # Let's think about the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of g up to x.\n    \n    # The frog can reach 0, a, 2a, etc., but also can reach positions by combining a and -b jumps.\n    \n    # For example, if a=5 and b=3, the frog can reach 0,5,8,13, etc., but also 3, -2 (but -2 is clamped to 0).\n    \n    # So, the minimal x0 is the minimal x such that all multiples of g up to x are reachable.\n    \n    # Since g divides both a and b, the frog can reach any multiple of g by choosing appropriate steps.\n    \n    # Therefore, for x >= x0, f(x) = (x // g) + 1.\n    \n    # So, the sum can be split into two parts: x < x0, where f(x) is computed manually, and x >= x0, where f(x) is (x//g + 1).\n    \n    # Now, how to compute x0?\n    \n    # Since the frog can reach any multiple of g, x0 is the minimal x such that the frog can reach all multiples of g up to x.\n    \n    # Given that the frog can reach 0, a, 2a, etc., but also can reach positions by subtracting b, which is equivalent to adding -b.\n    \n    # So, the frog can reach any multiple of g as long as x is large enough to allow the necessary steps.\n    \n    # Therefore, x0 is the minimal x such that x >= a - b (if a > b) or something similar.\n    \n    # Alternatively, x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of g up to x.\n    \n    # Perhaps x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach any multiple of g up to x, which is simply x0 = a + b.\n    \n    # Or perhaps it's more complex.

Then x0 is 5+3=8, but wait, no, because the frog can reach 0,5,8, etc., but also 3, 6, etc.\n    \n    # So for x=7, the frog can reach 0,3,5,6,8 (but 8 is beyond 7, so not included). Wait, but 7 is within the interval, so the frog can reach 0,3,5,6, and maybe others.\n    \n    # It's getting complicated.

So for x=7, the frog can reach 8 positions. Wait, 8 is beyond x=7, so how can it reach it? That seems contradictory.\n    \n    # Oh, wait! The problem says that the frog cannot jump outside the interval [0, x]. So for x=7, the frog can reach up to 7, but the sample note says f(7)=8. That suggests that 8 is reachable, which is impossible unless x is at least 8.\n    \n    # This indicates that my earlier understanding is flawed. Perhaps the frog can reach positions beyond x by making jumps that don't exceed x, but somehow the position itself is within x.\n    \n    # Wait, no. If the frog jumps to a position beyond x, it's not allowed. So the frog can only reach positions up to x.\n    \n    # But in the sample note, f(7) is 8.

Let me list all possible reachable positions step by step.\n    \n    # Starting at 0.\n    # Jump to 5.\n    # From 5, can't jump to 10, so only jump to 2.\n    # From 2, can jump to 7 (valid) or -1 (clamped to 0).\n    # From 7, can jump to 12 (invalid) or 4.\n    # From 4, can jump to 9 (invalid) or 1.\n    # From 1, can jump to 6 or -2 (clamped to 0).\n    # From 6, can jump to 11 (invalid) or 3.\n    # From 3, can jump to 8 (invalid) or 0.\n    # So the reachable positions are 0,2,4,5,6,7,1,3,8.\n    \n    # But 8 is beyond 7, so it shouldn't be counted. So why does the sample note say f(7)=8?\n    \n    # Oh, wait! The sample note says f(7)=8, but according to this, 8 is beyond x=7. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n    \n    # Re-reading the problem statement: \"the frog never jumps on an integer outside the interval [0, x]\". So the frog cannot jump to a position outside this interval. However, the problem statement counts the positions the frog can reach, regardless of whether they were jumped to or not. So if the frog can reach a position via a series of jumps, even if it's beyond x, but that position is within x, it is counted.\n    \n    # Wait, no. The frog can't make a jump that takes it beyond x. So the frog can only be in positions within [0, x]. So the reachable positions are exactly those within [0, x].\n    \n    # So in the sample, x=7, the frog can reach 0,2,4,5,6,7,1,3, which are 8 positions. So f(7)=8, which matches the sample note.\n    \n    # So the frog can reach 8 positions, but none beyond x=7. So how did it reach 8? It didn't. It reached 8 positions within x=7.\n    \n    # So, in this case, the frog can reach 8 different positions within [0,7]. So, for x=7, f(x)=8.\n    \n    # This suggests that the frog can reach all multiples of g up to x, but perhaps in some cases, it can reach more positions.\n    \n    # So, back to the approach: the frog can reach any multiple of g up to x, but sometimes it can reach more positions due to the combination of a and b jumps.\n    \n    # Therefore, for x >= x0, f(x) is the count of all multiples of g up to x. But in reality, the frog can reach more positions than just the multiples of g because it can combine a and b jumps to reach other positions.\n    \n    # So, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Instead, the reachable positions form a certain pattern based on the steps allowed.\n    \n    # Another approach: The frog's reachable positions can be modeled using BFS. Each position is a node, and edges represent possible jumps. The reachable positions are all the nodes reachable from 0 without stepping outside [0, x].\n    \n    # However, performing BFS for each x up to m is computationally infeasible for large m.\n    \n    # Instead, we can find a mathematical pattern or formula for f(x) based on the properties of a and b.\n    \n    # Key Insight: The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo d, where d is the gcd of a and b. However, the exact reachable positions depend on the specific values of a and b.\n    \n    # So, for each x, the number of reachable positions is the number of integers k such that k ≡ 0 mod d and 0 ≤ k ≤ x, and the frog can reach k through some combination of a and b jumps.\n    \n    # But how do we count these positions efficiently?\n    \n    # Let’s define d = gcd(a, b).

These positions are exactly the multiples of d.\n    \n    # Therefore, the reachable positions are all multiples of d that lie within [0, x].\n    \n    # Thus, for each x, f(x) is the count of such multiples, which is floor(x / d) + 1.\n    \n    # However, this isn't entirely accurate because the frog might not be able to reach all multiples of d within [0, x] due to movement constraints.\n    \n    # For example, if a=5 and b=3, d=1. The frog can reach any integer up to x, so f(x) would be x+1. But in the sample input, for x=7, f(x)=8, which aligns with this formula.\n    \n    # So, perhaps the correct formula for f(x) is floor((x + a) / d), but I'm not sure.\n    \n    # Let's test this with the sample input. For a=5, b=3, d=1:\n    \n    # f(0) = 1 (only 0)\n    # f(1) = 1 (only 0)\n    # f(2) = 1 (only 0)\n    # f(3) = 2 (0,3)\n    # f(4) = 2 (0,3)\n    # f(5) = 3 (0,3,5)\n    # f(6) = 3 (0,3,5)\n    # f(7) = 4 (0,3,5,7)\n    \n    # Wait, but according to the sample note, f(7)=8.

Let me re-examine the sample note.\n    \n    # The sample note says that for the first example, f(7)=8. But according to my calculation, f(7) should be 4, which doesn't match.\n    \n    # This suggests that my earlier approach is incorrect. Perhaps the frog can reach more positions than just the multiples of d.\n    \n    # Let me think differently. The frog's movement allows it to reach any position that can be expressed as p*a - q*b, where p and q are non-negative integers, and the position is within [0, x].\n    \n    # The set of all such positions forms a range. For example, if a=5 and b=3, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, etc. So the reachable positions are not just multiples of d, but a broader set.\n    \n    # Therefore, the initial approach was incorrect.

So the reachable positions are exactly those within [0, x].\n    \n    # So in the sample, x=7, the frog can reach 0,2,4,5,6,7,1,3, which are 8 positions. So f(7)=8, which matches the sample note.\n    \n    # So the frog can reach 8 positions, but none beyond x=7. So how did it reach 8? It didn't. It reached 8 positions within x=7.\n    \n    # So, in this case, the frog can reach 8 different positions within [0,7]. So, for x=7, f(x)=8.\n    \n    # This suggests that the frog can reach all multiples of g up to x, but perhaps in some cases, it can reach more positions.\n    \n    # So, back to the approach: the frog can reach any multiple of g up to x, but sometimes it can reach more positions due to the combination of a and b jumps.\n    \n    # Therefore, for x >= x0, f(x) is the count of all multiples of g up to x. But in reality, the frog can reach more positions than just the multiples of g because it can combine a and b jumps to reach other positions.\n    \n    # So, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Instead, the reachable positions form a certain pattern based on the steps allowed.\n    \n    # Another approach: The frog's reachable positions can be modeled using BFS. Each position is a node, and edges represent possible jumps. The reachable positions are all the nodes reachable from 0 without stepping outside [0, x].\n    \n    # However, performing BFS for each x up to m is computationally infeasible for large m.\n    \n    # Instead, we can find a mathematical pattern or formula for f(x) based on the properties of a and b.\n    \n    # Key Insight: The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo d, where d is the gcd of a and b. However, the exact reachable positions depend on the specific values of a and b.\n    \n    # So, for each x, the number of reachable positions is the number of integers k such that k ≡ 0 mod d and 0 ≤ k ≤ x, and the frog can reach k through some combination of a and b jumps.\n    \n    # But how do we count these positions efficiently?\n    \n    # Let’s define d = gcd(a, b). The frog can reach any position of the form k = p*a - q*b, where p and q are non-negative integers. These positions are exactly the multiples of d.\n    \n    # Therefore, the reachable positions are all multiples of d that lie within [0, x].\n    \n    # Thus, for each x, f(x) is the count of such multiples, which is floor(x / d) + 1.\n    \n    # However, this isn't entirely accurate because the frog might not be able to reach all multiples of d within [0, x] due to movement constraints.\n    \n    # For example, if a=5 and b=3, d=1. The frog can reach any integer up to x, so f(x) would be x+1. But in the sample input, for x=7, f(x)=8, which aligns with this formula.\n    \n    # So, perhaps the correct formula for f(x) is floor((x + a) / d), but I'm not sure.\n    \n    # Let's test this with the sample input. For a=5, b=3, d=1:\n    \n    # f(0) = 1 (only 0)\n    # f(1) = 1 (only 0)\n    # f(2) = 1 (only 0)\n    # f(3) = 2 (0,3)\n    # f(4) = 2 (0,3)\n    # f(5) = 3 (0,3,5)\n    # f(6) = 3 (0,3,5)\n    # f(7) = 4 (0,3,5,7)\n    \n    # Wait, but according to the sample note, f(7)=8. So this contradicts the earlier assumption.\n    \n    # Hmm, I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-examine the sample note.\n    \n    # The sample note says that for the first example, f(7)=8. But according to my calculation, f(7) should be 4, which doesn't match.\n    \n    # This suggests that my earlier approach is incorrect. Perhaps the frog can reach more positions than just the multiples of d.\n    \n    # Let me think differently. The frog's movement allows it to reach any position that can be expressed as p*a - q*b, where p and q are non-negative integers, and the position is within [0, x].\n    \n    # The set of all such positions forms a range. For example, if a=5 and b=3, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, etc. So the reachable positions are not just multiples of d, but a broader set.\n    \n    # Therefore, the initial approach was incorrect. Instead, the reachable positions form a contiguous range once x is sufficiently large.\n    \n    # To find the sum efficiently, we can determine the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions up to x, and then compute the sum for x >= x0 as the sum of arithmetic series.\n    \n    # The minimal x where the frog can reach all positions up to x is when the frog has covered all possible positions through combinations of a and b jumps.\n    \n    # This x0 is determined by the frog's ability to reach all positions in the range [0, x0], and beyond that, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n    \n    # Once x >= x0, the frog can reach any position up to x, so f(x) = x + 1.\n    \n    # Therefore, the solution involves:\n    \n    1. Determining x0, the minimal x where f(x) becomes x + 1.\n    2. For x < x0, compute f(x) manually.\n    3. For x >= x0, compute f(x) as x + 1.\n    \n    # Now, how to compute x0?\n    \n    # x0 is the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x.\n    \n    # This happens when the frog can reach every position in the range [0, x] by some combination of a and b jumps.\n    \n    # The frog can reach any position if the steps allow it to cover the entire range.\n    \n    # The minimal x0 is a + b - gcd(a, b).\n    \n    # Let's test this with the sample input: a=5, b=3, d=1. x0 = 5 + 3 - 1 = 7.\n    \n    # For x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7, so f(x)=8, which matches the sample.\n    \n    # For x=6, the frog cannot reach 7, so f(x)=7.\n    \n    # So, the formula for x0 is a + b - d, where d = gcd(a, b).\n    \n    # Now, the approach is:\n    \n    # 1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n    # 2. Compute x0 = a + b - d.\n    # 3. For x < x0, compute f(x) manually by BFS or another method.\n    # 4. For x >= x0, f(x) = x + 1.\n    \n    # However, for large m (up to 1e9), computing f(x) manually for x < x0 is not feasible. Therefore, we need a smarter way.\n    \n    # Let's find the sum for x < x0 and x >= x0 separately.\n    \n    # Sum for x < x0: We can precompute f(x) for x from 0 to x0 - 1 and sum them.\n    # Sum for x >= x0: The sum is sum_{x=x0}^m (x + 1) = sum_{k=1}^{m - x0 + 1} (x0 + k) = (m - x0 + 1)*(x0 + m + 1)/2.\n    \n    # But again, for large x0, precomputing f(x) is not feasible. So we need a mathematical way to compute the sum for x < x0.\n    \n    # Let's think about the structure of reachable positions for x < x0.\n    \n    # The frog can reach certain positions up to x, and these positions form a certain pattern. For x >= x0, all positions are reachable.\n    \n    # For x < x0, the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as p*a - q*b, where p and q are non-negative integers, and the result is within [0, x].\n    \n    # This forms a set that can be represented as a union of intervals or as a linear function.\n    \n    # To compute the sum for x < x0, we can find a formula that represents the number of reachable positions for each x.\n    \n    # Let's denote s(x) as the number of reachable positions for a given x. We need to find s(x) for x < x0 and sum them.\n    \n    # The minimal x where the frog can reach all positions is x0, so for x < x0, s(x) is less than x + 1.\n    \n    # However, finding s(x) for each x < x0 is time-consuming for large x0.\n    \n    # Instead, we can observe that for x < x0, the number of reachable positions increases in a predictable manner. The frog can reach all positions from 0 up to x when x is a multiple of a certain value.\n    \n    # Alternatively, perhaps the number of reachable positions for x < x0 can be represented as a linear function.\n    \n    # Let's consider the sample input where a=5, b=3, d=1, x0=7.\n    \n    # For x=0: s(0)=1\n    # x=1: s(1)=1\n    # x=2: s(2)=1\n    # x=3: s(3)=2\n    # x=4: s(4)=2\n    # x=5: s(5)=3\n    # x=6: s(6)=3\n    # x=7: s(7)=8\n    \n    # The sum from x=0 to x=6 is 1+1+1+2+2+3+3=13. Adding s(7)=8 gives total 21, but the sample sum is 19. Wait, the sample includes x=0 to x=7, which is 8 terms, summing to 19. So perhaps my earlier manual calculations are incorrect.\n    \n    # I think I'm stuck trying to find a pattern here. Let's try to find a formula for s(x) when x < x0.\n    \n    # When x < x0, the frog can reach positions in a certain range.
