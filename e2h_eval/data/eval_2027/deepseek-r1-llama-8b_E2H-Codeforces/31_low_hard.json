Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vanya and his cards. Each card has an integer, which can be positive, negative, or zero, but the absolute value doesn't exceed x. Natasha hid all his cards, but he found n of them. He wants the sum of all found cards to be zero. But since some are missing, we need to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero.\n\nHmm, wait. The initial set includes all possible integers from -x to x. So Vanya had infinitely many cards covering each possible value. Now, he found n of them, but some are missing. We need to find the minimal number of cards he must add (from the available ones) so that the sum of all found cards plus these added ones equals zero.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that he can find more cards. So the sum of all found cards (initially n, but he might find more) should be zero. But the goal is to find the minimum number of cards he needs to find (in addition to the n he already found) so that the total sum is zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that initially, Vanya has all the cards, but Natasha hid them. Now, he finds n cards, and those are the only ones visible. We need to compute the minimal number of cards he needs to find (from the remaining hidden ones) such that when you add their values, the total becomes zero.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Calculate the sum of the current found cards.\n2. Determine what additional cards (with values between -x and x) are needed to make the total sum zero.\n3. Find the minimal number of such cards.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nLet’s denote S as the sum of the found cards. We need to find a set of k cards (each with value in [-x, x]) such that their sum is equal to -S, and k is as small as possible.\n\nWait, no: because the total sum of all found cards plus the new ones should be zero. So the sum of the new ones is -S. So yes.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal k where we can select some integers (each between -x and x) whose sum is exactly (-S), and k is minimized.\n\nNow, the key is to find the minimal number of terms needed to reach a target sum T = (-S), with each term being at most x in absolute value.\n\nWait, but each term can be positive or negative, right? Because the cards can be any number between -x and x, inclusive.\n\nSo for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 2 + 2 + 1 (but wait, 1 is allowed, but in our case, each term can be up to x. Hmm, but wait, each term can be any integer between -x and x, including. So for T=5, x=2, we can do 2+2+1 is not possible because 1 is less than x, but wait, no—each term can be as low as -2, but in this case, we want to reach 5, so each term should be as large as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: to reach T, each term can contribute up to x towards the sum, either positively or negatively. But since we can choose the signs, the maximum contribution per term is x. So for the minimal k, we want to maximize each term's contribution towards the target.\n\nSo the minimal k is the ceiling of |T| / x. Because each step can contribute at most x towards reducing the remaining target.\n\nBut wait, let's test this idea with examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nThe found cards are [-1, 1, 2], sum S is (-1+1+2)=2. So T is -2. So we need to find a set of cards whose sum is -2.\n\nWhat is the minimal k? Well, adding a single card with -2. So k=1. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample:\n\nFound cards are [-2, -2], sum S is -4. So T is 4.\n\nx is 3.\n\nEach term can contribute at most 3. So 4 /3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2. So adding two 3's gives 6, which is more than 4. Wait, but that's not correct because the sum is 4, but 3+1=4, but 1 is allowed as x is 3.\n\nWait wait, no. Wait, the sum of the added cards must be 4. So for each added card, the maximum contribution is x (3) towards the sum. So 3 +1=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. Each card can have an integer value between -x and x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum \\( S \\) of the values on the found cards.\n2. **Determine the Target Sum**: The target sum for the additional cards is \\( -S \\) because the total sum should be zero.\n3. **Find Minimum Number of Cards**: To achieve the target sum with the fewest cards possible, each card can contribute at most \\( x \\) towards the target sum. Therefore, the minimum number of cards required is the ceiling of the absolute value of the target sum divided by \\( x \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\ns = sum(cards)\ntarget = -s\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Calculate minimal k\n    k = (abs(target) + x - 1) // x\n    print(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Calculate Sum**: Compute the sum of the found cards to determine how far from zero the current sum is.\n- **Target Adjustment**: The target for the additional cards is the negative of the computed sum to balance the total to zero.\n- **Compute Minimum Cards**: Using the formula \\( \\lceil \\frac{|target|}{x} \\rceil \\), we determine the smallest number of cards needed. This formula ensures each card contributes the maximum possible value towards reaching the target sum efficiently.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution in constant time, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.",
