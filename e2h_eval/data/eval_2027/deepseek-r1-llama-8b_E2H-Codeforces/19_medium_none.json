The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about districts connected in a tree structure because it's given that each pair of districts has exactly one path connecting them. Each district i has 2^i fans. The president wants to remove k contestants, and after removing them, the remaining districts should form a connected subtree (since they can all reach each other). The goal is to maximize the sum of the fans of the remaining districts. We need to find which k districts to remove.\n\nHmm. So the strategy here is to find a connected subtree of the original tree where the sum of 2^i for all i in the subtree is as large as possible, and then remove the other k nodes.\n\nWait, but how do we choose which nodes to remove? Because removing a node effectively prunes its subtree from consideration. So the optimal solution would involve selecting a subtree that includes as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\nI remember that in trees, the maximum sum for such a problem often corresponds to choosing a centroid or a specific kind of subtree that allows us to include as many high nodes as possible.\n\nWait, considering that 2^i grows exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts are much more valuable. So the optimal approach would be to select a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, while ensuring that the selected nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nPerhaps the key is to find a node that, when removed, partitions the tree into subtrees. We want to select the subtree that maximizes the sum of 2^i for its nodes. Then, for each such possible partition, we can compute which option gives the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but since k can be up to n-1, which is 1e6, we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal solution is to select a subtree that is a chain, and the sum is as large as possible. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think differently. Since 2^i is the weight of each node, the total sum is maximized when we include as many high i as possible.\n\nSo, in a tree, the best connected subtree would be the one that includes all the highest possible nodes. So, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the maximum number of the highest possible nodes.\n\nWait, but the subtree must be connected. So the best way is to find a root where the subtree starting at that root includes as many of the largest nodes as possible.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal subtree is formed by selecting a certain node as the root, and including all nodes in the tree that are in its subtree when the root is chosen.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to finding the centroid of the tree, but weighted by 2^i.\n\nNo, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that contains the node with the highest value, and then recursively includes the maximum possible nodes in a connected way.\n\nWait, let's consider the example given.\n\nIn the first sample, n=6, k=3. The tree structure is:\n\nLooking at the input:\n\nAfter the first line, the next lines are edges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo the tree is:\n\n1 is connected to 2.\n\n2 is connected to 6, 3, and 4.\n\n6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the initial tree is:\n\n1-2-6-5\n\n    |\n    3\n    |\n    4\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait 2 is connected to 1, 6, 3, and 4. Wait, no: looking at the edges:\n\nEdges are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nSo 2 is connected to 1, 6, 3, and 4. So the structure is like:\n\n2 is the central node connected to 1, 3, 4, and via 6 to 5.\n\nThe sample output is to remove 1,3,4. So the remaining nodes are 2,5,6. Their 2^i values are 2^2=4, 2^5=32, 2^6=64. Sum is 100.\n\nBut why is that the maximum?\n\nBecause including 2,5,6 is better than any other combination. For example, if you keep 6,5,3,4,2: their sum is 4+16+64+ ... Wait, wait, wait, no, 2's value is 4, 3 is 8,4 is 16,5 is 32,6 is 64. So keeping 2,5,6 gives 4+32+64=100. If you instead kept 3,4,5,6: 8+16+32+64=120. But wait, that's more than 100. Why isn't that the case?\n\nOh, because the tree is connected. Wait, if you remove 2, then 5 and 6 are only connected through 2. So if you remove 2, you can't have 5 and 6 connected without 2. So you can't have 5 and 6 in the same subtree if 2 is removed.\n\nAh right! So the subtree must be connected. So in the sample, if you remove 1,3,4, the remaining nodes are 2,5,6, which form a connected subtree. The sum is 4 + 32 + 64 = 100.\n\nIf you tried to include 3,4,5,6, they are not all connected because 2 is removed. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo the approach is to find a connected subtree S, whose size is (n - k), and the sum of 2^i for i in S is as large as possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree of size m = n - k, such that the sum is maximum.\n\nWe need to find such a subtree.\n\nBut how?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the structure of the optimal subtree. Since 2^i is increasing with i, the optimal subtree will include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but also arranged in a way that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but the tree is arbitrary. So perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the top t nodes (for some t) and is connected.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a path, and includes as many high i as possible.\n\nWait, but the tree could have various structures. So perhaps the way is to find the subtree that is a star, where the center is a high i node, and all the leaves are as high as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the subtree is a chain, and the chain includes as many high i as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible node, calculate the maximum possible sum if that node is the root of the subtree. Then, choose the root that gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut that's vague. How to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one where the sum of the subtree rooted at a particular node is as large as possible. Because then, choosing that node as the root and including its entire subtree would give a large sum.\n\nWait, but that depends on the structure.\n\nWait, considering that 2^i is the value of each node, the sum of a subtree is the sum of 2^i for all nodes in it.\n\nSo, for any subtree T, the sum is the sum of 2^i for i in T.\n\nOur task is to find a connected subtree of size m (n-k) with the maximum sum.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find a connected induced subgraph with m nodes that has maximum possible sum of 2^i for its nodes.\n\nNow, the question is, what's the structure of this subgraph.\n\nAn alternative approach: think of the problem as trying to select a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but connected.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the node with the highest value, and then all possible nodes that can be connected to it without excluding any high nodes.\n\nWait, but that's a bit vague.\n\nWait, another thought: in a tree, the maximum sum connected subgraph of size m is achieved by the subtree that includes the top m nodes in terms of their 2^i values, but arranged in a connected way.\n\nBut how do we ensure that these top m nodes are connected?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the top (m) nodes, and forms a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem as follows: the optimal subtree will be a subtree that includes a certain set of nodes, and those nodes are all in a single path, perhaps. Or perhaps it's a star-shaped subtree.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the optimal subtree includes 2,5,6. These are connected via 2-6-5. So it's a chain.\n\nAnother approach: since 2^i is exponential, the higher the node number, the better. So the optimal subtree must include as many as possible of the highest-numbered nodes, but in a connected way.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the minimal set of nodes to remove such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree containing as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes in the order of decreasing value (i.e., from highest to lowest). We can try to include as many as possible, ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but including them all may not be possible because the tree may not allow it.\n\nSo, perhaps the process is:\n\n- Sort all nodes in descending order of i.\n\n- Try to include as many as possible in a connected way.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a path, and consists of the m highest-numbered nodes in a connected path.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the problem is similar to finding a subtree of size m with maximum sum of node weights. Since the weight is 2^i, the sum is determined by the nodes included.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the subtree of size m (n -k) that has the maximum possible sum of 2^i.\n\nSo, the problem is now: find a connected subtree with exactly m nodes that has the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nHow to find this efficiently.\n\nHmm. Now, in a tree, the maximum sum subtree of size m is found by selecting the m nodes with the highest 2^i values, but they must form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but if the top m nodes are not connected, we have to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Collect all the nodes in the tree, sorted by their value (2^i) in descending order.\n\n2. Try to select the first m nodes, but check if they form a connected subtree. If yes, that's our answer.\n\n3. If not, then we need to find a way to connect them by including some additional nodes with lower values.\n\nBut this seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that starts at some node and goes through as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible node, we can compute the sum of the subtree rooted at that node, and then select the top m sums.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, this is feasible as long as each step is O(n).\n\nBut how to compute the sum for each subtree.\n\nYes, for each node u, the sum of its subtree is the sum of 2^u plus the sum of all its children's subtrees. Because each child's subtree is already connected to u.\n\nWait, but this is only true if the subtree is considered as a rooted tree. So for each node u, when computing the sum of its subtree, it's 2^u plus the sum of all the subtrees of its children.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute for each node u, the sum of its subtree (when u is the root). This can be done via a post-order traversal.\n\nOnce we have the sum for each subtree, the problem is to find a subtree of size m = n -k, which is connected, and has the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but the subtree can be any connected part of the tree, not necessarily rooted at a particular node.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by the subtree that is the union of the top m nodes, possibly connected via some paths.\n\nBut again, how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by selecting a subtree that is a chain, and the chain includes the m highest nodes.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes except the ones that are leaves in some critical way.\n\nAlternatively, think of it this way: the sum is maximized when the subtree includes as many high i as possible, even if that means including some lower i to maintain connectivity.\n\nSo, perhaps the way is to find the node with the highest 2^i, and include all its descendants, but that may not be optimal if there's a way to include more high i elsewhere.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the highest node is 6, with 2^6=64. Including 6,5,2 gives sum 4+32+64=100. But in the sample, the solution includes 2,5,6, which is 3 nodes. But the sample says that m = 6-3=3, which is correct.\n\nWait, but 6's subtree includes 5 and 2 and 6. So the sum is 64+32+4=100.\n\nSo perhaps, the subtree is the one rooted at 2, which includes 6 and 5.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another approach: since the subtree must be connected, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that has the maximum possible sum for a connected subtree of size m. To find this, perhaps the subtree is a path that includes as many high i as possible.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a star, centered at a high i node, and includes as many other high i nodes as possible.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the center is 2, which is not the highest i (6 is higher). So that's not the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by finding the subtree which, when considering all possible connected subtrees of size m, has the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each possible subtree S of size m, compute the sum of 2^i for i in S, and find the maximum.\n\nBut this is computationally impossible for n=1e6.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: the subtree that gives the maximum sum is the one that includes all the nodes except the ones that are in a certain path that contributes the least to the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAnother thought: in a tree, the subtree that includes a certain path between two high-value nodes may be the best.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by the subtree that includes the node with the highest value, and as much of its \"branch\" as possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the node with the highest value is 6 in the sample, and the subtree is 6-2-5, which is connected.\n\nBut in the sample, the sum is 100. What if the subtree was 6-2-3-4-2? No, that's not a subtree because 2 is the parent of 3 and 4. So 6's subtree includes 2,3,4,5,6. That's 5 nodes, which is larger than m=3, but the sum would be 64+32+4+8+16= 124, which is higher than the sample's 100.\n\nBut why isn't that the case? Because in the sample, they removed 1,3,4, leaving 2,5,6. So why wasn't the entire subtree of 6 chosen?\n\nBecause m=3, but the subtree of 6 has 5 nodes, which is more than 3. So perhaps the approach is to find the subtree with exactly m nodes.\n\nWait, no. Because m is n -k. So in the sample, n=6, k=3, m=3.\n\nSo the subtree must have exactly 3 nodes.\n\nSo in the sample, the subtree 2,5,6 has 3 nodes, sum 100.\n\nIf there's a subtree with 3 nodes that has a higher sum, that's better.\n\nBut what's the maximum sum possible for a connected subtree of 3 nodes.\n\nIn the sample, the options are:\n\n- 6,2,5: sum 64+4+32=100.\n\n- 6,2,3: 64+4+8=76.\n\n- 6,2,4: 64+4+16=84.\n\n- 2,3,4: 4+8+16=28.\n\n- 2,3,6: 4+8+64=76.\n\n- 2,4,6: 4+16+64=84.\n\n- 1,2,6: 2+4+64=70.\n\n- 3,2,4: 8+4+16=28.\n\nSo the maximum is 100.\n\nThus, the optimal is indeed 2,5,6.\n\nSo, the approach is to find a connected subtree of size m, which is the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree of size m with the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nSo, the next step is to find an efficient way to compute this.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nAn alternative idea: the sum of a connected subtree is the sum of all nodes in it. To maximize this sum, we need to include as many high i as possible, but connected.\n\nThus, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the m highest i's, but connected.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by the subtree that is the path from the node with the highest i down to some lower nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is a chain of m nodes, where the nodes are the highest possible.\n\nBut how to find such a chain.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that has the maximum depth, but that's not directly applicable.\n\nAnother approach: since each node's value is 2^i, the sum is maximized when the subtree includes as many high i as possible.\n\nThus, perhaps the optimal subtree is a path that includes the highest i, and then the next highest i that is adjacent to it, etc.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as finding the subtree that includes the node with the highest i, and as much of its adjacent nodes as possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the subtree must include the highest i, and then the subtree that includes as many as possible of the next highest i's in a connected way.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the subtree.\n\nSuppose the subtree is a star: a central node connected to several others. The sum would be the sum of the central node plus the sum of its connected leaves.\n\nBut perhaps a star shape can include a lot of high i nodes, thus maximizing the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a straight path, allowing inclusion of as many high i as possible.\n\nBut I'm not making progress.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the problem.\n\nThe sum of the subtree is the sum of 2^i for each node in it.\n\nSince 2^i is exponential, the sum is maximized when as many high i's are included.\n\nThus, the optimal subtree must include the highest possible i's, and be connected.\n\nTherefore, the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest i, and as many as possible of the next highest i's that are connected to it.\n\nWait, perhaps the subtree is the one that is the longest possible path starting from the highest i, and including as many as possible of the next highest i's in sequence.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a subtree that is a path, and the path includes the nodes with the top m values.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a chain, and the nodes in the chain are the top m nodes in the tree.\n\nBut how to find such a chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to the maximum path sum in a tree, but with a fixed size.\n\nIn that case, perhaps a dynamic programming approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, we can compute the maximum sum subtree that includes that node and has a certain size.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is based on 2^i, which is strictly increasing, the sum is dominated by the higher i's.\n\nThus, the optimal subtree must include the node with the highest i, and as many as possible of the next highest i's, connected in a way that forms a subtree.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Identify the node with the highest i, say u.\n\n2. Include u in the subtree.\n\n3. Then, include as many as possible of the next highest i's that are connected to u in such a way that the subtree remains connected.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtree is the one that is the smallest subtree containing the m highest i's.\n\nBut that might not always be possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that contains the m highest i's, and is connected by including the necessary nodes to make them connected.\n\nBut how to find which nodes are necessary.\n\nThis seems challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is the union of the m highest i's and the minimal set of nodes needed to connect them.\n\nBut again, for a tree, the minimal set is the minimal number of nodes that form a path connecting all these m nodes.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps a different approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the sum of the subtree.\n\nThe sum is the sum of 2^i for all i in the subtree.\n\nEach node contributes 2^i, which is unique.\n\nThus, the sum is simply the sum of 2^i for i in the subtree.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a connected subtree of size m with maximum sum.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to selecting a connected subset S of the tree with |S|=m, and sum of 2^i for i in S is as large as possible.\n\nTo find S, perhaps the approach is to find the subtree that includes the m largest 2^i's, and connects them optimally.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother Idea: In a tree, the subtree that includes the m largest 2^i's can be built by selecting the minimal number of nodes to connect them.\n\nWait, but the subtree must be connected, so any subset of nodes that includes these m must form a connected subtree.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree that includes the m largest nodes, and is as large as possible in sum.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that contains the m largest nodes, and is connected through a path that uses as few low nodes as possible.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's sort all the nodes in decreasing order of i.\n\nThen, try to build the subtree by adding the next highest node, ensuring that it is connected to the current subtree.\n\nThis approach is similar to a greedy algorithm.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort all nodes in descending order of i.\n\n2. Start with the highest node, add it to the subtree.\n\n3. For each next node, check if it is already in the subtree or can be connected by adding a minimal number of nodes.\n\n4. Continue until we have added m nodes.\n\nBut this approach may not always work because the next node may not be connected to the current subtree, requiring adding some lower nodes, which may increase the total sum less than the next node's value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one where the sum is maximized when the nodes are added in the order of their 2^i value, and whenever a node is added, all its adjacent nodes are checked for inclusion.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive.\n\nWait, but for n up to 1e6, any O(n) approach is acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps the following approach can work:\n\n- Sort all nodes in decreasing order of i.\n\n- Use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to track which nodes are in the subtree.\n\n- Iterate through the sorted list, adding each node to the subtree if it can be connected to the existing subtree with minimal cost (adding the least number of nodes possible, preferably 0 or 1).\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding the minimal number of nodes to remove to form a connected subtree of size m.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to finding a subtree with maximum sum, and the subtree must have exactly m nodes.\n\nIn this case, the approach is to find the m nodes with the highest 2^i values, and see if they form a connected subtree.\n\nIf they do, that's the maximum sum. If not, then we need to find a way to connect them by including some lower nodes.\n\nBut how.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is the minimal subtree that connects all the m highest nodes.\n\nBut the minimal subtree may require adding some lower nodes, thus reducing the sum.\n\nBut perhaps the sum of adding a few lower nodes is better than not being able to include some higher nodes.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the subtree as consisting of a main path, and the sum is the sum of all nodes along this path.\n\nBut the path may have branches, but the branches may include higher nodes.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by the subtree that is the path from the highest node down to some lower nodes, and includes as many high nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding the subtree that has the maximum sum, regardless of size, and then adjust it to have exactly m nodes.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is 2^i for each node, the contribution of a node is extremely high compared to its children. So, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes as many high i's as possible, and is connected via a single path.\n\nThus, the subtree is a chain that includes the highest possible i's.\n\nBut how to find this chain.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the path that starts at the highest i, and then includes the next highest i's that are adjacent to it.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is the chain of the m highest i's, but that may not be possible because they may not form a connected chain.\n\nThus, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Find the m highest i's.\n\n- Check if they form a connected subtree.\n\n- If yes, that's the maximum sum.\n\n- If no, then find the minimal number of additional nodes needed to connect them, but this would require including some lower i's, which would reduce the overall sum.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAnother Idea: Perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is a star centered at the highest i, and includes as many of the next highest i's as possible.\n\nBut in the sample, the highest i is 6, and the star would include 2,5, etc. But in the sample, the optimal subtree is 2,5,6, which is a chain, not a star.\n\nWait, perhaps the star is better than a chain in some cases.\n\nBut in the sample, the star would include 6 connected to 2, which is connected to 3,4,1. So the star would include 6,2,3,4,1,5, which is 6 nodes. But m is 3, so that's not relevant.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the problem as a graph where each node's value is 2^i, and the edges have weight 0. We need to find a connected subgraph with exactly m nodes that has the maximum sum.\n\nThe problem is to find the maximum sum connected subgraph with exactly m nodes.\n\nIn graph theory, this is known as the maximum weight connected subgraph of fixed size.\n\nBut I'm not aware of an efficient algorithm for this, especially for large trees.\n\nAnother Idea: For a tree, the maximum sum connected subgraph of size m is the sum of the m nodes with the highest values, provided they can form a connected subtree. If they cannot, then we need to find the minimal number of nodes to connect them, which would reduce the sum.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the node that is part of the m largest nodes, and then find the subtree that includes as much as possible of those nodes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to find the node with the highest value, and then include as much of its subtree as possible, but this may not yield the optimal sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to perform a post-order traversal of the tree, computing for each node the sum of its subtree, and then for each node, we can consider using it as the root of a subtree, and see if the sum can be part of the maximum.\n\nBut for n=1e6, this is manageable.\n\nOnce we have the sum for each subtree, the problem is to find a subtree of size m with maximum sum.\n\nWait, but how.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node u, the sum of its subtree is s(u). We can then, for each node u, compute the maximum sum of any subtree of size m that is rooted at u.\n\nBut this seems computationally heavy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that the optimal subtree is the one that has the maximum sum among all possible subtrees of size m.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\n1. Compute for each node u, the sum of the subtree rooted at u.\n\n2. For each node u, determine whether the subtree rooted at u has exactly m nodes.\n\n   a. If yes, record the sum s(u).\n\n   b. If not, find a way to merge the subtrees of its children to reach exactly m nodes.\n\nBut this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is a single node, but that's only if m=1.\n\nBut for larger m, it's better to include more nodes.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the sum is dominated by the higher i's, the optimal subtree is likely to be a chain that includes as many of the highest i's as possible.\n\nThus, perhaps the approach is to find the chain (path) of m nodes that has the highest possible sum.\n\nBut how to find this chain.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, we can compute the sum of the path starting at that node and going down as far as possible, and then select the path with the highest sum.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for patterns or similar problems.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to finding a path with the maximum sum, but with the constraint of exactly m nodes.\n\nIn that case, the solution would involve finding the path with the maximum sum that has exactly m nodes.\n\nBut I don't know of a standard algorithm for this.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the tree is connected, any subtree is a connected component. So the problem is to find the connected component of size m with the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the connected component of size m with the highest sum of node values.\n\nIn a general graph, this is NP-hard, but for trees, perhaps there's a linear-time approach.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is a chain of m nodes, and the sum is the sum of those nodes.\n\nBut again, how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that is the minimal connected subtree containing the m highest nodes.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's imagine that the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes except those in a certain path.\n\nBut again, not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that is the intersection of all the paths that pass through the highest node.\n\nBut that's unclear.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the sum as a function of the nodes included.\n\nThe sum increases exponentially with i, so higher nodes contribute significantly.\n\nThus, the optimal subtree must include as many high nodes as possible, but connected.\n\nThus, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the highest node, and all possible nodes connected to it, but limited to m nodes.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the subtree is the one that includes the highest node, and as much of its neighbors as possible, but limited to m nodes.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, for example, if the highest node is u, and its children are v1, v2, etc., each with their own subtrees.\n\nWe need to choose the m-1 other nodes from the union of the subtrees of u's children, selecting those that have the highest 2^i.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Identify the highest node u.\n\n2. Collect all the nodes from the subtrees of u's children, sorted in descending order of 2^i.\n\n3. Select the top m-1 nodes from this collection.\n\n4. Form the subtree consisting of u and these m-1 nodes.\n\nBut this assumes that these nodes form a connected subtree with u.\n\nBut wait, since u is the root, any node in the subtree of any child is connected via u.\n\nThus, the subtree is connected.\n\nThus, this approach may work.\n\nBut wait, is this the optimal?\n\nIn the sample, the highest node is 6, with value 64.\n\nIts children are 2 and 5.\n\nWait, in the sample, 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nWait, no, the sample's edges are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nThus, 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nSo the subtree of 6 includes 6,2,5,1,3,4.\n\nIf we take m=3, the subtree would be 6,2,5: sum 64+4+32=100.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the approach works in this case.\n\nAnother test case: let's say we have a chain 1-2-3-4-5, and m=3.\n\nThe highest node is 5, which has a subtree sum of 5's subtree (nodes 5,4,3,2,1). But m=3.\n\nWe can collect the top 2 nodes from the subtrees of 5's children. The children are 4, which has subtree sum of 4's subtree (including 3,2,1). So, the top 2 nodes from 4's subtree are 4,3.\n\nThus, the subtree would be 5,4,3: sum 32+16+8=56.\n\nAlternatively, is there a better option? Like 5,4,2? No, because 2 is not in 5's subtree.\n\nWait, 5's subtree is 5,4,3,2,1. So the children of 5 are 4.\n\nSo, the nodes available are 5,4,3,2,1.\n\nThe top 2 nodes after 5 are 4 and 3.\n\nThus, the sum is 5+4+3= 32+16+8=56.\n\nBut what if m=3, and the nodes 5,4,3 are not connected via a chain longer than 3? Well, they are connected via 5-4-3.\n\nSo that's the optimal.\n\nThus, the approach seems to work.\n\nAnother test case: suppose the tree is a star with 6 as the center connected to 1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nn=6, k=3, m=3.\n\nHighest node is 6.\n\nIts children are 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nTop 2 nodes are 5 and4.\n\nThus, the subtree is 6,5,4: sum 64+32+16=112.\n\nWhich is better than any other combination.\n\nThus, the approach seems promising.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Find the node u with the highest i.\n\n2. Collect all the nodes in the subtrees of u's children.\n\n3. Sort these nodes in descending order of i.\n\n4. Take the top (m-1) nodes.\n\n5. The optimal subtree is u plus these (m-1) nodes.\n\nBut wait, what if u's subtree doesn't have enough nodes?\n\nNo, since the total number of nodes in the tree is n, and m =n-k, which is less than n.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\n- Find u, the node with the highest i.\n\n- For all children v of u, collect all nodes in their subtrees.\n\n- Sort these nodes in descending order of i.\n\n- Select the top (m-1) nodes from this list.\n\n- The optimal subtree is u and these (m-1) nodes.\n\nBut wait, what if u's subtree has fewer than m nodes? That can't happen because m is n-k, and u's subtree is the entire tree.\n\nThus, the algorithm is to select u, and the top m-1 nodes from the union of the subtrees of u's children.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\n1. Read the tree and build an adjacency list.\n\n2. Find the node u with the maximum i.\n\n3. For each child v of u, perform a traversal (like BFS or DFS) to collect all nodes in the subtree of v.\n\n4. Collect all these nodes into a list, sort them in descending order of i.\n\n5. Select the top m-1 nodes from this list.\n\n6. The optimal subtree is u plus these nodes.\n\n7. Remove the other k nodes (",
