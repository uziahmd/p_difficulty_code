He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it's a prefix or suffix of the original string s. Each string is either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S), and I need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's in the order of the input.\n\nHmm, the input has 2n-2 strings, each of which is either a prefix or a suffix of length 1 to n-1. The goal is to assign each one as P or S correctly.\n\nWait, but how? Because some prefixes might overlap with suffixes, right? So I need to find a way to determine which are prefixes and which are suffixes based on the possible string s.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Maybe the key is to figure out the possible candidates for the original string s, then check for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut since the number of possible s is potentially huge, that's not feasible directly. So I need another way.\n\nWait, the problem says that there exists at least one possible string s that fits all the given prefixes and suffixes. So perhaps I can find s by considering the constraints provided by the input.\n\nEach string in the input must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. But the tricky part is that for each length l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo for each length l, we have two options: one is a prefix candidate and the other is a suffix candidate.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for a given l, say l=2, there are two strings: one could be a prefix and the other a suffix. But that's only if l < n, because for l = n, it's the full string.\n\nWait, the problem states that for each l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. These are all the prefixes and suffixes of some string s of length n.\n\nSo for each l, two strings: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo for each l, the two strings must satisfy certain conditions. For example, the prefix of length l-1 must be a prefix of the suffix of length l, or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe I can find the correct s by building it step by step.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible l, the prefix of length l must agree with the suffix of length l in terms of their first l-1 characters. Because the original string s must have a prefix of l and a suffix of l, and their overlapping parts must match.\n\nWait, for example, suppose l is 3. Then the prefix of length 3 is p, and the suffix of length 3 is s. For the original string, the first three characters are p, and the last three are s. So the third character of p must equal the third character of s.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the prefix of length l is a string of length l, and the suffix is a string of length l. So for the overall string s, the first l characters are the prefix, and the last l are the suffix. So the prefix and suffix must agree on their common part. For example, the first l-1 characters of the suffix must match the last l-1 characters of the prefix. Because the entire string s starts with the prefix and ends with the suffix. So the prefix's last l-1 characters must equal the suffix's first l-1 characters.\n\nAh, right! So for each l, the two strings of length l (one prefix, one suffix) must have their overlapping parts equal.\n\nSo for each l, let's take the two strings of that length: one is a prefix candidate, the other is a suffix candidate. We need to choose between them such that for each l, the last l-1 characters of the prefix string equal the first l-1 characters of the suffix string.\n\nBut how do we determine which is which?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe for each l, the two strings must have the property that when you take the suffix of the prefix string (length l-1) and compare it to the prefix of the suffix string (length l-1), they must be equal.\n\nWait, yes. So for each l, the two strings of length l must satisfy that condition. Because the prefix of length l must end with the same l-1 characters as the suffix of length l starts with.\n\nSo for each l, the two possible strings must be such that for each pair, one can be the prefix and the other the suffix, but they must satisfy that the last l-1 of the prefix equals the first l-1 of the suffix.\n\nWait, but for each l, the two given strings are all possible prefixes and suffixes. So for each l, among",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or suffix of the original string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves checking each string against the constraints imposed by their possible positions as either a prefix or suffix.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Prefix-Suffix Constraints**: For each length `l` from 1 to `n-1`, there are exactly two strings. One of these must be a prefix and the other a suffix. The key insight is that the last `l-1` characters of the prefix must match the first `l-1` characters of the suffix.\n2. **Determine Prefix and Suffix**: For each length `l`, we need to check which of the two strings can be the prefix and which can be the suffix based on the above constraint. This ensures that the original string `s` can be constructed consistently.\n3. **Construct Result String**: Once we determine the correct prefix and suffix for each length, we construct the result string where each position corresponds to 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\n# Create a dictionary to hold all strings grouped by their lengths\nlength_dict = {}\nfor s in strings:\n    l = len(s)\n    if l not in length_dict:\n        length_dict[l] = []\n    length_dict[l].append(s)\n\n# Prepare the result string\nresult = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n\nfor l in range(1, n):\n    candidates = length_dict[l]\n    # Try all possible pairs to see which one satisfies the condition\n    for i in range(len(candidates)):\n        prefix = candidates[i]\n        suffix = candidates[1 - i]\n        # Check if the last l-1 chars of prefix match first l-1 of suffix\n        if prefix.endswith(suffix[:-1]):\n            # Assign P to the current candidate and S to the other\n            result[i] = 'P'\n            result[1 + i] = 'S'\n            break\n\n# Convert the list of characters into a string and print\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: We read the input values and store the strings in a list.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: Strings are grouped by their lengths using a dictionary to facilitate easy access.\n3. **Checking Constraints**: For each length `l`, we check each pair of strings to determine if they can be a prefix and suffix by ensuring the necessary overlap condition is met.\n4. **Constructing Result**: Based on the checks, we mark each string as 'P' or 'S' in the result list and then convert this list to a string for output.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the correct positions of each string as either a prefix or suffix by leveraging the constraints provided by their lengths and character overlaps.",
