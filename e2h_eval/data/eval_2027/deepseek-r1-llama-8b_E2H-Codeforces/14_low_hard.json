He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many positive integers n exist such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\nI think the approach is to find the smallest n where Z(n) equals m, and then check if the next numbers also give the same count until it increases beyond m.\n\nWait, but how do I find all possible n's? Because sometimes there might be a range of n's that all have the same Z(n). For example, looking at the sample input, when m=1, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9. So for each of these, Z(n) is 1.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find the lower bound: the smallest n where Z(n) = m.\n2. Find the upper bound: the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n3. Then, all integers between lower and upper (inclusive) are the solutions.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find these lower and upper bounds?\n\nFirst, I'll need a helper function to compute Z(n) given a number. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to find the minimal n where Z(n) is exactly m. But since Z(n) can jump by more than 1 when n crosses a multiple of 5^k, perhaps binary search would be efficient here.\n\nWait, but how does Z(n) behave? It increases as n increases, but not necessarily by 1 each time. For example, when n reaches a multiple of 5, Z(n) might increase by more than one.\n\nSo, for a given m, there could be a range of n's that have Z(n) = m.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n- Use binary search to find the first n where Z(n) >= m.\n- Then, check if Z(n) is exactly m. If not, then no solution exists (output 0).\n- Otherwise, find the next n where Z(n) > m, and all n's between the first and one before that are part of the solution.\n\nWait, but how to find the upper bound? Because after the first n, some higher n's may still have the same Z(n).\n\nFor example, let's say we have n=24. Z(24) is floor(24/5)=4, floor(24/25)=0. So total 4. Then n=25: floor(25/5)=5, floor(25/25)=1, total 6. So Z(25)=6.\n\nWait, that's a jump from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there are no n's, because 5 is not achieved by any n.\n\nBut wait, the sample input says for m=1, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9. Let's compute Z(5): 1. Z(6): 1. Z(7):1. Z(8):1. Z(9):1. Z(10):2. So yes, those n's have Z(n)=1.\n\nSo, the key is to find the minimal and maximal n that satisfy Z(n) = m.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Binary search to find the smallest n_low such that Z(n_low) = m.\n- Then, find the largest n_high such that Z(n_high) = m.\n\nOnce I have n_low and n_high, if they exist, then the count is n_high - n_low + 1. Otherwise, it's zero.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nFirst, write a function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, perform a binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nWait, but wait: the minimal n where count_zeros(n) is equal to m. Or, perhaps, I should find the first occurrence where count_zeros(n) is equal to m, and then find the last occurrence.\n\nAlternatively, the binary search can find the left and right boundaries.\n\nBut how to structure the binary search for the lower bound?\n\nLet me think about the binary search process.\n\nWe can set low=0 and high= something large enough, like 5*m, but perhaps we can calculate a better high.\n\nWait, the maximum possible n for a given m is m",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves finding the smallest and largest \\( n \\) values that satisfy this condition and then counting the integers in this range.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) (factorial of \\( n \\)) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the count of 5s in the prime factors of \\( n! \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that yield exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n   - **Upper Bound**: Find the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\).\n\n3. **Count Valid Numbers**: Once the bounds are found, all integers between these bounds (inclusive) are valid solutions. If no such \\( n \\) exists, the result is zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower_bound(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate, might need to increase if not found\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    # After loop, check if low is correct\n    if count_zeros(low) != m:\n        return None\n    return low\n\ndef find_upper_bound(m, lower):\n    low = lower\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial estimate, might need to increase\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz > m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    # After loop, check if high is correct\n    if count_zeros(high) != m:\n        return None\n    return high\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input_line)\n    \n    # Find lower bound\n    lower = find_lower_bound(m)\n    if lower is None:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Find upper bound\n    upper = find_upper_bound(m, lower)\n    if upper is None:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    count = upper - lower + 1\n    print(count)\n    if count > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper + 1))))\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing up the contributions from multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n- **find_lower_bound Function**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeroes equals \\( m \\).\n- **find_upper_bound Function**: Similarly, uses binary search to find the largest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeroes equals \\( m \\).\n- **solve Function**: Reads input, finds the valid range of \\( n \\), and prints the result. If no valid \\( n \\) exists, it outputs 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of \\( n \\) using binary search, ensuring the solution is both optimal and handles edge cases correctly.",
