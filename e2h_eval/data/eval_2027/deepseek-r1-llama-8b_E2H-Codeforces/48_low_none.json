            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, but there's a twist when the base b is the Roman numeral system (represented by 'R'). Also, each door has four parts: a, either b or R, c, and then some empty part. The key idea is that c in base a needs to be converted into base b, but if b is R, then we have to represent it using Roman numerals instead of standard digits.\n\nHmm. So, the input will give us a and b, and a string representing a number in base a. We need to convert this number into base b, but if b is R, then instead of writing it as digits, we write it using Roman numerals.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\n1. Read the input. The first line contains a and b. The second line is the number c in base a.\n2. If b is 'R', then the conversion is to Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's a regular base conversion.\n3. First, we need to convert the given number from base a to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n4. Then, convert that decimal integer into base b. If b is 10 or less, it's straightforward. But if b is greater than 10, we use letters A-Z for 10-35.\n5. Wait, no. Actually, the problem says that for bases greater than 10, letters are used starting from A=10, B=11, etc. So, for example, if base is 13, then numbers up to 12 can be represented with digits 0-9 and A (10), B (11), C (12). But wait, the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a, which may contain leading zeros. The output should omit leading zeros.\n\nWait, the output must be the integer c in base b, without leading zeros. So, the process is:\n\n- Convert c from base a to decimal (let's call this value N).\n- Convert N to base b, but if b is 'R', then represent N as a Roman numeral.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's see the sample input and output.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\nThe first test case is '10 2\\n1' and the output is '1'. That makes sense because 1 in base 10 is 1 in base 2.\n\nAnother sample input is '16 R\\n5', which outputs 'V'. So, 5 in base 16 (which is 5 in decimal) is represented as V in Roman numerals.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second part of the input is the number c in base a. So, the first sample's first line is a=10, b=2, and c is '1' in base 10. So, converting 1 to base 2 gives '1'.\n\nIn the second sample input, a=16, b=R. So, the number is '5' in base 16, which is 5 in decimal. So, converting 5 into Roman is 'V'.\n\nAnother sample: '5 R\\n4' → output 'IV'. So, 4 in base 5 is 4 in decimal, which in Roman is IV.\n\nWait, wait. How?\n\nWait, perhaps I got the process wrong. Let me re-express:\n\nc is a number in base a. So, the number is c's value in decimal is N = value_of(c in base a).\n\nThen, we have to represent N in base b, where b could be a digit (like 2,3,...,25) or R (meaning Roman numerals).\n\nBut when b is R, N is represented as a Roman numeral, not as digits.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read a, b.\n2. Read c_str, which is a string in base a.\n3. Compute N = int(c_str, base=a)\n4. If b is R:\n   - Convert N to Roman numeral.\n5. Else:\n   - Convert N to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n6. Output the result.\n\nSo, the key functions needed are:\n\n- A function to convert a number from base a (given as a string) to decimal.\n- A function to convert a decimal number to a Roman numeral.\n- A function to convert a decimal number to a given base (as a string, handling bases up to 25 and beyond, using letters as needed).\n\nWait, but how to handle cases where b is more than 10? For example, if a=16 and b=15, then N is in decimal, and we need to represent it in base 15, which uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F (since 15 is base, digits go up to 14, so A=10, B=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to base `b`. The conversion has a special case when `b` is the Roman numeral system (represented by 'R'). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the values of `a`, `b`, and the number string `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: Convert the number string `c` from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to a Roman numeral string using the rules of Roman numerals.\n4. **Base Conversion**: If `b` is a digit, convert the decimal number to the specified base `b` as a string, ensuring no leading zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef int_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder < 10:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    a_b = input_lines[0].split()\n    a = int(a_b[0])\n    b = a_b[1] if len(a_b) > 1 else a_b[0]\n    c_str = input_lines[1]\n    \n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    n = 0\n    for ch in c_str:\n        n = n * a + int(ch, 36)  # 36 is for A=10, etc.\n    \n    if b == 'R':\n        print(int_to_roman(n))\n    else:\n        print(decimal_to_base(n, int(b)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into the components needed for the conversion process.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The function converts the given number string from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and applying base conversion rules.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The `int_to_roman` function converts the decimal number to a Roman numeral string by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values and appending corresponding Roman symbols.\n4. **Base Conversion**: The `decimal_to_base` function converts the decimal number to the specified base, handling bases greater than 10 by using letters for values 10 and above.\n\nThis approach ensures that the number is correctly converted from base `a` to either a regular base or Roman numerals, handling all edge cases efficiently.",
