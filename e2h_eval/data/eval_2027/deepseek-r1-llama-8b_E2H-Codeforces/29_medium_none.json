Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the numeric value modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then there are multiple queries where each query is like \"di → ti\". For each digit di in the current string, replace it with the substring ti. After all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros are ignored when interpreting the number, but wait, no—wait, the note says that leading zeroes are not removed after replacement. Oh right, because in the example, the third sample input ends up as '777', but the replacement steps probably added some zeros which were kept.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: when representing s as a decimal number, ignore leading zeros. But also, if s is empty, it's considered zero. So for the final computation, the string is treated as a number without leading zeros. But during processing, the substitutions can leave leading zeros, which are part of the string but are only stripped at the end.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Process each substitution query in order.\n2. For each character in the current string, replace it according to the latest substitution rules.\n3. Once all substitutions are done, compute the numeric value of the string mod 1e9+7, ignoring leading zeros except when the string is empty.\n\nBut wait, the substitution queries are applied in the order they are given. So each new query may override or add to previous substitutions. So for example, if we have two queries: first replacing '2' with '00', then another replacing '2' with '000', any subsequent replacements of '2' will use the last one. So the processing is in the order of the queries, each potentially modifying the current substitution mappings.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can model this by maintaining a substitution map, which for each digit, tells us what it gets replaced with. Each query updates this map.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So initially, the substitution map is empty. For each query, we take the key (di) and set its value to ti. So if a digit was previously in the map, it gets overwritten by the new query.\n\nWait, but in the example provided:\n\nSample Input:\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nWait, no, looking back, the input seems to be a list of lines, but perhaps it's a single line as input. Wait, no, in the sample input, the first line is the initial string, then the second is n, then n lines of queries.\n\nWait, the first sample input is written as ['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0'], but that's probably not the actual input format. Probably, the input is a single string, with \\n separating the lines.\n\nSo in code, the input is read as:\n\n- The first line is s, which is the initial string.\n- The second line is n, the number of queries.\n- Then, n lines, each being a query of the form \"d→t\".\n\nEach query is processed in the order given. So for each query, the substitution map is updated.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, the substitution map is fixed, and the initial string s is transformed by replacing each digit according to the substitution map.\n\nWait, no: because each substitution is applied in the order of the queries. So for example, if a query comes later, it may change how a certain digit is replaced.\n\nWait, let's think: each query replaces the specific digit di with ti. So if a digit d is in the substitution map, each occurrence of d in the string is replaced with the corresponding ti from the substitution map. So each query overwrites the substitution for a particular digit.\n\nThus, the substitution map should be built by processing each query in order, with later queries overriding earlier ones for the same digit.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Create a dictionary called substitutions, where keys are digits (as characters), and values are the replacement strings.\n\n- For each query, parse di and ti. Add or update the substitution map: substitutions[di] = ti.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, process the initial string s by replacing each character according to the substitution map.\n\nSo for each character c in s:\n\n- If c is in the substitution map, replace it with the corresponding value.\n- Else, leave it as is.\n\nThis gives the final string.\n\nThen, compute the numeric value of this string modulo 1e9+7, treating it as a number. But since the string could be very long (after substitutions), we can't directly compute it as a number due to size constraints. So we need to compute the value modulo 1e9+7 efficiently.\n\nSo how do we compute the numeric value modulo MOD?\n\nWe can process each character of the final string, and for each character, update the result as (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? Because after substitution, the string could start with many zeros, but when converting to a number, those are ignored except if the string is empty.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\nSo, for the final string, after substitution, we need to compute the number as if leading zeros are stripped, except when the string is empty.\n\nSo, for example, if the string is \"00123\", the numeric value is 123.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Process each query to build the substitution map.\n\n2. Apply the substitution map to the initial string s, resulting in a new string t.\n\n3. Compute the numeric value of t as follows:\n\n   a. If t is empty, output 0.\n\n   b. Else, strip leading zeros, then compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, the problem statement says that leading zeros are not removed from the string after substitution. So, during substitution, the leading zeros are preserved. But when the final string is converted into a number, leading zeros are ignored.\n\nSo, for example, if the substitution results in \"000123\", the numeric value is 123.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- After substitution, create t.\n\n- If t is empty, the number is 0.\n\n- Else, strip leading zeros to get the significant part.\n\n- Then compute the integer value of this significant part modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut how to handle large t? Because for t with 1e5 characters, we can't store it as an integer directly.\n\nSo, to compute the modulo, we can process each character of the significant part and compute the mod step by step.\n\nFor example:\n\nmod = 1e9 +7\n\nresult = 0\n\nfor c in significant_part:\n\n    result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % mod\n\nreturn result\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, read the initial string s.\n\nThen read n.\n\nThen read n queries, each of the form di -> ti.\n\nBuild the substitution map.\n\nThen apply substitution to s to get t.\n\nThen process t to compute the numeric value.\n\nWait, but substitution can be done as a function: for each character in s, if it's in the substitution map, replace it with the corresponding string. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nSo for example, if s is '123' and substitution for '1' is 'a', substitution for '2' is 'b', substitution for '3' is 'c', then the result is 'abc'.\n\nSo the substitution for a digit can turn it into a longer string, but each character in that string will be processed in subsequent steps.\n\nWait, no: each substitution is done once per digit in the initial string. Or wait, no: substitution is done per digit in the original string. So for each character in the initial s, check if it's in the substitution map. If yes, replace it with the substitution string. Then, each character in that substitution string is treated as separate characters in the next step.\n\nWait, but substitution is applied all at once. For example, if the substitution is '2' → '12', then each '2' in s becomes '12', which adds two digits.\n\nSo, substitution is a one-time expansion. So, the substitution is applied to each character in the initial s, expanding them into their respective replacement strings, and the resulting concatenated string is t.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nt = ''\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    if c in substitutions:\n\n        t += substitutions[c]\n\n    else:\n\n        t += c\n\nSo, this way, each substitution can expand a single character into multiple characters, which may themselves be subject to further substitutions. But since the substitution map is built based on the order of the queries, and each query only affects the substitution for a single character, this is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution map is built before processing the initial string. So, in the case where a substitution's replacement contains a digit that has been substituted, that replacement won't be processed further.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ns = '22'\n\nQueries:\n\n1. '2' → '3'\n\n2. '3' → '44'\n\nIn the initial substitution map, '2' is mapped to '3', and '3' is mapped to '44'.\n\nProcessing the initial string:\n\nEach '2' is replaced with '3', resulting in '33'.\n\nThen, each '3' is replaced with '44', resulting in '3322'.\n\nWait, but in the substitution map, '2' is mapped to '3' and '3' is mapped to '44'. So during processing, each '2' is expanded to '3', but then that '3' is not expanded again because the substitution for '3' is done in a subsequent step.\n\nWait, no: because the substitution for '3' is in the substitution map, so when the initial '2' is replaced with '3', the '3' in the substitution string will be processed as per the substitution map. So, for example:\n\nOriginal substitution map after both queries:\n\nsubstitutions = {'2': '3', '3': '44'}\n\nProcessing '2' in s:\n\nreplace '2' with '3' → '3'\n\nthen, the '3' in '3' is replaced with '44' → '44'\n\nso the overall result is '44'.\n\nAh, right. So, the substitution is applied recursively.\n\nSo, for each character in the initial string, if it's in the substitution map, we replace it with the corresponding string, and then each character in that string is checked against the substitution map again, and so on, until no more substitutions can be applied.\n\nWait, but that would require a recursive approach, which could be computationally expensive. But given that the maximum length of s is 105, and each substitution can expand a character into, say, up to 105 characters, the total possible length after substitutions is up to 105*105= about 1e4, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but considering that each substitution can be of arbitrary length, the worst case is that each substitution for a digit turns into another substitution, leading to exponential growth. But given the problem constraints (sum of lengths of ti for all queries is 105), the total length after all substitutions would be manageable.\n\nSo, perhaps the substitution should be processed as a replacement that may include other substitutions. So, instead of a single pass, perhaps we need to process the substitutions in a breadth-first manner, until no more substitutions can be applied.\n\nWait, but in our approach, the substitution map is built before processing, so any changes in the substitution map (like adding new substitutions) won't affect the processing of the initial string. Because the substitution map is fixed after all queries have been processed.\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution map is built in the order of the queries, and each query can overwrite a substitution for a digit. So, during the substitution of the initial string, any new substitutions added after a query would not affect the processing of the current string.\n\nWait, no, because substitution is done in a single step: each character in the initial string is replaced by its substitution, which is a fixed string. So, if a substitution leads to a digit that has a substitution, that substitution is already in the substitution map, so during the processing of the initial string, it would be replaced accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think with an example.\n\nSuppose substitution map is:\n\n'2' → '3'\n\n'3' → '44'\n\nAnd the initial string is '222'.\n\nProcessing each '2' would give '3', so the initial substitution would result in '333'.\n\nBut then, each '3' in '333' is replaced with '44', so the final string is '333' → '333' → '44' each '3' becomes '44', so the final string is '333' → '4444'.\n\nWait, no. No, the substitution is done in one pass. So the substitution for '2' is '3', which is a single character. So when processing each '2' in the initial string, it's replaced by '3', and then each '3' in that substitution is replaced by '44', because during the substitution processing, each character in the substitution string is checked against the substitution map.\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution map is built before processing, and the substitution for '3' is known. So when the substitution for '2' is '3', and during the processing of '2', the replacement string is '3', which is then processed as '3' → '44', so the overall substitution for '2' is '44'.\n\nSo in the substitution phase, each character in s is replaced by a string that is itself substituted according to the substitution map.\n\nSo, perhaps the substitution process is equivalent to replacing each character in s with a string, and then each character in that string is again replaced according to the substitution map.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Because each substitution is a fixed string, and each character in that string is replaced according to the substitution map.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each character c in s:\n\n   if c is in substitution map, replace it with substitution[c], then process each character of substitution[c] as per the substitution map.\n\nBut since substitution map is fixed, this can be done in a single pass.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because the substitution can be of any length, and each character in the substitution string can themselves be subject to substitution.\n\nSo, perhaps the substitution is applied recursively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the substitution is processed by expanding each character in s into the substitution string, and then each character in that substitution string is also expanded, and so on, until no more expansions are possible.\n\nBut that could be computationally intensive for some cases, but given the problem constraints, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, each query is processed in order, and each query overwrites a substitution for a specific digit. So, the substitution map is built correctly for all possible substitutions.\n\nSo, during substitution, each digit is replaced according to the substitution map, which may involve multiple substitutions.\n\nWait, but that's not how substitution maps work. For example, suppose substitution map is:\n\na → b\n\nb → c\n\nThen, substituting a would lead to b, which in turn would lead to c.\n\nBut in our model, substitution is done in a single step: the substitution for a is replaced by b, and then the substitution for b is replaced by c.\n\nSo the substitution for a is actually c, not b followed by c.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because in reality, substitution for a would be replaced by b, which is then replaced by c.\n\nBut in our model, when we process the substitution for a, we look up a in the substitution map, find b, and replace a with b. Then, when processing the substitution for b, which is in the substitution map, we replace b with c. So the final string would have each a replaced by bc.\n\nSo, the substitution is done in a way that each substitution can include other substitutions.\n\nThus, the substitution process must be recursive.\n\nSo, the substitution of a digit d is equal to the substitution of the string substitution[d], which may itself contain other substitutions.\n\nTherefore, the substitution must be processed in a way that for each digit, we replace it with its substitution, and then each character in that substitution is processed again.\n\nSo, for example, substitution for a is 'bc', substitution for b is 'd', substitution for c is 'e'.\n\nSo, a is replaced by 'bc', which is then processed: b becomes 'd' and c becomes 'e', so a is ultimately replaced by 'de'.\n\nSo, the substitution must be applied iteratively until no more substitutions can be made.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to represent the substitution as a function that, for a given digit, returns the expanded string, taking into account all possible substitutions.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nPerhaps, for each character in the initial substitution, we can compute the fully expanded version by repeatedly applying the substitution map.\n\nWait, but for a given character, the expansion could involve multiple layers of substitutions.\n\nFor example:\n\ns is 'a'.\n\nsubstitution map:\n\na → 'b'\n\nb → 'cd'\n\nc → ''\n\nd → 'ef'\n\nSo, substituting a would first become 'b', then substituting 'b' becomes 'cd', then substituting each character in 'cd':\n\nc is substituted to '', d is substituted to 'ef'.\n\nSo, the final substitution for a is 'cd' → 'c' is replaced by '' and 'd' is replaced by 'ef', so 'cd' becomes 'ef'.\n\nSo, the final substitution of 'a' is 'ef'.\n\nHmm, so to compute the expansion of a substitution, we have to process it recursively.\n\nThus, for each character in the substitution, we have to substitute it again, and so on.\n\nThis suggests that the substitution is a tree, and the expansion is the concatenation of all the leaves of the substitution tree.\n\nBut implementing this could be time-consuming.\n\nBut given that the maximum initial string is 105 characters, and each substitution can expand into a string of up to 105 characters, the maximum possible recursion depth isn't too bad.\n\nAlternatively, for each character in the substitution, we can compute its fully substituted string, and then concatenate.\n\nWait, perhaps a memoization approach would help. We can memoize the substitution of each character, so that if a character's substitution is already computed, we can just return it.\n\nSo, for example:\n\ndef expand(c):\n\n    if c in memo:\n\n        return memo[c]\n\n    if c not in substitutions:\n\n        memo[c] = c\n\n        return c\n\n    # get the substitution string for c\n\n    sub_str = substitutions[c]\n\n    # expand each character in sub_str\n\n    expanded_sub = ''.join([expand(ch) for ch in sub_str])\n\n    memo[c] = expanded_sub\n\n    return expanded_sub\n\nThis way, each character is expanded recursively, and the substitution is fully resolved.\n\nBut in Python, for the given constraints, this should be manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read s.\n\n- Read n queries, build the substitution map.\n\n- For each character in s, recursively expand it, considering the substitution map.\n\nBut wait, the substitution map may not include all characters, so for any character not in the substitution map, it remains as is.\n\nSo, the substitution function for a character c is:\n\nif c is in substitution map, then replace it with the substitution, and then recursively expand each character in the substitution string.\n\nElse, return c.\n\nThus, the substitution function is:\n\ndef expand(c):\n\n    if c in memo:\n\n        return memo[c]\n\n    if c not in substitutions:\n\n        memo[c] = c\n\n        return c\n\n    sub = substitutions[c]\n\n    expanded_sub = ''.join([expand(ch) for ch in sub])\n\n    memo[c] = expanded_sub\n\n    return expanded_sub\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. Read s, n, and the queries, building the substitution map.\n\n2. For each character in s, expand it using the substitution function, which recursively expands any substitution.\n\n3. Concatenate all the expanded characters to form the final string t.\n\nThen, compute the numeric value of t mod 1e9+7, stripping leading zeros unless t is empty.\n\nBut wait, in the substitution process, the leading zeros are preserved, but when converting to a number, leading zeros are ignored.\n\nSo, after substitution, the final string is t.\n\nWe need to process t as follows:\n\n- If t is empty, output 0.\n\n- Else, remove leading zeros to get the significant string.\n\n- Compute the numeric value of this significant string modulo 1e9+7.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nCompute the significant string:\n\nsignificant = t.lstrip('0')\n\nIf significant is empty, then the number is 0.\n\nElse, compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute the numeric value mod MOD, handling potentially very long significant strings.\n\nTo do this, we can process each character in the significant string, updating the result as:\n\nresult = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n\nSo, even for very long strings, this is manageable.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's outline the code.\n\nRead s.\n\nRead n.\n\nsubstitutions = {}\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    parts = input().split('->')  # split on '->'\n\n    di = parts[0].strip()\n\n    ti = parts[1].strip()\n\n    substitutions[di] = ti\n\nmemo = {}\n\ndef expand(c):\n\n    if c in memo:\n\n        return memo[c]\n\n    if c not in substitutions:\n\n        memo[c] = c\n\n        return c\n\n    sub = substitutions[c]\n\n    expanded_sub = ''.join([expand(ch) for ch in sub])\n\n    memo[c] = expanded_sub\n\n    return expanded_sub\n\nt = ''.join([expand(c) for c in s])\n\n# Now process t to compute the numeric value.\n\nif not t:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    significant = t.lstrip('0')\n\n    if not significant:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        MOD = 10**9 +7\n\n        res = 0\n\n        for c in significant:\n\n            res = (res *10 + int(c)) % MOD\n\n        print(res)\n\nWait, but in the substitution process, the function expand is called for each character in s, which builds t.\n\nBut let's test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nInput:\n\n123123\n1\n2->00\n\nSample Output:\n\n10031003\n\nSo, initial s is '123123', n=1, query is 2->00.\n\nSo substitution map is {'2': '00'}.\n\nProcessing each character in s:\n\n1 → not in substitution, so 1.\n\n2 → substitution is '00', so expand '2' → '00'.\n\n3 → substitution is none, so '3'.\n\n1 → '1'.\n\n2 → '00'.\n\n3 → '3'.\n\nSo t becomes '1' + '00' + '3' + '1' + '00' + '3' → '10031003'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nThird sample input:\n\n222\n2\n2->0\n0->7\n\nSo substitution map:\n\nAfter first query: 2 → '0'\n\nAfter second query: 0 → '7'\n\nSo substitution for 2 is '0', which is then substituted to '7'.\n\nSo expand(2) is expand('0') → expand('7') → '7'.\n\nThus, each '2' becomes '7', so t is '777'.\n\nSo the significant is '777', mod is 777.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\n1000000008\n0\n\nSo substitution map is empty.\n\nThus, t is '1000000008'.\n\nCompute the numeric value:\n\n1000000008 mod 1e9+7 is 1000000008 - (1e9+7) = 1000000008 - 1000000007 = 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: Empty string.\n\nInput: s='', n=0 → output 0.\n\nCase 2: All substitutions result in empty strings.\n\nE.g., s='2', substitution 2→''.\n\nt is empty → output 0.\n\nCase3: s is '0', substitution 0→'0000'.\n\nt is '0000' → significant is '' → output 0.\n\nCase4: substitution chains.\n\ns='a', substitution a→'b', substitution b→'c', substitution c→'d'.\n\nt is 'd'.\n\nCompute mod of d as integer.\n\nAnother case: substitution for a digit leads to a longer substitution which includes another substitution.\n\nThus, the expand function needs to handle this.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Parsing the input correctly.\n\nIn the code, the input is read as:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = int(input())\n\nqueries = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each query, split on '->' to get di and ti.\n\nWait, but the query line could have multiple '->'?\n\nNo, the query is of the form di→ti, where di is a single digit, and ti is a string of digits, possibly empty.\n\nWait, the query is a string like '2->00', so splitting on '->' gives parts = ['2', '00'].\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code correctly parses di and ti.\n\nAnother thing: substitution for a digit can be an empty string. So in the substitution map, a digit can be mapped to an empty string.\n\nTesting:\n\ns='2', substitution 2→'' → t is empty → output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: substitution for a digit includes other substitutions, leading to a longer string.\n\nFor example:\n\nsubstitution:\n\na → 'bcd'\n\nb → 'e'\n\nc → 'f'\n\nd → 'g'\n\nThus, a is expanded to 'bcd' → each of those letters is substituted:\n\nb → 'e', c → 'f', d → 'g' → so 'bcd' becomes 'e fg'? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, substitution for a is 'bcd'.\n\nSo a → bcd.\n\nThen, substitution for b is 'e', substitution for c is 'f', substitution for d is 'g'.\n\nThus, a is replaced by efg.\n\nThus, the expand function correctly handles this.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo, the final code is as outlined.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. The substitutions can be quite complex, involving replacing each digit with potentially another digit or an empty string, which may themselves require further substitutions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Build Substitution Map:** Process each query to build a substitution map where each digit (as a character) maps to its replacement string.\n3. **Expand Substitutions:** For each character in the initial string, recursively expand it using the substitution map. This means that if a character is replaced by another string, each character in that string is also expanded according to the substitution rules.\n4. **Compute Result:** After expanding all substitutions, convert the resulting string into a numeric value, ignoring leading zeros. Compute this value modulo 1e9+7.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = int(input())\nsubstitutions = {}\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    parts = input().strip().split('->')\n    di = parts[0].strip()\n    ti = parts[1].strip()\n    substitutions[di] = ti\n\nmemo = {}\n\ndef expand(c):\n    if c in memo:\n        return memo[c]\n    if c not in substitutions:\n        memo[c] = c\n        return c\n    sub = substitutions[c]\n    expanded_sub = ''.join([expand(ch) for ch in sub])\n    memo[c] = expanded_sub\n    return expanded_sub\n\nt = ''.join([expand(c) for c in s])\n\nif not t:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    significant = t.lstrip('0')\n    if not significant:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        res = 0\n        for c in significant:\n            res = (res * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n        print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The initial string `s` and the number of queries `n` are read from standard input.\n2. **Building Substitution Map:** Each query is processed to build a dictionary where each key is a digit and the value is the string it should be replaced with.\n3. **Expanding Substitutions:** The function `expand` recursively processes each character in the initial string. If a character has a substitution, it is replaced by the corresponding string, and each character in that string is processed similarly until no more substitutions can be applied.\n4. **Computing Result:** After processing all substitutions, the resulting string is converted into a numeric value. Leading zeros are ignored, and the result is computed modulo 1e9+7 to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that all substitutions are applied correctly and efficiently, even when substitutions lead to longer strings or further substitutions. The use of memoization in the `expand` function helps optimize repeated calculations.",
