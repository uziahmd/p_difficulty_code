He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A creates a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So after this step, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C then appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string before C added them. It can also be equal to both.\n\nSo the string after all steps must satisfy several conditions:\n- The order is correct: all 'a's come first, then 'b's, then 'c's.\n- There is at least one 'a' and one 'b' (since B appends some 'b's).\n- The count of 'c's must be equal to the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's.\n\nWait, but wait. When C appends the 'c's, the counts are of 'a's and 'b's in the string after B's step. Because C appends based on the current state before adding 'c's.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nOriginal from A: all 'a's.\nAfter B: some 'a's followed by some 'b's.\nAfter C: same as before, plus some 'c's at the end. The count of 'c's equals the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string up to that point.\n\nSo for a given string S, we need to:\n\n1. Check if it's in the form aaa...bbb...ccc..., meaning no other characters and the order is correct.\n2. Check that there's at least one 'a' and at least one 'b' because B appended some.\n3. Count the number of 'a's (a_count), 'b's (b_count), and 'c's (c_count).\n4. Ensure that c_count is equal to a_count OR b_count. Also, it's allowed to be equal to both.\n\nAdditionally, since C appends the 'c's after B, the entire string must consist of a's, then b's, then c's without any mixing. So the structure must be a sequence of a's, then a sequence of b's, then a sequence of c's.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFirst, split the string into runs of a's, b's, and c's. Each run must consist of only one type of character, and the order must be a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nFor example, if the string starts with a, then switches to b, then to c — that's okay. But if after a comes c without any b's, that's invalid because B would have added some b's.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the process is:\n\nA adds a's, then B adds b's, so after B, the string has a's followed by b's. Then C adds c's, so the final string is a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo any other order is invalid. Like, if the string has a 'c' before a 'b', that's impossible. So the entire string must consist of a's, then b's, then c's in that exact order, with each section non-empty except possibly none? Wait no. Because in the process:\n\nA adds some a's — so count_a >=1.\n\nB adds some b's — so count_b >=1.\n\nC adds some c's — count_c >=1.\n\nWait, wait, no. The problem statement says that after B gives it to C, C appends some number of 'c's. It doesn't say that the count_c has to be at least 1. But looking back at the note: \"It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\" So perhaps the string could have zero 'c's? Or not?\n\nWait, no. Because C appends some number of 'c's. So if C appends zero 'c's, then the string after C is the same as after B. But according to the note, the string given to us has at least one 'a' and one 'b' because B appends some 'b's. So in our case, the string could have zero 'c's? Or is that possible?\n\nWait, no. Because C appends some number of 'c's. So the count_c must be >=0? Or is it possible for C to add zero 'c's? The problem statement says \"appends some number of letters 'c'\". The term \"some\" usually implies at least one, but in programming problems sometimes it can mean zero or more. Hmm. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement: C appends some number of letters 'c'. It is possible that the number is zero? No, because the problem says \"some\", which suggests at least one. Or wait, maybe not. Let me see the note: in the first example, the count of 'c's is equal to the count of 'a's, which was 3.\n\nBut the problem says that it's possible that the number of 'c's is equal to both. So perhaps C can choose to add zero 'c's. Wait, no, because in that case, the string after C would be the same as after B, which may not satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\nSo, the number could be zero, but then the string after C would have zero 'c's. But in that case, the original string would have to have some 'c's before that step. Wait, no: if C appends zero 'c's, then the string remains as it was after B.\n\nBut according to the process, after B, the string is a's followed by b's. So after C, the string is a's, then b's, then some c's (possibly zero). But wait, when C appends zero 'c's, does that mean that the string is a's followed by b's, and then nothing? So the string is just a's followed by b's, without any c's.\n\nIs that allowed? Because the problem says that the string is given to C, and C appends some 'c's. If C appends zero, then the string after C is the same as after B.\n\nBut in that case, the string would consist of a's followed by b's, with no c's. So for such a case, the count_c is zero. But according to the conditions, the count_c must be equal to a_count or b_count. So zero must be equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nBut since a_count is at least 1, and b_count is at least 1, zero can't be equal to either. So in that case, the count_c can't be zero.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. So let's think: when C appends 'c's, the number can be zero? Or is it that C must append at least one 'c'? The problem statement says \"appends some number of letters 'c'\". Usually, \"some\" implies at least one, but I'm not sure. Let me look at the examples.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nIn the third example, the string is 'aabc'. Let's see:\n\nThe string is 'aa' followed by 'b' followed by 'c'.\n\nSo a_count = 2, b_count = 1, c_count = 1.\n\nC appends 1 'c', which is equal to the number of 'b's (1).\n\nSo the sample output is 'YES'.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 'bbacc'.\n\nWait, the string is 'bbacc' — let's parse it.\n\nBreaking it down: 'bba cc' — no, wait, the string is 'bbacc' — the first two are 'b's, then 'accc'? Or wait, the string is 'b','b','a','c','c' — that's incorrect because after 'b's come 'a's, which is not allowed. So the order is wrong, hence output is 'NO'.\n\nSo for the code, the string must be in the form a^+ b^+ c^+ — but wait, no, because C could choose to append zero 'c's. But earlier analysis suggests that if C appends zero 'c's, then the string would have no 'c's, but then count_c is zero, which must be equal to a_count or b_count. Since a_count and b_count are at least 1, zero can't be equal to either. So C must have appended at least one 'c'. Therefore, the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\nSo for the code, the string must have at least one 'a', at least one 'b', and at least one 'c'. Otherwise, it's automatically invalid.\n\nSo the first step is to check the string for the correct order.\n\nHow to do that:\n\nWe can iterate through the string and make sure that the order is a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nEach character after the first must be the same as the previous until a switch occurs. The switch can only happen once from a to b, and once from b to c.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n'aaaabbbbc' is okay.\n\n'aaabbbba' is invalid because after the b's, another a comes.\n\nSimilarly, 'aabbaa' is invalid.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Split the string into groups of consecutive same characters.\n\n2. The groups must be of types a, then b, then c. Only one group each, in that order.\n\n3. So the groups must be exactly three: a, b, c.\n\nIf the groups are less than three, like just a and b, then it's invalid because C must have added c's.\n\nWait, no. Because C could add zero 'c's, but earlier reasoning suggests that in that case, the count_c is zero, which can't satisfy the condition. So the string must have at least one 'c'.\n\nSo, the groups must be a, b, c, each present at least once.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can process the string, create a list of the runs.\n\nFor example, 'aaabbbc' would have runs ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n\nIf the runs are not exactly three, or if they are not in the order a, then b, then c, the string is invalid.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- 'aabbaabbc' → runs are [a, b, a, b, c] → invalid.\n\n- 'abbcca' → runs are [a, bb, c, a] → invalid.\n\n- 'aabbaaccc' → runs are a, b, a, c → invalid.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\n- Check that the string is a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's, each appearing at least once.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, we proceed.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of a's, b's, and c's.\n\nLet a_count = number of a's.\n\nb_count = number of b's.\n\nc_count = number of c's.\n\nThen, check whether c_count is equal to a_count OR b_count.\n\nIf yes, output 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nAlso, we need to ensure that a_count >=1 and b_count >=1 and c_count >=1.\n\nBecause:\n\n- A adds some a's, so a_count is at least 1.\n\n- B adds some b's, so b_count is at least 1.\n\n- C adds some c's, so c_count is at least 1.\n\nWait, no. Because C appends some number of 'c's, which could be zero. But earlier reasoning suggested that if C appends zero, then the count_c is zero, which can't satisfy the condition. So perhaps the code must have c_count >=1.\n\nSo, during processing, if any of a_count, b_count, or c_count is zero, the string is invalid.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the correct order of a's, then b's, then c's, with each part present at least once.\n\n   - How? By splitting into runs.\n\n   For example:\n\n   Initialize runs as empty list.\n\n   current_char = first character.\n\n   For each subsequent character:\n\n      if same as current_char, continue.\n\n      else:\n\n          add current_char to runs.\n\n          current_char = new char.\n\n   After loop, add the last current_char to runs.\n\n   Then, runs must be exactly ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n\n   Also, the runs must be exactly three, and each must be unique.\n\n   So, if len(runs) !=3, it's invalid.\n\n   Also, the runs must be in order a, b, c.\n\n   So runs[0] == 'a', runs[1] == 'b', runs[2] == 'c'.\n\n   If any of these is not true, invalid.\n\n2. Compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\n   a_count is the number of 'a's.\n\n   Similarly for others.\n\n3. Check if a_count >=1, b_count >=1, c_count >=1.\n\n   Because each step adds at least one.\n\n4. Check if c_count == a_count OR c_count == b_count.\n\n   If yes, output 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this.\n\nImplementing the runs:\n\nWe can loop through the string, tracking the current run.\n\nInitialize run_list as empty.\n\nprev_char = None.\n\nfor char in s:\n\n    if char == prev_char:\n\n        continue\n\n    else:\n\n        if prev_char is not None:\n\n            run_list.append(prev_char)\n\n        prev_char = char\n\nif prev_char is not None:\n\n    run_list.append(prev_char)\n\nWait, no. Because if the string is empty, this will append None. But the string is non-empty because the length is >=1.\n\nSo, for example, s = 'aabbaa', run_list will be ['a', 'b', 'a'].\n\nSo, in code:\n\nrun_list = []\n\ncurrent = s[0]\n\nfor c in s[1:]:\n\n    if c != current:\n\n        run_list.append(current)\n\n        current = c\n\nrun_list.append(current)\n\nThen, check len(run_list) ==3, and run_list[0] == 'a', run_list[1] == 'b', run_list[2] == 'c'.\n\nIf not, return 'NO'.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nCompute counts:\n\na_count = s.count('a')\n\nb_count = s.count('b')\n\nc_count = s.count('c')\n\nCheck a_count >=1, b_count >=1, c_count >=1.\n\nIf any is zero, 'NO'.\n\nElse, check if c_count is equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nIf yes, 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nPutting this into code.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the run_list has more than 3 elements? Like, for example, 'aabbaabba' — the run list would have ['a', 'b', 'a', 'b', 'a'], which is longer than 3, so it's invalid.\n\nSo the code correctly returns 'NO' for such strings.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nRuns: ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n\na_count=3, b=1, c=3.\n\nc_count == a_count (3), so YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc'\n\nProcessing:\n\ns = 'bbacc'\n\nrun_list:\n\nStart with 'b'.\n\nSecond character is 'b' → same.\n\nThird is 'a' → different. Add 'b' to run_list. Now current is 'a'.\n\nFourth is 'c' → different. Add 'a' → run_list is ['b', 'a']. current is 'c'.\n\nFifth is 'c' → same.\n\nAt end, add 'c' → run_list is ['b','a','c'].\n\nBut the run_list is ['b','a','c'], which is not in the order a,b,c. So it's invalid. So output is 'NO'.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc'\n\ns = 'aabc'\n\nrun_list:\n\ncurrent is 'a' → next is 'a' same.\n\nNext is 'b' → different. Add 'a' → run_list is ['a'].\n\ncurrent is 'b' → next is 'c' → different. Add 'b' → run_list is ['a', 'b'].\n\ncurrent is 'c' → end, add 'c' → run_list is ['a', 'b', 'c'].\n\nSo valid.\n\na_count=2, b=1, c=1.\n\nc_count is 1. Is it equal to a_count (2) or b_count (1)? Yes, equals b_count. So output 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → a_count=1, b=3, c=1.\n\nc_count=1, which is equal to a_count. So output 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcc' → a_count=1, b=1, c=2.\n\nc_count is 2, which is equal to neither. So output 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → a=1, b=1, c=1. So c_count=1 equals a and b. So 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbbccc' → a=2, b=3, c=3. c_count=3 equals b_count. So 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabbbccc' → a=3, b=3, c=3. So c_count=3 equals a and b. So 'YES'.\n\nAnother case: 'a' → a_count=1, but no b or c. So invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abcab' → runs are a, b, c, a, b. So invalid.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nWe'll read the input string S.\n\nFirst, check if the string is non-empty. Since the problem says the length is at least 1, but for the code, perhaps it's better to handle it.\n\nBut given the constraints, we don't need to worry about empty strings.\n\nThen, compute the run_list.\n\nIf run_list is not exactly three, or the first two runs are not a and b, then output 'NO'.\n\nElse, compute a_count, b_count, c_count.\n\nCheck all counts >=1.\n\nThen, check if c_count equals a_count or b_count.\n\nIf all conditions met, output 'YES', else 'NO'.\n\nSo, in Python code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nif len(s) == 0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    # compute run_list\n\n    run_list = []\n\n    current = s[0]\n\n    for c in s[1:]:\n\n        if c != current:\n\n            run_list.append(current)\n\n            current = c\n\n    run_list.append(current)\n\n    # check run_list\n\n    if len(run_list) !=3:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        if run_list[0] != 'a' or run_list[1] != 'b' or run_list[2] != 'c':\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            a_count = s.count('a')\n\n            b_count = s.count('b')\n\n            c_count = s.count('c')\n\n            if a_count ==0 or b_count ==0 or c_count ==0:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n            else:\n\n                if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n                else:\n\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but wait. What about when the run_list is longer than 3? Like 'aabbaabba' which would have a run_list of ['a','b','a','b','a'].\n\nIn that case, len(run_list) is 5, which is not 3, so the code correctly outputs 'NO'.\n\nWhat about a string that is 'abba' → run_list is ['a', 'b', 'a'], which is len 3, but run_list[0] is 'a', run_list[1] is 'b', run_list[2] is 'a' → which is not 'c', so code outputs 'NO'.\n\nAnother edge case: 'acb' → run_list is ['a','c','b'] → len 3, but run_list[1] is 'c' which is not 'b', so invalid.\n\nAnother edge case: 'cba' → run_list is ['c','b','a'] → len 3, but first run is 'c' → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → run_list is ['a','b'], len 2 → invalid.\n\nAnother case: 'abcabc' → run_list is ['a','b','c','a','b','c'] → len 6 → invalid.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'aaabccc' → run_list is ['a','b','c'].\n\na_count=3, b=1, c=3.\n\nc_count=3 == a_count → 'YES'.\n\nSample 2: 'bbacc' → run_list is ['b','a','c'] → which is not in a,b,c order → 'NO'.\n\nSample3: 'aabc' → run_list ['a','b','c'] → a_count=2, b=1, c=1 → c_count=1 equals b_count → 'YES'.\n\nAll samples pass.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → run_list correct, a=1, b=1, c=1. c_count equals both → 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → run_list is ['a','b','a'] → len 3, but third element is 'a' not 'c' → 'NO'.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabba' → run_list is ['a','b','a'] → same as above.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → run_list ['a','b','c'], a=1, b=3, c=1 → c_count=1 equals a_count → 'YES'.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcdd' → but the input can't have 'd's as per problem statement. So we don't need to handle that.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nPotential optimizations: Since the maximum string length is 5000, the code's time complexity is acceptable.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending certain characters in a specific order.
