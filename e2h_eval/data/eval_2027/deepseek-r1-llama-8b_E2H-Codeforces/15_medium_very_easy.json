They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find all winning integers x such that there's a permutation p of 1 to 2^n where the team with skill x becomes the champion. The tournament structure is a knockout style, and each phase has certain rules based on the string s.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the tournament has n phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one remains. For each phase i (starting from 0?), the games are structured in a certain way. Wait, the description says that for phase i, the number of games is 2^(n-i). So phase 0 has 2^n games, phase 1 has 2^(n-1) games, etc., down to phase n-1 with 1 game.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck: the first phase has 2^{n-1} games. So when n=3, phase 0 has 4 games, then phase 1 has 2 games, phase 2 has 1 game. So the string s has length n, and each character corresponds to a phase. So for phase 0, it's the first phase with 2^{n-1} games, phase 1 is the next with 2^{n-2}, and so on until phase n-1.\n\nEach phase has a rule determined by s[i]. If s[i] is '0', then in each match of that phase, the lower-skilled team wins. If it's '1', the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nThe task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x can be the champion.\n\nHmm. So I need to model the tournament process and see for which x it's possible for them to win all their matches.\n\nLet me think about how the tournament proceeds.\n\nEach round, the teams are paired into groups. The pairing depends on the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first phase, the teams are paired as 1 vs 2, 3 vs4, etc. Then, the winners of those pairs form the next phase's participants, but how exactly? Oh, wait, in the second phase, the winner of 1 vs 2 plays against the winner of 3 vs4, and so on.\n\nSo the structure is a binary tree. Each node represents a game, and the leaves are the initial pairings. The root is the final game that determines the champion.\n\nSo each x needs to be able to win all the games along its path from the leaf up to the root.\n\nSo for x to become champion, in each round it must defeat its opponent, which depends on the rules of each phase.\n\nThe key here is to model the tournament as a binary tree, and for each x, determine if there's a way to arrange the teams in the tree such that x can reach the top by winning each required match according to the phase rules.\n\nBut since the permutation p is variable, we can choose which teams meet in each match, as long as the outcome is consistent with the rules and the chosen permutation.\n\nWait, but the permutation determines the skills of the teams. So the structure of the tournament is fixed, but the assignment of teams to each node can vary, as long as the tournament's phase rules are satisfied.\n\nWait no, the tournament structure is fixed. The initial pairings are in the first phase, then the winners are combined in a certain way for the next phase, etc. So the exact opponents in each round depend on the initial pairing and the outcomes.\n\nBut since the permutation can be chosen, perhaps the key is to model the necessary constraints on the relative strengths of x and others.\n\nSo, for x to win the tournament, it must be possible to arrange the other teams in such a way that in each game x participates, it meets the right opponents and defeats them according to the phase rules.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled with some kind of binary decision tree, where each phase imposes certain constraints on the ordering of the teams.\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that the tournament is equivalent to a single-elimination bracket, where each round's matches are determined by the structure. The order in which teams are placed in the bracket affects who they face in each round.\n\nBut considering all possible permutations is computationally infeasible for n up to 18, so we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each phase, the way the teams are grouped depends on the phase's level. For example, phase 0 (the first phase) has groupings of two consecutive numbers. Phase 1 groups four consecutive numbers into two groups of two, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the tournament can be viewed as a complete binary tree with height n. Each non-leaf node represents a game. The leaves are the initial matches, and each internal node represents the match between the winners of its two children.\n\nSo for x to be the champion, it must win all the games along the path from the leaf to the root.\n\nIn each game, whether x wins depends on the phase's rule and the skill of x and its opponent.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to determining whether x can be arranged such that in every match it participates in, it can defeat its opponent according to the rules, given the permutation.\n\nBut how do the phase rules affect the arrangement?\n\nLet me consider each phase:\n\nPhase i (starting from 0) has 2^{n - i - 1} games, each of which produces a winner. The winners proceed to the next phase.\n\nWait, no. For phase i, the number of games is 2^{n - i - 1}? Or maybe I'm getting the phases wrong.\n\nWait, the tournament has n phases. The first phase has 2^{n-1} games, then phase 2 has 2^{n-2} games, down to phase n-1 with 1 game.\n\nSo for phase i (0-based), the number of games is 2^{n - i - 1}. Because for i from 0 to n-1: 2^{n-1 -i} games.\n\nYes.\n\nEach phase i corresponds to a certain level in the tournament tree. The games in phase i are the matches that occur at that level, grouping the winners from phase i-1 into pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nIn phase 0, the first phase, the teams are grouped into 2^{n-1} games, each consisting of two consecutive teams. So phase 0 is the first set of matches.\n\nThen, phase 1 consists of 2^{n-2} games. Each game is between the winners of two adjacent games from phase 0.\n\nWait, no. Because phase 0 has 2^{n-1} games, which would produce 2^{n-1} winners. Then phase 1 will group these 2^{n-1} winners into 2^{n-2} games, each consisting of two consecutive winners from phase 0.\n\nSo, for example, the first game of phase 1 is the winners of game 0 (1v2) and game 1 (3v4), and so on.\n\nSo, the structure is that in each phase i, the games are formed by taking consecutive pairs from the previous phase's winners.\n\nThus, the tournament can be seen as a binary tree where each node has two children (the two games that feed into it).\n\nSo, each team's journey through the tournament can be represented by a path from a leaf (a game in phase 0) up to the root (the final game).\n\nSo, for a particular x to win, it must be possible to arrange the permutation such that in each of the games along x's path, x wins according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut how does the phase's rule influence the required ordering of the teams?\n\nEach phase i has a rule s[i], which determines whether the stronger or weaker team wins.\n\nWait, phase i is the i-th phase, starting from 0. So for each phase, the rule applies to all the games in that phase.\n\nSo, during phase i, each game's outcome depends on whether s[i] is 0 or 1.\n\nIf s[i] is 0, then in each game, the lower-skilled team wins. So in that case, the winner is the weaker of the two.\n\nIf s[i] is 1, the higher-skilled team wins.\n\nSo, for x to win all its matches, in each phase's game that x is involved in, x must either be the higher-skilled or the lower-skilled team, depending on s[i].\n\nHmm. So, for each phase i, the rule s[i] dictates whether the winner is the higher or lower skilled.\n\nThus, for x to win in phase i's game, when x is playing against another team y, then:\n\nif s[i] is 0: y must be less skilled than x (since the lower-skilled team wins)\nif s[i] is 1: y must be higher skilled than x (so x loses, but wait, wait. No, wait—if s[i] is 1, the higher-skilled team wins. So if x is higher-skilled than y, x wins; else, y wins.\n\nWait, no. If s[i] is 1, then in the game, the higher-skilled team wins. So for x to win that game, x must be higher-skilled than y.\n\nBut if s[i] is 0, then the lower-skilled team wins. So for x to win, y must be higher-skilled than x.\n\nSo, for each phase i, any game that x is involved in requires that x's opponent in that game has a certain skill level relative to x.\n\nNow, the problem is to arrange the permutation p such that in each game along x's path, the above condition is satisfied.\n\nBut the structure of the tournament is fixed. So the opponents in each game for x are determined by the initial pairings and the prior results.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is variable. So we can arrange the initial pairings and the winners in such a way that x can reach the top.\n\nWait, but the initial pairings are fixed as per the tournament's structure. Like, in phase 0, the pairings are 1v2, 3v4, etc. So regardless of the permutation p, the initial pairings are in consecutive pairs.\n\nWait, no! Wait, no—p is a permutation of the team skills. So the actual team numbers don't matter, only their skills. So, the initial pairings are 1v2, 3v4, etc., but the teams with these numbers can have any skill levels. So the actual teams that get paired together are determined by their original numbering, but their skill levels can be assigned as per the permutation.\n\nAh, right. So the structure of the tournament is fixed in terms of the initial pairings and how the winners are grouped into the next phase.\n\nSo, for example, in phase 0, the first two teams are 1 and 2, then 3 and 4, etc.\n\nBut the permutation p assigns their skills. So the actual teams that end up in each match are determined by the permutation.\n\nWait, no. The permutation defines the skill levels of the teams, but the initial pairings are based on their team numbers.\n\nSo team 1 is always paired against team 2 in phase 0. But their skill levels are p[0] and p[1], respectively.\n\nSimilarly, team 3 is paired against 4, with skills p[2] and p[3], etc.\n\nSo, the initial pairings are fixed as per the team numbers, but the skills are determined by the permutation.\n\nSo, when considering phase 0, the outcome of each game depends on whether s[0] is 0 or 1, and the relative skills of the two teams in that pair.\n\nSo for each phase, the games are determined by the initial pairings, and the outcomes are determined by s[i] and the current permutation.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be possible to assign the permutation p such that:\n\n1. In each game along x's path, x wins according to the phase's rule.\n\n2. All other constraints are satisfied so that the tournament's outcome leads to x being the champion.\n\nBut how do we model this for each x?\n\nI think the key is to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node represents a game, and each game has a rule (s[i]) for deciding the winner.\n\nFor x to be the champion, it must win all the games on the path from x's leaf node to the root.\n\nBut the path is determined by the tournament's structure. So, for example, for n=3, the structure is:\n\nPhase 0: 4 games, each between consecutive pairs.\n\nPhase 1: 2 games, each between the winners of phase 0's first two games, then the next two, etc.\n\nPhase 2: 1 game, between the winners of phase 1's two games.\n\nSo, x's path depends on where it starts in the initial phase.\n\nWait, but in the initial phase 0, the team with skill x could be in any of the 2^{n} positions, but in each case, it's part of a pair. So, for example, in phase 0, the team could be in a pair (a, b), and the outcome depends on s[0].\n\nSo, for each possible position of x in the initial phase, we can model the required constraints on the permutation.\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, trying all possible positions for x is impossible for each x.\n\nAlternative approach: For each x, determine the minimal set of constraints that must be satisfied by the permutation p for x to be the champion.\n\nEach phase i contributes a constraint on x's relative strength compared to some other teams.\n\nWait, let's model this as a set of inequalities. For each phase, x must have a certain relationship with the teams it faces in that phase.\n\nBut the problem is that the opponents in each phase are determined by the outcomes of earlier phases.\n\nWait, but perhaps the constraints can be built incrementally.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that for each phase i, and for each possible 'side' of the bracket, we can model the required ordering of the teams that must pass through that side to reach the final.\n\nBut this might get complicated.\n\nAnother approach: Since the tournament is a binary elimination tree, the champion must come from a specific subset of the initial participants. For each phase i, the possible participants are those that have won all their previous games.\n\nBut again, modeling this seems difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the tournament can be viewed as a series of rounds, each imposing certain constraints on the permutation.\n\nEach phase i has a rule s[i]. So, for x to win all its matches, it must satisfy certain conditions based on the s[i] values along its path.\n\nLet me try to model the constraints step by step.\n\nIn the last phase (phase n-1), there's only one game. So x must be the winner of that game, which means that x must be the highest-skilled team among the two participants in that game.\n\nThe two participants in the last phase are the winners of the previous phase's two games.\n\nSo, to get to the last phase, x must have been the winner of phase n-2's game. Similarly, to get there, x must have won the phase n-2's game, which depends on the s[n-2] value.\n\nBut the problem is that the structure of the tournament requires that x's path through the brackets must involve certain other teams, which in turn impose constraints on the permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a bitmask, where each bit represents a team, and the constraints are the relationships between x and certain other teams.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a binary heap. Each node has two children, representing the two games that lead to it. So, for each node in the heap, the winner comes from the winners of the left and right subtrees.\n\nBut the key is to model the constraints imposed by each phase's rule on the path from x to the root.\n\nLet me try to model it for a small n.\n\nSuppose n=1. Then, s is a single character.\n\nIf s[0] is '0', then the lower-skilled team wins. So the champion is the team with the lower skill. So the only possible x is 1 (if p[0]=1 and p[1]=2, then x=1 wins). But wait, wait. Wait, for n=1, the tournament is just one game. So the champion is the winner of that game.\n\nSo, if s[0] is '0', the champion is the lower-skilled team, so the permutation p must have the lower number as the champion. So possible x is 1.\n\nIf s[0] is '1', the champion is the higher-skilled team, so x can be 2.\n\nWait, but in this case, for n=1, the output would be x=1 if s[0] is 0, and x=2 if s[0] is 1.\n\nBut the sample input shows more complex cases.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should think in terms of the maximum possible x, but the problem requires finding all possible x that can be the champion under some permutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to model for each phase i, the required ordering of the teams that must be in the subtree leading to x.\n\nFor example, in phase i, if s[i] is '0', then in each game, the lower-skilled team wins. So, the winner of phase i's game must be the lower-skilled of the two teams.\n\nThis implies that in the subtree leading to x, all the teams must be arranged such that x is the lowest-skilled in each of its games up to that point.\n\nWait, no. Because in phase i, the games are played in groups of 2^{n-i} games. So each group of 2^{n-i} teams is split into 2^{n-i-1} games, each with two teams.\n\nSo, for each game in phase i, if s[i] is '0', the winner is the lower-skilled. So, in each such game, the winner must be the lower-skilled of the two.\n\nSo, for x to be the winner of phase i's game, x must be the lower-skilled than its opponent in that game.\n\nIf s[i] is '1', then x must be the higher-skilled than its opponent.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the constraint is:\n\nif s[i] == '0': x < opponent\nif s[i] == '1': x > opponent\n\nNow, the question is, how do these constraints chain together for x's entire path through the tournament.\n\nMoreover, each phase i's game is part of a larger grouping. So, for x to win in phase i, it must also have won in all previous phases.\n\nWait, but each phase's games are played in order, and the winners proceed to the next phase.\n\nSo, for x to reach phase i, it must have won all the previous phases' games.\n\nSo, the constraints build up as x must satisfy certain inequalities with multiple other teams.\n\nLet me think recursively.\n\nAt each phase, the constraints are added based on the phase's rule and the required opponent in that phase.\n\nBut how are the opponents determined? They depend on the prior phases' outcomes.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to represent the constraints in terms of ranges. For example, in phase 0, each game is a pair, and the winner must be either the higher or lower depending on s[0].\n\nThen, in phase 1, each game is between two phase 0 winners, and similarly, their relative skills must satisfy s[1]'s rule.\n\nBut building this recursively is tricky.\n\nAn alternative idea is to model the tournament as a binary decision tree, where each node is a game, and each edge represents the winner moving up.\n\nWe can represent the path x takes through the tree, collecting constraints on the permutation.\n\nFor example, in phase 0, x is in some game. Depending on s[0], x must be lower or higher than its opponent. That gives a constraint.\n\nThen, in phase 1, x's opponent is the winner of another phase 0 game, which depends on s[1] and the same logic.\n\nSo, for each phase, the constraints on x and its opponent(s) are added.\n\nBut how do I model this for all possible paths?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to ensuring that x is in a certain position within a certain subset of the teams, determined by the phase rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution involves computing the minimum and maximum possible x that can be the champion, and then all x in between that can be achieved.\n\nWait, but the permutation is arbitrary, so perhaps the constraints allow for a range of x's.\n\nWait, perhaps for each phase i, the rule s[i] imposes a certain direction on the ordering of the teams in that phase's games.\n\nThese directions can be thought of as forcing x to be on a certain side of the bracket, which in turn affects the possible opponents in higher phases.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node is a game, and the leaves are the initial pairings. The root is the final game.\n\nEach game has two children, which are the two sub-games that feed into it.\n\nFor x to win, it must win all the games along the path from x's leaf to the root.\n\nEach game along this path imposes a constraint on x's relative skill to its opponent in that game.\n\nSo, for each game in x's path, if the phase's rule is s[i], then:\n\n- s[i] = 0: x's opponent in this game must have a higher skill than x.\n- s[i] = 1: x's opponent in this game must have a lower skill than x.\n\nWait, because in phase i, the rule determines how the winner is decided.\n\nSo, for each game that x must win, the opponent must be either higher or lower than x, based on s[i].\n\nBut how do these constraints cascade?\n\nLet me model this with an example.\n\nTake n=2, s = \"10\".\n\nPhase 0: two games, each pair is 1v2 and 3v4. Rule is s[0] = '1' (higher wins).\n\nPhase 1: one game, which is the winners of the two phase 0 games. Rule is s[1] = '0' (lower wins).\n\nSo, for x to be champion, it must win both phase 0 and phase 1 games.\n\nIn phase 0, x is in one of the two initial games. Suppose x is in the first game (1v2). Since s[0] is '1', x must be higher than its opponent. So, if x is in game 1, then p[0] > p[1].\n\nThen, in phase 1, x's opponent is the winner of the second phase 0 game. Let's say that x wins phase 0, then in phase 1, x must face the winner of 3v4.\n\nIn phase 1, s[1] is '0', so x must be lower than its opponent in that phase.\n\nSo, x must be less than the winner of phase 0's second game.\n\nBut the winner of phase 0's second game is determined by s[0] = '1', so in that game, the higher-skilled team wins. So, if the second game is between 3 and 4, the higher of p[2] and p[3] wins.\n\nSo, x must be less than that winner.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nx must be greater than p[1] (from phase 0), and less than max(p[2], p[3]) (from phase 1).\n\nAlso, the permutation p is [p0, p1, p2, p3], where p0 is the winner of 1v2, p1 is the loser, p2 is the winner of 3v4, p3 is the loser.\n\nBut since x is the champion, x must be p0 or p2.\n\nWait, no. Because x is either p0 or p2, depending on which phase 0 game it was in.\n\nWait, but x can be any team except those eliminated in the initial phases.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things.\n\nAn alternative approach is to note that the constraints form a hierarchy of required inequalities.\n\nEach phase i adds a constraint on x's relation to some other team, which in turn may require x to be in a certain order with other teams.\n\nThese constraints can be represented as a directed graph, where edges represent 'must be less than' or 'must be greater than' relationships.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to checking if x can be the maximum or minimum in this DAG, depending on the constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: the tournament can be considered as a series of layers, each layer adding certain constraints. The earliest phase (phase 0) has the broadest impact, as it determines which teams proceed to the next phase.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to compute, for each phase, the required ordering of the teams that x must have with respect to certain other teams, and then combine these to find the overall constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe it's helpful to think in terms of the minimal and maximal x that can be the champion.\n\nWait, in some cases, x must be the highest possible, while in others, the lowest.\n\nBut the permutation is completely flexible, so perhaps x can be any number that satisfies all the necessary constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to model for each x whether it can be the champion by checking if there exists a permutation where x can satisfy all the phase constraints.\n\nBut with n up to 18, trying all x from 1 to 2^18 is manageable, but each check would need to be efficient.\n\nBut even 2^18 is 262,144, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each x in 1..2^n:\n   a. Check if there exists a permutation p such that x can be the champion.\n   b. Collect all such x.\n\nBut how to implement step 1a efficiently.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is a bijection from the team indices to the skill levels. So, for a given x, we need to assign the other teams in such a way that all the phase constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps we can model the constraints as a set of inequalities that x must satisfy, and also ensure that the permutation is a valid permutation.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given x, we can construct a partial order of the other teams based on the phase constraints and the rule s[i].\n\nThen, check if x can be placed at the top of this order.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a binary decision tree, where for each phase, we decide the order of the teams in that phase's games, ensuring that x can proceed.\n\nBut again, this is vague.\n\nAnother approach: Since the initial pairings are fixed as per the team numbers, perhaps we can model the tournament as a binary tree, and for each node, track the required ordering of the two children.\n\nWait, but the initial pairings are team 1 vs 2, 3 vs4, etc., so their positions in the tree are fixed.\n\nSo, perhaps the tournament structure is a fixed binary tree, with leaves being the initial pairs.\n\nSo, for example, for n=3, the initial leaves are (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8). These form the first level of the tree.\n\nThen, the next level up combines the winners of (1,2) with (3,4), and (5,6) with (7,8), and so on.\n\nSo, the tournament tree is fixed in terms of the initial pairings.\n\nSo, for each node in this tree, we can model the constraints on x's path through it.\n\nThus, for x to be the champion, it must win all the games along the path from x's initial leaf to the root.\n\nEach game along this path has a rule s[i], which determines the required relationship between x and its opponent in that game.\n\nSo, for each game along x's path, we can collect the constraint on x's relative skill compared to its opponent in that game.\n\nThese constraints can be represented as inequalities.\n\nFor example, if s[i] is 0, then x must be less than the opponent in that game. If s[i] is 1, x must be greater than the opponent.\n\nBut the opponents in each game are determined by the structure of the tournament tree.\n\nSo, for x's initial leaf, the opponent is known (e.g., for x=5, the opponent is 6 in phase 0).\n\nThen, the winner of that game proceeds to the next phase, where it plays against the winner of another initial pair.\n\nSo, the opponents in higher phases are determined by the structure of the tree.\n\nThus, for each x, the path to the root can be determined, and the constraints for each phase along that path can be collected.\n\nOnce these constraints are collected, it's a matter of checking whether there exists a permutation p where all these constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo, the steps for a given x are:\n\n1. Determine the path from x's initial leaf to the root in the tournament tree.\n\n2. For each phase i along this path, note the rule s[i].\n\n3. For each phase i, determine the opponent in that phase's game.\n\n4. Based on s[i], create a constraint between x and that opponent.\n\n5. After collecting all constraints, check if it's possible to assign the permutation p such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. If yes, x is a winning integer.\n\nSo, the key is to model the constraints for each x and determine if they can be satisfied.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for each x.\n\nEach constraint is an inequality between x and another team. For example, x must be > y or x must be < y, depending on the phase's rule.\n\nMoreover, these constraints must be compatible with each other.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, for each x, collect all the constraints that x must have with other teams, and see if these can be satisfied in some permutation.\n\nBut since the permutation is a bijection, the constraints must form a system that doesn't contradict itself, and allows for x to be placed in a way that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to represent this.\n\nPerhaps we can model the constraints as a directed graph, where each edge represents a 'less than' or 'greater than' relation.\n\nIf any cycles or contradictions are found, x cannot be the champion.\n\nOtherwise, if the graph is a DAG, and x can be placed at the top, then x is a winning integer.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, but the constraints for x are all inequalities involving x and other teams. So, for example, x must be > a, x must be < b, etc.\n\nSo, the constraints can be represented as a set of ordered pairs, indicating that x must be less than or greater than certain other teams.\n\nOnce all these constraints are collected, we can check if there's a permutation that satisfies all of them.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother idea: The constraints can be represented as a partial order. For each x, the constraints define a minimal and maximal possible value that x can take, considering all the required inequalities.\n\nIf the minimal possible value is less than the maximal possible, then it's possible to assign x to a value within that range, provided that the other constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints can be represented as intervals. For each x, after collecting all the constraints, compute the minimal and maximal possible x can be, given the constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using a recursive approach, where for each phase, the constraints on x's opponent are added, and the function returns whether the current state is feasible.\n\nBut with n up to 18, recursion may be too slow.\n\nAlternatively, since the tournament structure is fixed, perhaps the constraints can be precomputed for each x, and then checked for feasibility.\n\nBut again, the details are unclear.\n\nAnother angle: The problem is similar to finding a topological order of the teams, where x is the last element, and all the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to model the constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the constraints can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where each edge u -> v means u must be less than v.\n\nIf this DAG is a DAG, then a topological sort exists. In this case, x can be the maximum in the permutation, provided that all edges go to x.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but for x to be the maximum, all other nodes must be less than x.\n\nBut the constraints may require x to be greater than some and less than others, which is impossible unless there's a cycle.\n\nSo, perhaps the constraints can be represented as a graph where edges are u < v, and for x to be a possible champion, the graph must be a DAG, and x must be the maximum possible node.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constraints can be represented as a graph where edges are either u < v or u > v, and x must satisfy all such constraints.\n\nWait, but in this case, the graph may have cycles, making it impossible.\n\nBut for each x, the constraints are that x must be less than or greater than certain other nodes.\n\nSo, the problem is to determine if these constraints can be satisfied without any contradictions.\n\nThis sounds like a 2-coloring problem, where each constraint enforces a certain relationship, and we need to check if the constraints are satisfiable.\n\nBut again, with n up to 18, the number of constraints could be large.\n\nBut perhaps for each x, the constraints can be represented as a graph, and we can perform a BFS or DFS to detect contradictions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Think about the tournament as a binary tree, and for each node, track the required direction of the edge (i.e., whether the winner is higher or lower).\n\nThen, for x to be the champion, it must be the winner of all the games along its path, which imposes certain constraints on the permutation.\n\nBut how to translate this into a set of inequalities.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node in the tournament tree, we can track the required relationship between the two children and the parent.\n\nFor example, if in a game (left_child, right_child), the rule is s[i], then the winner is either left_child or right_child, depending on whether s[i] is '0' or '1'.\n\nSo, for the parent node, the winner must have a certain relationship with both children.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated.\n\nAn alternative idea: For each node in the tournament tree, represent the set of possible winners that can reach that node, given the phase's rule.\n\nThis can be done via memoization.\n\nFor example, for a leaf node (initial game), the possible winner is determined by s[0].\n\nThen, for each internal node, the possible winners are determined by the possible winners of the two children, and the phase's rule.\n\nBut since the permutation is variable, the actual winners can be any arrangement that satisfies the rules.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, we can compute the set of possible ranks that the winner can have in the permutation, given the constraints up to that node.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, we can track the minimal and maximal possible values that the winner can have, considering the constraints.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, we can compute the possible range of values that the winner can have, given the constraints.\n\nFor a leaf node (initial game), the possible values are either p_i or p_j, depending on s[0].\n\nIf s[0] is '0', the winner is the lower of the two, so the winner's value is min(p_i, p_j). Thus, the possible value is any x where x is less than or equal to p_j.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, we can represent the possible range of values the winner can have, given the constraints.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps it's time to look for hints or think of the problem differently.\n\nWait, considering that the permutation is completely flexible, perhaps the constraints can be satisfied as long as x is in a certain subset of the teams, determined by the phase rules.\n\nBut what's that subset?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the tournament as a binary tree, and for each x, the path from x's leaf to the root imposes a set of constraints.\n\nEach constraint is a comparison between x and some other team.\n\nIf all these constraints can be satisfied without contradiction, then x is a winning integer.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. For each x, determine its path through the tournament tree.\n\n2. For each game along this path, note the phase's rule s[i], which tells whether x must be higher or lower than its opponent.\n\n3. Collect all such constraints.\n\n4. Check if these constraints can be satisfied in some permutation.\n\nBut how to model the constraints.\n\nPerhaps, for each x, the constraints can be represented as a list of inequalities, e.g., x < a, x > b, etc.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to checking if these inequalities can be satisfied by some permutation.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constraints can be represented as a graph where nodes are the other teams, and edges indicate whether they must be less than or greater than x.\n\nIf this graph has no cycles and is a DAG, then a topological order exists, allowing x to be placed appropriately.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the constraints as a graph where each edge u → v means u must be less than v. Then, for x to be the champion, x must be the maximum in this graph, meaning there are no edges pointing to x, and all other nodes have edges pointing to someone else.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: The constraints can be represented as a collection of inequalities that x must satisfy. The minimal x can be is 1, and the maximal is 2^n.\n\nBut the constraints may restrict x to a certain range.\n\nWait, but for each x, the constraints are based on the path through the tournament.\n\nBut perhaps for each x, the constraints can be represented as a set of inequalities, and the minimal and maximal possible x can be determined.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which integers can be the champion of a tournament based on given rules for each phase. The tournament is structured as a knockout style, where each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one remains.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament can be visualized as a binary tree where each node represents a game. The leaves are the initial matches, and each internal node represents the match between the winners of its two children.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (given by a string `s`) that determines whether the higher-skilled or lower-skilled team wins each game.\n3. **Path Constraints**: For a team to be the champion, it must win all games along its path from the leaf to the root. Each game along this path imposes a constraint on the relative skills of the teams involved.\n4. **Constraints Representation**: For each team, we collect constraints based on the phase rules. These constraints are represented as inequalities between the team and others it must face.\n5. **Feasibility Check**: For each team, we check if there exists a permutation of skills that satisfies all constraints derived from the phase rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import product\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    total_teams = 2 ** n\n    #

The leaves are the initial matches, and internal nodes represent subsequent matches.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule that determines the outcome of each game. The rules are applied as constraints on the relative skills of the teams.\n3. **Path Constraints**: For each team, we determine the path it takes through the tournament tree and collect constraints based on the phase rules.\n4. **Graph Representation**: Constraints are represented as a directed graph where edges indicate whether one team must be less than or greater than another.\n5. **Feasibility Check**: The graph is checked for cycles and contradictions. If the graph is a DAG, the team can be the champion under some permutation of skills.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine all possible winning integers by considering the constraints imposed by each phase's rules.",
