Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be used to exactly form two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the guest's and host's names, their letters should exactly match the pile, with no extra letters and no missing ones.\n\nHmm, right. So, the input consists of three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second the host's, and the third is the pile. We need to check if the combined letters of guest and host equal exactly the pile.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, I think the steps are:\n\n1. Combine the guest and host strings into one.\n2. Count the frequency of each letter in this combined string.\n3. Do the same for the pile string.\n4. Compare the two frequency counts. If they're exactly the same, output YES; else, NO.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the core part is comparing the letter counts.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the case where the lengths of the combined guest+host and the pile don't match? Oh right, because if their total number of letters is different, then it's automatically impossible. So maybe the first thing to check is whether the sum of the lengths of guest and host equals the length of the pile. If not, immediately return NO.\n\nThat's a good point. For example, if the guest has 5 letters and the host has 10, total 15. But the pile is only 14 letters, then we can return NO without further processing.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- Read the three lines from input. Let's call them guest, host, pile.\n\n- Check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, print NO.\n\n- Else, proceed.\n\nThen, create a combined string by concatenating guest and host.\n\nNext, count the frequency of each character in both the combined string and the pile.\n\nCompare these two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nIn Python, one way is to use the Counter class from the collections module. Because Counter makes it easy to count the occurrences of each character.\n\nSo, for the combined string, create a Counter. Similarly, create a Counter for the pile string.\n\nThen, compare these two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, because the order doesn't matter. It's all about the counts.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, import Counter.\n\nThen, read the three inputs. Oh wait, the sample input shows that each line is a single string, but the user might have entered them as separate lines. So, in Python, we can read each line via input().strip().\n\nWait, no, in the sample input description, it's written as three lines, each containing the respective strings. So, perhaps, in the code, we'll read them as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nYes.\n\nThen, check len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, print 'NO' and exit.\n\nElse, combine the guest and host into one string: combined = guest + host.\n\nCreate counters:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounter_combined = Counter(combined)\ncounter_pile = Counter(pile)\n\nIf counter_combined == counter_pile, then output 'YES', else 'NO'.\n\nWait, that's straightforward.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, wait, actually, looking at the sample input given, the first line is the guest, the second the host, and the third the pile.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input is written as:\n\nInput\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nBut in reality, the input is three lines, each line being the respective strings.\n\nSo, the first line is the guest's name, the second the host's, the third the pile.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nWait, but wait, the input may contain newlines? Or is each of the three lines a single string, possibly containing newlines?\n\nNo, in the problem statement, the input is three lines, each line is a string without newlines. Because, in the note, it says that each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters. So, the input lines are read as is, including any newlines? Or are the newlines part of the strings?\n\nWait, no. Because in the sample input, the first line is 'SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'â€”but that's just a representation. Wait, no, probably not. Because in the problem statement, the input is three lines, each line is a single string, which may consist of multiple words or parts but without any newlines. So, perhaps, the \\n is part of the string, but in the actual input, each line is a single string, possibly with \\n included.\n\nWait, no. Because the sample input is presented as a list of three elements, each being a string with '\\n' in them. So, in reality, the actual input is three lines, each line being a string, which may include newlines.\n\nWait, but in the context of programming competition problems, usually, the input is read as is, so for example, if a line contains a newline, it will be captured as part of the string.\n\nWait, but in Python, when using input().strip(), it will remove leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines. So, if a line in the input is \"A\\nB\", using input().strip() would give \"AB\".\n\nBut that's incorrect because the actual string should be \"A\\nB\", which is two characters: 'A' and 'B', but separated by a newline.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says that each line is not empty and contains only uppercase Latin letters. So, perhaps the \\n is not present in the input lines.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample input.\n\nLooking back, the sample input is written as:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ... etc.]\n\nWhich seems like each line is a string that includes newlines. But in reality, in the programming competition's input, each of the three lines is a single line, without any embedded newlines.\n\nAh, right! Because in the actual input, each line is a single line, and the \\n in the sample input is just a representation of the line breaks between the three input lines.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is three lines: first line is guest's name, second host's, third pile.\n\nEach line is a string consisting of uppercase letters, possibly with spaces? Or not?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" So, no spaces or other characters except uppercase letters.\n\nWait, no, wait, the problem says, \"contain only uppercase Latin letters.\" So, no spaces, no other characters. So each line is a single string with only letters.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the sample input, the guest's name is 'SANTACLAUS', the host's is 'DEDMOROZ', and the pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'â€”so the guest's name is one word, the host's is another, and the pile is a concatenation of those plus others.\n\nWait, perhaps in the actual input, each of the three lines is a single string, which can consist of multiple letters without any spaces or newlines.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the \\n in the sample is a typo. Or perhaps, in the actual input, each line is a single string, without any embedded newlines.\n\nBecause, in programming competition problems, each input line is read as a separate line, but without any embedded newlines unless specified.\n\nSo, in this problem, the three lines are:\n\nLine 1: guest's name (string S)\nLine 2: host's name (string T)\nLine 3: pile (string U)\n\nAnd S, T, U are each a string of uppercase letters (no spaces, no newlines).\n\nSo, the correct way to read them is:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nRead the three lines as guest, host, pile.\n\nCheck if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, print NO.\n\nElse, combine guest + host into a single string, create a Counter for that and a Counter for the pile. If both Counters are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS (length 10)\nHost: DEDMOROZ (length 8)\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS (length 20)\n\nCombined guest+host length is 18. Pile length is 20. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no.\n\nWait, guest is SANTACLAUS, which is 10 letters. Host is DEDMOROZ, which is 8 letters. So combined, 18 letters.\n\nPile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUSâ€”let me count:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S â†’ that's 19 letters? Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S â†’ S, A, N, T, A, M, O, R, O, Z, D, E, D, C, L, A, U, S â†’ that's 18 letters. Oh right, because SANTACLAUS is 10 letters, DEDMOROZ is 8 letters. So the pile must have 18 letters.\n\nWait, but the sample input's output is 'YES'. So, the code would correctly pass.\n\nAnother sample: the second input in the sample.\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL â†’ length 9\nHost: JOULUPUKKI â†’ length 10\nPile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI â†’ let's see, length 19.\n\nWait, 9+10=19, so the pile's length is 19. So, the code proceeds.\n\nThen, combining guest and host: 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI' â†’ let's count the letters.\n\nNow, the pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' â†’ let's count letters.\n\nWe need to see if the counts match.\n\nIn the problem note, it says that in the second sample, the letter 'P' is missing and there's an extra 'L'. So, the code would detect that the counters are not equal, hence output 'NO'.\n\nSimilarly, the third sample: guest and host combined have a certain count, but the pile has an extra 'L', so the counters differ, output 'NO'.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nWhat if guest is empty? No, problem says each line is non-empty.\n\nWhat if all letters are the same, like guest is 'AAA', host is 'AAA', pile is 'AAAAA'? Then, code would detect that.\n\nAnother edge case: guest is 'A', host is 'A', pile is 'AA' â†’ returns YES.\n\nWhat about when the combined length is zero? No, because each line is non-empty.\n\nAnother case: guest is 'AB', host is 'CD', pile is 'ABCD' â†’ YES.\n\nPile is 'BCDA' â†’ also YES.\n\nWhat about if the pile is 'ACBD' â†’ same letters, so YES.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, considering the code:\n\nWe need to import Counter from collections.\n\nRead the three lines.\n\nCheck if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). Else, print NO.\n\nElse, combine guest and host, make a Counter, compare with pile's Counter.\n\nIf equal, print YES, else NO.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead the three lines.\n\nCheck the sum of their lengths.\n\nCombine guest and host.\n\nCounters.\n\nCompare.\n\nPrint result.\n\nThus, the code should look like this.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given pile of letters can be used to exactly form two names: the guest's name and the host's name. The solution involves checking if the combined letters of the guest's and host's names match exactly with the pile of letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Check Lengths:** Verify if the sum of the lengths of the guest's and host's names equals the length of the pile. If not, print \"NO\" and exit.\n3. **Combine Names:** Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n4. **Count Letters:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each letter in the combined string and the pile.\n5. **Compare Counts:** Check if the counters for the combined string and the pile are identical. If they are, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ntotal_length = len(guest) + len(host)\nif total_length != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    combined = guest + host\n    counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read as three separate strings representing the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Length Check:** This step ensures that the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile, which is a necessary condition for them to be permutations of each other.\n- **Combining Names:** By concatenating the guest's and host's names, we create a string that should contain all the letters from both names.\n- **Counting Letters:** Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined string and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** The comparison of the two counters determines if the letters can be rearranged to form the original names. If they match exactly, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the possibility of forming the names from the pile using letter counts, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
