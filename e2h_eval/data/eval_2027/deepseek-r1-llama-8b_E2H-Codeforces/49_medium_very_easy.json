They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about reconstructing the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on some given roads. Each road has two numbers: the GCD and LCM of the two lawns it connects. My task is to determine if there's a possible arrangement of the mushroom counts that satisfies all these roads, and if so, output any one such arrangement.\n\nHmm. So the input gives me n lawns and m roads. Each road is between two lawns, say u and v, and has GCD(g) and LCM(l). The constraints are that for each pair u-v, the GCD of their mushroom counts must be g, and their LCM must be l.\n\nWait, but what's the relationship between GCD and LCM? Oh right, for any two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So if I know the GCD and LCM for a pair, I can compute a and b up to a multiple.\n\nBut since I'm trying to find possible values for a and b, I need to model this as a system of equations where each equation is a_i * a_j = g_ij * l_ij (since g_ij is the GCD and l_ij is the LCM, so a_i * a_j = g_ij * l_ij).\n\nWait, no. Wait, for any two numbers a and b:\n\na * b = GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b)\n\nYes, that's correct. So for each pair of connected nodes, their product equals g_ij * l_ij.\n\nSo each edge gives an equation: a_u * a_v = g_uv * l_uv.\n\nBut wait, the GCD and LCM could be from different edges, but they might not all agree on the same a values. So the problem reduces to solving a system of multiplicative equations.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled using Union-Find with some additional data structures, perhaps. Because each edge imposes a constraint between two variables.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each node, we can track its value, but since it's multiplicative, perhaps we can represent each variable as a product of primes, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe we can model each variable in terms of a ratio or logarithm, but that could lead to precision issues.\n\nAlternatively, since each equation is a_u * a_v = k, where k is known, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each edge represents a ratio. For example, a_u / a_v = k / (a_u * a_v) ? No, wait, perhaps more accurately, a_u * a_v = k => a_u = k / a_v.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the variables in terms of their products. For example, for each node u, assign a value x_u such that a_u = x_u. Then, for each edge u-v with g and l, the equation is x_u * x_v = g * l.\n\nWait, no. Because GCD(a_u, a_v) is g, which implies that g is the largest number that divides both a_u and a_v. Also, LCM(a_u, a_v) is l, which is the smallest number divisible by both. So a_u and a_v must satisfy:\n\ng = GCD(a_u, a_v)\nl = LCM(a_u, a_v)\nWhich implies:\na_u * a_v = g * l\nand the GCD of a_u/g and a_v/g is 1.\n\nSo, for each edge, the product of the two variables is fixed, but their ratio must also have a GCD of 1 when divided by g.\n\nWait, but how do I model this? Because knowing just the product isn't enough— the individual values must satisfy that their GCD is g.\n\nHmm. So, for each edge, we have two constraints:\n\n1. a_u * a_v = g * l\n2. GCD(a_u, a_v) = g\n\nWhich implies that a_u = g * a', a_v = g * b', where GCD(a', b') = 1.\n\nThen substituting into equation 1: (g a') (g b') = g l → g² a' b' = g l → g a' b' = l → a' b' = l / g.\n\nSo, for each edge, after extracting g and l, we can compute that a' * b' = l/g, and a' and b' are coprime.\n\nThis seems manageable. So for each edge, we can model it as a' * b' = c, where c = l/g, and a' and b' are coprime.\n\nNow, the problem is to assign a' and b' such that for each edge, the product is c, and a' and b' are coprime.\n\nSo, the variables are a'_u for each node u, and the constraints are a'_u * a'_v = c for each edge.\n\nAdditionally, for any two connected components, the a' variables must form a tree where each edge's a' and b' are coprimes.\n\nWait, but this approach is similar to building a graph where each edge is a constraint on the product of a'_u and a'_v. So, this is a multiplicative version of the Union-Find structure.\n\nIn the Union-Find data structure, each node has a parent, and paths are compressed. Here, perhaps each node can have a value representing the product of a' along the path from the root. Then, for each edge u-v with c, we can check whether a'_u * a'_v equals c, and if not, set a'_u to c / a'_v.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should model each node's a'_u as a value relative to the root. For example, if I have a tree structure, then for any node u, a'_u is equal to (some base value) multiplied by the product along the path from u to the root. But that might not directly help.\n\nAlternatively, for each connected component, I can choose a root node. Then, for each node u in the component, a'_u is equal to the product of all the edges from u to the root, considering the constraints.\n\nWait, maybe the way to model this is to represent each node's a'_u as a fraction relative to the root. So, when processing an edge u-v, we can express a'_u in terms of a'_v or vice versa.\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each edge u-v with c gives a'_u = c / a'_v.\n\nThis is similar to a system of equations where each equation is a'_u * a'_v = c. So, to solve this, we can model the variables using a Union-Find structure with path compression and tracking of the product.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved using a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure, where each node has a parent and a weight. The weight represents the product from the node to its parent.\n\nSo, for each node u, when we find its root, the product from u to the root is known. For each edge u-v, we have a constraint that a'_u * a'_v = c. We can try to merge the sets of u and v, updating the weights as necessary.\n\nIf during this process, any inconsistency is found (like a conflicting product), then the system is unsatisfiable, and we should output NO.\n\nOtherwise, after processing all edges, each connected component can be assigned a base value (which can be arbitrary, as long as all a'_u are consistent within the component). Once the base is chosen, all a'_u can be determined.\n\nWait, but the base can be any positive integer, right? Because a'_u is defined as a_u / g, which is a positive integer because g is the GCD.\n\nSo, once all constraints are satisfied, each connected component can be assigned a base value (say, 1 for simplicity), and then all a'_u can be computed as the product along the path from the root.\n\nWait, but how? Maybe I should model each node's a'_u as the product of the edges from the root. So, for each node, a'_u = product of the weights along the path from the root to u.\n\nNo, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think: Each node u has a value w_u, which represents the product a'_u multiplied by the product of the edges along the path from u to the root. Or perhaps w_u is a'_u divided by the product of the edges along the path from u to the root.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think of how the DSU with weights works for additive constraints. In the case of additive constraints, each edge u-v has a weight w, meaning x_u + x_v = w. The DSU with path compression can handle this by keeping track of the offset from each node to its parent.\n\nIn the multiplicative case, each edge u-v has a product constraint: x_u * x_v = c. So, x_u = c / x_v.\n\nTo model this, each node can have a value that represents x_u, and the DSU needs to manage the product relations.\n\nSo, for each node, when we find its root, we can compute the product of x_u along the path from u to the root. Then, for any edge u-v, we can compute whether the product of x_u and x_v equals c, considering their roots.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is as follows:\n\n- Each node u has a parent p[u], and a weight w[u] such that x_u = w[u] * x[p[u]].\n- When merging two sets, we adjust the weights so that the product constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo, for each edge u-v with c = x_u * x_v:\n\n- Find the roots of u and v.\n- If they are in different sets, we merge them. The product of x_u and x_v should be equal to c.\n- To merge, we need to set the relation between the roots. Suppose the root of u is ru and the root of v is rv. Then, x_ru is the product of x_u's path to ru, and similarly for rv.\n- So, x_u = w_u * x_ru, x_v = w_v * x_rv.\n- The constraint is (w_u * x_ru) * (w_v * x_rv) = c.\n- Now, to make ru and rv have a common root, say r, we need to link ru to rv or vice versa.\n- Suppose we attach ru to rv. Then, x_ru = x_rv * s, where s is the multiplier we'll determine.\n- Then, the equation becomes (w_u * x_rv * s) * (w_v * x_rv) ) = c → w_u * w_v * s * (x_rv)^2 = c.\n- But since x_rv is the product of all edges from rv to r, perhaps x_rv is part of the system, but I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, for each connected component, we can assign a base value, say 1, and then compute all a'_u as the product of the edges from the base. However, this might not always work because the product could lead to very large numbers, but given the constraints on GCD and LCM, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nWait, but let's think about how the a'_u and a'_v relate. For each edge, a'_u * a'_v = c, and GCD(a'_u, a'_v) = 1.\n\nSo, for each edge, a'_u and a'_v must be coprime factors of c.\n\nSo, for example, if c is 6, possible pairs (a', b') are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1), etc. But only those pairs where a' and b' are coprime.\n\nSo, for each edge, when assigning a' and b', they must be coprime factors of c.\n\nThis suggests that the system can be built by choosing for each edge a pair of coprime factors whose product is c, and ensuring that these choices are consistent across all edges.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to building a graph where each edge has a directed assignment of a' and b' such that their product is c and they are coprimes.\n\nThis seems tricky, but perhaps we can model it using a DSU structure that tracks the multiplicative relationships.\n\nSo, going back to the DSU approach, each node has a parent and a value that represents the product of a' from the node to its parent. Then, for each edge, we can find the roots of the two nodes, and check if the product of their current a' values multiplied by the edge's c is consistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the DSU should track the product of a' values along the path from each node to the root. So, for any node u, x_u is the product of a' from u to the root.\n\nWait, but then for an edge u-v with c, the equation is x_u * x_v = c. So, if u and v are in different sets, we can merge them by setting the product x_u * x_v = c.\n\nSo, in the DSU, when merging u and v, we need to set the product between the roots of u and v such that x_u * x_v = c.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nEach node u has a parent p[u] and a value w[u], which represents the product of a' from u to p[u]. So, x_u = w[u] * x_p[u].\n\nWhen finding the root of u, we can compute x_u as the product of w along the path from u to the root.\n\nFor each edge u-v with c, the condition is x_u * x_v = c.\n\nSo, when processing an edge, we first find the roots of u and v. If they are the same, we check if x_u * x_v equals c. If not, it's impossible, return NO.\n\nIf the roots are different, we need to merge them.\n\nLet's say the root of u is ru, and the root of v is rv.\n\nWe have x_u = product of w from u to ru.\n\nx_v = product of w from v to rv.\n\nWe want x_u * x_v = c.\n\nAfter merging, the roots will have the same root, say r.\n\nSo, the new product x_ru * x_rv = ?\n\nWait, perhaps the idea is to express x_ru in terms of x_rv or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, we can set x_ru = (c) / x_v.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's see.\n\nWait, when we merge ru and rv, we can attach one to the other. Let's say we make rv the parent of ru.\n\nThen, the product x_ru = x_rv * s, where s is the new weight.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx_u = w_u * x_ru = w_u * (x_rv * s) = w_u * s * x_rv.\n\nSimilarly, x_v = w_v * x_rv.\n\nSo, the original condition x_u * x_v = c becomes:\n\n(w_u * s * x_rv) * (w_v * x_rv) = c.\n\nWhich simplifies to w_u * w_v * s * (x_rv)^2 = c.\n\nBut x_rv is a product of a' variables, which are positive integers. So, s must be set such that this equation holds.\n\nBut this seems difficult because s depends on x_rv, which is unknown.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I need to model it differently.\n\nAnother idea: Since a'_u and a'_v must multiply to c and be coprimes, perhaps for each edge, I can arbitrarily choose a'_u to be a divisor of c, and a'_v to be c / a'_u, ensuring that GCD(a'_u, a'_v) is 1.\n\nBut how to do this consistently across the entire graph?\n\nThis seems similar to building a bipartition of the graph, but perhaps it's not straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that for each edge, the a' values are coprimes. So, if two nodes are in the same connected component, their a' values must be coprimes along certain edges.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to enforce that.\n\nMaybe I should model this as a graph where each edge is a constraint that a'_u * a'_v = c, and a'_u and a'_v are coprimes.\n\nSo, for each connected component, I can choose a representative (like a root) and assign a' values based on the constraints.\n\nSo, perhaps for each node, I can represent a' as a fraction relative to the root. For example, a'_u = k * a'_root, where k is some rational number.\n\nBut since a'_u must be an integer, this would require that a'_root divides a'_u.\n\nWait, but the initial a'_u can be any integer, as long as all constraints are satisfied.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for similar problems or standard approaches.\n\nAh, right! This is similar to the problem of solving systems of equations with multiplication constraints, which can be handled with a DSU structure that tracks the product of variables along the path.\n\nEach node u has a value x_u, which represents a' for that node. For each edge u-v with c, the equation is x_u * x_v = c.\n\nSo, the DSU with path compression can be adapted to handle this by maintaining for each node u a 'weight' that represents x_u / x_parent[u], and then for each edge, we can compute whether the existing constraints are compatible.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Initialize each node as its own parent, with weight 1.\n\n2. For each edge u-v with c, perform the following:\n\n   a. Find the root of u (ru) and the root of v (rv).\n\n   b. If ru != rv, merge the two trees.\n\n      i. Compute the product of x_u (which is x_u = product of weights along the path from u to ru) and x_v (product from v to rv).\n\n      ii. The constraint is x_u * x_v = c.\n\n      iii. When merging, we need to set the new weight for the root so that this equation holds.\n\n   c. If ru == rv, check if x_u * x_v == c. If not, output NO.\n\nSo, the key is to implement the DSU with the ability to handle multiplicative constraints.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this.\n\nEach node u has:\n\n- parent[u]: the parent in the DSU.\n\n- rank[u]: used for union by rank (though perhaps not necessary here).\n\n- weight[u]: the weight from u to its parent. So, x_u = weight[u] * x_parent.\n\nWhen finding the root of u, we can compute the cumulative product from u to the root.\n\nSo, the find function returns the root and the product x_u.\n\nWait, perhaps the find function returns a tuple (root, product), where product is x_u.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the find function for u would recursively find the parent, multiplying the weights along the path.\n\nOnce the root is found, the function returns the root and the product x_u.\n\nSo, for each edge u-v with c:\n\n- Find (ru, x_u) and (rv, x_v).\n\n- If ru != rv:\n\n   - We need to merge the two trees so that x_u * x_v = c.\n\n   - Let's assume that ru becomes the child of rv.\n\n   - So, the new weight for rv will be such that x_rv = x_ru * s, where s is to be determined.\n\n   - The equation is x_u * x_v = c.\n\n   - Express x_u and x_v in terms of ru and rv.\n\n   - x_u = x_ru * product of weights from u to ru.\n\n   - x_v = x_rv * product of weights from v to rv.\n\n   - So, (x_ru * ...) * (x_rv * ...) = c.\n\n   - After merging, x_ru = s * x_rv.\n\n   - Substituting into the equation:\n\n     (s * x_rv) * ... * (x_rv * ...) = c.\n\n   - Hmm, perhaps it's better to express the relation between ru and rv.\n\n   - Let’s denote that when ru is attached to rv, the weight for ru is such that x_ru = (c) / (x_v * ...).\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it this way:\n\nAfter merging, the equation x_u * x_v = c must hold. But x_u is in terms of the root, and x_v is in terms of the other root.\n\nSo, after merging, suppose ru becomes a child of rv.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\nx_u = (product from u to ru) * x_ru.\n\nx_v = (product from v to rv) * x_rv.\n\nAnd x_ru = (some multiple) * x_rv.\n\nWe need x_u * x_v = c.\n\nSo,\n\n(product_u * x_ru) * (product_v * x_rv) = c.\n\nBut x_ru = s * x_rv, where s is the weight from ru to rv.\n\nSo,\n\nproduct_u * s * x_rv * product_v * x_rv = c.\n\n=> (product_u * s * product_v) * (x_rv)^2 = c.\n\nBut x_rv is the product of the path from rv to the new root (which is rv itself after merging), which is x_rv.\n\nWait, no, because after merging, the new root is still rv, unless we change that.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for existing solutions or algorithms for this problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I can refer to the \"Union-Find with Multiplicative Constraints\" approach. I recall that this kind of problem is solvable with a DSU structure that tracks the multiplicative relationships.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\nEach node has a parent and a weight. The weight represents the product of variables along the path from the node to its parent. So, for node u, x_u = w_u * x_p(u).\n\nWhen finding the root of u, we can compute the product of all weights along the path from u to the root.\n\nFor each edge u-v with c, we need x_u * x_v = c.\n\nSo, during the find operation, we can compute x_u and x_v.\n\nIf the roots are different, we can merge them by setting the appropriate weights.\n\nIf the roots are the same, we must check whether x_u * x_v equals c.\n\nSo, the steps for processing each edge are:\n\n1. Find the root of u and get x_u.\n\n2. Find the root of v and get x_v.\n\n3. If roots are different:\n\n   a. Check if (x_u * x_v) mod c is not zero. If it is, it's impossible.\n\n   b. Merge the two sets, adjusting the weights so that x_u * x_v = c.\n\n4. If roots are same:\n\n   a. Check if x_u * x_v == c. If not, impossible.\n\nSo, the challenge is implementing the merge step.\n\nLet me try to outline the merge step.\n\nSuppose u's root is ru, and v's root is rv.\n\nWe have x_u = a, x_v = b.\n\nWe need a * b = c.\n\nWe want to attach ru to rv or rv to ru.\n\nLet's say we attach ru to rv.\n\nSo, x_ru = w (the new weight for ru).\n\nThen, x_u = a = w * x_rv.\n\nBut x_rv is the current x of rv.\n\nSo, x_u = w * x_rv → w = x_u / x_rv.\n\nBut since a * b = c, and a = w * x_rv, and b is x_v.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n(w * x_rv) * b = c → w * x_rv * b = c.\n\nBut x_rv is known (it's the x of rv before merging).\n\nSo, w = (c) / (b * x_rv).\n\nThus, when attaching ru to rv, we set the weight of ru to w = c / (b * x_rv).\n\nWait, but this may not be an integer. How do we handle that?\n\nBecause c, a, b, x_rv are all integers, but in the problem statement, the initial GCD and LCM are at least 1, so c can be up to 106*106=11236.\n\nSo, perhaps in practice, this division would always result in an integer. Because a * b = c, and a = w * x_rv, which implies that w must be c/(b * x_rv). But since a and b are integers, c must be divisible by b * x_rv.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, if a = 2, b=3, c=5, then 2*3=6 !=5, which would have been rejected earlier.\n\nSo, during the processing of the edge, we would have already checked that a * b == c.\n\nSo, in the merge step, the division would always yield an integer.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nImplement the DSU with each node having a parent and a weight.\n\nFor the find function, path compression is done by updating the weights so that each node's weight is the product from the node to the root.\n\nWait, perhaps the find function should return the root and the product from the node to the root.\n\nSo, the find function would be something like:\n\ndef find(u):\n    if parent[u] != u:\n        orig_parent = parent[u]\n        parent[u], x = find(parent[u])\n        weight[u] *= x\n    return (parent[u], weight[u])\n\nWait, no. Because the weight[u] is the product from u to parent[u]. So, when we find the root of u, we need to compute the product from u to the root.\n\nSo, during find, when we recursively find the parent, we update u's weight to point directly to the root, multiplying the weight along the path.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nfind(u) returns (root, product).\n\nInitially, u's parent is u, weight is 1.\n\nIf u's parent is not root, we find the root of u's parent, which gives us (root, product_parent).\n\nThen, the weight of u is updated to weight_u * product_parent.\n\nSo, after find, u's weight is the product from u to the root.\n\nSo, the find function would look like this:\n\ndef find(u):\n    if parent[u] != u:\n        orig_parent = parent[u]\n        # Recursively find the root of the parent\n        root, w = find(parent[u])\n        # Update u's parent to root, and weight to the product from u to root\n        parent[u] = root\n        weight[u] *= w\n    return (parent[u], weight[u])\n\nWait, but wait: Initially, the weight of u is the product from u to its parent. So, when we find the root, the path from u to root is the sum of the weights along the way.\n\nSo, in the find function, when we find that u's parent is not the root, we find the root of the parent, then update u's weight to be the product from u to the parent (which is weight[u]) multiplied by the product from parent to the root (which is the returned w).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, for each edge u-v with c:\n\n- Find the root of u, get x_u = product from u to root.\n\n- Find the root of v, get x_v = product from v to root.\n\n- If the roots are different:\n\n   - We need to make sure that x_u * x_v == c. Because x_u and x_v are the products from u and v to their respective roots, and the edge requires x_u * x_v = c.\n\n   - So, if roots are different, we can merge them by attaching one root to the other, and setting the weights accordingly.\n\nSo, how?\n\nSuppose we make ru the root of rv.\n\nThen, the equation becomes x_u * x_v = c.\n\nBut x_u is the product from u to ru, and x_v is the product from v to rv.\n\nAfter merging, the root of rv becomes ru, and the weight of rv is set such that x_rv = (c) / (x_u * x_v) ?\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, after merging, the product x_u remains the same (since x_u is the product from u to ru, and ru is now the root).\n\nSimilarly, x_v is the product from v to rv, but rv is now a child of ru.\n\nSo, the product from v to ru is x_v * weight[rv], because v's product is to rv, and rv's product is to ru.\n\nSo, the total product from v to ru is x_v * w_rv.\n\nThus, the equation x_u * (x_v * w_rv) = c.\n\nWe can solve for w_rv: w_rv = c / (x_u * x_v).\n\nSince x_u * x_v must divide c, this is an integer.\n\nSo, during the merge, we set the parent of rv to ru, and set weight[rv] = w_rv.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nif ru != rv:\n\n   w_rv = c // (x_u * x_v)\n\n   set parent[rv] = ru\n\n   set weight[rv] = w_rv\n\nelse:\n\n   if x_u * x_v != c:\n\n       return NO\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Initialize DSU where each node is its own parent, weight 1.\n\n- For each edge u-v with c:\n\n   a. Find (ru, x_u) = find(u)\n\n   b. Find (rv, x_v) = find(v)\n\n   c. If ru == rv:\n\n      i. Check if x_u * x_v == c.\n\n         - If not, output NO.\n\n   d. Else:\n\n      i. Compute w_rv = c // (x_u * x_v).\n\n      ii. Attach rv to ru, setting weight[rv] = w_rv.\n\n- After processing all edges, check for each connected component.\n\nWait, but after processing all edges, how do I determine the a' values for each node?\n\nBecause a' is defined as a_u / g, but I'm not sure how that ties into the DSU variables.\n\nWait, no. The a'_u is the value that, when multiplied by g, gives a_u. So, a'_u = a_u / g.\n\nBut in our DSU model, we have x_u = a'_u.\n\nWait, no. Because in the DSU, x_u is a'_u. Because for each edge u-v, a'_u * a'_v = c = l/g, where l is the LCM and g is the GCD.\n\nSo, after processing all edges, each x_u is a'_u, which is a_u / g.\n\nSo, to compute a_u, we can set a_u = x_u * g.\n\nBut wait, how do I know what g is for each node?\n\nHmm, perhaps for each node u, the a'_u is x_u, which is a_u / g. So, a_u = x_u * g.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for each node u, the GCD of a_u and any adjacent node's a_v is g_uv. So, for each edge, the GCD is known.\n\nBut how does that affect the a'_u?\n\nWell, a'_u = a_u / g_uv.\n\nSo, a'_u is specific to each edge. But this seems conflicting because a'_u is a property of the node, not the edge.\n\nWait, no. Because for each node u, a'_u must be the same across all edges incident to u. Because a'_u is a_u / g, where g is the GCD of a_u and a_v for any connected node v.\n\nWait, no. Because for each edge u-v, the GCD is g_uv, which can vary per edge.\n\nSo, for example, node u can have a different g with each neighbor.\n\nSo, a'_u is a_u / g_uv, but since g_uv varies, a'_u must vary for each edge.\n\nBut that's impossible because a'_u is a single value for each node u.\n\nWait, this suggests that my initial approach is flawed.\n\nBecause for node u, a'_u must be the same for all edges connected to u.\n\nWait, no. Because a'_u is a_u / g, but the g varies per edge. So, for node u, a'_u is a_u divided by the GCD of a_u and a_v for each edge u-v.\n\nBut that would imply that a'_u must be such that for each edge u-v, a'_u * a'_v = c, where c is l_uv / g_uv.\n\nWait, but in our earlier model, a'_u is a variable, and for each edge u-v, a'_u * a'_v must equal l_uv / g_uv.\n\nSo, for each node u, a'_u must be consistent across all edges connected to it.\n\nThus, the DSU approach is valid because it enforces that a'_u * a'_v = c for each edge u-v.\n\nSo, after processing all edges, the DSU correctly represents the a'_u for each node.\n\nThus, the a'_u is x_u, and a_u = x_u * g_uv for each edge u-v.\n\nBut wait, no. Because a_u is the same for all edges connected to u. So, for node u, a_u is fixed, and for each edge u-v, g_uv is the GCD of a_u and a_v.\n\nThus, a'_u is a_u / g_uv, which varies per edge.\n\nBut that's not possible because a'_u is a property of the node, not the edge.\n\nSo, perhaps my model is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach is not sufficient, as it allows for varying a'_u per edge, which isn't possible.\n\nHmm. This is a problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that each edge has two numbers: GCD and LCM of the two lawns it connects. So, for each edge u-v, the GCD is g_uv and the LCM is l_uv. So, for each such edge, a_u and a_v must satisfy:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g_uv\n\nlcm(a_u, a_v) = l_uv\n\nWhich implies that a_u * a_v = g_uv * l_uv.\n\nBut for a_u and a_v, their GCD is g_uv, so a_u = g_uv * a', a_v = g_uv * b', where gcd(a', b') = 1.\n\nSubstituting into the product equation: (g_uv a') (g_uv b') = g_uv l_uv → g_uv^2 a' b' = g_uv l_uv → g_uv a' b' = l_uv → a' b' = l_uv / g_uv.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprimes, this implies that l_uv must be divisible by g_uv, which is given.\n\nSo, for each edge u-v, a' * b' = c, where c = l_uv / g_uv.\n\nBut a' and b' are coprimes.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign a' and b' for each edge such that all edges are consistent.\n\nBut each edge u-v involves the same a' for u and b' for v.\n\nWait, no. Because for a given node u, it can be part of multiple edges. For each edge u-v, a' is the same for u.\n\nBecause a_u is a fixed number, and a' is a_u / g_uv.\n\nBut for each edge u-v, g_uv can be different. So, a_u / g_uv can vary per edge, which is impossible because a_u is fixed.\n\nThus, the problem is only possible if, for each node u, all edges incident to u have the same g_uv, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, that's not correct. For example, if u is connected to v1 with g_uv1 and to v2 with g_uv2, then a_u / g_uv1 must be equal to a_u / g_uv2, which implies that g_uv1 = g_uv2. Otherwise, a_u cannot satisfy both edges.\n\nSo, this suggests that for each node u, all edges incident to u must have the same GCD.\n\nBut this is not given in the problem.\n\nWait, this is a crucial observation. So, for any node u, all edges connected to u must have the same GCD with u.\n\nOtherwise, it's impossible to assign a_u such that for all edges u-v, a_u / g_uv = a'_u, which must be the same across all edges.\n\nSo, for the problem to have a solution, all edges incident to a node u must have the same GCD. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nThis adds a new constraint: for each node u, all edges incident to u must have the same GCD.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\nSample Output: YES\\n5 1 2.\n\nLooking at node 2:\n\nIt has edges with node 1 (GCD 1, LCM 2) and node 3 (GCD 1, LCM 3). So, both edges have GCD 1 for node 2. So, that's okay.\n\nNode 3 has edges with node 2 (GCD 1) and node 1 (GCD 1). So, same GCD.\n\nNode 1 has an edge with node 3 (GCD",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to reconstruct the number of laughy mushrooms on each lawn based on given roads, each with a GCD and LCM of the mushroom counts at the connected lawns. If possible, we should output any valid arrangement; otherwise, we should indicate that it's impossible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each road between two lawns has a GCD and LCM. These constraints imply that the product of the mushroom counts at the two lawns must equal the product of the GCD and LCM for that road.\n2. **Union-Find Data Structure**: We use a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure with path compression to manage the relationships between nodes efficiently. Each node will track its parent and a weight representing the multiplicative relationship to its parent.\n3. **Handling Multiplicative Constraints**: For each edge, we ensure that the product of the weights from each node to their respective roots equals the given product (GCD * LCM). If merging sets reveals an inconsistency, the problem is unsolvable.\n4. **Reconstruction**: After processing all edges, if all constraints are satisfied, we reconstruct the mushroom counts by multiplying each node's weight with the GCD of its edges.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n\n    parent = list(range(n+1))\n    weight = [1]*(n+1)\n\n    def find(u):\n        if parent[u] != u:\n            orig_parent = parent[u]\n            root, w = find(parent[u])\n            parent[u] = root\n            weight[u] *= w\n        return (parent[u], weight[u])\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        v = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        g = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        c = g * l\n\n        ru, xu = find(u)\n        rv, xv = find(v)\n\n        if ru == rv:\n            if xu * xv != c:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                return\n        else:\n            # Merge rv into ru\n            # Compute w_rv = c / (xu * xv)\n            w_rv = c // (xu * xv)\n            parent[rv] = ru\n            weight[rv] = w_rv\n\n    # Now assign a_u = x_u * g, where g is the GCD of all edges for u\n    # But wait, since a'_u = x_u, and a_u = x_u * g_uv, but g_uv can vary per edge\n    # This approach is incorrect.
