Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the numeric value modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nSo Andrew has an initial string s. Then there are n queries where each query is like \"di→ti\". Each query means replacing every occurrence of digit di in the current string with ti. After all queries, we need to compute the numeric value of the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. Also, leading zeros are ignored when interpreting the number, but wait, no—wait, the note says that leading zeroes are not removed after replacement. Oh right, because in the example, the third sample input ends up as '777', but the replacement didn't remove any leading zeros. So the resulting string is treated as is, including any leading zeros, except that if it's empty, it's considered zero.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: when you represent s as a decimal number, ignore the leading zeros. Also, if s is empty, it's zero. So for example, if after substitutions the string is \"000\", the numeric value is 0.\n\nBut wait, the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string after replacement. So the string can have leading zeros, but when converted to a number, those are ignored. So the actual numeric value is computed by ignoring leading zeros, but the string is processed as is.\n\nHmm, okay. So the steps are:\n\n1. Process each query in order, replacing every occurrence of di with ti.\n\nBut wait, how? Because each query is applied to the current string. For example, the first example: the initial s is \"123123\". The first query is \"2→00\", which replaces 2 with 00, so s becomes \"10031003\". Then the next query is \"3→\", which replaces 3 with empty, so s becomes \"1212\".\n\nSo the processing is done in the order of the queries, each modifying the current string.\n\nThe challenge is to model this efficiently.\n\nNow, considering that the string can be up to 105 characters, and each substitution can replace a single character with multiple others, but the sum of all ti lengths across queries is up to 105. So the maximum possible length after all substitutions is manageable.\n\nBut processing each substitution step naively by string replacement could be feasible given the small size.\n\nOnce all substitutions are done, the string is processed into a number, ignoring leading zeros. But how to handle that.\n\nWait, but the problem is to compute the number modulo 1e9+7. So perhaps we can model this as a mathematical computation, building up the number step by step, taking modulo at each step to prevent integer overflow.\n\nYes, that's a good approach.\n\nLet me think about this.\n\nWe can model the string as a list of digits, and process each substitution step, updating the list accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since each substitution replaces a single character (di) with a string (ti), which can be zero or more characters, perhaps we can represent the current state of the string as a dictionary where each key is a digit, and the value is the corresponding replacement string.\n\nWait, that might be an efficient way. Because each substitution is a function from a single digit to a string. So after all substitutions, the final string is built by replacing each digit in the initial string according to all the substitution rules.\n\nBut the substitution rules can be processed in the order given. However, since substitution rules can overwrite each other, we need to make sure that the latest substitution for a particular digit takes precedence.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because each substitution is applied in sequence. For example, suppose the first substitution is 'a→b', then 'a→c'. These would replace a's with b, then with c. So the last substitution for a particular digit determines its final replacement.\n\nWait, no. Because each substitution is applied to the current string. So if a substitution changes a digit, the subsequent substitutions may change it again.\n\nFor example, let's say the initial string is 'abc'.\n\nFirst substitution: 'a→x' → string becomes xbc.\n\nSecond substitution: 'x→y' → string becomes ybc.\n\nSo the final string is ybc.\n\nSo each substitution is applied to the entire current string, replacing each occurrence of di with ti.\n\nThus, the order of substitution matters. So to model this correctly, we can't precompute a substitution map; instead, each substitution affects the current string.\n\nBut with a string of up to 105 characters and up to 105 substitutions, this is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Start with the initial string s.\n\n- For each query in order, perform the substitution on the current string.\n\n- After all substitutions, compute the numeric value of the resulting string, treating it as a decimal number, ignoring leading zeros, and return the mod 1e9+7",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to process a series of substitution queries on an initial string of digits and then compute the numeric value modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\). Each query replaces every occurrence of a specific digit with a given string. After all queries, we convert the resulting string into a number, ignoring leading zeros, and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Read the initial string and the number of queries.\n2. **Process Queries**: For each query, replace every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given replacement string.\n3. **Compute Result**: After processing all queries, convert the resulting string into a number, ignoring leading zeros, and compute the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    s = input[0].strip()\n    n = int(input[1].strip())\n    queries = []\n    for i in range(2, 2 + n):\n        parts = input[i].strip().split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        queries.append((di, ti))\n    \n    current = list(s)\n    for di, ti in queries:\n        new = []\n        for c in current:\n            if c == di:\n                new += list(ti)\n            else:\n                new.append(c)\n        current = new\n    \n    if not current:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    num_str = ''.join(current)\n    if not num_str.isdigit():\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    result = 0\n    for c in num_str:\n        result = (result * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The initial string and the number of queries are extracted.\n2. **Processing Each Query**: Each query is processed by replacing every occurrence of the specified digit in the current string with the given replacement string.\n3. **Building the Resulting String**: After all queries, the resulting string is built by iterating through each character and applying the necessary replacements.\n4. **Computing the Modulo**: The resulting string is converted into a number, ignoring leading zeros. The number is then computed modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to get the final result.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is applied correctly and efficiently, handling all edge cases such as leading zeros and empty strings.",
