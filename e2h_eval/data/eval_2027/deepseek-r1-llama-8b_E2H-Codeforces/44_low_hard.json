He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about Polycarp solving problems over k days. Each day he must solve a contiguous sequence of problems from the list, and he can't skip any. So all the problems are divided into exactly k consecutive groups. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that group, and the total profit is the sum of these maxes for all days. We need to maximize this total profit.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Let's think about dynamic programming. Because we're dealing with sequences and trying to find an optimal way to split them, DP seems like a good fit.\n\nLet me consider the structure. Maybe we can define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit when considering the first i problems and using j days. But wait, since each day must consist of a consecutive block, the state needs to account for where the last break is. Or perhaps, another approach is to track the end of the current segment.\n\nWait, maybe another idea: For each position i, and for each possible number of days up to k, keep track of the best way to split the first i problems into t days, such that the last day ends at i. Then, the maximum across all t would be considered for the next steps.\n\nSo, let's formalize this. Let dp[i][t] be the maximum total profit for the first i problems divided into t days. The goal is to compute dp[n][k].\n\nHow to compute dp[i][t]? Well, for each i and t, we can look back to some j < i, and take the maximum between j+1 and i, then add that to dp[j][t-1]. Because the last day could have started at j+1 and ended at i.\n\nBut wait, that might not capture the correct maximum. Alternatively, for each j, the maximum in the segment j+1 to i would be the maximum of a[j+1..i], which could vary depending on where you split.\n\nThis suggests that for each j < i, the maximum in j+1..i is known. So, we can precompute for all possible i and j the maximum in that interval. That's manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Precompute a 2D array max_val[i][j], where max_val[i][j] is the maximum value from a[j] to a[i-1], assuming the array is 0-based. Wait, maybe it's easier to make it 1-based. So for i >= j, max_val[i][j] = max(a[j...i]).\n\nWait, but in the problem, the days are made by splitting the list into contiguous segments. So for example, if we have the first i elements split into t days, the last day could be from j+1 to i. So the maximum for that day is max_val[j+1][i]. Then, dp[i][t] = max(dp[j][t-1] + max_val[j+1][i]) for all j from t-1 to i-1.\n\nWait, because each day has at least one problem, so the first t-1 days must cover j elements (j >= t-1), and the last day covers i-j elements (but i-j can be 1 or more). So j must be at least t-1, because each of the first t-1 days must have at least one problem.\n\nSo, for each i, t, we can compute dp[i][t] as the maximum of dp[j][t-1] + max(j+1, i) for j ranging from t-2 to i-1.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express that. For each i and t, we can choose a split point j, which is the end of the (t-1)th day. Then, the t-th day starts at j+1 and ends at i. The profit for this day is the maximum of a[j+1 ... i], which is precomputed as max_val[j+1][i]. So dp[i][t] = max over j from t-1 to i-1 of (dp[j][t-1] + max_val[j+1][i]).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the initial conditions. For t=1, dp[i][1] is the maximum of a[1..i], because all the problems are solved in one day. So for each i, dp[i][1] = max_val[1][i].\n\nFor the base case, when t=0, but that's not needed since t starts at 1.\n\nWe can build the dp table up to i = n and t = k.\n\nOnce we have filled the dp table, the answer is dp[n][k].\n\nBut we also need to reconstruct the way the problems were split into days. So we'll",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total profit Polycarp can achieve by solving a list of problems over a given number of days. Each day, Polycarp must solve a contiguous sequence of problems, and the profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The goal is to distribute the problems into k days such that the total profit is maximized.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We define a DP table `dp[i][t]` where `dp[i][t]` represents the maximum total profit when considering the first `i` problems and using `t` days.\n2. **Precompute Maximum Values**: To efficiently compute the maximum value in any subarray, we precompute a 2D array `max_val` where `max_val[i][j]` stores the maximum value from index `i` to `j`.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each position `i` and each possible number of days `t`, we consider all possible previous positions `j` where the last split could have occurred. The transition is given by:\n   \\[\n   dp[i][t] = \\max_{j < i} (dp[j][t-1] + \\text{max}(a[j+1..i]))\n   \\]\n4. **Reconstruct the Solution**: After filling the DP table, backtrack to determine how the problems were split into days to achieve the maximum profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    k = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute max_val[i][j], 1-based indices\n    max_val = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        max_val[i][i] = a[i-1]\n        current_max = a[i-1]\n        for j in range(i-1, 0, -1):\n            current_max = max(current_max, a[j-1])\n            max_val[j][i] = current_max\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    # Base case: t=1, all problems in one day\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        dp[i][1] = max_val[1][i]\n    \n    # Fill DP table\n    for t in range(2, k+1):\n        for i in range(t, n+1):  # At least t problems for t days\n            max_profit = 0\n            for j in range(t-1, i):\n                current = dp[j][t-1] + max_val[j+1][i]\n                if current > max_profit:\n                    max_profit = current\n            dp[i][t] = max_profit\n    \n    # Reconstruct the solution\n    res = [0]*k\n    current_day = k\n    last_pos = n\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        for t in range(k, 0, -1):\n            if dp[i][t] != dp[i-1][t]:\n                res[t-1] = i\n                last_pos = i - 1\n                break\n        else:\n            res[0] = 1\n            break\n    \n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precomputation**: The `max_val` array is filled such that each entry `max_val[i][j]` holds the maximum value in the subarray from index `i` to `j` (both inclusive).\n2. **DP Initialization**: The base case for the DP table is when all problems are solved in a single day, which is simply the maximum value in the entire array up to that point.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible number of days `t` and each position `i`, the DP table is filled by considering all possible previous positions `j` and computing the maximum profit achievable by splitting the problem list at `j`.\n4. **Reconstruction**: After computing the DP table, we backtrack from the end to determine the exact way the problems were split into days to maximize the profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum possible total profit while keeping track of how the problems were distributed across the days.",
