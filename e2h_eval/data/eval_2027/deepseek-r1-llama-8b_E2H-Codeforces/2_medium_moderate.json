Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The conditions for an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All the other squares (the ones not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to check the diagonals. Then, check the rest of the grid.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the grid. Since n is odd, the grid is square with a center point. The two diagonals intersect at the center.\n\nSo for each grid, I need to:\n\n- Check that all the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) has the same character.\n- Check that all the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) has the same character.\n- Also, the two diagonals must have the same character as each other because they both form the X.\n- Then, all the other cells (non-diagonal) must have the same character, and this character must be different from the diagonal one.\n\nWait, no. Wait: the problem says that the diagonals must be the same, and the non-diagonal squares must be the same but different from the diagonal.\n\nSo step by step:\n\n1. Check that the main diagonal is all the same character.\n2. Check that the anti-diagonal is all the same character.\n3. Ensure that these two are the same character.\n4. Check that all other cells are the same as each other, and that this is different from the diagonal/anti-diagonal character.\n\nSo how do I implement this?\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nThe first line is n. Then, n lines follow, each containing n characters.\n\nWait, but in Python, reading from stdin can sometimes be tricky, especially when the input is given as multiple lines. So perhaps read all lines into a list, then process them.\n\nBut wait, the input is provided as a list of strings, each representing a row.\n\nWait, looking at the example input:\n\nThe first sample input shows something like:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]\n\nSo each string in the list is a row. So the first row is 'xooox', the second is 'oxoxo', etc.\n\nSo to get the grid, I can split each row into individual characters.\n\nSo, for each row in the input, create a list of characters, then create a 2D list.\n\nOnce I have the grid, proceed to check the conditions.\n\nSo step 1: Read n.\n\nThen, read n lines, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace, then split into a list of characters.\n\nSo grid = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)]\n\nWait, but sometimes, when the user inputs via a file, using input() might cause issues, but assuming that the code is read correctly.\n\nNext, check the main diagonal.\n\nThe main diagonal consists of grid[i][i] for i in 0..n-1.\n\nSimilarly, the anti-diagonal is grid[i][n-1 - i].\n\nSo for each i, check that grid[i][i] is equal to the first diagonal cell, and grid[i][n-1 -i] is equal to the first anti-diagonal cell.\n\nWait, no. Because for the diagonals to be correct, all cells in the main diagonal must be the same, and all in the anti-diagonal must be the same, and the main and anti-diagonal must have the same character.\n\nSo first, collect the main diagonal's character, say d1 = grid[0][0], then check for all i if grid[i][i] == d1.\n\nSame for the anti-diagonal: d2 = grid[0][n-1], then check all i if grid[i][n-1-i] == d2.\n\nThen, if d1 != d2, then it's invalid.\n\nIf d1 == d2, then proceed.\n\nThen, check all the other cells (not on either diagonal) to see if they are all the same as each other, and also not equal to d1.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if it's not on the main or anti diagonal, check that grid[i][j] is equal to some c, which should be the same across all such cells, and c != d1.\n\nSo, plan:\n\n- Check main diagonal: all same, store d1.\n- Check anti-diagonal: all same, store d2.\n- If d1 != d2: output NO.\n- Else, check that d1 is the same as d2 (so we already did that, but perhaps redundant).\n- Then, find all cells not on the diagonals.\n- Collect their values, ensure they are all the same, and that this value is different from d1.\n\nWait, but what about the case where some cells are on the diagonals? No, because those are checked separately.\n\nSo, for the other cells, collect their values.\n\nSo, for each i in 0..n-1:\n   for each j in 0..n-1:\n      if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1): continue\n      else:\n          add grid[i][j] to a list.\n\nThen, check if all elements in this list are the same.\n\nAlso, this common element must not be equal to d1.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck main diagonal: all same, store d1.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal: all same, store d2.\n\nIf d1 != d2: output NO.\n\nElse, collect all non-diagonal cells' letters.\n\nIf all non-diagonal letters are same, and that letter is not d1: output YES.\n\nElse: NO.\n\nSo, now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nCase 1: n=3.\n\nFor example, the second sample input is 3x3 grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nWait, wait, the sample input was:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nWhich would have main diagonal: 'w', 's', 'w'.\n\nSo d1 is 'w' for first and third, but middle is 's' which is different. So condition fails, so output is NO? But according to the sample output, the second test case outputs 'YES'.\n\nWait, no, wait the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input 2 is:\n\n3\nxpx\np x p\nxpe ?\n\nWait, no, the third sample input is different.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\n['3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWait, no, the sample inputs are:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nWhich would be:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nWait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the rows wrong.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSo the second test case is 3x3 grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo main diagonal is w, s, w. So d1 is 'w' for first and third, but middle is 's'—so d1 is not consistent. So the main diagonal is not all same. So the answer is NO.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the second test case outputs 'YES'. Wait, no, the sample output is ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'].\n\nWait, maybe I misread the sample input.\n\nWait, the sample input is three test cases. Let me recheck.\n\nAh, the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nSo main diagonal is grid[0][0] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][2] = 'w' — so d1 is 'w'.\n\nAnti-diagonal is grid[0][2] = 'w', grid[1][1] = 'w', grid[2][0] = 'w' — d2 is 'w'.\n\nSo both diagonals are 'w's.\n\nNow, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1): 's'\n\n(1,0): 's'\n\n(1,2): 's'\n\n(2,1): 's'\n\nSo all non-diagonal are 's's, which is different from 'w's.\n\nSo the condition is satisfied, so output is 'YES'.\n\nAh, okay. So my initial thinking was incorrect. So the code needs to correctly capture these steps.\n\nSo now, let's outline the steps again.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCompute d1 as grid[0][0]. Check all grid[i][i] == d1.\n\nCompute d2 as grid[0][n-1]. Check all grid[i][n-1 -i] == d2.\n\nIf d1 != d2 → output NO.\n\nElse, check that all non-diagonal cells are same, and that this is different from d1.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\nd1 = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    if i == 0:\n        d1 = grid[i][i]\n    else:\n        if grid[i][i] != d1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n# Now, check anti-diagonal\nd2 = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    j = n - 1 - i\n    if i == 0:\n        d2 = grid[i][j]\n    else:\n        if grid[i][j] != d2:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            exit()\n\nif d1 != d2:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now, collect all non-diagonal cells\nother = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        other.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(other) == 0:\n    # This is possible only when n=1, but n is >=3, so no.\n    # So no, since n is >=3, there are other cells.\n    # So this case can't happen.\n    pass\n\nfirst_other = other[0]\nall_other_same = True\nfor c in other:\n    if c != first_other:\n        all_other_same = False\n        break\n\nif not all_other_same:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if first_other == d1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but wait, what if all the other cells are the same, but that same is equal to d1? Then it's invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif all same and same as d1 → invalid.\n\nElse, if all same and different → valid.\n\nSo the code above does that.\n\nTesting with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the main diagonal is x, o, o, o, x → not all same. So condition fails → output NO.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: w, w, w → same.\n\nAnti-diagonal: w, w, w → same.\n\nOthers: s, s, s, s → same and different from w → output YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3\n\nx p x\n\np x p\n\nx p e\n\nWait, grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nMain diagonal: x, x, e.\n\nSo d1 starts as x, but third cell is e → condition fails → output NO.\n\nYes, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\nDiagonals: a, a, a. Others: none. So all non-diagonal are a? Wait, no: for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So in this case, all are a. So others are a, which is same as d1. So condition fails. So output is NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\nb a b\n\na b a\n\nb a b\n\nDiagonals: b, b, b.\n\nOthers: a, a, a, a.\n\nSo others are a, different from b. So output is YES.\n\nSo code should handle all these.\n\nWhat about n=1? Well, in the problem statement, n is >=3, so no.\n\nWhat about when the grid is entirely filled with the same character as the diagonals? Like, grid is all 'x's. Then, the non-diagonal are also 'x's. So condition fails, output is NO.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, after checking the diagonals, I collect the other cells.\n\nBut in the code, for i in 0..n-1 and j in 0..n-1, except when i==j or i+j =n-1.\n\nSo, for each cell, check if it's on either diagonal. If not, add to other.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother thing: for n=3, the other cells are four in number.\n\nNow, what about when n is 5.\n\nLike, grid size 5x5.\n\nSo, the code will loop through all 25 cells, and skip the 5+5-1=9 cells (since i=j or i+j=4).\n\nSo, 25-9=16 cells in other.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, main diagonal is grid[0][0] = 'x', then grid[1][1]='o', which is different. So code exits early with NO.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nMain diagonal: grid[0][0]='w', grid[1][1]='w', grid[2][2]='w' → same.\n\nAnti-diagonal: grid[0][2]='w', grid[1][1]='w', grid[2][0]='w' → same.\n\nothers: grid[0][1]='s', grid[1][0]='s', grid[1][2]='s', grid[2][1]='s' → all 's' and not equal to 'w' → YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nMain diagonal: grid[0][0]='x', grid[1][1]='x', grid[2][2]='e' → not same. So code exits with NO.\n\nSo, the code works for samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid is:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals: a, a, a → same.\n\nOthers: a, a, a, a → same as d1 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbab\n\naba\n\nDiagonals: a, b, a → not same → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbab\n\nabb\n\nMain diagonal: a, b, b → not same.\n\nSo code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nSuppose all diagonals are 'x's, and all other cells are 'o's.\n\nSo, main diagonal is x, ..., x.\n\nAnti-diagonal is x, ..., x.\n\nOthers are o.\n\nThus, code returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\ngrid is:\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nx x x\n\nThen, main and anti-diagonal are x. Others are x. So code returns NO.\n\nSo, code seems correct.\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\n- When n=3 and all non-diagonal are same as diagonal: output NO.\n- When n=3 and all non-diagonal are same, but different from diagonal: output YES.\n- When n=3 and main diagonal is same, anti-diagonal same, and others same but different: YES.\n\nI think the code handles all of these.\n\nNow, time to write the Python code.\n\nBut in the code, after reading the grid, we need to check the main diagonal.\n\nWait, in the code, for the main diagonal, I have:\n\nd1 = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if i ==0:\n\n        d1 = grid[i][i]\n\n    else:\n\n        if grid[i][i] != d1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            exit()\n\nSimilarly for the anti-diagonal.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3 and grid[0][0] is 'a', grid[1][1] is 'a', grid[2][2] is 'a'? So d1 is 'a'.\n\nThen, anti-diagonal is grid[0][2], grid[1][1], grid[2][0]. They all must be 'a'.\n\nSo code proceeds.\n\nThen, collect others.\n\nOther cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nTheir values must be same and not equal to d1.\n\nSo, code is correct.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the grid could be modified, but in Python, the list of lists is mutable. So in the code, when processing each row, it's fine.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n",
