Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the direction of each edge in a flow network such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain conditions. The graph is undirected, and each edge has a given flow volume. We need to assign a direction to each edge so that:\n\n1. For every vertex v (except the source and sink), the sum of incoming edges equals the sum of outgoing edges.\n2. The source vertex (vertex 1) has no incoming edges.\n3. The resulting directed graph is acyclic (so it's a DAG).\n\nHmm. So basically, after directing the edges, the graph should satisfy all these properties. And we need to output for each edge whether it's directed from ai to bi or the other way around.\n\nI remember that in maximum flow problems, especially when dealing with undirected graphs, the residual graph can be used to determine directions. But I'm not exactly sure how to apply that here.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the algorithm already computes the maximum flow, but only knows the flow volume per edge. So perhaps we can model the direction based on some kind of potential or level structure.\n\nAnother thought: the problem requires that the sum of flows into each non-source and non-sink vertex is equal to the sum out. So for each vertex v (not 1 or n), the in-degree multiplied by their respective flows must equal the out-degree times their respective flows. But since each edge's flow is fixed, the way we direct them will affect the in and out sums.\n\nWait, let's think about what the condition implies. For each vertex v (excluding source and sink), the total flow coming in equals the total going out. Since each edge contributes its flow either in one direction or the other, the sum for each vertex must balance.\n\nBut how can we determine the direction of each edge to achieve this?\n\nLet me consider the graph as a flow network where the edges are directed. The sum of flows into each internal node must equal the sum out. That sounds like conservation of flow, except for the source and sink.\n\nSo the approach might involve finding a way to assign directions such that the above holds, and the graph remains acyclic.\n\nWait, the graph needs to be a DAG. So there shouldn't be any cycles. Which suggests that the directions must form a DAG, possibly a tree-like structure with edges pointing towards the sink.\n\nWait, but if the original graph is connected, which it is, then assigning directions such that the flow goes from lower to higher in some ordering could work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the direction can be determined based on some kind of potential function. Like, each node has a potential, and edges point from lower potential to higher. This would ensure no cycles because the potential can't decrease along a path.\n\nYes! That makes sense. Because if you have a potential (like in BFS levels) assigned to each node, and you direct edges from lower to higher potentials, then you avoid cycles. Also, this setup ensures that for each node, the sum of outgoing edges (which go to higher potentials) equals the sum of incoming edges (from lower potentials). Wait, does it?\n\nWait, for the source node, which is node 1, it should have no incoming edges. So if node 1 has the lowest potential, then all edges leaving it must go to nodes with higher potentials. Similarly, for the sink, which is node n, all edges entering it must come from nodes with lower potentials.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Assign a potential value to each node such that node 1 has the lowest potential, node n the highest, and others in between arranged so that the potentials increase in a way that satisfies the flow conditions.\n\n2. For each edge, if the potential of a is less than that of b, direct the edge from a to b; else, from b to a.\n\nThis should satisfy all the required conditions because:\n\n- For node 1, all edges are outgoing, so no incoming edges.\n- For node n, all edges are incoming, so no outgoing edges (wait, no—because node n is the sink, so edges to it are incoming, but edges from it are outgoing. Wait, but the sink is the end, so all edges into it are part of the flow, and none leave except as part of the flow. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.)\n\nWait, let me think again. If the potentials are such that node 1 is the lowest and node n is the highest, then all edges go from lower to higher. So for each edge (a, b), if potential(a) < potential(b), then the edge is directed a->b. Otherwise, it's directed b->a.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- For node 1, since it's the lowest, all edges from it are outgoing. No edges come into it except possibly from higher nodes, but those would have to have higher potentials, so they'd be directed towards node 1, but that's impossible because node 1 is the lowest. So node 1 can't have any incoming edges, which satisfies the first condition.\n\nFor other nodes v (not 1 or n):\n\nSum of outgoing edges is sum of edges where a is v and a's potential is less than b's. Sum of incoming edges is sum of edges where b is v and b's potential is less than a's.\n\nWait, but each edge contributes to either the outgoing or incoming sum of v.\n\nWait, no. Each edge (a, b) contributes c_i to either a's outgoing or b's incoming, depending on the direction.\n\nSo for node v, the sum of outgoing edges is sum of c_i for edges where a = v and a's potential < b's. The sum of incoming edges is sum of c_i for edges where b = v and a's potential < b's.\n\nBut for node v, these two sums must be equal.\n\nSo how can we arrange the potentials so that for every v (not 1 or n), the sum of outgoing edges equals the sum of incoming edges?\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe the potential assignment is such that for each v, the sum of c_i for edges where a = v is equal to the sum of c_i for edges where b = v. But that's not necessarily true, because the edges are undirected and the c_i are given.\n\nWait, but the problem says that a solution exists, so we don't have to worry about no solution.\n\nPerhaps the way to model this is to find a potential function where for each node v (except 1 and n), the sum of c_i for edges leaving v equals the sum of c_i for edges entering v.\n\nSo, for each edge (a, b), if a's potential is less than b's, then the c_i contributes to a's outgoing and b's incoming. Otherwise, it contributes to b's outgoing and a's incoming.\n\nWe need to find a potential assignment such that for every v, the sum of outgoing edges from v equals the sum of incoming edges.\n\nHow can we find such a potential assignment?\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled using a graph where each node's potential is determined based on some constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the potential can be determined via a BFS starting from node 1. Since node 1 is the source, all edges from it are outgoing. Then, for each neighbor of node 1, their potential is higher than node 1's. Then, their neighbors' potential is higher still, and so on.\n\nBut wait, what if during BFS traversal, some nodes have higher potentials but their edges' c_i values don't allow the sum to balance? How can that be handled?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding a valid potential function that satisfies certain equations.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. Let's say we assign each node a potential d[v]. Then, for each edge (a, b), if d[a] < d[b], we direct it a→b, else b→a.\n\nNow, for each node v, the sum of c_i for edges directed away from v is S_out(v), and the sum for edges directed into v is S_in(v). We need S_out(v) = S_in(v) for all v except 1 and n.\n\nWait, but for node 1, S_in(1) must be zero. For node n, S_out(n) must be zero.\n\nWait, no. Node n is the sink, so all edges entering it are part of the flow, but edges leaving it are not part of the flow. Or perhaps that's not the right way to think about it.\n\nWait, perhaps the sink's S_in is the total flow, and S_out is zero. But in our problem, the conditions are:\n\n- For v = 1: S_in(1) = 0.\n- For v = n: S_out(n) = 0.\n- For all other v: S_in(v) = S_out(v).\n\nSo, how do the potentials relate to this?\n\nLet me think about the sum for each node v:\n\nS_in(v) = sum of c_i for edges (a, b) where b = v and d[a] < d[b].\n\nS_out(v) = sum of c_i for edges (a, b) where a = v and d[a] < d[b}.\n\nWe need S_in(v) = S_out(v) for v != 1, n.\n\nAnd S_in(1) = 0, S_out(n) = 0.\n\nHmm. So for each node v, the sum of edges directed into v is equal to the sum directed out of v.\n\nSo, considering the entire graph, the sum of all S_in(v) for v in 1..n is equal to the sum of all S_out(v) for v in 1..n.\n\nBut since S_in(1) is zero and S_out(n) is zero, the sum of S_in(v) for v=2 to n-1 is equal to the sum of S_out(v) for the same set.\n\nBut S_in(v) + S_out(v) for each v is the sum of all edges incident to v. Because each edge is either incoming or outgoing for v, but not both.\n\nWait, no. Each edge is either directed into or out of v. So for each edge (a, b), it contributes to either a's S_out or b's S_in.\n\nWait, for each edge (a, b), if d[a] < d[b], then it contributes c_i to a's S_out and to b's S_in. Else, it contributes to b's S_out and a's S_in.\n\nSo, for each edge, it contributes exactly c_i to either S_in or S_out of the nodes.\n\nTherefore, the sum over all S_in(v) equals the sum over all S_out(v). Because each edge contributes exactly once to either an S_in or S_out.\n\nBut according to the problem conditions, for v=1, S_in(v)=0, and for v=n, S_out(v)=0. So, the sum of S_in(v) for v=2..n-1 plus S_in(1) (which is zero) equals the sum of S_out(v) for v=2..n-1 plus S_out(n) (which is zero). So, yes, the total flow is conserved.\n\nBut how to find such a potential function d[v] that satisfies these conditions.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative approach: perhaps the problem can be viewed as building a directed graph that is a DAG, with node 1 as source and node n as sink, and for each edge, directing it in a way that the flow through the edges respects the capacity constraints and the balance conditions.\n\nWait, but how? Because the capacities are given, and the directions are to be determined.\n\nAnother idea: since the graph is connected, we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from node 1, and assign potentials based on the distance from node 1. Then, for each edge, if a is closer to 1 than b, direct a→b. Otherwise, direct b→a. But wait, this might not satisfy the balance conditions.\n\nWait, let's test this idea on the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nSo edges:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2, 10\n\nEdge 2: 1-2, 10\n\nEdge 3:3-1,5.\n\nIf we do BFS from 1:\n\nNode 1 is level 0.\n\nNode 2 is level 1.\n\nNode 3 is level 1 (since it's connected to 1 directly, but also connected to 2 which is level 1).\n\nWait, but in BFS, 3 could be at level 1 as well.\n\nBut then, for each edge:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2. Both are level 1. So, which way to direct? If directed from 3→2, then 3's S_out increases by 10, 2's S_in increases by 10. Alternatively, 2→3: 2's S_out +=10, 3's S_in +=10.\n\nBut for node 2, S_in + S_out would be 10 (from edge 2) + whatever. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach isn't sufficient.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the correct directions are:\n\nEdge 1: 2 →3 (direction 1, meaning a=3, b=2, di=1). Wait no, wait the output is ['1\\n0\\n1'].\n\nWait, the first edge is 3 2 10. So the output is 1, meaning di=1, so the direction is 2→3.\n\nWait, the output is for each edge, 0 means ai → bi, 1 means bi → ai.\n\nSo for the first edge, direction is 2→3.\n\nSecond edge: 1→2, direction is 0.\n\nThird edge:3→1, direction is 1.\n\nSo node 2 has edges from 1 and 2.\n\nWait, node 2's edges:\n\nEdge 2: 1→2, contributing 10 to node 2's S_in.\n\nEdge 1: 2→3, contributing 10 to node 2's S_out.\n\nSo S_in(2) is 10, S_out(2) is 10. So they're equal.\n\nSimilarly, node 3 has edges:\n\nEdge 1: 2→3, contributing 10 to S_in(3).\n\nEdge 3:3→1, contributing 5 to S_out(3).\n\nWait, node 3 is the sink, so S_out(3) must be zero. But according to the sample, 3 has an edge to 1. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, node 3 is the sink. So in the directed graph, all edges into node 3 are allowed, but edges leaving are not. Because the sink is the terminal point.\n\nSo, in the sample, node 3's S_out is zero, so any edges leaving node 3 are disallowed. So the edge from 3 to 1 is directed as 1→3, but that doesn't make sense because node 3 is the sink.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The problem statement says that the sink is node n, so in the directed graph, all edges into node n are part of the flow, but edges leaving node n are not. So S_in(n) is the total flow, and S_out(n) must be zero.\n\nWait, no. In the directed graph, node n can have outgoing edges, but those edges don't contribute to the flow because the flow only goes from source to sink. So in the problem, the edges leaving the sink are directed away, but they are not part of the actual flow. So their S_out is non-zero, but the flow can't use them.\n\nBut according to the problem's conditions, S_out(n) must be zero. So for the sink, all edges leaving it must have di=0, so that they contribute to S_out(n). But that would imply that those edges are not part of the flow. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the S_out(n) is allowed to be non-zero, but the flow doesn't pass through those edges. However, the problem's condition requires that S_out(n) is zero.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nCondition 2: The obtained directed graph does not have cycles.\n\nSo the directed graph must be a DAG, with edges directed such that no cycles exist.\n\nBut for the sink, any edges directed out are allowed as long as they don't create cycles. But in that case, S_out(n) could be non-zero. So why does the problem require S_out(n) to be zero?\n\nAh, because the sink is the end point, so no flow can leave it. So all edges into the sink are part of the flow, but edges out are not. So for the sink, S_in must be the total flow, and S_out must be zero.\n\nSo, in the directed graph, the sink cannot have any outgoing edges, because otherwise, those edges would contribute to S_out(n), which must be zero.\n\nWait, no. Because S_out(n) is the sum of the edges directed out of n. To have S_out(n)=0, all edges from n must be directed into it. But that's impossible because the edges are undirected. So perhaps the problem's condition is that for the sink, S_out(n) is zero. So all edges incident to the sink must be directed into it.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if any edge from the sink is directed out, it would contribute to S_out(n), which must be zero. So all edges from the sink must be directed into it.\n\nSo, for node n, all edges must be directed into it.\n\nThus, in the sample, the third edge is 3-1,5. Since node 3 is the sink, this edge must be directed into it, which means the direction is 3→1, but that's impossible because 3 is the sink. Wait, no. Wait, the edge is between 3 and 1. Since node 3 is the sink, all edges from 3 must be directed into 3. So for the edge 3-1, it can only be directed 3←1, i.e., 1→3.\n\nBut in the sample output, the third edge is directed as 3→1, which would mean that the edge is directed from 3 to 1. But that would mean it's an outgoing edge from the sink, which violates the condition.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the conditions are:\n\n- For each node v, including the sink, S_in(v) = S_out(v).\n\nBut for the source, S_in is zero, and for the sink, S_out is zero.\n\nSo for the sink, S_in is equal to S_out, which is zero. So all edges into the sink must have their c_i counted in S_in(sink), and all edges out of the sink must have their c_i counted in S_out(sink). But since S_out(sink) must be zero, all edges out of the sink must have di=0, meaning the direction is ai→bi, but since bi is the sink, that can't happen. Or wait, maybe I'm getting the direction reversed.\n\nNo, for an edge (a, b), di is 0 if a→b, 1 if b→a.\n\nSo for the edge (3,1,5), if node 3 is the sink, the edge must be directed into 3. So di should be 0, because a is 3, b is 1. Wait, no. Wait, if a is 3, b is 1, and the edge is directed 3→1, then di is 0. Because the output is 'di' which is 0 if the direction is ai→bi. So for the edge (3,1,5), if di is 1, it means 1→3. So if the edge is directed into 3, then di should be 0.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nThe output for each edge is di, which is 0 if the direction is ai→bi, else 1.\n\nSo, for the edge (a, b, c), if di is 0, the flow is a→b; if 1, the flow is b→a.\n\nSo, for the edge (3,1,5), if it's directed into 3, that would be 3→1, so di is 0.\n\nBut in the sample, the output for this edge is '1', meaning the direction is 1→3.\n\nWait, but node 3 is the sink. So, according to the problem conditions, the sink's S_out must be zero. So for node 3, all edges directed out of it must have their flow not contribute to the overall flow.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the sample.\n\nIn the sample, the three edges are:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2,10 → output is 1 (so direction is 2→3)\n\nEdge 2:1-2,10 → output is 0 (so direction is 1→2)\n\nEdge 3:3-1,5 → output is 1 (so direction is 1→3)\n\nSo, in the directed graph:\n\nEdges:\n\n1→2 (10)\n\n2→3 (10)\n\n1→3 (5)\n\nSo the directed graph is:\n\n1 points to 2 and 3.\n\n2 points to 3.\n\nSo for node 2: S_in = 10 (from 1), S_out = 10 (to 3). So equal.\n\nFor node 3: S_in = 10 (from 2) +5 (from 1) =15. S_out is zero, because node 3 is the sink. So S_in(3)=15, S_out(3)=0. But according to the condition, S_in(v) must equal S_out(v) for all v except 1 and n. Wait, node 3 is n. So the condition for node 3 is S_out(n) must be zero. Which is satisfied.\n\nBut wait, node 3's S_in is 15, but the condition is that S_in(v) must equal S_out(v) for v not 1 or n. Oh, right! So for node 3, it's the sink, so the condition doesn't apply to it. Only the other nodes (v=2) must have S_in equal to S_out.\n\nSo the sample satisfies the conditions.\n\nSo, the way to assign directions is to direct edges in a way that forms a DAG, with all edges directed towards the sink, ensuring that for each node (except source and sink), S_in equals S_out.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAn alternative idea: find a spanning tree where the sum of edges directed out of each node (except source and sink) equals the sum directed in.\n\nWait, perhaps it's possible to model this as a bipartition of edges. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached by first performing a BFS or similar traversal to assign potentials, then directing edges accordingly.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Assign a potential value to each node. Node 1 has potential 0, node n has potential 1. Other nodes get potentials based on BFS, ensuring that the potentials increase as you move away from the source.\n\n2. For each edge (a, b), if potential[a] < potential[b], direct it a→b; else, direct it b→a.\n\n3. Then, check if the conditions are satisfied. If not, adjust accordingly.\n\nBut how to ensure that the conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps the BFS-based potential assignment is sufficient.\n\nLet's see: in the sample, node 1 has potential 0.\n\nNode 2 is at level 1, node 3 is at level 1.\n\nEdge 3-2: since potentials are equal, we have to decide the direction. But in the sample, the edge is directed 2→3.\n\nBut in this case, the potential of a (3) is equal to b (2). So according to the rule, if a's potential is not less than b's, we direct it b→a, which would be 2→3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the rule is: for each edge, if a's potential is less than b's, a→b; else, b→a. Including when a and b have the same potential.\n\nWait, but in that case, for edges between nodes of equal potential, the direction can be arbitrary as long as it doesn't create cycles. But in the sample, that was the case.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Assign potentials via BFS starting from node 1.\n\n- For each edge, compare a and b's potentials. If a's potential is less than b's, direct a→b; else, direct b→a.\n\nThis should ensure that the directed graph is a DAG, as potentials are strictly increasing along paths.\n\nNow, does this assignment satisfy the conditions that for each non-source/sink node, S_in equals S_out?\n\nNot necessarily. It depends on the sum of the edges.\n\nWait, but perhaps it does. Because the way the potentials are assigned, for each edge (a, b), if a's potential is less than b's, then the flow leaves a and enters b. So for a, this contributes to S_out, and for b, S_in.\n\nBut for a node v, the sum of S_out is the sum of edges leaving v, which are those where a = v and a's potential is less than b's.\n\nThe sum of S_in is the sum of edges entering v, which are those where b = v and a's potential is less than b's.\n\nSo, for each node v, S_in(v) is the sum of c_i for edges where a's potential < b's and b = v.\n\nS_out(v) is the sum of c_i for edges where a = v and a's potential < b's.\n\nWe need S_in(v) = S_out(v) for all v except 1 and n.\n\nSo, the question is, does assigning potentials via BFS ensure this equality?\n\nIn the sample, it does. Let's see another example.\n\nSuppose we have a graph with nodes 1, 2, 3,4. Edge 1-2, c=5; edge 2-3, c=5; edge 3-4, c=5. All other edges removed.\n\nBFS from 1 gives potentials: 1:0, 2:1, 3:2,4:3.\n\nEdges:\n\n1→2, 2→3, 3→4.\n\nEach node v (2 and 3):\n\nFor node 2: S_in is 5 (from 1), S_out is 5 (to 3). Equal.\n\nFor node 3: S_in is 5 (from 2), S_out is 5 (to 4). Equal.\n\nFor node 4: S_in is 5, S_out is 0. So condition holds.\n\nSo, works here.\n\nAnother example: suppose a graph where node 2 is connected to 1 and 3, each with c=5. Node 3 is connected to 2 and 4, each c=5.\n\nBFS from 1: 1 has 0, 2 has 1, 3 has 2,4 has 3.\n\nEdges:\n\n1→2, 2→3, 3→4.\n\nAlso, 2-3: c=5.\n\nSo, in this case, the edge between 2 and 3 is directed 2→3.\n\nNow, for node 2:\n\nS_in: 5 (from 1).\n\nS_out: 5 (to 3) +5 (to 3) = 10.\n\nSo S_in(2)=5, S_out(2)=10. Not equal. So the condition is violated.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So the initial approach may not work in all cases.\n\nSo, the BFS-based potential assignment may not always satisfy the condition that S_in(v) equals S_out(v) for all non-source/sink nodes.\n\nSo, what's the issue here?\n\nIn this example, node 2 has two edges to node 3. When the edge is directed 2→3, it contributes to S_out(2) and S_in(3). But another edge (the same node pair) is not present. So in this case, the condition isn't met.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to handle this is to find a way to balance the sum of the edges.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternative approach: the problem is essentially to find a way to partition the edges into in-edges and out-edges for each node, such that the sum of in-edges equals the sum of out-edges for each non-source/sink node, and the directed graph is a DAG with source 1 and sink n.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled as finding a valid orientation of the edges.\n\nThis is known as the \"Eulerian orientation\" problem but with specific constraints.\n\nWait, but I'm not familiar with the exact terminology here.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be considered as finding a flow where the residual graph is a DAG, and the flow satisfies the balance conditions.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the given graph is connected and a solution exists, so perhaps the approach is to model the problem as a directed graph where each edge is oriented based on the potential function, and then verify the balance conditions.\n\nBut in the earlier example, the balance conditions were not satisfied.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to perform BFS, assign potentials, then for each node, if the balance is not satisfied, flip some edges.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the flow conservation and using a Union-Find data structure.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node, the sum of outgoing edges must equal the sum of incoming edges. So, the problem can be transformed into finding a way to split the edges into in and out edges such that for each node, the sum of the edges directed out minus the sum directed in is zero, except for node 1 (where it's -sum of outgoing edges) and node n (where it's +sum of incoming edges).\n\nWait, but that's more like a system of equations.\n\nLet me model this as a system of variables for each edge. For each edge (a, b), we can choose to direct it a→b or b→a. Let x_e be 0 if a→b, 1 if b→a.\n\nThen, for each node v (excluding 1 and n), the equation is:\n\nsum_{e=(u,v)} x_e * c_e = sum_{e=(v,w)} (1 - x_e) * c_e.\n\nBecause for edge (u, v), if it's directed u→v, x_e is 0, so contributes c_e to v's S_in. If directed v→u, x_e is 1, so contributes to u's S_in. Wait, no. Wait, for edge (u, v), x_e is 0 if a→b (u→v), so for v, it's an incoming edge. So, S_in(v) += c_e.\n\nSimilarly, for edge (v, w), if x_e is 0, it's directed v→w, so contributes to v's S_out.\n\nSo, for each node v (not 1 or n), S_in(v) = sum_{e=(u,v)} (x_e == 0 ? c_e : 0) + sum_{e=(v,w)} (1 - x_e ? c_e : 0).\n\nWait, maybe it's better to express the equations correctly.\n\nFor node v:\n\nS_in(v) = sum of c_e for edges (u, v) where the edge is directed to v.\n\nWhich is the same as sum of c_e for edges (u, v) where x_e is 0 (since x_e=0 means u→v).\n\nSimilarly, S_out(v) = sum of c_e for edges (v, w) where x_e is 0 (since x_e=0 means v→w).\n\nWait, no. Because for an edge (v, w), x_e=0 means v→w, so contributes to v's S_out.\n\nSo, for each node v, the equation is:\n\nsum_{(u, v)} (c_e if x_e=0 else 0) = sum_{(v, w)} (c_e if x_e=0 else 0).\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nsum_{(u, v)} (x_e=0) * c_e = sum_{(v, w)} (x_e=0) * c_e.\n\nWhich can be rearranged as:\n\nsum_{(u, v)} (1 - x_e) * c_e = sum_{(v, w)} (1 - x_e) * c_e.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not the right way.\n\nAlternatively, for each node v, the sum of c_e for edges directed into v equals the sum of c_e for edges directed out of v.\n\nSo:\n\nsum_{e ∈ E_in(v)} c_e = sum_{e ∈ E_out(v)} c_e.\n\nWhere E_in(v) is the set of edges directed into v, and E_out(v) is the set directed out of v.\n\nEach edge (a, b) is either in E_in(b) or E_out(a).\n\nSo, for each node v, the sum of E_in(v) equals the sum of E_out(v).\n\nBut how to model this as equations.\n\nThis seems like a system of linear equations where for each node v, sum E_in(v) - sum E_out(v) = 0.\n\nExcept for v=1 and v=n.\n\nFor v=1: sum E_in(1) - sum E_out(1) = 0 (since sum E_in(1) is zero, and sum E_out(1) is positive).\n\nFor v=n: sum E_in(n) - sum E_out(n) = 0 (since sum E_out(n) is zero).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a subset of edges to reverse (assign x_e=1) such that for each node v, the sum of c_e for edges directed into v minus the sum for edges directed out equals zero.\n\nBut solving this system seems computationally expensive, especially for large n and m.\n\nBut given that the problem statement says a solution exists, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the fact that the problem allows for any valid orientation as long as the conditions are met:\n\nWe can model this as finding a way to orient the edges so that the resulting directed graph is a flow network with a feasible flow, respecting the maximum flow.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the maximum flow is already computed, but the directions are unknown.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding a valid flow that corresponds to the maximum flow, but with the edges directed in such a way that the flow is maximized, and the direction assignments meet the conditions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the problem requires that the directed graph is a DAG with node 1 as the source and node n as the sink. So the edges must form a DAG, and the flow must be routed from source to sink.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be approached by finding a DAG orientation of the graph, such that for each node v, the sum of edges directed into v equals the sum directed out, except for the source and sink.\n\nThis is known as the \"Eulerian orientation\" problem for a directed graph, but I'm not sure of the exact terminology.\n\nWait, but in this case, the underlying graph is undirected, and we need to find an orientation that satisfies the balance conditions for each node.\n\nThis is known as the problem of finding a valid Eulerian orientation for the undirected graph, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, but for an Eulerian orientation, the in-degree must equal the out-degree for all nodes. But in our problem, the source and sink are exceptions.\n\nWait, no. Our problem allows for source (in-degree 0) and sink (out-degree 0), but for all other nodes, in-degree equals out-degree.\n\nSo it's similar to the Eulerian tour problem, but adjusted for the presence of a source and sink.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution involves finding a way to orient the edges so that for each node except the source and sink, in-degree equals out-degree, and the graph is a DAG.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: since the graph is connected, perform a BFS starting from the source, and for each node, assign a level. Then, for each edge, direct it from the node with lower level to the node with higher level. This ensures the graph is a DAG.\n\nBut as shown earlier, this may not satisfy the balance conditions.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires a combination of BFS and some additional processing to ensure the balance.\n\nBut I'm stuck on how to proceed.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the problem as a graph where each node has a certain demand for the difference between incoming and outgoing edges.\n\nFor node 1: demand is -sum of outgoing edges (since it must have zero incoming edges).\n\nFor node n: demand is +sum of incoming edges (since it must have zero outgoing edges).\n\nFor other nodes: demand is zero (since in-degree equals out-degree).\n\nSo, the problem becomes assigning directions to edges such that the sum of flows entering each node minus the sum exiting equals their demand.\n\nThis is similar to a system of equations, but again, solving this for large graphs is impractical.\n\nWait, but the problem allows for any valid solution, not necessarily unique. So perhaps we can greedily assign directions based on the BFS levels and then adjust as needed.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, after performing BFS and assigning directions, we can check for each node whether the balance is achieved. If not, swap the direction of some edges.\n\nBut what edges to swap?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite matching problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding a way to partition the edges into in and out sets such that for each node, the sum of in edges equals the sum of out edges, except for the source and sink.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nWait, another observation: the problem can be viewed as a flow problem where each node v (except 1 and n) must have in-flow equal to out-flow. The source has all its edges outgoing, and the sink has all its edges incoming.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum",

Each node is assigned a potential value based on its distance from the source. This ensures that the graph is processed level by level, which helps in maintaining the DAG structure.\n2. **Direction Assignment**: For each edge, we compare the potentials of its endpoints. If the potential of the first endpoint is less than the second, we direct the edge from the first to the second. Otherwise, we direct it in the reverse direction.\n3. **Output**: The result for each edge is printed as either '0' or '1', indicating the direction of the flow.\n\nThis approach ensures that the resulting directed graph is a DAG and satisfies the flow balance conditions for all vertices except the source and sink.",
