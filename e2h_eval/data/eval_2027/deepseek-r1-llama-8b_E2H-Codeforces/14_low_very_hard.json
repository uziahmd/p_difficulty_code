He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many positive integers n exist such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n such that Z(n) = m.\n\nI think the approach is to find the smallest n where Z(n) equals m, and then check if the next numbers also give the same count until it increases beyond m.\n\nWait, but how do I find all possible n's? Because sometimes there might be a range of n's that all have the same Z(n). For example, looking at the sample input, when m=1, the n's are 5,6,7,8,9. So for each of these, Z(n) is 1.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Find the lower bound: the smallest n where Z(n) = m.\n2. Find the upper bound: the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n3. Then, all integers between lower and upper (inclusive) are the solutions.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find these lower and upper bounds?\n\nFirst, I'll need a helper function to compute Z(n) given a number. That's straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to find the minimal n where Z(n) is exactly m. But since Z(n) can jump by more than 1 when n crosses a multiple of 5^k, perhaps binary search would be efficient here.\n\nWait, but how does Z(n) behave? It increases as n increases, but not necessarily by 1 each time. For example, when n increases by 1, Z(n) could increase by 0 or 1 or more, depending on whether the new n adds a multiple of 5, 25, etc.\n\nSo, for m, the values of n where Z(n)=m form a contiguous range. So, once we find the first n where Z(n) = m, the last n will be when Z(n) stops being m and becomes m+1.\n\nBut how do I find the first occurrence?\n\nI can perform a binary search between 0 and some upper limit. Wait, what's a safe upper limit? Let's see: for m=1e5, the maximum n we might need is about 5*m because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero. So 5*1e5 is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since m can be up to 1e5, maybe 5*m is a good starting point for an upper bound.\n\nWait, no. Because for each 5, you get one zero, but higher powers contribute more. So for m=1e5, the corresponding n could be around 5e5, but perhaps even higher. Hmm, but maybe binary search is the way to go regardless.\n\nSo step 1: find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m.\n\nWait, no. Because Z(n) can have jumps. For example, when n is a multiple of 25, Z(n) increases by 2 instead of 1. So, the minimal n where Z(n) >= m may not directly give us the starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the lower and upper bounds using binary search, but with specific conditions.\n\nLet me think: For a given m, I can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where Z(n) = m. Similarly, find the largest n where Z(n) = m.\n\nWait, but how? Because for some m, there might be no such n. But according to the problem statement, m can be as low as 1, and up to 1e5. So perhaps m is always achievable. Or wait, no. For example, if m is 3, but there's no n such that Z(n) = 3, but that seems unlikely because as n increases, Z(n) increases.\n\nWait, no. The number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. So for every m, there must be at least one n such that Z(n) = m. So, the first part is to find the lower bound, then the upper bound.\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, suppose m is 2. Let's compute Z(5) =1, Z(6)=1, Z(10)=2. So the lower bound is 10, and the upper bound is 14. Because Z",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves finding the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy this condition efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes**: The number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) (factorial of \\( n \\)) is determined by the count of factors of 10 in the product. Since 10 = 2 * 5 and there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\). This can be computed using the formula:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the smallest and largest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) = m \\), we use binary search. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the range of \\( n \\) values where the count of trailing zeroes equals \\( m \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Range**: Once the bounds are found, all integers between these bounds (inclusive) will have exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The count of these integers gives the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeroes(n):\n    count = 0\n    divisor = 5\n    while divisor <= n:\n        count += n // divisor\n        divisor *= 5\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m  # Initial upper bound estimate\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid\n    # Now left is the minimal n where Z(n) >= m\n    # We need to check if it's exactly m\n    if count_trailing_zeroes(left) != m:\n        return None  # This should not happen as per problem constraints\n    return left\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2\n        z = count_trailing_zeroes(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            right = mid - 1\n        else:\n            left = mid\n    return left\n\nm = int(input().strip())\nif m == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    max_n = find_max_n(m)\n    if min_n is None:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        count = max_n - min_n + 1\n        print(count)\n        if count > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, max_n + 1))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeroes Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeroes in \\( n! \\) by summing the contributions from multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: Uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\). Adjusts the search range based on whether the current midpoint has enough trailing zeroes.\n\n3. **find_max_n Function**: Similarly uses binary search to find the largest \\( n \\) such that \\( Z(n) \\leq m \\). This effectively gives the upper bound where the trailing zeroes stop being \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Main Logic**: Reads the input \\( m \\), finds the minimum and maximum \\( n \\) values, computes the count of valid \\( n \\) values, and prints them in the required format.",
