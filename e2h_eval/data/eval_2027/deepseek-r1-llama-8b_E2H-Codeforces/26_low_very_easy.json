Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles given certain constraints on x, y, z. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem says that x, y, z are the sides of a triangle, and they must satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x, y, z are in order (x ≤ y ≤ z), the key condition is x + y > z. Because if that holds, then the other conditions (x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically hold because z is the largest.\n\nHmm. So the main condition is x + y > z. And z can't be more than D, but also it's at least C. So for each possible z in [C, D], I need to find how many pairs (x, y) satisfy x ≤ y, with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without iterating through every possible z. Let me think about the variables.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- x ranges from A to B.\n- y ranges from B to C.\n- z ranges from C to D.\n\nBut since z is the largest side, we have to ensure x + y > z.\n\nSo for each possible z, I can count the number of (x,y) pairs such that x <= y, x >= A, y >= B, x <= B, y <= C, and x + y > z.\n\nBut doing this directly for each z might be computationally expensive, especially since D can be up to 5e5, which is 500,000. So O(D) is manageable, but for each z, O(1) or O(log something) would be better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for all possible z's the required counts and sum them up.\n\nBut let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, let's fix z. For a fixed z, what's the number of (x, y) pairs that satisfy:\n\nx is between A and B,\ny is between B and C,\ny >= x (since x <= y),\nand x + y > z.\n\nWait, no, the condition is x + y > z. Since x and y are both >=1, but their specific ranges vary.\n\nBut given that x can be as small as A, and y as small as B, perhaps for a given z, the minimal x + y is A + B. So if z is less than A + B, then all possible (x, y) pairs satisfy x + y > z. Otherwise, some do not.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for example, if z is larger than x + y for some pairs but not others. So for a given z, the number of valid (x, y) pairs is equal to the number of (x, y) pairs where x <= y, x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y > z.\n\nSo, for each z in [C, D], calculate the number of such pairs, then sum over all z in this range.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me model the problem.\n\nWe can think of the variables as follows:\n\nx ∈ [A, B]\ny ∈ [max(B, x), C] (since y >= x and y >= B)\nz is fixed, and z is in [C, D]\n\nBut for each z, the condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo for each z, the task is to find the number of (x, y) pairs in their respective ranges where x <= y and x + y > z.\n\nLet me consider that for each z, I can compute the total possible (x, y) pairs, subtract those that don't satisfy x + y > z.\n\nThe total possible (x, y) pairs for a given z is:\n\nnumber of x: (B - A + 1)\nnumber of y: (C - B + 1) for each x, but wait, no. Because for each x, y can be from max(x, B) to C. But since x can be up to B, and y starts at B, for x <= B, the y starts at max(x, B) = B when x <= B. So for each x, y ranges from B to C, but also y >= x.\n\nWait, no. Because y must be >= x and >= B. So for x <= B, y starts at max(x, B). But since x can be as low as A, which could be less than B. So for x < B, y starts at x (since x <= y",
