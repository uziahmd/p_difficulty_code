He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, but there's a twist when the base b is the Roman numeral system (represented by 'R'). Also, each door has four parts: a, either b or R, c, and then some empty part. The key idea is that c in base a needs to be converted into base b, but if b is R, then we have to represent it using Roman numerals instead of standard digits.\n\nHmm. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Read the input which includes a and b for each test case.\n2. For each line, we have a number c given in base a.\n3. We need to convert c from base a to base b, considering whether b is R or a normal integer.\n4. Output the result without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but wait. The input is a bit more complicated. Each line is a separate test case, right? Because the example shows multiple inputs and outputs. So, the program will process each line as a separate case.\n\nWait, looking at the example input:\n\nThe first line is '10 2\\n1', meaning a=10, b=2, c=1 (in base 10). So converting 1 from base 10 to base 2 is 1, output '1'.\n\nSecond line is '16 R\\n5'—so a=16, b=R (meaning Roman numerals), c=5 (base 16). So 5 in base 16 is 5 in decimal, which in Roman is 'V'.\n\nThird line is '5 R\\n4'—a=5, b=R, c=4 (base 5). Wait, no. Wait, c is in base a, so c is 4 in base 5, which is 4 in decimal. Convert to Roman: IV.\n\nFourth line: '2 2\\n1111001'—a=2, b=2, c is 1111001 in base 2. So convert 1111001 (binary) to base 2, which is the same, but written as 1111001.\n\nFifth line: '12 13\\nA'—a=12, b=13, c='A' in base 12. So A is 10 in base 12, which in base 13 is just 10, represented as 'A' because 10 is less than 13.\n\nSo the output is the string representation of c in base b.\n\nNow, the main task is to write a function that can take a number in base a, convert it to a decimal, and then represent that decimal in base b, where b could be an integer or R.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the number c is up to 103 digits in base a. So for a=25, that's a very large number, way beyond standard data types. So we can't just parse it as an integer; we need to handle big integers.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Parse a and b.\n- If b is R, then the target is the Roman numeral representation of the number.\n- Else, b is an integer, and we need to convert c from base a to base b as a decimal number, then represent it in base b as a string, omitting leading zeros.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read each test case line.\n2. Split into a, b, and c.\n3. Convert c from base a to decimal.\n   - How to do this? Since c can be up to 103 digits, we need to handle big integers. So perhaps process each digit and build the number step by step.\n4. Once we have the decimal value, if b is R, we need to convert this decimal to Roman numerals.\n   - Or, if b is not R, we need to convert the decimal to base b as a string.\n5. Output the result without leading zeros.\n\nWait, but in the third test case of the example, the input is '5 R\\n4'—so a=5, b=R, c is '4' in base 5. So c is 4 in base 5, which is 4 in decimal. So in Roman, that's IV. Correct.\n\nAnother example: '2 2\\n1111001'—c is '1111001' in base 2, which is binary. So it's 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + ... etc. When converting to base 2, it's the same as the input, but leading zeros are omitted.\n\nSo, how to approach the conversion.\n\nFirst, let's think about parsing c from base a. For each character in c, we need to calculate its value in base a, adding to the total.\n\nBut since c can be up to 103 digits, we can't store it as a regular integer. So, we'll need to handle it as a string and perform the conversion step by step, building a big integer.\n\nSimilarly, when converting to base b, if b is not R, we need to represent the decimal number in base b, which again can be up to 101510 (as per the note). So, we can represent that as an integer.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nParsing c from base a:\n\n- For each character in c:\n   - If it's a digit, its value is int(char).\n   - Else, if it's uppercase (since in Roman, letters are uppercase?), but wait, in the input, c is given as a string in base a. So for example, in base 16, c could be 'A' which is 10, 'B' which is 11, etc. But wait, in the sample input, the fifth test case is 'A' in base 12, which is 10 in decimal. So the function must correctly parse c, treating letters as their respective values.\n\nWait, but in base a, letters are used only if a > 10. For example, in base 16, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc.\n\nSo, in the code, for each character in c:\n\n- If the character is a digit, its value is its integer equivalent.\n- Else, it's a letter (uppercase?), and its value is ord(char) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it's said that c is a non-negative integer in base a, which may include leading zeros. So the letters are allowed only if a>10.\n\nSo, for each character in c:\n\nif char.isdigit():\n    val = int(char)\nelse:\n    val = ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\nBut wait, what about lowercase letters? The problem says nothing about it, but the sample inputs use uppercase. So perhaps we should assume that all letters in c are uppercase. Or maybe the code should convert them to uppercase.\n\nProbably, the code should process each character as uppercase, but perhaps the problem ensures that the input is correct.\n\nSo, now, the code can process each character in c, get its value, and compute the decimal value.\n\nBut since c can be 103 digits long, and a can be 25, the maximum possible decimal value is 25^103 - 1, which is a huge number. So, we need to handle big integers. In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's manageable.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, we need to convert it to base b.\n\nIf b is R, then we need to represent the decimal number as a Roman numeral string.\n\nElse, we need to convert the decimal number to base b, as a string without leading zeros.\n\nSo, the next task is to write two functions:\n\n1. Function to convert a string in base a to a decimal integer (handling big numbers).\n2. Function to convert a decimal integer to a string in base b, handling both cases when b is R (Roman) or a normal integer.\n\nLet me outline these functions.\n\nFunction 1: str_to_decimal(s, base)\n\nInput: s is the string representation of a number in base 'base' (an integer >=2), which can have leading zeros.\n\nOutput: the integer value of s interpreted in base 'base'.\n\nProcess:\n\n- Initialize result = 0\n- For each char in s:\n   - if char is a digit, val = int(char)\n   - else, val = 10 + (ord(char.upper()) - ord('A'))\n   - result = result * base + val\n- Return result.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nFunction 2: decimal_to_str(n, base)\n\nInput: n is a non-negative integer, base is an integer >=2, or 'R' for Roman numerals.\n\nOutput: the string representation of n in base 'base' (or Roman numerals if base is 'R').\n\nSo, for base as integer:\n\nWe need to convert n to base b, as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nFor example, n=5, base=2: 101.\n\nn=10, base=13: 'C'?\n\nWait, no: 10 in base 13 is 'C' because 10 < 13.\n\nWait, no: in base 13, the digits are 0-12. So 10 is represented as 'C', 11 as 'D', etc.\n\nWait, no: the standard is that for bases higher than 10, letters are used starting from A=10, B=11, etc.\n\nSo, for base 13, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', 12 is 'C', 13 is invalid (since 13 is the base, which is 0 to 12).\n\nWait, no, wait: when you have a base b, the digits are 0 to b-1. So for base 13, the digits are 0,1,...,12. So 10 is represented as 'A', 11 as 'B', 12 as 'C'.\n\nSo, in function decimal_to_str, when the base is an integer, we can proceed as follows:\n\nIf n is 0, return '0' (but according to the problem statement, c is never zero, but the function should handle it).\n\nElse:\n\n- Compute the digits of n in base b.\n- Then, map each digit to its corresponding character.\n\nFor example, for each digit d in 0..b-1:\n\nif d < 10: character is str(d)\nelse: 'A' + (d-10)\n\nSo, the function can create a list of digits, then map each to the corresponding character.\n\nBut how to extract the digits?\n\nThe standard method is to repeatedly divide n by the base and collect the remainders.\n\nBut for large n, like up to 1e308, this is manageable in Python.\n\nSo, for base as integer:\n\ndigits = []\nif n == 0:\n    digits.append(0)\nelse:\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\ndigits.reverse()\nresult = ''.join([chr(d + ord('0')) if d <10 else chr(ord('A') + d -10) for d in digits])\nreturn result\n\nWait, but for example, if base is 2 and n is 5:\n\n5 /2 = 2 rem 1\n\n2/2 = 1 rem 0\n\n1/2 = 0 rem 1\n\ndigits after reverse: [1,0,1] → '101'.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about when the base is 1? No, base is at least 2.\n\nSo, function for integer base seems manageable.\n\nNow, for the Roman numeral case:\n\nWhen base is 'R', the function needs to convert the decimal number into a Roman numeral string.\n\nSo, Roman numerals have specific rules. The symbols are:\n\nI = 1\n\nV =5\n\nX=10\n\nL=50\n\nC=100\n\nD=500\n\nM=1000\n\nAnd the subtractive notation applies for 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD), 900 (CM).\n\nSo, the approach is to break down the number into thousands, hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nWe can create a list of tuples that maps values to their corresponding Roman numerals, including the subtractive cases.\n\nFor example, the list would be:\n\n[\n(1000, 'M'),\n(900, 'CM'),\n(500, 'D'),\n(400, 'CD'),\n(100, 'C'),\n(90, 'XC'),\n(50, 'L'),\n(40, 'XL'),\n(10, 'X'),\n(9, 'IX'),\n(5, 'V'),\n(4, 'IV'),\n(1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value in this list, we check how many times it fits into the number, append the corresponding numeral that many times, and subtract the value from the number.\n\nFor example, for n=3888:\n\n3888 / 1000 = 3 → 'MMM'\n\n3888 mod 1000 = 888.\n\n888 / 900 is 0 → skip.\n\n888 / 500 = 1 → 'D'\n\n888 mod 500 = 388.\n\n388 / 100 = 3 → 'CCC'\n\n388 mod 100 = 88.\n\n88 / 90 = 0 → skip.\n\n88 / 50 = 1 → 'L'\n\n88 mod 50 =38.\n\n38 /40 = 0 → skip.\n\n38 /10=3 → 'XXX'\n\n38 mod 10=8.\n\n8/9=0 → skip.\n\n8/5=1 → 'V'\n\n8 mod5=3 →3.\n\n3/4=0 → skip.\n\n3/1=3 → 'III'\n\nSo total is MMM D CCC L XXX V III → MDCLXXXVIII.\n\nWait, but 3888 is 3*1000 + 888. Wait, 3*1000 is 3000, 888 is 800+80+8.\n\nWait, perhaps my breakdown is incorrect. Let me compute 3888:\n\n3888 ÷ 1000 = 3 → M ×3 → 'MMM'\n\n3888 - 3000 = 888.\n\n888 ÷ 900 is 0 → skip.\n\n888 ÷500 =1 → D, remainder 388.\n\n388 ÷100=3 → C×3 → 'CCC', remainder 88.\n\n88 ÷90=0 → skip.\n\n88 ÷50=1 → L, remainder 38.\n\n38 ÷40=0 → skip.\n\n38 ÷10=3 → X×3 → 'XXX', remainder 8.\n\n8 ÷9=0 → skip.\n\n8 ÷5=1 → V, remainder 3.\n\n3 ÷4=0 → skip.\n\n3 ÷1=3 → III.\n\nSo overall: MMM D CCC L XXX V III → MDCLXXXVIII.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the function for Roman numerals can be implemented with this approach.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nSo, the steps for each test case are:\n\nRead a and b, and c.\n\nCheck if b is 'R' or not.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal.\n\nIf b is 'R', convert the decimal to Roman.\n\nElse, convert the decimal to base b as a string.\n\nNow, the problem arises with the size of c: 103 digits. So, processing each digit as a character is manageable.\n\nBut for the function to convert c to decimal, since the number can be very large, we need to handle it as a string and process each character accordingly.\n\nSo, the code structure in Python would be:\n\nRead each line, split into a, b, c.\n\nHandle each case.\n\nImplementing the functions:\n\nFirst, the function to convert c to decimal:\n\ndef str_to_decimal(s, base):\n    result = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n        result = result * base + val\n    return result\n\nBut wait, what if the base is larger than the maximum digit in c? Like, if base is 16, and c has 'G'? Then it's invalid, but according to the problem statement, c is a valid number in base a, so it won't have such characters.\n\nSo, the function should work.\n\nNow, the function to convert decimal to Roman:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nTesting this function: for n=5, returns 'V'; n=4, 'IV'; n=9, 'IX'; n=10, 'X', etc.\n\nNow, the function to convert decimal to base b (integer):\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if base < 2:\n        return ''  # invalid, but base is at least 2.\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits.reverse()\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nTesting: decimal_to_base(5,2) → '101'; decimal_to_base(10,13) → 'C' because 10 is less than 13.\n\nBut wait, 10 in base 13 is 'A'?\n\nWait, yes, because in base 13, the digits are 0-12. So 10 is represented as 'A'.\n\nWait, no, wait: in base 13, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', 12 is 'C'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for n=10, base=13: digits is [10], which becomes 'A'.\n\nAnother example: n=15, base=16 → 'F'.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe code will process each line as a test case.\n\nIn Python, reading lines from stdin:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\nfor line in lines:\n    a, b_part = line.split('\\n', 1)\n    a = int(a)\n    parts = a.split()\n    # Wait, no, wait: the first line contains two integers a and b. So the first line is like \"10 2\\n1\", so after splitting on whitespace, it's ['10', '2'], then the second part is '1'.\n\n    # So perhaps the line is split into two parts: the first is the a and b line, the second is the c line.\n\n    # Wait, no, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1'—wait, no, the input is:\n\nThe first line contains a and b, the next line is c.\n\nSo for each test case, the first line is a and b, and the second line is c.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system. The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\n\nSo, each test case is two lines: first line is a and b, second is c.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\nfor case in range(len(lines)//2):\n    # Read a and b from lines[2*case]\n    ab_line = lines[2*case].split()\n    a = int(ab_line[0])\n    b = ab_line[1]\n    # Read c from lines[2*case +1]\n    c = lines[2*case +1]\n    # Now process\n    # Convert c to decimal\n    dec = 0\n    for ch in c:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            val = int(ch)\n        else:\n            val = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n        dec = dec * a + val\n    # Now convert dec to base b\n    if b == 'R':\n        roman = decimal_to_roman(dec)\n        print(roman)\n    else:\n        # Convert dec to base b as a string\n        # Edge case: if dec is 0, return '0'?\n        # According to problem statement, c is non-zero.\n        # So, no problem.\n        if dec == 0:\n            print('0')\n        else:\n            digits = []\n            n = dec\n            while n >0:\n                rem = n % int(b)\n                digits.append(rem)\n                n = n // int(b)\n            digits.reverse()\n            res = []\n            for d in digits:\n                if d <10:\n                    res.append(str(d))\n                else:\n                    res.append(chr(ord('A') + d -10))\n            print(''.join(res))\n\nWait, but what about when b is 1? No, the problem says b is ≥2. So no problem.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nProcessing each case:\n\nCase 1: a=10, b=2, c='1'.\n\ndec = 1*10^0 =1.\n\nb is 2, not R. So convert 1 to base 2: '1'.\n\nOutput: 1.\n\nCase 2: a=16, b='R', c='5'.\n\ndec is 5.\n\nConvert to Roman: 'V'.\n\nOutput: V.\n\nCase3: a=5, b='R', c='4'.\n\ndec is 4 → Roman is IV.\n\nOutput: IV.\n\nCase4: a=2, b=2, c='1111001'.\n\ndec is 1111001 in binary → 1+2+4+8+16+32+64 = 127? Wait, 1111001 is 7 bits.\n\nWait, 2^6 is 64, 2^5=32, 2^4=16, 2^3=8, 2^2=4, 2^1=2, 2^0=1.\n\n1111001 is 1*(2^6) + 1*(2^5) + 1*(2^4) + 1*(2^3) + 0*(2^2) + 0*(2^1) +1*(2^0) → 64 +32 +16 +8 +0 +0 +1 = 121.\n\nSo in base 2, it's 1111001, which is same as c, so output '1111001'.\n\nCase5: a=12, b=13, c='A'.\n\n'A' in base 12 is 10.\n\nConvert to base 13: 10 is less than 13, so 'A'.\n\nSo output is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nBut wait, let's think about another test case.\n\nTest case: a=16, b=16, c='Z'.\n\nWait, but in base 16, letters go up to F (15). So 'Z' is invalid, but according to the problem statement, the input is always correct, so c will be a valid number in base a.\n\nSo, the code can safely assume that any letters in c are valid for base a.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=3, c='22'.\n\nIn base 3, 22 is 2*3 +2 =8. Convert to base 3: 22 (same as c, output '22').\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b='R', c='22' → dec is 8 → Roman is VIII.\n\nSo, code would output 'VIII'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b='R', c='0' → but according to problem statement, c is not zero. So no.\n\nWhat about a=10, b=16, c='FF' → FF in base 10 is 15+16=31. Wait no: wait, no, in base 10, 'FF' is not a valid number. Wait, no: 'FF' in base 10 is not a valid representation because 10 is the base. So, 'FF' in base 10 is invalid. But according to problem statement, c is a valid number in base a, so 'FF' can't be a c when a is 10.\n\nSo, the code can safely process all inputs.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the code handles all edge cases, including when the decimal is zero. Although according to the problem statement, c is not zero, but when converting to base b, perhaps the decimal is zero.\n\nWait, in the function for base b, when dec is zero, it returns '0'. But according to the problem statement, c is not zero. So, it's safe.\n\nAnother edge case: a=2, b=2, c='0' → but according to the note, c is not zero.\n\nAnother case: a=25, b=25, c='Z' → Z is 25, but in base 25, Z is 25, but wait, 25 is the base, so digits can't be equal to the base. So, in base 25, digits go from 0 to 24. So 'Z' is 25, which is invalid. But according to problem statement, c is a valid number in base a. So the code can assume that c is a valid number in base a.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nI think this should handle all the cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to base `b`, where `b` can be either a standard integer or the Roman numeral system (represented by 'R'). The challenge involves handling very large numbers efficiently and converting between different numeral systems.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read each test case which consists of two lines: the first line contains integers `a` and `b`, and the second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Convert `c` from Base `a` to Decimal**: Since `c` can be very long (up to 103 digits), we handle it as a string and convert it to a decimal integer using a loop.\n3. **Determine the Target Base**: Check if `b` is 'R' (Roman numerals) or a standard integer.\n4. **Convert Decimal to Roman Numerals**: If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to its Roman numeral representation using predefined mappings for Roman symbols.\n5. **Convert Decimal to Standard Base**: If `b` is a standard integer, convert the decimal number to the specified base, ensuring no leading zeros in the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = []\n    for (i, r) in val:\n        while n >= i:\n            res.append(r)\n            n -= i\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    for case in range(len(input_lines) // 2):\n        ab_line = input_lines[2 * case].split()\n        a = int(ab_line[0])\n        b = ab_line[1]\n        c = input_lines[2 * case + 1]\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        dec = 0\n        for ch in c:\n            if ch.isdigit():\n                val = int(ch)\n            else:\n                val = 10 + (ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A'))\n            dec = dec * a + val\n        \n        if b == 'R':\n            print(decimal_to_roman(dec))\n        else:\n            if dec == 0:\n                print('0')\n            else:\n                digits = []\n                n = dec\n                while n > 0:\n                    rem = n % int(b)\n                    digits.append(rem)\n                    n = n // int(b)\n                digits.reverse()\n                res = []\n                for d in digits:\n                    if d < 10:\n                        res.append(str(d))\n                    else:\n                        res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n                print(''.join(res))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into test cases. Each test case processes the given `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n- **Base Conversion to Decimal**: The function converts each character of `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer, handling both digits and letters.\n- **Roman Numeral Conversion**: If `b` is 'R', the decimal number is converted to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating through them to build the result string.\n- **Standard Base Conversion**: For standard bases, the decimal number is converted by repeatedly dividing by the base and collecting remainders, then mapping these remainders to their corresponding characters.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases, including very large numbers and different numeral systems.",
