Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the direction of each edge in a flow network such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain conditions. The goal is to find for each edge whether it's directed from ai to bi or vice versa.\n\nThe given graph is undirected, and each edge has a capacity (flow volume). We need to assign directions so that:\n\n1. For each vertex v (excluding the source 1 and sink n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows.\n2. The source vertex (1) has no incoming edges.\n3. There are no cycles in the directed graph.\n\nHmm, okay. So the first thing I think about is that this directed graph must form a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), because there can't be any cycles. Also, since the graph is connected and we're assigning directions based on max flow, I suspect that the solution involves building a flow network where each edge is directed in a way that respects the max flow structure.\n\nWait, but how do I determine the direction for each edge? Because each edge is part of the original undirected graph, but once directed, it becomes a one-way connection.\n\nI remember that in maximum flow problems, especially when dealing with bipartitioned graphs or using the Ford-Fulkerson method, the residual graph is built by reversing edges when they're saturated. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe model this as a graph where each node except the source must have equal in-degree and out-degree. That sounds familiar—it's similar to an Eulerian graph condition. Oh right! In an Eulerian directed graph, every node except possibly two (the start and end) has equal in-degree and out-degree. But in our case, the source (node 1) should have zero in-degree, which suggests that node n (the sink) will have a higher out-degree.\n\nWait, but the problem says that for each vertex v (1 < v < n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing. So node 1 has zero in-degree, and node n has some out-degree.\n\nThis structure is similar to a graph where all nodes except 1 and n have balanced degrees, and the edges form a DAG. So perhaps we can model the problem by choosing directions such that the entire graph is a DAG and satisfies the degree conditions.\n\nSo how do we model this? One idea is to build a directed graph where each edge is either forward or backward, ensuring that the in-degree and out-degree conditions are met.\n\nBut considering that the original graph is connected, how do we assign the directions?\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by finding a spanning tree or some kind of arborescence (a directed tree rooted at the source). But since the graph isn't necessarily a tree, that might not be sufficient.\n\nAnother thought: Since the directed graph must be a DAG, the edges must be oriented in a way that forms a topological order. So perhaps we can find a topological order of the vertices, and then direct the edges accordingly.\n\nBut how to determine the direction of each edge based on the given capacities?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a directed graph where for each edge, the direction is chosen such that the sum of flows is preserved, and the in/out degree conditions hold.\n\nWait, but the flow volumes are given, so each edge contributes to the sum of the connected nodes. So, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of ci for edges coming into v must equal the sum going out.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model the problem as finding a set of directions for each edge such that for each node v (1 < v < n), the sum of outgoing edges equals the sum of incoming edges.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. For each node v (1 < v <n), sum_{outgoing edges} ci = sum_{incoming edges} ci. \n\nAdditionally, for node 1, sum_incoming = 0, and for node n, sum_outgoing = sum_incoming + something. Wait, no: node 1 has no incoming edges, but its outgoing edges contribute to other nodes. Similarly, node n can have any number of incoming edges, but its outgoing edges must be zero.\n\nWait, no, node n is the sink, so in the directed graph, all edges leading into it would contribute to its in-degree, but it's allowed to have in-degree. However, the problem states that for 1 < v < n, in-degree equals out-degree. So for node n, it can have any in-degree, but since it's the sink, it's possible that its out-degree is zero.\n\nBut how does that affect the overall system?\n\nLet me think differently. Since the problem requires the sum of incoming and outgoing for each node (except ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the direction of each edge in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific conditions: it must be a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), the source vertex has no incoming edges, and the sum of incoming and outgoing flows for each intermediate vertex is equal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Transformation**: Convert the undirected graph into a directed graph by assigning directions to each edge.\n2. **Eulerian Condition**: Ensure that for each intermediate vertex, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows.\n3. **Topological Sorting**: Use a topological sort to determine the direction of edges in a way that respects the flow constraints and avoids cycles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])-1  # 0-based\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])-1\n        idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n    \n    # Assign directions based on a BFS-like approach\n    # Build a graph where edges are stored as tuples (u, v, capacity)\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    reverse_graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for u, v, c in edges:\n        graph[u].append((v, c))\n        reverse_graph[v].append((u, c))\n    \n    # We'll assign directions such that for each edge, if it's part of the residual graph,\n    # it will be directed from u to v or vice versa.\n    # But how to determine which way?\n    # Let's model it as a system where for each node except 1 and n, the in-degree equals out-degree.\n    # So, perhaps, the direction can be determined by finding a spanning tree with certain properties.\n    \n    # Another approach: For each edge, decide whether to direct it u->v or v->u based on some criteria.\n    # For example, if the sum of capacities of edges from u's children (excluding the parent) is less than the sum of edges to other nodes, then u should have an outgoing edge to its parent.\n    \n    # Alternatively, use BFS starting from the source, directing edges towards the sink.\n    # This might work because the sink is the only node that can have an imbalance in its in-degree and out-degree.\n    \n    # Let's try this approach:\n    # 1.
