The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus. They play n rounds, and in each round, the loser gets a red spot. My task is to calculate how many red spots each has after all rounds.\n\nHmm, right. So each round, both choose their move based on their respective sequences. The key is that each uses a cyclic sequence: for example, if A is \"RPS\", then the moves go R, P, S, R, P, S, etc. Similarly for B.\n\nSo for each round i (from 0 to n-1), we need to determine who wins, and increment their red spot count accordingly.\n\nWait, but n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. And the sequences can be up to 1000 characters each. So, we need an efficient way to compute this without doing O(n) operations per step, because 2e5 * 1000 is 2e8, which might be a bit tight for Python.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 2e5 steps with each step taking O(1) would be okay. Because 2e5 is manageable. But if for each step, I have to loop through the sequences to find their current move, that could be expensive. So maybe precompute the move for each player for each possible round.\n\nYes, that makes sense. For example, for each player, create a list where the i-th element is their move for the (i)th round. Then, for each round, just look up their move.\n\nBut how long are these lists? For n=2e5, each list will be 2e5 elements. For each of the two players, that's 4e5 elements in total, which is acceptable in memory.\n\nSo first, let's think about how to generate the move for each round.\n\nFor player A, the sequence is A's string. The moves cycle through the sequence repeatedly. So for round r, the move is A[r % len(A)]. Similarly for B.\n\nSo for each round from 0 to n-1, we can compute a_r = A[r % m] and b_r = B[r % k], where m is len(A), k is len(B).\n\nOnce we have a_r and b_r, we determine the winner of the round.\n\nNow, the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors.\nScissors beat paper.\nPaper beats rock.\n\nIf both choose the same, it's a draw.\n\nSo, for a given a_r and b_r, we need to see who wins.\n\nLet me think about the possible combinations:\n\nCase 1: a_r == b_r → draw. No one gets a point.\n\nElse, check the winning conditions.\n\nAlternatively, I can represent each choice as a number, like:\n\nR = 0\nS = 1\nP = 2\n\nThen, the winning condition is based on the difference. For example, (a - b) mod 3 equals:\n\n(R, S): 0-1 = -1 → mod 3 is 2 → which means R beats S.\n\n(S, P): 1-2 = -1 → mod 3 is 2 → S beats P.\n\n(P, R): 2-0 = 2 → mod 3 is 2 → P beats R.\n\nWait, wait. Hmm, perhaps another way: in each case, the winner is determined by whether (a_r, b_r) follows the winning pattern.\n\nAlternatively, for each a and b, we can precompute who wins.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as a function that returns 1 if a beats b, -1 if b beats a, or 0 for draw.\n\nSo for a given a and b, what is the outcome?\n\nLet's make a helper function.\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0  # draw\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1  # a wins\n    else:\n        return -1  # b wins\n\nYes, that should work. Because:\n\n- If a and b are same, 0.\n\n- Else, check if a beats b according to the rules. If yes, a wins (so a gets a point). Otherwise, b wins (b gets a point).\n\nWait, but wait. When a is R and b is S, a wins. So when a is R, and b is S, the result is a wins. So in code, for a = 'R', b = 'S', the function returns 1, meaning a is the winner.\n\nSo for each round, we get the result (1, -1, or 0). Based on that, we add 1 to the loser's red spot count.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read n, A, B.\n\n2. Precompute for each round i (0 to n-1):\n\n   a_move = A[i % m]\n   b_move = B[i % k]\n\n   Determine who wins.\n\n3. For each round, if someone wins, increment their red spots.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   a = A[i % m]\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n   result = get_winner(a, b)\n\n   if result == 1:\n       polycarpus_loses, so nikephoros gains a point.\n       red_nike +=1\n   elif result == -1:\n       nikephoros loses, so polycarpus gains.\n       red_poly +=1\n   else:\n       do nothing.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when a wins, then the loser is b's player, which is polycarpus. So the red spot goes to polycarpus.\n\nWait no: the problem says that the winner gives the loser a pinch. So if a wins, then polycarpus is the loser, so he gets a red spot.\n\nSimilarly, if b wins, then nikephoros is the loser, gets a red spot.\n\nSo for each round:\n\nif a beats b: poly gets a spot.\n\nif b beats a: nike gets a spot.\n\nelse: no one.\n\nSo for each round, we check if a beats b. If yes, poly loses, so his red spots increase.\n\nElse if b beats a, then nike loses, so his red spots increase.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif a == b:\n    pass\nelse if a beats b:\n    poly +=1\nelse:\n    nike +=1\n\nSo now, the question is how to compute a beats b.\n\nAlternatively, using the helper function, we can get the outcome.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nred_nike = 0\nred_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        # a wins, so poly gets a spot\n        red_poly +=1\n    else:\n        # b wins, so nike gets a spot\n        red_nike +=1\n\nAfter processing all rounds, print red_nike and red_poly.\n\nWait, that's manageable.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5, and for each iteration, the modulo operation is O(1), so it's manageable.\n\nSo, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWait, A is 'RPS' (length 3), B is 'RSPP' (length 4).\n\nSo for each i from 0 to 6:\n\ni=0:\nA[0] = 'R'\nB[0] = 'R' → same → no points.\n\ni=1:\nA[1%3=1] = 'P'\nB[1%4=1] = 'S' → P vs S. Does P beat S? Yes, because S beats P? Wait, no.\n\nWait, the rules:\n\nRock beats Scissors.\n\nScissors beat Paper.\n\nPaper beats Rock.\n\nSo:\n\nIf a is P, and b is S: does P beat S? No. Because S beats P.\n\nWait wait, no. Wait, the rules say:\n\nrock (R) beats scissors (S).\n\nscissors (S) beat paper (P).\n\npaper (P) beats rock (R).\n\nSo, for a = 'P' and b = 'S':\n\nP is paper. S is scissors. Scissors cut paper. So S beats P. So a is P, b is S → b beats a.\n\nSo in this case, when a is P and b is S, the winner is b.\n\nSo for i=1:\n\na is P, b is S → b wins. So nikephoros loses, gets a spot.\n\nWait, no. Because a is P, b is S: S beats P. So in this round, b (Polycarpus) wins, so Nikephoros is the loser and gets a red spot.\n\nSo in this round, red_nike increases by 1.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, the second round is P - S: Nikephoros loses. So yes, that's correct.\n\nIn the sample, after 7 rounds, the output is 3 2.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nLet's list each round.\n\nRound 0: both R → draw.\n\nRound 1: A is P, B is S → S beats P. So Poly wins, Nike gets a spot. So red_nike becomes 1.\n\nRound 2: A is S, B is R → S beats R? Wait, S is scissors, R is rock. Rock beats scissors. So R beats S. So in this round, B is R, A is S. So B (Poly) wins. So red_nike increases by 1, making it 2.\n\nRound 3: A is P (since 3%3=0 → A[0] is R?), wait wait, wait.\n\nWait, A is 'RPS'. So indices are 0: R, 1: P, 2: S. So for i=3, 3%3=0 → A[0] is R.\n\nB is RSPP. Indices 0: R, 1:S, 2:P, 3:P. So for i=3, 3%4=3 → B[3] is P.\n\nSo Round 3: A is R, B is P.\n\nDoes R beat P? Yes. So A wins. So Poly loses, gets a spot. So red_poly becomes 1.\n\nRound 4: i=4.\n\nA: 4%3=1 → P.\n\nB:4%4=0 → R.\n\nSo a is P, b is R. P beats R, so A wins. So Poly loses, red_poly becomes 2.\n\nRound 5: i=5.\n\nA:5%3=2 → S.\n\nB:5%4=1 → S.\n\nSame, so no points.\n\nRound 6: i=6.\n\nA:6%3=0 → R.\n\nB:6%4=2 → P.\n\nR vs P: R is beaten by P? No, because R is rock, P is paper. Paper beats rock. So a is R, b is P → P wins. So B (Poly) wins. So red_nike +=1, making it 3.\n\nSo in total:\n\nNikephoros has 3 red spots.\n\nPoly has 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the logic seems correct.\n\nSo in code, the approach is solid.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this.\n\nSo, in Python, read n, A, B.\n\nCompute len(A) as m, len(B) as k.\n\nInitialize red_nike and red_poly to 0.\n\nLoop for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   a = A[i % m]\n\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n   if a == b:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n           red_poly +=1\n\n       else:\n\n           red_nike +=1\n\nFinally, print red_nike and red_poly.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, considering the constraints, n can be up to 2e5. Each iteration is O(1), so the total time is acceptable.\n\nTesting other edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All draws.\n\nn=100, A='RRR', B='RRR'.\n\nEach round, a == b. So no red spots. Output 0 0.\n\nEdge case 2: One player always wins.\n\nn=2e5, A is 'RRR...R' (all R), B is 'SSS...S'.\n\nIn each round, a is R, b is S. R beats S. So each round, Poly loses. So red_nike will be 2e5, red_poly 0.\n\nAnother edge case: n is 0? But according to input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nWait, input constraints are 1 <= n <= 2e5. So no need to handle n=0.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='R', B='S'.\n\nR beats S, so Poly loses. So output is 0 1.\n\nWait, no: a is R, b is S. a beats b, so Poly (player B) is the loser. So red_poly +=1. So output is 0 1.\n\nWait, wait, no: the problem statement says that the loser gets pinched. So in this case, since R beats S, the loser is the one who played S. So Poly is the one who lost, so he gets a red spot.\n\nSo in the output, red_poly is 1, red_nike is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code correctly handles that.\n\nSo I think the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's implement it.\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nRead A and B as strings.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nInitialize counters.\n\nLoop through each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   a = A[i % m]\n\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n   if a == b: skip.\n\n   else:\n\n       check if a beats b.\n\n       if yes, poly +=1.\n\n       else, nike +=1.\n\nPrint the results.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be something like:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nred_nike = 0\nred_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        red_poly +=1\n    else:\n        red_nike +=1\n\nprint(red_nike, red_poly)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the input lines are given as ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'], which suggests that the actual input lines may have leading or trailing whitespaces, but in reality, the problem statement says that the second line contains the string A, so in code, when reading via input(), we can use .strip() to remove any leading/trailing whitespaces.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the solution should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on both players after they have played a series of Rock-Paper-Scissors games. Each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves, and the loser of each round gets a red spot.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The game is played between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who each follow their own cyclic sequences of moves. The goal is to count the number of times each player loses a round, which results in a red spot on the loser.\n2. **Intuition**: For each round, both players show their respective moves based on their cyclic sequences. The winner of each round is determined by the standard Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. If the same move is shown by both, it's a draw, and no one gets a red spot.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Given that the number of rounds can be very large (up to 200,000), we need an efficient way to determine the outcome of each round without excessive computational overhead. This can be achieved by precomputing the moves for each round using modular arithmetic to cycle through the sequences.\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - Read the input values.\n   - Precompute the moves for each player for all rounds using their respective cyclic sequences.\n   - For each round, determine the winner and update the red spot count accordingly.\n5. **Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of rounds, making it efficient enough to handle the upper constraint of 200,000 rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\nred_nike = 0\nred_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        red_poly += 1\n    else:\n        red_nike += 1\n\nprint(red_nike, red_poly)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n` and the sequences `A` and `B` for each player.\n- **Cyclic Move Calculation**: For each round `i`, the move for each player is determined by their respective sequences using `i % m` for `A` and `i % k` for `B`.\n- **Determine Winner**: For each round, if the moves are different, we check if the first player's move beats the second player's move according to the Rock-Paper-Scissors rules. If so, the second player gets a red spot; otherwise, the first player gets a red spot.\n- **Output**: After processing all rounds, the counts of red spots for each player are printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures that we correctly count the number of losses for each player.",
