    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an array of integers, and we need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, my goal is to remove one element such that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible element to remove, I need to compute the instability of the remaining array and then find the minimum among all those possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 1e5, which is 10^5. If I try to iterate over each element, compute the max and min each time, that would be O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible. That's going to be way too slow. So I need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about what the max and min depend on. The current max and min are determined by the entire array. When I remove an element, the new max could be either the same as the original max (if there are other elements equal to it) or something lower. Similarly, the new min could stay the same or decrease.\n\nWait, but how do I find the best element to remove? Maybe instead of checking every element, I can find some candidates that, when removed, might give the optimal result.\n\nI remember that the maximum and minimum of the array are determined by certain elements. So if I have duplicates for the max, removing one won't change the max. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to consider the cases where the removed element is either the current max, the current min, or another element that might affect the max or min when removed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal solution is to find the second maximum and second minimum, because removing the max might allow the next highest to become the new max, possibly reducing the instability.\n\nWait, let's think with an example. Suppose the array is [1,3,3,7]. The initial max is 7, min is 1. Removing 7 gives [1,3,3], with max 3, min 1, instability 2. If I remove the first 3, the array becomes [1,3,7], which has max 7 and min 1, so instability 6. So in this case, removing the max was better.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is [1, 100000]. Removing either gives a single element, which has instability 0. So in that case, the min is achieved by removing one of the extremes.\n\nSo the optimal strategy seems to involve considering all possible candidates that could affect the max or min when removed.\n\nMaybe the minimal instability will be the minimum among:\n\n- The instability when removing the global max.\n- The instability when removing the global min.\n- The instability when removing the second max and see if the new max is higher than before, etc.\n\nWait, but how do I find the second max and second min efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n- The initial instability minus the contribution of the element being removed.\n\nWait, not sure. Let's think differently.\n\nWhat's the effect of removing an element 'x' on the max and min?\n\nIf x is the current max, then after removal, the new max is the next highest element. Similarly, if x is the current min, the new min is the next lowest.\n\nIf x is neither, then the max remains the same, and the min remains the same unless x is the only min or something.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose the array has multiple mins. Then removing one of them doesn't change the min. But if the array has only one min, then removing it will make the new min the next lowest element.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Find all possible candidates for elements to remove that are either the max, the min, or the second max, or the second min.\n\nThen, for each candidate, compute the instability of the array after removing it, and choose the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find the second max and second min?\n\nWell, we can precompute the sorted list of the array. Then, the second max is the second largest element, and the second min is the second smallest.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because the second max is the largest element that is less than the max. So, for example, in [7,7,3], the max is 7, and the second max is also 7.\n\nSimilarly, the second min is the smallest element that is larger than the min.\n\nHmm, so to find the second max and second min, I can sort the array and then pick the appropriate elements.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n\n2. Compute the initial max and min, which is the last and first elements.\n\n3. Consider all possible candidates for removal:\n\n   a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently finding the second maximum and second minimum values, which are crucial for determining the effect of removing an element.\n2. **Identify Key Elements**: The key elements to consider for removal are the current maximum, current minimum, the second maximum, and the second minimum. These elements are likely candidates for removal as they can significantly affect the instability.\n3. **Compute Instability for Each Candidate**: For each candidate element (max, min, second max, second min), compute the instability of the resulting array after its removal. Track the minimum instability encountered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na_sorted = sorted(a)\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\ncurrent_max = a_sorted[-1]\ncurrent_min = a_sorted[0]\n\ncandidates = [\n    current_max,\n    current_min,\n    a_sorted[-2],\n    a_sorted[1]\n]\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor x in candidates:\n    new_a = a_sorted.copy()\n    new_a.remove(x)\n    new_max = new_a[-1]\n    new_min = new_a[0]\n    instability = new_max - new_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting allows us to easily access the maximum and minimum values and their nearest neighbors.\n2. **Candidates for Removal**: By considering the maximum, minimum, second maximum, and second minimum, we ensure that we explore all potential reductions in instability.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each candidate, we create a new array by removing the candidate and then compute the new maximum and minimum. This approach ensures we efficiently find the minimum possible instability without checking every possible element, which would be computationally expensive.\n\nThis method efficiently narrows down the candidates for removal, ensuring we find the optimal solution with minimal computational overhead.",
