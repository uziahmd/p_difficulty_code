    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem says that Valera has an array a of n integers. There's also a function f(x) which is the sum of certain elements in a based on the binary representation of x. Specifically, for each bit i in x, if it's 1, we add a_i to f(x). So f(x) is like a bitwise selection of the array elements and summing them up.\n\nOur task is to find the maximum value of f(x) where x is between 0 and m, inclusive. But wait, how is m represented? Oh right, the third input line gives a binary string s0s1...sn-1, which represents m. So first, I need to convert this binary string into its decimal equivalent to get the value of m.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For instance, in the sample input, n is 2, the array is [3,8], and m is 20. The binary of 20 is '11010'. Wait, no, maybe I should look at how m is constructed. Oh right, the binary string is s0 to sn-1, which probably corresponds to bits from least significant to most? Or maybe the other way around. Hmm, perhaps each character in the string represents a bit starting from the 0th position (LSB) to the (n-1)th position (MSB). So for example, the string '11010' would correspond to bits 0 to 3: let's see:\n\nWait, n is 2 in the first sample. So the binary string has two digits. Let's parse it as s0=1, s1=0. So m is (s0 * 2^0) + (s1 * 2^1) = 1*1 + 0*2 =1. So m is 1. That makes sense because in the note, it says x can be up to 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read the binary string and convert it into the decimal value of m.\n2. Then, find all x from 0 to m, compute f(x), and find the maximum.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 105, which is quite large. If m is up to 2^105 -1, that's a huge number. So iterating through every x from 0 to m isn't feasible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, the key here is to find the maximum subset of the a array such that the sum of those a_i's is as large as possible, considering the constraints on x's binary representation.\n\nWait, what defines f(x)? It's the sum of a_i for each bit i set in x. So for each x, f(x) is the sum of a_i where x has the i-th bit set. So f(x) is the sum of a_i multiplied by the bits of x.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where for each bit position, we decide whether to include a_i in the sum or not, but constrained by the fact that the number x must be <= m.\n\nSo the maximum f(x) is the maximum sum of a subset of the a_i's such that the binary representation of the sum corresponds to a number x <= m.\n\nBut how do we model this? It feels similar to a knapsack problem, but with a twist. Each item is a_i, and each \"bit\" can be chosen or not. However, the choices are constrained by the bits of m.\n\nAnother approach: For each bit position, decide whether to take a_i or not, but ensuring that the resulting x doesn't exceed m.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a binary decision for each bit. Since each bit contributes a_i to the sum if it's set, and the rest depends on higher bits.\n\nBut how to represent the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since the maximum x is m, perhaps we can greedily set as many high bits as possible, but ensuring that when a higher bit is set, the lower bits can be set to maximize the sum.\n\nWait, but this might not work because sometimes a higher a_i may be small, making it better to skip it and take more lower a_i's.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each bit from the highest to the lowest, and for each bit, decide whether setting it to 1 will help achieve a higher sum without exceeding m.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let's consider building x bit by bit, starting from the most significant bit down to the least. At each step, we decide whether to set the current bit to 1, provided that doing so doesn't make x exceed m.\n\nIf we set a bit to 1, we can add a_i to the sum. But we also have to consider the bits below. So perhaps, for each bit, we can try setting it to 1 and then see what's the maximum sum possible for the remaining bits, ensuring that the overall x doesn't exceed m.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming approach, where the state is the current bit being considered and whether the prefix so far is equal to m's prefix or less.\n\nWait, yes! That's the way to go. Let's model the DP state as follows:\n\n- dp[i][tight]: the maximum sum achievable when considering bits from i down to 0. The 'tight' flag indicates whether the bits processed so far are exactly matching the prefix of m, or if they are already less than m's prefix.\n\nWhen tight is True, it means that the bits chosen so far for positions higher than i match exactly with m's bits. This imposes that the next bits can't exceed m's corresponding bits.\n\nWhen tight is False, the bits chosen so far are already less than m's, so the remaining bits can be set freely.\n\nSo the recurrence would be something like:\n\nFor each bit position i, starting from the highest (n-1) down to 0:\n\n- If tight is True:\n   - We can choose to set this bit to 1 only if m's i-th bit is 1, and after setting, the new tight condition depends on whether the bit was set to exactly match m's bit.\n   - Alternatively, we can choose not to set this bit, in which case tight remains True because the prefix is still equal to m's.\n\n- If tight is False:\n   - We can choose to set this bit to 1, adding a_i to the sum, and tight remains False because the prefix is already less than m's.\n   - Or, choose not to set it, again tight remains False.\n\nWait, but the bits are ordered from highest to lowest. Let's say the bits are numbered from 0 (LSB) to k-1 (MSB), where k is the length of the binary string.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the binary string is given as s0s1...sn-1. So for n=2, the string is two characters. Which one is the MSB and which is LSB?\n\nIn the first sample, the binary string is '10', which is 2 in binary, but according to the note, m is 20. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, in the first sample, the binary string is '10' which is 2 in decimal, but m is 20. Wait, that's conflicting. Oh wait, no, perhaps the binary string represents m as a binary number where the leftmost digit is the highest bit.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is interpreted as a big-endian number. Like, for the string '10', that would be 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2. But in the first sample, m is 20, which is 10100 in binary. So perhaps the binary string is s_0 is the MSB, s_1 is next, etc. Because the sample input for m is '11010', which is 26 in binary. Wait, but 26 is 11010, but in the note, m is 20. Oh wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the input.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\nWait, n is 2, so the binary string is of length 2. So for m, it's 1*(2^1) + 0*(2^0) = 2. But in the note, x can be up to 20. That doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the binary string.\n\nWait, the note says that in the first test case, m is 20. But the binary string is '10', which is 2. So that suggests that perhaps the binary string is reversed.\n\nAh, yes! Probably, the binary string is given as s_0 is the least significant bit (rightmost) and s_{n-1} is the most significant bit (leftmost). So for the first sample, '10' would be s0=1, s1=0. So m is 1*(2^0) + 0*(2^1) =1. Which matches the note.\n\nWait, but in the second sample, the output is 27. Let me check that.\n\nIn the second sample, the binary string is '11010', which is 5 bits long. So s0 is the LSB, s4 is the MSB.\n\nSo m is s0*(2^0) + s1*(2^1) + s2*(2^2) + s3*(2^3) + s4*(2^4).\n\nBreaking down '11010':\n\ns0=0, s1=1, s2=0, s3=1, s4=1.\n\nSo m = 0*1 +1*2 +0*4 +1*8 +1*16 = 0+2+0+8+16=26.\n\nWait, but the note says m is 20+21+23=11? No, that's not matching. Oh, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the note.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is representing m as a binary number where each character is a bit, with the leftmost being the highest. So for '11010', the binary is 11010, which is 26 in decimal.\n\nBut the note says, for the second sample, m is 20+21+23=11, which is 1011 in binary. Hmm, this doesn't add up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string s0s1...sn-1 represents m as a binary number, but the bits are in reverse order. So s0 is the highest bit, s1 is the next, etc. So for the first sample, '10' represents 10 in binary, which is 2. But in the note, m is 20, which is larger than 2. So that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is that m is the sum of the numbers represented by the binary digits s0 to sn-1, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the binary string is actually the binary representation of m, and the bits are in the same order as the string, but that would require the string to be of length n, which may not be the case.\n\nWait, maybe the binary string is for a number that requires up to n bits. So for n=5, the binary string is 5 bits, which could represent up to 31.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is just a binary representation of m, regardless of n. Because in the first sample, n=2, and the binary string is 2 bits, but m is 1, which is 1 in binary, which is 1 bit. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is s0s1...sn-1, and m is computed as s0*2^{n-1} + s1*2^{n-2} + ... + sn-1*2^0. So for the first sample, n=2, the string is '10', which is 1*2^1 + 0*2^0 = 2. But in the note, m is 20, which is larger. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is a binary number, and m is that number. So for the first sample, the binary string is '10', which is 2 in decimal. But in the note, x can be up to 20, which is 20>2. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe third line contains a sequence of digits zero and one without spaces s0s1...sn-1 — the binary representation of number m.\n\nSo m is equal to the binary number formed by the string s0s1...sn-1.\n\nWait, but then for the first sample, the binary string is '10', which is 2, but the note says m is 20, which is 10100 in binary, 5 bits. So that suggests that the binary string is longer than n bits.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is not of length n, but the problem statement says it's s0s1...sn-1, so the length is exactly n. So perhaps the initial understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is interpreted as the binary representation of m, and it's not necessarily of length n. So for example, in the first sample, the binary string is '10' which is 2, but m is 20. So that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is for m, which is a number, but the length of the string is up to n bits. So for n=5, m can be up to 2^5-1=31. So in the first sample, the binary string is 2 bits, but m is 20, which is 10100 in binary (5 bits). That would mean that the binary string is longer than n, but the problem statement says it's s0s1...sn-1, which implies that the length is exactly n.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should re-examine the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['2\\n3 8\\n10', '5\\n17 0 10 2 1\\n11010']\n\nWait, the third line is the binary string for m. So for the first case, n=2, the binary string is '10', which is 2 in decimal. But the note says that m is 20. So 2 !=20. That's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misreading the sample. Let me check the sample input again.\n\nWait, perhaps the third line is for m, but the binary string is longer than n bits. Because in the first sample, the binary string is '10', but m is 20. So perhaps the binary string is not of length n, but the problem statement says it is. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is for m, but the length is not necessarily n. But the problem statement says the third line is s0s1...sn-1, which implies that it's of length n.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is s0s1...sn-1, which is a binary number with n bits, but the value of m is equal to that binary number. So for the first sample, the binary string is '10', which is 2, but the note says m is 20. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the note is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the binary string is s0s1...sn-1, but the value of m is the integer whose binary representation is the string. So for the first sample, '10' is 2, but the note says m is 20. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe the note is talking about a different scenario. Or perhaps the note is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the binary string is a binary number that is exactly n bits long, which may have leading zeros. So for the first sample, '10' is 2, which is 10 in binary, and n=2. So m is 2, but the note says m is 20, which is 10100, 5 bits. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the binary string is reversed. So for the first sample, '10' is interpreted as 01, which is 1. So m is 1. Which matches the note.\n\nYes! So in the first sample, the binary string is '10', which when reversed is '01', which is 1 in decimal. So m is 1.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sample, the binary string is '11010', which when reversed is '01011' (but wait, that would be 5 bits). Wait, no: the string is s0s1s2s3s4, which is 5 characters. Reversed, it's s4 s3 s2 s1 s0. So '11010' reversed is '01011', which is 11 in decimal.\n\nWait, no, wait: '11010' as a string has 5 bits. When reversed, it's '01011', which is 0*16 + 1*8 + 0*4 + 1*2 +1*1 = 8+2+1=11.\n\nAh, that makes sense. So the note says that m is 20 +21+23=11. So that's 11. So yes, the binary string is s0s1...sn-1, which when reversed is the binary representation of m.\n\nSo the correct way to compute m is to reverse the binary string, interpret it as a binary number, and that's m.\n\nSo for the first sample, the binary string is '10' reversed is '01' which is 1, so m=1.\n\nIn the second sample, the binary string is '11010' reversed is '01011' which is 11 in decimal.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. Read the binary string.\n2. Reverse it to get the binary representation of m.\n3. Compute m as the decimal value of this reversed string.\n\nThat's important.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding x in [0, m], such that f(x) is maximized, where f(x) is the sum of a_i for each bit i set in x.\n\nConstraints:\n\nn can be up to 105, which means that m can be up to 2^105, which is a very large number. So iterating through all x from 0 to m is impossible.\n\nThus, we need a dynamic programming approach.\n\nSo the plan is to model the problem using dynamic programming, tracking for each bit position whether the current bits chosen are exactly matching the bits of m, or are less than m.\n\nWe'll model the DP state as:\n\ndp[i][tight]: the maximum sum achievable considering the first i bits (from highest to lowest) and whether the bits chosen so far are exactly matching m's prefix (tight=True) or are less than m's prefix (tight=False).\n\nThe transitions will be as follows:\n\nFor each bit position i (starting from the highest), and for each state (tight or not):\n\nCase 1: Current state is tight.\n\nAt this point, the bits chosen so far match the first i bits of m. Now, for the i-th bit, we can choose to set it or not.\n\n- If we set it to 1:\n\n   Check if m's i-th bit is 1.\n\n   If yes, then we can set it to 1, and proceed to the next state. The new tightness depends on whether the current bit is set to exactly match m's bit. Since in this case, the bit is set to 1 (same as m's bit), the next state remains tight.\n\n   If no, then setting it to 1 would make x exceed m. So this is not allowed.\n\n- If we don't set it to 1:\n\n   Then, the next state remains tight because the bits so far are still matching m's prefix.\n\nCase 2: Current state is not tight.\n\nHere, the bits chosen so far are less than m's prefix, so any choice of bits for the remaining positions is allowed. So for the current bit, we can choose to set it or not, whichever gives a higher sum.\n\nSo for each state, we explore both possibilities (set or not set), and track the maximum sum.\n\nThe base case is when we've processed all bits. The sum is then the accumulated value.\n\nBut wait, how do we represent the bits? Since the binary string is reversed, the first bit in the DP corresponds to the highest bit of m.\n\nWait, perhaps the bits are processed from the highest to the lowest. So for example, the binary string '11010' reversed is '01011', which is 5 bits: 0 (bit 4), 1 (bit 3), 0 (bit 2), 1 (bit 1), 1 (bit 0). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the reversed string is '01011', which is 5 bits. So the first character in the reversed string is the highest bit. So when processing, we start from the highest bit (position 4) to the lowest (position 0).\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to process the bits in order from the highest (leftmost after reversal) to the lowest (rightmost after reversal). So for the reversed string, the first character is the highest bit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the bits as a list, where the 0th index is the highest bit (since the reversed string starts with the highest bit).\n\nSo for the reversed string, the first character is the highest bit.\n\nSo, for example, the reversed string '01011' is:\n\nbit 4: 0\n\nbit 3: 1\n\nbit 2: 0\n\nbit 1: 1\n\nbit 0: 1\n\nSo, the highest bit is bit 4, then bit 3, etc.\n\nThus, the DP will process the bits from highest (bit n-1) to lowest (bit 0).\n\nNow, the DP state is dp[i][tight], where i is the current bit being processed, and tight is whether the bits up to i are exactly equal to m's prefix.\n\nThe initial state is dp[n][True] = 0, but that's not quite right. Wait, perhaps the initial state is before processing any bits, so i starts from the highest bit (n-1) and goes down to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is dp[bit][tight], where bit starts from the highest (say, 104 for n=105) down to 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the DP as follows:\n\nInitialize the DP for the (n)th bit (after all bits have been processed), with sum 0.\n\nThen, for each bit from n-1 downto 0:\n\n   For each possible state (tight or not):\n\n      For each possible choice (set bit or not):\n\n         Compute the new state and update the DP accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the bits in a list, with the 0th element being the highest bit.\n\nSo, for the reversed binary string, we create a list of bits, where bits[0] is the highest bit, bits[1] is the next, etc., up to bits[n-1], which is the lowest bit.\n\nThen, the DP will process from i=0 to i=n-1.\n\nWait, no. Because when you reverse the string, the first character is the highest bit. So for the reversed string, the first character is the highest bit. So, for example, the string '10' reversed is '01', which represents 1 in binary (1*2^0 + 0*2^1 =1). So the bits are [0,1], meaning bit 0 is 0, bit 1 is 1. So the highest bit is bit 1.\n\nThus, in the DP, we process the bits from the highest (bit n-1) to the lowest (bit 0). So for each bit i, starting from n-1 down to 0.\n\nWait, but the reversed string has n bits. So for the DP, we process each bit from the highest (i = n-1) down to 0.\n\nSo the initial state is before processing any bits. So for i = n, the sum is 0, and the tightness is True (since no bits have been processed yet). Or perhaps, the initial state is for i = n-1, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial state is for i = n, sum 0, tight is True. Then, for each i from n-1 downto 0, we process each state.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the binary string s, reverse it to get m's binary representation.\n\n2. Convert this reversed string into a list of integers, where each element is 0 or 1. Let's call this list 'bits'.\n\n3. Initialize the DP table. The DP can be represented as a dictionary or a 2D array. Since the number of bits is up to 105, and the tightness is a boolean (True/False), the DP can be a 2D array where dp[i][tight] represents the maximum sum achievable after processing the first i bits.\n\n4. For each bit i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n   For each possible state (tight is True or False):\n\n      For each possible choice (set the bit to 1 or not):\n\n         Compute the new tightness and update the DP.\n\nSo, more concretely:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (n) x 2. Initially, dp[i][tight] is -infinity for all except dp[n][True] = 0.\n\nWait, no. Because for the nth bit, after processing all bits, the sum is 0, and the tightness is True (since we haven't set any bits yet, so we're exactly matching m's prefix).\n\nThen, for each i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n   For each tight in [True, False]:\n\n      If dp[i][tight] is not -infinity:\n\n          current_max_sum = dp[i][tight]\n\n          // Try setting this bit to 1:\n\n          if tight is True:\n\n              // Can we set this bit to 1?\n\n              if bits[i] == 1:\n\n                  // Yes, we can set it to 1.\n\n                  new_tight = True if (current_bit is 1 and the next bits are processed in a way that continues to be tight)\n\n                  // Wait, no. After setting this bit to 1, the next state's tightness depends on whether this bit is exactly matching m's bit.\n\n                  // So, if in the current state, tight is True, and we set this bit to 1, which is equal to m's bit, then the new tightness is True.\n\n                  // Else, if we set it to 1 when m's bit is 0, it's invalid.\n\n                  // So in tight state, when considering setting this bit to 1:\n\n                  if bits[i] == 1:\n\n                      // Then, we can set it, and the new tightness is True.\n\n                      new_sum = current_max_sum + a_i\n\n                      if new_sum > dp[i+1][True]:\n\n                          dp[i+1][True] = new_sum\n\n                  else:\n\n                      // Can't set it to 1, because m's bit is 0.\n\n                      // So do nothing.\n\n          else:\n\n              // Tight is False, so any choice is allowed.\n\n              // Set the bit to 1, adding a_i.\n\n              new_sum = current_max_sum + a_i\n\n              if new_sum > dp[i+1][False]:\n\n                  dp[i+1][False] = new_sum\n\n          // Now, try not setting this bit.\n\n          // Whether tight is True or False, not setting allows us to proceed.\n\n          new_sum = current_max_sum\n\n          if new_sum > dp[i+1][tight]:\n\n              dp[i+1][tight] = new_sum\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the transitions wrong. Let me think again.\n\nIn each step, for a given bit i and state tight, I can choose to set the bit to 1 or not.\n\nIf I choose to set it to 1:\n\n   If in tight state:\n\n      - The current bit i in m is bits[i].\n\n      - If bits[i] is 1, then setting this bit to 1 is allowed. The new state's tightness is whether the previous bits were tight and the current bit is exactly equal to m's.\n\n      - So, if bits[i] is 1, then after setting, the new tightness is True.\n\n      - Else, if bits[i] is 0, setting it to 1 would make x exceed m, so this choice is invalid.\n\n   If not in tight state:\n\n      - We can set the bit to 1, since x is already less than m. The new state remains not tight.\n\nIf I choose not to set it:\n\n   The new state's tightness remains the same as the current state.\n\nSo, for each possible choice (set or not), we calculate the new state and update the DP accordingly.\n\nSo, the transitions are:\n\nFor each i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n   for each tight in [True, False]:\n\n       if dp[i][tight] is not -infinity:\n\n           // Option 1: set this bit to 1.\n\n           if tight:\n\n               if bits[i] == 1:\n\n                   // Can set it.\n\n                   new_tight = True\n\n                   new_sum = dp[i][tight] + a_i\n\n                   if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_tight]:\n\n                       dp[i+1][new_tight] = new_sum\n\n               else:\n\n                   // Cannot set it, as it would exceed m.\n\n                   pass\n\n           else:\n\n               // Can set it, as x is already less than m.\n\n               new_tight = False\n\n               new_sum = dp[i][tight] + a_i\n\n               if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_tight]:\n\n                   dp[i+1][new_tight] = new_sum\n\n           // Option 2: do not set this bit.\n\n           new_tight = tight\n\n           new_sum = dp[i][tight]\n\n           if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_tight]:\n\n               dp[i+1][new_tight] = new_sum\n\nWait, but in the tight state, when you choose not to set the bit, the new_tight remains True only if the current bit is equal to m's bit. Otherwise, it's already handled.\n\nNo, because if the current state is tight, and you choose not to set the bit, then the new state's tightness is the same as the current state, because the bit hasn't been set to anything. Wait, no: if the current state is tight, which means the bits processed so far are equal to m's prefix. When you choose not to set the current bit, the new state's tightness depends on whether the current bit is set to 0 or 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that in the tight state, you can choose to set the current bit to 0 or 1, but only if the choice doesn't exceed m's bits.\n\nSo, for the tight state:\n\n- You can choose to set the bit to 0 or 1, but only if setting it to 1 does not make x exceed m's bits.\n\nWait, but the current state is tight, which means that the bits processed so far are exactly equal to m's prefix. So for the current bit i, if you set it to 1, then the new state's tightness depends on whether this bit is equal to m's bit.\n\nIf m's bit is 1, then setting it to 1 keeps the state tight.\n\nIf m's bit is 0, setting it to 1 makes x exceed m, which is not allowed.\n\nThus, for the tight state:\n\n- Setting to 1: allowed only if m's bit is 1.\n\n- Setting to 0: allowed, and the new state's tightness is True, because the current bit is set to 0, same as m's.\n\nWait, no. Because if the current state is tight (exact match so far), and you set the current bit to 0, which is less than m's bit, then the new state becomes not tight.\n\nWait, no. Because if m's bit is 1 and you set it to 0, then x is now less than m, so the new state is not tight.\n\nWait, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the tight state:\n\n- For the current bit i:\n\n   If you set it to 1:\n\n      Only allowed if bits[i] is 1.\n\n      The new state is tight (since the bit is equal to m's bit).\n\n   Else (set to 0):\n\n      The new state is not tight, because x is now less than m.\n\nSo, for the tight state, the choice to set the bit to 0 is always allowed, but it changes the state to not tight.\n\nSo, in the DP, for each transition:\n\nWhen in tight state:\n\n   option 1: set to 1.\n\n      if bits[i] is 1:\n\n          new_sum = current_sum + a_i\n\n          new_tight = True\n\n          update dp[i+1][new_tight] with new_sum.\n\n   option 2: set to 0.\n\n      new_sum = current_sum\n\n      new_tight = False\n\n      update dp[i+1][new_tight] with new_sum.\n\nWhen in not tight state:\n\n   option 1: set to 1.\n\n      new_sum = current_sum + a_i\n\n      new_tight = False\n\n      update dp[i+1][new_tight] with new_sum.\n\n   option 2: set to 0.\n\n      new_sum = current_sum\n\n      new_tight = False\n\n      update dp[i+1][new_tight] with new_sum.\n\nWait, no. Because in the not tight state, the x is already less than m, so any choice of bits is allowed. So setting to 1 or 0, the state remains not tight.\n\nSo for the not tight state:\n\n- Both options (set to 1 or 0) lead to new_tight = False.\n\nSo, the transitions are:\n\nif tight:\n\n   if bits[i] is 1:\n\n       // can set to 1, new_tight is True.\n\n       new_sum = current_sum + a_i\n\n       dp[i+1][True] = max(dp[i+1][True], new_sum)\n\n   // set to 0, new_tight is False.\n\n   new_sum = current_sum\n\n   dp[i+1][False] = max(dp[i+1][False], new_sum)\n\nelse:\n\n   // can set to 1 or 0, both are allowed.\n\n   // set to 1:\n\n   new_sum = current_sum + a_i\n\n   dp[i+1][False] = max(dp[i+1][False], new_sum)\n\n   // set to 0:\n\n   new_sum = current_sum\n\n   dp[i+1][False] = max(dp[i+1][False], new_sum)\n\nWait, but in the tight state, when you set to 0, you can't just set it to 0 and leave new_tight as True. Because if the current bit is 0, but m's bit is 1, then x is now less than m, so the new state is not tight.\n\nSo, the transition for tight state is:\n\n- set to 1: allowed only if bits[i] is 1, new_tight is True.\n\n- set to 0: allowed, new_tight is False.\n\nSo, in code terms:\n\nfor each i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n    for each tight in [True, False]:\n\n        if dp[i][tight] is not -inf:\n\n            // try setting bit i to 1\n\n            if tight:\n\n                if bits[i] == 1:\n\n                    // can set to 1\n\n                    new_tight = True\n\n                    new_sum = dp[i][tight] + a_i\n\n                    if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_tight]:\n\n                        dp[i+1][new_tight] = new_sum\n\n                else:\n\n                    // cannot set to 1, since m's bit is 0 and tight is True\n\n                    pass\n\n            else:\n\n                // not tight, can set to 1\n\n                new_sum = dp[i][tight] + a_i\n\n                if new_sum > dp[i+1][False]:\n\n                    dp[i+1][False] = new_sum\n\n            // try not setting bit i\n\n            new_sum = dp[i][tight]\n\n            new_tight = tight\n\n            if new_sum > dp[i+1][new_tight]:\n\n                dp[i+1][new_tight] = new_sum\n\nWait, but in the not tight state, setting the bit to 0 is allowed, but it doesn't change the tightness.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle all these cases.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, the maximum value is the maximum of dp[0][True] and dp[0][False], but wait, after processing all bits, the state is i = n, so the maximum is the maximum of dp[n][True] and dp[n][False]. But initially, dp[n][True] is 0, and others are -infinity.\n\nWait, no. Because when i is processed from n-1 downto 0, after processing all bits, i+1 would be n.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial state is dp[n][True] = 0, and other states are -infinity.\n\nThen, for each i from n-1 downto 0:\n\n   process transitions to i+1.\n\nAfter processing all bits, the maximum is the maximum of dp[0][True] and dp[0][False], but wait, no. Because after processing all bits, the state is i = n, which is beyond the last bit.\n\nSo, the maximum is the maximum of dp[n][True] and dp[n][False].\n\nWait, but dp[n][True] is the sum after processing all bits and being tight (so x equals m). dp[n][False] is the sum after processing all bits and x is less than m.\n\nSo the maximum is the maximum of these two.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n",
