She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has several tabs open in her browser and wants to close some of them. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nShe starts with n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can perform one of two actions:\n1. Move the cursor left or right. But she can't move beyond the currently available tabs because some may already be closed.\n2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position.\n\nSo, for example, if she's at position i, closing to the left would close all tabs before i, but only those that haven't been closed yet. Similarly for the right.\n\nHmm, so the process involves moving the cursor to certain positions and then performing the close operations.\n\nThe task is to find the minimal time (seconds) needed to do this.\n\nFirst, let's think about when no tabs need to be closed. Like, if l=1 and r=n, meaning all tabs are needed. Then the answer is 0, because nothing needs to be done.\n\nBut in other cases, we need to figure out how many moves and closes are required.\n\nLet me break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. Determine which tabs need to be closed. These are the ones less than l and greater than r.\n   So, any tab < l and > r must be closed.\n\n2. For each such region (left of l and right of r), decide the optimal way to close them.\n\nWait, but the order might matter. Like, maybe it's better to close the left first, then the right, or vice versa.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are as follows:\n\n- Move the cursor to a position where she can close the left tabs efficiently.\n- Perform the close left operation.\n- Then, move to a position to close the right tabs.\n- Perform the close right operation.\n\nAlternatively, she could do it in reverse: close the right first, then the left.\n\nWe need to calculate the minimal time for both options and choose the smaller one.\n\nAdditionally, there might be cases where she doesn't need to close either side, like if l=1 and r=n. Or if the initial position is already inside the desired segment.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check if the current state is already acceptable. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, calculate the steps required for both possible orders of closing (left first, then right; or right first, then left) and take the minimum of the two.\n\nWait, but sometimes she might not need to do both. For example, if l=1 and r=n, but maybe she needs to close only one side.\n\nWait, no. Because if l=1 and r=n, that means she needs to keep all the tabs. So no action is needed.\n\nBut in general, she needs to close tabs on both sides if l>1 and r<n.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nSuppose l=2 and r=4 in a case where n=6. Then, she needs to close tabs 1 and 5 and 6. So, she has to close both left and right.\n\nAnother example: if l=1 and r=3, then she needs to close the right of 3 (tabs 4,5,6). So only the right needs to be closed.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in this case, l=1, r=3. So the desired tabs are 1,2,3. So she must close all tabs higher than 3, which are 4,5,6. So she has to close the right.\n\nSimilarly, if l=3 and r=6, then she must close the left tabs (1,2).\n\nSo, depending on the values of l and r, she might need to close left, right, or both.\n\nWait, no. Because if l=3 and r=5 in a case where n=6, then she needs to close tabs 1,2 (left) and 6 (right). So both sides.\n\nSo, for the problem, the first thing is to determine whether she needs to close left, right, or both.\n\nSo, let's model the problem:\n\nCompute the set of tabs that need to be closed. They are the union of:\n\n- Tabs less than l: [1, l-1]\n- Tabs greater than r: [r+1, n]\n\nIf either of these sets is non-empty, she needs to close them.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Determine if the initial state is already acceptable (i.e., l=1, r=n). If yes, return 0.\n\n2. Else, compute whether she needs to close left, right, or both.\n\n3. For each possible combination of closing (like left first, then right; or right first, then left), compute the time required.\n\n4. Take the minimum of the times across all possible valid orders.\n\nWait, but what are the possible combinations? Since she can choose to close left, then right, or right then left.\n\nBut also, in some cases, she might not need to close both. Like, if she's only required to close left, then she just needs to handle that.\n\nWait, no. Because if l=2 and r=4, then she needs to close 1 (left) and 5,6 (right). So she must close both.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Compute whether she needs to close left (if l>1) and/or right (if r <n).\n\nThen, based on that, decide the steps.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nhas_left = (l > 1)\n\nhas_right = (r < n)\n\nSo, cases:\n\n- Case 1: has_left is false and has_right is false: do nothing.\n\n- Case 2: has_left is true and has_right is true: need to close both.\n\n- Case 3: has_left is true, has_right is false: close only left.\n\n- Case 4: has_left is false, has_right is true: close only right.\n\nSo, for each case, the steps vary.\n\nNow, for each case, how to compute the time.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved when both left and right need to be closed.\n\nFor example, she starts at pos. She can move to the left end, then close left. Then move to the right end, then close right.\n\nAlternatively, she can move to the right end, close right, then move to the left end, close left. Which is better?\n\nOr perhaps another path.\n\nWait, but the initial position is given. So, let's model it as:\n\nTime is calculated as the sum of moving steps and the close steps.\n\nEach movement is a single second, as is each close.\n\nSo, for closing left first:\n\nShe needs to move to the position x, which is l, because to close the left, she needs to be at l (since after closing, all tabs to the left of l will be closed, but l itself remains). Wait, no: if she's at position x, closing left will close all tabs to the left of x. So, to close the tabs less than l, she can be at any position >= l. So, the optimal point is to be at l, because any further left movement isn't necessary.\n\nWait, no. Because if she's at l, closing left will close all tabs before l, which is exactly what is needed. So, for the left part, she needs to reach a position >= l, but preferably l, because then she can close the left without needing to move again.\n\nWait, perhaps being at l is sufficient.\n\nSo, for closing the left:\n\nShe needs to move from the current position to a position >= l, and then close left.\n\nSimilarly, for closing the right: she needs to move to a position <= r, then close right.\n\nSo, for the case where she needs to close both left and right:\n\nOption 1:\n\nClose left first, then close right.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move from pos to l: distance is |pos - l| steps.\n\n- Close left: 1 second.\n\n- Then, move from l to r: distance is |r - l| steps.\n\n- Close right: 1 second.\n\nTotal: |pos-l| + 1 + |r-l| + 1 = |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nOption 2:\n\nClose right first, then close left.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move from pos to r: |pos - r| steps.\n\n- Close right: 1 second.\n\n- Move from r to l: |r - l| steps.\n\n- Close left: 1 second.\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nWhich option is better? It depends on which of |pos - l| + |r - l| or |pos - r| + |r - l| is smaller.\n\nWait, because |pos - l| could be larger than |pos - r|, depending on where pos is relative to l and r.\n\nWait, let's take an example:\n\nSuppose pos is between l and r.\n\nLike l=2, r=4, pos=3.\n\nOption 1:\n\nMove to 2: 1 step.\n\nClose left: 1.\n\nMove to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right: 1.\n\nTotal: 1+1+1+1=4.\n\nOption 2:\n\nMove to 4: 1 step.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nMove to 2: 2 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5. So option 1 is better.\n\nAnother example: l=2, r=4, pos=1.\n\nOption1:\n\nMove to 2: 1 step.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nMove to4: 2 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nOption2:\n\nMove to4: 3 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nMove to2: 2 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal: 3+1+2+1=7.\n\nSo option1 is better.\n\nAnother example: pos is to the right of r.\n\nE.g., l=2, r=4, pos=5.\n\nOption1:\n\nMove to 2: 3 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nMove to4: 2 steps.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nTotal:3+1+2+1=7.\n\nOption2:\n\nMove to4:1 step.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nMove to2:2 steps.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal:1+1+2+1=5.\n\nSo option2 is better here.\n\nAh, so the choice of which order to close can affect the total time.\n\nSo, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the minimal time is the minimum of the two options.\n\nSo, for general cases, the time for option1 is (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2.\n\nOption2 is (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l) + 2.\n\nWait, no: the distance from l to r is |r - l|.\n\nWait, for option1, after closing left, she's at l. To get to r, she has to move |r - l| steps.\n\nSimilarly for option2, after closing right, she's at r. Then she moves to l, which is |r - l| steps.\n\nSo, for each option, the sum is |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2 and |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nWait, but |r - l| is the same in both cases. So, the difference is in the first terms.\n\nSo, the minimal time is min( (|pos - l| + |r - l| ), (|pos - r| + |r - l| )) + 2.\n\nWait, no. Because |r - l| is added in both cases, so it's part of the fixed cost. So the variable part is |pos - l| and |pos - r|.\n\nSo, the minimal between (|pos - l| and |pos - r| ) plus 2*(fixed parts) is not correct. Let me re-calculate:\n\nOption1: (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2.\n\nThat's |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSimilarly, option2: |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo, the total time is (|pos - l| + (r - l)) + 2 OR (|pos - r| + (r - l)) + 2.\n\nWait, but wait, r - l is fixed, so the difference comes from |pos - l| vs |pos - r|.\n\nSo, which one is better depends on which is smaller between |pos - l| and |pos - r|.\n\nWait, no. Because when you add (r-l) to each, it's a constant. So, the minimal time is the minimal between (|pos - l| + (r - l)) and (|pos - r| + (r - l)).\n\nWait, for example:\n\nCase where pos is between l and r:\n\npos is 3, l=2, r=4. So |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1. So both options give (1+2)=3 and (1+2)=3, plus 2, total 5 each.\n\nBut earlier example showed that option1 could be better.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let's take l=2, r=4, pos=3.\n\nOption1: move to 2 (1 step), close left (1), move to4 (1 step), close right (1). Total steps 4.\n\nOption2: move to4 (1 step), close right (1), move to2 (2 steps), close left (1). Total steps 5.\n\nSo option1 is better. According to the formula, the time is (1+2)+2=5, but in reality it's 4.\n\nWait, so my previous formula is incorrect.\n\nAh, because when you close left, the movement from l to r is |r - l| steps, which is (4-2)=2 steps. So, in option1, the movement is 1 (from pos to l) + 2 (l to r) = 3, plus 2 for the close operations, total 5. But actual steps are 4.\n\nHmm, so my formula is overcounting. So perhaps I need to model it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the movement steps should be the distance from pos to l, plus the distance from l to r (but wait, after closing left, she is at l, right? So, moving from l to r is |r - l| steps. So the total movement is (|pos - l| + |r - l|) steps.\n\nPlus 2 for the two close operations.\n\nWait, in the first example, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\n|3-2|=1, |4-2|=2.\n\nTotal movement: 3 steps.\n\nPlus 2 close steps: 5.\n\nBut in reality, the steps were 4.\n\nAh, so perhaps the movement is not |pos - l| + |r - l|, but |pos - l| + (r - l) (since r > l, it's r - l steps).\n\nWait, but in the example, moving from l to r is 2 steps, which is correct.\n\nBut the initial movement from pos=3 to l=2 is 1 step, then from l=2 to r=4 is 2 steps. So total movement is 3 steps.\n\nPlus the two close steps: 1+1=2.\n\nTotal 5.\n\nBut the actual steps were 4.\n\nHmm, why is that?\n\nBecause when she moves from l=2 to r=4, she does it in 2 steps, but that's after closing the left. So, the movement is allowed within the existing tabs.\n\nWait, perhaps the model is that after closing left, the a becomes l, and b remains as the current r, which is 4. So, moving from l=2 to r=4 is allowed.\n\nSo, the movement steps are correctly accounted for.\n\nBut why in the example, the actual steps were 4 instead of 5.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, in the example where pos is 3, l=2, r=4.\n\nOption1:\n\n- Move from 3 to 2: 1 step.\n\n- Close left: 1 sec. Now, all tabs <2 are closed. So a=2.\n\n- Then, move from 2 to 4: 2 steps.\n\n- Close right: 1 sec. Now, all tabs >4 are closed. So b=4.\n\nTotal steps: 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nWhich matches the formula.\n\nBut earlier thought said the steps were 4. That was incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps I had a mistake in thinking about the steps.\n\nSo, the formula is correct.\n\nThus, for both options, the time is:\n\nOption1: (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nOption2: (distance from pos to r) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo, the minimal time is the minimum of these two.\n\nSo, in code, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the time is min( (abs(pos - l) + (r - l)) + 2, (abs(pos - r) + (r - l)) + 2 )\n\nWait, no. Because (r-l) is added in both cases. So, the minimal is between the two options' movement steps.\n\nSo, let's calculate both and pick the minimal.\n\nNow, what about cases where she needs to close only left or only right?\n\nCase: has_left is true, has_right is false.\n\nSo, she needs to close all tabs to the left of l.\n\nHow to do that:\n\nShe can move from pos to l, then close left.\n\nTime is: distance from pos to l + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if she's at a position that is already >= l, but she needs to close the left.\n\nWait, suppose she is at a position >= l, but needs to close the left. She can close the left directly.\n\nWait, because closing left when she's at l will close all tabs before l.\n\nBut if she's at a position higher than l, then closing left will also close the tabs before that position, which may include l. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, no. Because if she's at position x, which is >= l, then closing left will close all tabs to the left of x. So, if x is l, then it closes tabs 1 to l-1.\n\nBut if x is higher than l, say x = l+1, then closing left will close all tabs to the left of l+1, which includes l. But l is part of the desired segment. So, that's not allowed.\n\nAh! So, she cannot close the left if she's at a position higher than l. Because that would close l as well, which is needed.\n\nSo, she must be at exactly position l when she closes the left.\n\nBecause otherwise, she'll close l and other tabs, which she shouldn't.\n\nSo, in order to close the left, she must be at l, and then close left.\n\nSimilarly, to close the right, she must be at r, and then close right.\n\nSo, for the case where she needs to close left only:\n\nTime is the distance from pos to l, plus 1 (close left).\n\nSimilarly for right only.\n\nBut wait, what about when she is already at l or r?\n\nIn that case, the movement is zero, and she can close immediately.\n\nSo, for the case of closing left only:\n\nTime is max(0, l - pos) + 1 if pos <= l.\n\nWait, no. Because if she is at a position less than l, she needs to move to l, then close left.\n\nWait, no. Wait, l is the starting point of the desired segment. So, to close the left, she must be at l.\n\nBecause if she's at a position higher than l, closing left would close more than just the left of the desired segment.\n\nSo, she has to be at l when she closes the left.\n\nSo, the movement is |pos - l|.\n\nThen, the close takes 1 second.\n\nSame for closing right: she must be at r, then close.\n\nSo, for the case where only left needs to be closed:\n\ntime = |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, for only right: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nWait, but what if she's already at l or r?\n\nLike, if pos == l: then movement is 0, time is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now, putting it all together.\n\nThe algorithm is:\n\n1. Check if l == 1 and r == n. If yes, output 0.\n\n2. Else, compute has_left and has_right.\n\n   has_left = l > 1\n\n   has_right = r < n\n\n3. Based on has_left and has_right, compute the time.\n\n   a. If neither has_left nor has_right: time is 0.\n\n   b. If has_left is true and has_right is true:\n\n      compute option1: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\n      compute option2: |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\n      time is min(option1, option2).\n\n   c. If has_left is true and has_right is false:\n\n      time is |pos - l| + 1.\n\n   d. If has_left is false and has_right is true:\n\n      time is |pos - r| + 1.\n\n   e. If both are false: time is 0.\n\nWait, no: in case 3a, if neither has_left nor has_right, it's because l=1 and r=n. So, time is 0.\n\nWait, but how can has_left and has_right both be false? Only when l=1 and r=n.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, let's structure the code accordingly.\n\nTesting this logic against examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nhas_left = 2>1 → True.\n\nhas_right=4<6 → True.\n\nSo, both need to be closed.\n\noption1: |3-2| + (4-2) +2 =1 +2 +2=5.\n\noption2: |3-4| + 2 +2=1+2+2=5.\n\nSo, time is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nSo, l=1, r=3.\n\nhas_left: 1>1? No → False.\n\nhas_right: 3 <6 → True.\n\nSo, only right needs to be closed.\n\nTime is |3-3| +1=0+1=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample:\n\n5 2 1 5.\n\nSo, l=1, r=5.\n\nhas_left: 1>1? No.\n\nhas_right:5<5? No.\n\nSo, time is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=4.\n\nhas_left: 2>1 → True.\n\nhas_right:4<5 → True.\n\nSo, both need to be closed.\n\noption1: |2-2| + (4-2) +2 → 0+2+2=4.\n\noption2: |2-4| + 2 +2 → 2+2+2=6.\n\nSo, time is min(4,6)=4.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nOption1: move to 2 (already there), close left (1), move to4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total steps 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5.\n\nhas_left: 3>1 → True.\n\nhas_right:5<7 → True.\n\noption1: |4-3|=1, (5-3)=2 → 1+2=3, plus 2 →5.\n\noption2: |4-5|=1, plus 2 →3, plus 2 →5.\n\nSo, time is 5.\n\nBut what about the movement:\n\nOption1:\n\nMove to3 (1 step), close left (1), move to5 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 5.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where l=1 and r=n-1.\n\nE.g., n=5, l=1, r=4.\n\nhas_left: 1>1? No.\n\nhas_right:4<5 → Yes.\n\nSo, time is |pos -4| +1.\n\nWait, no: she needs to close the right of r=4, which is 5.\n\nSo, she needs to move to r=4, then close right.\n\nTime: |pos -4| +1.\n\nBut what if she is already at 4.\n\nYes, time is 1.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=n-1, pos is n.\n\nShe has to move from n to r=n-1, then close right.\n\nTime: (n - (n-1)) +1 = 1+1=2.\n\nWait, movement is 1 step, close is 1.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: pos is 1, and has_left is true.\n\nLike, n=5, l=2, r=4, pos=1.\n\nhas_left: True.\n\nhas_right: True.\n\noption1: |1-2|=1, (4-2)=2 → 3, plus 2 →5.\n\noption2: |1-4|=3, plus 2 →5.\n\nSo, time is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code can proceed with this logic.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nWe need to read four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute has_left = (l > 1)\n\nhas_right = (r < n)\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    if has_left and has_right:\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        time = min(option1, option2)\n\n    elif has_left:\n\n        time = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif has_right:\n\n        time = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        time = 0\n\n    print(time)\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where has_left is true but has_right is false, like l=2, r=4, n=5.\n\nSo, she needs to close left.\n\nTime is |pos - l| +1.\n\nBut what if pos is 3, l=2.\n\nShe moves to 2 (1 step), close left (1).\n\nTotal 2.\n\nBut what about if she is at pos=2: then she can close immediately, time 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: pos is less than l.\n\nE.g., pos=1, l=3, r=5, n=6.\n\nhas_left: True.\n\nhas_right: True.\n\nSo, both need to be closed.\n\noption1: |1-3|=2, (5-3)=2 → 4, plus 2 →6.\n\noption2: |1-5|=4, plus 2 →6.\n\nSo, time is 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nhas_left=True, has_right=True.\n\noption1: 1 + 2 + 2=5.\n\noption2:1 + 2 +2=5.\n\nmin is5.\n\nOutput:5.\n\nSample 2:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nhas_left=False, has_right=True.\n\ntime is |3-3| +1=0+1=1.\n\nSample3:\n\n5 2 1 5.\n\nhas_left=False, has_right=False.\n\ntime 0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=3, r=4.\n\nhas_left: 3>1 →True.\n\nhas_right:4<5 →True.\n\noption1: |5-3|=2 + (4-3)=1 →3, +2 →5.\n\noption2: |5-4|=1 +1 →2, +2 →4.\n\nSo, time is 4.\n\nWhat's the steps:\n\nClose right first.\n\nMove from5 to4:1 step.\n\nClose right:1.\n\nThen move from4 to3:1 step.\n\nClose left:1.\n\nTotal steps:4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code will output 4.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nI think this approach covers all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the optimal path for closing the tabs either by moving the cursor and closing them in one direction first or the other.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closing Tabs**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` or right of `r` that need to be closed. This is done by checking if `l > 1` (tabs to the left) and if `r < n` (tabs to the right).\n2. **Calculate Time for Different Scenarios**:\n   - If both left and right tabs need to be closed, calculate the time for two scenarios: closing left first then right, and closing right first then left. Choose the minimum time from these two.\n   - If only left or only right tabs need to be closed, calculate the time required to move to the respective end and close the tabs.\n3. **Handle Edge Cases**: If no tabs need to be closed (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), the time is zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nhas_left = l > 1\nhas_right = r < n\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    if has_left and has_right:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n    elif has_left:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    elif has_right:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    else:\n        print(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Check if there are tabs to the left of `l` or right of `r` that need closing.\n2. **Calculate Time for Both Directions**: When both directions need closing, compute the time for both possible orders (left first or right first) and choose the minimum.\n3. **Single Direction Closure**: If only one direction needs closing, compute the time to move to the respective end and close the tabs.\n4. **Edge Case Handling**: Directly return 0 if no tabs need closing.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal time required for Luba to close the necessary tabs using the optimal path.",
