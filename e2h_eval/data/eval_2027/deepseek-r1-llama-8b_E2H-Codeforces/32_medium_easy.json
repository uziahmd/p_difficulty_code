    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe task is about an array stabilization problem. We're given an array of integers, and we need to remove exactly one element to minimize the instability of the resulting array. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.\n\nHmm, right. So the goal is to find which element to remove so that when we compute the max minus min of the remaining elements, it's as small as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial array without removing any elements. The instability is max(a) - min(a). But since we must remove exactly one element, maybe the optimal choice is to either remove the current max or the current min. Because those are the two extremes contributing the most to the instability.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple max or min elements? For example, if there are several 3s in the array, removing one 3 might not change the max or min. So I need to consider all possible candidates for removal.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the current max and min of the array.\n2. Consider removing each occurrence of the max and min, and for each such removal, compute the new instability.\n3. Among all these possibilities, find the minimal instability.\n\nBut wait, for a large array (n up to 1e5), iterating through all max and min elements could be O(n), which is acceptable because n is manageable. But perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after finding the global max and min, the best candidate to remove is either the first occurrence of the max or the first occurrence of the min. Or maybe not necessarily the first, but any occurrence.\n\nWait, no. Because if the array has multiple maxes, removing any one of them will leave the max as the same value. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo here's a more efficient approach:\n\n- Compute the global max and min of the original array.\n- Then, create a new array by removing each occurrence of the max and compute the new instability. Keep track of the minimum among these.\n- Do the same for each occurrence of the min.\n- The overall minimum across all these possibilities is the answer.\n\nWait, but that might not cover all cases. What if the array has other elements that, when removed, allow the max and min to decrease significantly?\n\nFor example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4]. The initial instability is 3. If you remove 4, the new array is [1,2,3], instability is 2. If you remove 1, it's 3 again. But what if you remove 2? The new array is [1,3,4], instability is 3. So the best option is to remove 4, leading to instability 2.\n\nAnother example: [1, 100000]. Removing either 1 or 100000 leaves a single element, so the instability is 0.\n\nSo the key is to check all possible removals of the max and min elements, but considering that each can be present multiple times.\n\nWait, but for the case where the array has multiple maxes and mins, removing any one of them doesn't change the overall max or min. So in that case, the best is to remove the max or the min, whichever gives a lower instability.\n\nSo the steps I can take are:\n\n1. Find the current global_max and global_min of the array.\n2. Create a list of all indices where the value is equal to global_max or global_min.\n3. For each index in this list, remove it and compute the new instability of the array.\n4. Track the minimum instability found from all these removals.\n\nBut wait, another approach: after removing a certain element, the new max and min might not be the same as the global ones. For example, suppose the array is [5, 1, 6, 7]. The global max is 7, min is 1. If I remove 1, the new min is 5, and the max is 6. So the instability becomes 1. But if I remove 7, the new max is 6, min is 1, so instability is 5. So in this case, removing the min gives a better result.\n\nSo, when considering which element to remove, it's not enough to just look at the current max and min. Because sometimes, removing the min could lead to a situation where the new min is higher, thus reducing the instability.\n\nHmm, so that complicates things. How can we efficiently compute, for each possible element to remove, the new max and min?\n\nWait, but for each candidate element to remove (like, say, an element x), the new max would be the maximum of the array excluding x, and similarly for the min.\n\nComputing this for each x naively would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=1e5.\n\nSo we need a way to compute, for each x, the new max and min quickly.\n\nWait, but how? For each x, the new max is the maximum of all elements except x. Similarly for the min.\n\nThis can be done by precomputing prefix and suffix max and min arrays.\n\nAh, right! So here's an idea:\n\n- Precompute four arrays:\n   - prefix_max: where prefix_max[i] is the maximum of a[0..i]\n   - suffix_max: where suffix_max[i] is the maximum of a[i..n-1]\n   - Similarly for prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nThen, for any index i, the maximum of the array excluding a[i] is the maximum of prefix_max[i-1] and suffix_max[i+1].\n\nSame for the minimum: it's the minimum of prefix_min[i-1] and suffix_min[i+1].\n\nThis way, for each element, we can compute the new max and min in O(1) time.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute prefix_max, suffix_max, prefix_min, suffix_min arrays.\n2. For each index i in 0..n-1:\n   a. Compute new_max as max of prefix_max[i-1] and suffix_max[i+1].\n   b. Compute new_min as min of prefix_min[i-1] and suffix_min[i+1].\n   c. Compute instability as new_max - new_min.\n3. Find the minimum instability among all possible i.\n\nYes, this should work.\n\nNow, let's think about how to handle the edge cases:\n\n- When i is 0 (first element): then prefix_max[-1] is undefined. So in that case, the new_max is suffix_max[1].\n- Similarly, if i is the last element, the new_max is prefix_max[n-2].\n- Same logic for the min.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each i, left = prefix_max[i-1] if i>0 else -infinity\nright = suffix_max[i+1] if i <n-1 else -infinity\nnew_max = max(left, right)\nSimilarly for min.\n\nWait, but how do we represent the case where i is 0 or n-1? Because for i=0, the prefix is empty, so the max is the suffix starting from i+1 (which is 1). For i=n-1, the suffix is empty, so the max is the prefix ending at i-1.\n\nSo in code, for each i:\n\nleft_max = prefix_max[i-1] if i > 0 else -infinity\nright_max = suffix_max[i+1] if i < n-1 else -infinity\ncurrent_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nOnce we have current_max and current_min, the instability is current_max - current_min.\n\nWe can loop through all i, calculate this, and track the minimum.\n\nThis seems efficient because all steps are O(n), which is acceptable for n=1e5.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, we can precompute the prefix and suffix arrays.\n\nImplementing prefix_max:\n\nprefix_max is an array where prefix_max[i] is the maximum from a[0] to a[i].\n\nInitialize prefix_max[0] = a[0], then for i from 1 to n-1, prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i]).\n\nSimilarly, suffix_max is built from the end.\n\nSame for prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for prefix_max, each step takes the max so far. For prefix_min, each step takes the min.\n\nWait, no, no. Wait, for prefix_max, yes: it's the max up to i. For prefix_min, it's the min up to i.\n\nSimilarly, for suffix_max, it's the max from i to end. So for suffix_max, we can build it by starting from the end.\n\nSo, for building prefix_max:\n\nprefix_max = [a[0]]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_max.append(max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i]))\n\nSimilarly, suffix_max = [0]*n\nsuffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_max[i] = max(suffix_max[i+1], a[i])\n\nWait, but in Python, indexes start at 0. So for suffix_max, the last element is a[-1], and for i = n-2 down to 0, suffix_max[i] is the max of a[i] and suffix_max[i+1].\n\nSame for prefix_min.\n\nOnce these arrays are built, for each i, we can compute the new_max and new_min.\n\nWait, but wait: the new_max after removing a[i] is the maximum of the entire array except a[i], which is the maximum of the left part (up to i-1) and the right part (from i+1 onwards).\n\nSimilarly for the new_min.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute for each i:\n\nleft_part_max = prefix_max[i-1] if i > 0 else -infinity\nright_part_max = suffix_max[i+1] if i < n-1 else -infinity\ncurrent_max = max(left_part_max, right_part_max)\n\nSimilarly for min:\n\nleft_part_min = prefix_min[i-1] if i > 0 else +infinity\nright_part_min = suffix_min[i+1] if i < n-1 else +infinity\ncurrent_min = min(left_part_min, right_part_min)\n\nThen, the instability is current_max - current_min.\n\nSo, now, the plan is clear.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against some examples.\n\nTake the sample input 1:\n\nInput:\n4\n1 3 3 7\n\nThe array is [1,3,3,7]\n\nCompute prefix_max: [1,3,3,7]\nsuffix_max: [7,7,7,7]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1,1,1]\nsuffix_min: [1,1,1,1]\n\nFor each i, compute new_max and new_min.\n\ni=0: a[i]=1\nleft_part_max: none, so only right_part_max is suffix_max[1] =7.\ncurrent_max is 7.\nleft_part_min: none, so suffix_min[1] is 1.\ncurrent_min is 1.\nInstability is 7-1=6.\n\ni=1: a[i]=3\nleft_part_max is prefix_max[0]=1\nright_part_max is suffix_max[2]=7\ncurrent_max is 7.\nleft_part_min is prefix_min[0]=1\nright_part_min is suffix_min[2]=1.\ncurrent_min is 1.\nInstability is 6.\n\ni=2: a[i]=3\nleft_part_max is prefix_max[1]=3\nright_part_max is suffix_max[3]=7\ncurrent_max is7.\nleft_part_min is prefix_min[1]=1\nright_part_min is suffix_min[3]=1.\ncurrent_min is 1.\nInstability is6.\n\ni=3: a[i]=7\nleft_part_max is prefix_max[2]=3\nright_part_max is none, so current_max is3.\nleft_part_min is prefix_min[2]=1\nright_part_min is none, so current_min is1.\nInstability is 3-1=2.\n\nSo the minimum instability is 2, achieved by removing 7.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nInput:\n2\n1 100000\n\nCompute prefix_max: [1, 100000]\nsuffix_max: [100000, 100000]\nprefix_min: [1, 1]\nsuffix_min: [1, 1]\n\ni=0: removing 1\ncurrent_max is suffix_max[1]=100000\ncurrent_min is suffix_min[1]=1\nInstability is 99999.\n\ni=1: removing 100000\ncurrent_max is prefix_max[0]=1\ncurrent_min is prefix_min[0]=1\nInstability is 0.\n\nSo the minimum is 0.\n\nWhich also matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: [5,1,6,7]\n\nAs earlier.\n\nCompute prefix_max: [5,5,6,7]\nsuffix_max: [7,7,7,7]\nprefix_min: [1,1,1,1]\nsuffix_min: [1,1,1,1]\n\nFor each i:\n\ni=0 (value 5):\ncurrent_max = suffix_max[1] =7\ncurrent_min = suffix_min[1] =1\ninstability 6.\n\ni=1 (value 1):\ncurrent_max is max(prefix_max[0]=5, suffix_max[2]=7) →7\ncurrent_min is min(prefix_min[0]=5, suffix_min[2]=1) →1\nSo instabilty is 6.\n\nWait, that's not correct. Wait, when we remove 1, the new array is [5,6,7]. Max is7, min is5. So instability is 2.\n\nWait, what's wrong here.\n\nWait, in this case, the initial array is [5,1,6,7]. So when i=1 (the '1'), the left_part_max is prefix_max[0] =5, right_part_max is suffix_max[2]=6? Or wait, suffix_max for i=2 is 6, but the suffix from i=2 is 6,7, but in the array after removing i=1, the elements are 5,6,7. So the max is7.\n\nWait, let's see. The suffix_max array is built as follows:\n\nStart from the end.\n\nsuffix_max[3] =7\nsuffix_max[2] = max(6,7) →7\nsuffix_max[1] = max(1,7) →7\nsuffix_max[0] = max(5,7) →7\n\nWait, no. Wait, when building suffix_max, for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n\nFor i=2, suffix_max[2] = max(a[2], suffix_max[3]) → max(6,7) →7\ni=1: max(a[1]=1, suffix_max[2]=7) →7\ni=0: max(a[0]=5, suffix_max[1]=7) →7.\n\nSo the suffix_max array is [7,7,7,7].\n\nHmm, so when i=1, right_part_max is suffix_max[2] =7.\n\nLeft_part_max is prefix_max[0] =5.\n\nSo current_max is max(5,7)=7.\n\nNow, current_min is min of prefix_min[0]=5 and suffix_min[2]=1.\n\nWait, suffix_min[2] is 1? Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, the prefix_min array is built as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] =5\nprefix_min[1] = min(5,1) →1\nprefix_min[2] = min(1,6) →1\nprefix_min[3] = min(1,7) →1\n\nSuffix_min is built as:\n\nsuffix_min[3] =7\nWait, no. Wait, for the min:\n\nWhen building suffix_min, for each i, it's the min from a[i] to a[n-1].\n\nWait, no, perhaps I have to rethink the suffix arrays.\n\nWait, for suffix_min, for i, it's the min from a[i] to a[n-1].\n\nSo for the array [5,1,6,7], suffix_min would be:\n\ni=0: min(5,1,6,7) →1\ni=1: min(1,6,7) →1\ni=2: min(6,7) →6\ni=3: 7.\n\nWait, no. Let me compute it correctly.\n\nBuilding suffix_min from the end:\n\nsuffix_min[3] =7\nsuffix_min[2] = min(6, suffix_min[3]) →6\nsuffix_min[1] = min(1, suffix_min[2]) →1\nsuffix_min[0] = min(5, suffix_min[1]) →1.\n\nSo the suffix_min array is [1,1,6,7].\n\nSo for i=1, the right_part_min is suffix_min[2] =6.\n\nleft_part_min is prefix_min[0]=5.\n\nSo current_min is min(5,6) →5.\n\nThus, current_max is7, current_min is5. So instability is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo in code, for i=1, the new_max is7, new_min is5, instability is2.\n\nSo the code correctly captures that.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nCompute prefix_max, suffix_max, prefix_min, suffix_min.\n\nLoop over each i in 0..n-1:\n\nCompute left_max and right_max as described.\n\nCompute current_max = max(left_max, right_max).\n\nSimilarly for min.\n\nCompute instability.\n\nTrack the minimum instability.\n\nAt the end, output the minimum.\n\nNow, in terms of code:\n\nWe need to handle cases where i is 0 or n-1.\n\nIn Python, for i=0, i-1 is -1, which is invalid. So in code, for i=0:\n\nleft_max is None, so we set it to -infinity.\n\nSimilarly, for i=n-1, right_max is None, set to -infinity.\n\nWait, but in Python, we can represent it as:\n\nif i ==0:\n    left_max = -infinity\nelse:\n    left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n\nSimilarly for right_max.\n\nSame for min.\n\nWait, but using negative and positive infinities is tricky because in Python, comparing with int may cause issues. So, for example, when i is 0, left_part_max is None, but right_part_max is suffix_max[1], which is a number.\n\nSo, for i=0:\n\nleft_part_max = -infinity\nright_part_max = suffix_max[1]\n\ncurrent_max = max(left_part_max, right_part_max) → which will be right_part_max.\n\nSimilarly for other cases.\n\nSo in code, we can represent -infinity as float('-inf').\n\nSame for +infinity.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nn = len(a) # although the input ensures this.\n\nCompute prefix_max:\n\nprefix_max = [0]*n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n\nCompute suffix_max:\n\nsuffix_max = [0]*n\nsuffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_max[i] = max(a[i], suffix_max[i+1])\n\nCompute prefix_min:\n\nprefix_min = [0]*n\nprefix_min[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n\nCompute suffix_min:\n\nsuffix_min = [0]*n\nsuffix_min[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_min[i] = min(a[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nNow, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nCompute left_max and right_max:\n\nif i ==0:\n    left_max = float('-inf')\nelse:\n    left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n\nif i ==n-1:\n    right_max = float('-inf')\nelse:\n    right_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n\ncurrent_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n\nSimilarly for min:\n\nif i ==0:\n    left_min = float('inf')\nelse:\n    left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n\nif i ==n-1:\n    right_min = float('inf')\nelse:\n    right_min = suffix_min[i+1]\n\ncurrent_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n\ninstability = current_max - current_min\n\nkeep track of the minimum.\n\nSo, now, putting it all together.\n\nTesting for the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, a=[1,3,3,7]\n\nprefix_max: [1,3,3,7]\n\nsuffix_max: [7,7,7,7]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1,1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,1,1,1]\n\nFor i=3, which is 7:\n\nleft_max is prefix_max[2] =3.\n\nright_max is -inf.\n\ncurrent_max=3.\n\nleft_min is prefix_min[2] =1.\n\nright_min is inf.\n\ncurrent_min=1.\n\nSo instability is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, a=[1,100000]\n\nprefix_max: [1,100000]\n\nsuffix_max: [100000, 100000]\n\nprefix_min: [1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,1]\n\ni=0: current_max is suffix_max[1]=100000, current_min is suffix_min[1]=1. Instability 99999.\n\ni=1: current_max is prefix_max[0]=1, current_min is prefix_min[0]=1. Instability 0.\n\nSo the code would pick 0.\n\nAnother test case: [5,1,6,7]\n\nprefix_max: [5,5,6,7]\n\nsuffix_max: [7,7,7,7]\n\nprefix_min: [5,1,1,1]\n\nsuffix_min: [1,1,6,7]\n\ni=1 (element 1):\n\nleft_max = prefix_max[0] =5.\n\nright_max = suffix_max[2] =7.\n\ncurrent_max=7.\n\nleft_min = prefix_min[0]=5.\n\nright_min = suffix_min[2]=6.\n\ncurrent_min =5.\n\nSo instability is 2.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, in terms of code, the variables are:\n\nn, a.\n\nCompute prefix and suffix arrays.\n\nLoop over each i.\n\nCompute current_max and current_min.\n\nCalculate instability.\n\nFind the minimum.\n\nSo the code is manageable.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase when all elements are the same.\n\nE.g., n=3, a=[2,2,2].\n\nFor any i, the new array has two 2's, so instability is 0.\n\nSo code should output 0.\n\nAnother case: n=5, a=[10, 20, 30, 40,50].\n\nIf we remove 50, the new max is40.\n\nMin is10.\n\nInstability 30.\n\nIf we remove 10, new min is20.\n\nMax is50.\n\nInstability 30.\n\nBut wait, the initial instability is40.\n\nWait, no: initial array's max is50, min is10. So initial instability is40.\n\nWait, when you remove 50, the new array's max is40, min is10. So instability is30.\n\nWhich is better than keeping the initial array.\n\nSo the code will find that removing 50 gives 30, which is better than any other removal.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2.\n\na=[5,5]. Removing either gives instability 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, a=[1, 2, 3].\n\nIf we remove 1: new array [2,3], instability 1.\n\nIf we remove 3: new array [1,2], instability 1.\n\nIf we remove 2: new array [1,3], instability 2.\n\nSo the minimal instability is1.\n\nSo the code would compute that.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the edge cases for i=0 and i=n-1.\n\n- Using float('-inf') and float('inf').\n\n- Making sure that the arrays are correctly built.\n\nSo the code should look like this:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as a list.\n\nCompute prefix_max, suffix_max, prefix_min, suffix_min.\n\nInitialize min_instability to a very large number.\n\nLoop over each i:\n\n   compute left_max and right_max.\n\n   current_max = max(left_max, right_max).\n\n   compute left_min and right_min.\n\n   current_min = min(left_min, right_min).\n\n   instability = current_max - current_min.\n\n   if instability < min_instability:\n\n       min_instability = instability.\n\nAt the end, print min_instability.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, testing.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7\n\nSample Output:2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 100000\n\nSample Output:0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nn = len(a)  # although the input ensures this.\n\n# Compute prefix_max\nprefix_max = [0] * n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n\n# Compute suffix_max\nsuffix_max = [0] * n\nsuffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_max[i] = max(a[i], suffix_max[i+1])\n\n# Compute prefix_min\nprefix_min = [0] * n\nprefix_min[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n\n# Compute suffix_min\nsuffix_min = [0] * n\nsuffix_min[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_min[i] = min(a[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    # Compute current_max\n    if i == 0:\n        left_max = float('-inf')\n    else:\n        left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n    if i == n-1:\n        right_max = float('-inf')\n    else:\n        right_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n    current_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n    \n    # Compute current_min\n    if i == 0:\n        left_min = float('inf')\n    else:\n        left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n    if i == n-1:\n        right_min = float('inf')\n    else:\n        right_min = suffix_min[i+1]\n    current_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n    \n    instability = current_max - current_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n\nWait, but in the code, after computing current_max and current_min, the instability is computed as current_max - current_min. But since the new array has n-1 elements, the max and min may not be the same as before, but the code correctly calculates it.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, that should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The goal is to remove one element such that the instability of the resulting array is minimized. The instability is given by the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n2. **Insights**: The key insight is that removing either the current maximum or minimum value can potentially reduce the instability. However, we must consider all possible removals of both maximum and minimum values to ensure we find the optimal solution.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: To efficiently compute the effect of removing each element, we use prefix and suffix arrays for both maximum and minimum values. These arrays allow us to quickly determine the new maximum and minimum values when any single element is removed.\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute prefix and suffix arrays for both maximum and minimum values.\n   - For each element, calculate the new maximum and minimum values by excluding the current element using the prefix and suffix arrays.\n   - Track the minimum instability across all possible removals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nn = len(a)\n\n# Compute prefix max\nprefix_max = [0] * n\nprefix_max[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_max[i] = max(prefix_max[i-1], a[i])\n\n# Compute suffix max\nsuffix_max = [0] * n\nsuffix_max[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_max[i] = max(a[i], suffix_max[i+1])\n\n# Compute prefix min\nprefix_min = [0] * n\nprefix_min[0] = a[0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], a[i])\n\n# Compute suffix min\nsuffix_min = [0] * n\nsuffix_min[-1] = a[-1]\nfor i in range(n-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_min[i] = min(a[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    # Calculate current_max\n    if i == 0:\n        left_max = float('-inf')\n    else:\n        left_max = prefix_max[i-1]\n    if i == n-1:\n        right_max = float('-inf')\n    else:\n        right_max = suffix_max[i+1]\n    current_max = max(left_max, right_max)\n    \n    # Calculate current_min\n    if i == 0:\n        left_min = float('inf')\n    else:\n        left_min = prefix_min[i-1]\n    if i == n-1:\n        right_min = float('inf')\n    else:\n        right_min = suffix_min[i+1]\n    current_min = min(left_min, right_min)\n    \n    instability = current_max - current_min\n    if instability < min_instability:\n        min_instability = instability\n\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: These arrays help in efficiently computing the maximum and minimum values when any element is excluded. `prefix_max[i]` stores the maximum value from the start up to index `i`, while `suffix_max[i]` stores the maximum value from index `i` to the end.\n2. **Iterate Through Elements**: For each element, we determine the new maximum and minimum values by excluding the current element. This is done using the prefix and suffix arrays to get the maximum and minimum values from the left and right parts of the array.\n3. **Track Minimum Instability**: By iterating through each element and calculating the instability after its removal, we keep track of the minimum instability encountered.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal element to remove, resulting in the minimum possible instability for the array.",
