    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an array of integers, and we need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, my goal is to remove one element such that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible element to remove, I need to compute the instability of the remaining array and then find the minimum among all those possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 1e5, which is 10^5. If I try to iterate over each element, compute the max and min each time, that would be O(n^2) time, which is definitely too slow. Because 1e5 squared is 1e10 operations—way beyond what can be handled in the time constraints.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's note that the original array has a certain max and min. When I remove an element, the new max or min might change depending on whether the removed element was the current max, min, or something else.\n\nWait, but sometimes even if you remove an element that's not the max or min, the new max or min could be the next highest or lowest. So the removal can affect both ends.\n\nSo perhaps I should precompute the possible candidates for the new max and min when each element is removed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the second maximum and second minimum, and see how their combination affects the instability.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Find the initial max and min of the array.\n2. For each element, consider what happens when it's removed:\n   a. The new max could be the second_max if the current max was this element.\n   b. Similarly, the new min could be the second_min if the current min was this element.\n3. Then, for each element, calculate the new instability as (new_max - new_min), and keep track of the minimum.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find the second_max and second_min? Maybe by scanning the array once and keeping track of these values.\n\nWait, but perhaps another approach: After removing each element, the new max is either the same as the original max (if the removed element isn't the max) or the second_max. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo, the idea is to precompute the second_max and second_min. Then, for each element, determine whether it's the max or the min, and compute the new instability accordingly.\n\nLet's think about this:\n\n- Let current_max = max(a)\n- Let current_min = min(a)\n- Let second_max be the maximum value in the array other than current_max.\n- Let second_min be the minimum value in the array other than current_min.\n\nThen, for each element in the array, when I remove it, I need to see if it was the current_max or current_min. If it was, then the new max or min will be the second_max or second_min respectively. Otherwise, the new max remains current_max and the new min remains current_min.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. For example, suppose there are multiple instances of the current_max. Like [3,3,3]. Then, removing one 3 won't change the max. So, in that case, the second_max would still be 3. So, in this case, the new max is still 3, not some lower value.\n\nSo, perhaps I should precompute the count of current_max and current_min, and also the second_max and second_min.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nCompute for the array:\n\n- The maximum value (max_val)\n- The second maximum (second_max), which is the maximum value in the array that is less than max_val.\n- The minimum value (min_val)\n- The second minimum (second_min), which is the minimum value in the array that is greater than min_val.\n\nThen, for each element in the array, when considering removing it, check:\n\nCase 1: The element is the max_val. Then, the new max becomes second_max. The min remains min_val unless all elements except the max were min_val. Wait, no— if all elements except max are min_val, then removing the max would leave only min_val, so the new min is min_val. But wait, in that case, the new max is the second_max, which is min_val. So the new instability is zero.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think of an example.\n\nExample: Array is [7, 3, 3, 1]. Max is 7, min is 1. Second_max is 3, second_min is 3.\n\nIf I remove 7: the new array is [3,3,1]. Max is 3, min is 1. Instability is 2.\n\nIf I remove 3: the new array is [7,3,1]. Max is 7, min is 1. Instability is 6.\n\nIf I remove 1: new array is [7,3,3]. Max is 7, min is 3. Instability is 4.\n\nWait, so in this case, the best option is to remove 7, leading to instability 2.\n\nSo in this case, when the element being removed is the max, the new max is the second_max, and min remains as before.\n\nBut wait, what if the array is like [5,5,5], and min is 5. So when you remove any 5, the new array is two 5s. So the max and min are both 5, instability is zero.\n\nSo, the key is that when an element is the current max, the new max is the second_max. Similarly, when it's the current min, the new min is the second_min.\n\nBut when an element is neither the max nor the min, removing it doesn't affect the max or min.\n\nSo, for each element x in the array, the new instability is:\n\nif x == max_val:\n    new_max = second_max\nelif x == min_val:\n    new_min = second_min\nelse:\n    new_max = max_val\n    new_min = min_val\n\nBut wait, not quite. Because sometimes, the second_max is equal to the max_val (like in the case where multiple max elements exist). Or the second_min could be the same as min_val.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nsecond_max is the maximum value in the array that is strictly less than max_val. So if the array has multiple max_val elements, the second_max is the same as max_val.\n\nSimilarly, second_min is the minimum value in the array that is strictly greater than min_val.\n\nSo, for example, if the array is [3,3,3], then max_val is 3, second_max is 3. Min_val is 3, second_min is 3.\n\nSo, when any element is removed, the new array is [3,3], with max 3 and min 3. So instability is 0.\n\nSo, in this case, for any x removed, the new instability is (3 -3)=0.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCompute max_val, min_val, second_max, second_min.\n\nFor each element in the array, compute the new instability when removing it.\n\nThe new instability is:\n\nif x is max_val:\n    new_max = second_max\nelif x is min_val:\n    new_min = second_min\nelse:\n    new_max = max_val\n    new_min = min_val\n\nBut wait, what if x is both the max and the min? That can only happen if all elements are the same.\n\nIn that case, when you remove x (which is the max and min), the new array's max and min would be the second_max (which is the same as x) and second_min (same as x), so the instability is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the plan is:\n\n- Compute max_val and min_val of the array.\n- Compute second_max as the maximum value in the array that is less than max_val. If all elements are max_val, then second_max is max_val.\n- Compute second_min as the minimum value in the array that is greater than min_val. If all elements are min_val, then second_min is min_val.\n- Then, for each element x in the array:\n   - if x is max_val:\n       new_max = second_max\n       new_min = min_val\n   - elif x is min_val:\n       new_min = second_min\n       new_max = max_val\n   - else:\n       new_max remains max_val\n       new_min remains min_val\n   - compute the instability as new_max - new_min\n- Find the minimum instability across all x.\n\nWait, but is this correct?\n\nWait, let's test the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n4\n1 3 3 7\n\nmax_val is 7, min_val is 1.\nsecond_max is 3 (since 3 is the largest number less than 7).\nsecond_min is 3 (since 3 is the smallest number larger than 1).\n\nSo, for each element:\n\n- Remove 1: new_min is 3, new_max is 7. Instability is 7-3=4.\n- Remove 3: new_max is 7, new_min is 1. 7-1=6.\n- Remove another 3: same as above.\n- Remove 7: new_max is 3, new_min is 1. 3-1=2.\n\nSo the minimum is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n2\n1 100000\n\nmax_val is 100000, min_val is 1.\nsecond_max is 1 (since all other elements are 1, which is less than max_val).\nsecond_min is 100000 (since all other elements are 100000, which is larger than min_val).\n\nWhen removing 1: new_min is 100000, new_max is 100000. So instability is 0.\nWhen removing 100000: new_max is 1, new_min is 1. So instability is 0.\n\nThus, the minimum is 0.\n\nWhich also matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if the array has multiple max and min.\n\nLike [5,5,5,5]. Then, for any element removed, the new array has 5,5,5. So the max and min are both 5, instability 0.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nWhat about [2,1,3,4,5]?\n\nOriginal max is 5, min is 1.\nsecond_max is 4.\nsecond_min is 2.\n\nIf I remove 5: new max is 4, min is 1. Instability 3.\nIf I remove 1: new min is 2, max is 5. Instability 3.\nIf I remove 2: new max is 5, new min is 1. Instability 4.\nSame for others.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nSo now, the problem is to compute second_max and second_min correctly.\n\nHow to compute them efficiently.\n\nIn code:\n\nWe can scan the array once to find max_val and min_val.\n\nThen, to find the second_max:\n\nWe can initialize second_max to -infinity. Then, for each element in the array, if it's less than max_val and greater than second_max, update second_max.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements equal to max_val? Like [7,7,3,1]. In this case, second_max should be 7, because if you remove one 7, the remaining 7 is still the max.\n\nSo the correct way to compute second_max is: the maximum value in the array that is less than or equal to max_val, but not including the current max_val (if it's part of the array).\n\nWait, no. No, because if there are multiple max_val elements, then the second_max is the same as max_val.\n\nSo, the second_max is the maximum value in the array after excluding the current max_val (if any). Or, if all elements are max_val, then the second_max is max_val.\n\nWait, no. Because if all elements are max_val, then when you remove one, the new array's max is still max_val.\n\nSo, the correct way to compute second_max is: the maximum value in the array, but if the array has at least one element less than max_val, then it's the maximum of those. Else, it's max_val.\n\nWait, no. Because if all elements are max_val, then the second_max is max_val, because when you remove one element, the new array's max is still max_val.\n\nSo, for example, array [7,7,7], the second_max is 7.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nCompute max_val.\n\nThen, collect all elements that are less than max_val. If this list is non-empty, second_max is the maximum of this list. Else, second_max is max_val.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nSo, to implement this:\n\nCompute max_val and min_val.\n\nThen, create a list called 'other_max' which contains all elements in a where a[i] < max_val.\n\nIf 'other_max' is empty, then second_max = max_val.\n\nElse, second_max = max(other_max).\n\nSame for 'other_min' = [a[i] > min_val].\n\nIf 'other_min' is empty, then second_min = min_val.\n\nElse, second_min = min(other_min).\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient. Because, for example, in the array [3,3,1], the max_val is 3, other_max is [1], so second_max is 1. So when you remove a 3, the new max is 1.\n\nBut in the array [3,3,3], other_max is empty, so second_max is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nCompute max_val = max(a)\nCompute min_val = min(a)\n\nother_max = [x for x in a if x != max_val]\nif len(other_max) == 0:\n    second_max = max_val\nelse:\n    second_max = max(other_max)\n\nSimilarly for min_val:\n\nother_min = [x for x in a if x != min_val]\nif len(other_min) == 0:\n    second_min = min_val\nelse:\n    second_min = min(other_min)\n\nWait, but this can be optimized.\n\nInstead of creating a new list, perhaps just iterate through the array once, tracking the maximum and the second_max.\n\nSimilarly for min and second_min.\n\nAlternatively, for each element, we can compare it to current_max and track the second_max.\n\nBut for large n, using list comprehensions may be acceptable since it's O(n) time.\n\nBut for n=1e5, it's manageable.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nRead the array.\n\nCompute max_val and min_val.\n\nCompute other_max as all elements less than max_val. If none, second_max is max_val.\n\nCompute other_min as all elements greater than min_val. If none, second_min is min_val.\n\nElse, second_min is the min of other_min.\n\nWait, but for other_min, if there are elements greater than min_val, their min is the smallest of them, which is the second_min.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce we have all four variables, then for each element x in a:\n\nif x is max_val:\n\n   new_max = second_max\n\n   new_min remains min_val\n\nelif x is min_val:\n\n   new_min = second_min\n\n   new_max remains max_val\n\nelse:\n\n   new_max = max_val\n\n   new_min = min_val\n\nThen, compute the instability as new_max - new_min.\n\nFind the minimal instability.\n\nBut wait, what if the element x is both max_val and min_val? Which can only happen if all elements are same.\n\nIn that case, when x is removed, the new array's max is second_max (which is same as x) and min is second_min (also same as x), so instability is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nTest case: n=2, a=[5,5]\n\nmax_val=5, min_val=5.\n\nother_max is empty, so second_max=5.\n\nother_min is empty, so second_min=5.\n\nFor each element x:\n\nx is 5.\n\nSo, new_max = second_max=5.\n\nnew_min is min_val=5.\n\nSo instability is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[1,2,3]\n\nmax_val=3, min_val=1.\n\nother_max is [1,2], so second_max=2.\n\nother_min is [2], so second_min=2.\n\nRemoving 3: new_max=2, new_min=1 → instability 1.\n\nRemoving 1: new_min=2, new_max=3 → instability 1.\n\nRemoving 2: new_max=3, new_min=1 → instability 2.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: [7,3,3,1]\n\nAs before.\n\nAnother case: [5,4,5,5]\n\nmax_val=5, min_val=4.\n\nother_max is [4], so second_max=4.\n\nother_min is empty, so second_min=4.\n\nRemoving 5: new_max is 4, new_min is 4 → instability 0.\n\nRemoving 4: new_max is 5, new_min is 4 → instability 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nRead n and the array.\n\nCompute max_val and min_val.\n\nCompute other_max as [x for x in a if x < max_val]\n\nif other_max is empty, second_max = max_val\n\nelse, second_max = max(other_max)\n\nSimilarly for other_min: [x for x in a if x > min_val]\n\nif other_min is empty, second_min = min_val\n\nelse, second_min = min(other_min)\n\nThen, for each x in a:\n\nif x == max_val:\n\n   new_max = second_max\n\nelif x == min_val:\n\n   new_min = second_min\n\nelse:\n\n   new_max = max_val\n\n   new_min = min_val\n\nthen, compute new_max - new_min, track the minimum.\n\nNow, for n=1e5, this is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut, in Python, creating lists for other_max and other_min may take O(n) memory, but for 1e5 elements, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, can optimize by traversing the array once, keeping track of second_max and second_min.\n\nYes, perhaps that's better.\n\nSo, during the initial pass, compute max_val, min_val, and also compute second_max and second_min.\n\nLet me think about how to do that.\n\nInitialize:\n\nmax_val = -infinity\n\nsecond_max = -infinity\n\nmin_val = infinity\n\nsecond_min = infinity\n\nfor each x in a:\n\n   if x > max_val:\n\n       second_max = max_val\n\n       max_val = x\n\n   if x < min_val:\n\n       second_min = min_val\n\n       min_val = x\n\nWait, but this approach only tracks the last occurrence of max and min, not all.\n\nFor example, in [3,5,5,2], during traversal:\n\nx=3: max is 3, second_max is -inf.\n\nx=5: new max is 5, second_max is 3.\n\nx=5: same as above, no change.\n\nx=2: min is 2, second_min is inf.\n\nSo, in this case, the second_max is 3, which is correct.\n\nBut what about when multiple elements have the same max.\n\nLike [7,7,7], the initial approach would set max_val to 7, second_max to -inf, but during the iteration, the next 7s don't change max_val, but do they update second_max?\n\nNo, because in the initial condition, when x is equal to max_val, the code does not update second_max. So, the second_max remains as -inf.\n\nWhich is incorrect.\n\nSo, the initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe need to find the second_max as the maximum value that is less than or equal to the max_val, but not counting the max_val itself.\n\nWait, no. Because, for example, in [7,7,3,1], the second_max is 7, because when you remove one 7, the array still has 7 as the max.\n\nSo, to compute second_max, we need to find the maximum of all elements that are <= max_val, except that at least one element is less than max_val.\n\nWait, no. Because if all elements are max_val, then the second_max is max_val.\n\nSo, the correct way is to find the maximum of all elements except for one occurrence of max_val.\n\nWait, no. Because, if there are multiple max_val elements, then the second_max is still max_val.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find the maximum of all elements that are less than or equal to max_val, but if all elements are max_val, then the second_max is max_val.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to find the maximum of all elements except the first occurrence of max_val.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the second_max as the maximum of all elements that are not the first occurrence of max_val.\n\nBut that's getting complicated.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to collect all elements, and find the maximum after excluding one occurrence of the max_val.\n\nWait, but that's not correct either, because if there are multiple max_vals, removing one leaves others.\n\nSo, for example, [7,7,3,1]. If you remove one 7, the remaining array has two 7s, so the max is still 7.\n\nSo, in this case, the second_max is 7.\n\nSo, the correct way to compute second_max is the maximum of the array after removing one occurrence of max_val.\n\nBut that's O(n) time for each, which is expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following logic:\n\nIf the count of max_val is >=1:\n\n   second_max = max_val if there exists at least one element equal to max_val (but that's always true if count >=1).\n\nWait, no. That's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nsecond_max is the maximum of the array, but ignoring one occurrence of max_val.\n\nSo, for example:\n\narray = [7,7,3,1]\n\nmax_val =7.\n\ncount_of_max =2.\n\nso, after removing one 7, the array has another 7, so second_max is 7.\n\nSo, the second_max is 7.\n\nSo, how to compute this?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nCompute max_val and the count of max_val.\n\nIf count_of_max >=1:\n\n   if count_of_max >1, then second_max is max_val.\n\n   else, second_max is the maximum of the rest of the elements.\n\nSimilarly for min_val.\n\nWait, yes. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCompute max_val = max(a)\n\ncount_max = a.count(max_val)\n\nif count_max >1:\n\n   second_max = max_val\n\nelse:\n\n   # find the maximum of all elements except one occurrence of max_val.\n\n   # but wait, perhaps it's better to find the maximum of the array after removing one max_val.\n\n   # but how?\n\n   # alternative: find the maximum of elements less than max_val.\n\n   # if any, then that's the second_max.\n\n   # else, second_max is max_val.\n\n   # but in this case, if all elements except one max_val are less than max_val.\n\n   # So, if count_max is 1, then the other_max is [elements < max_val], and if that's non-empty, second_max is max of other_max.\n\n   # else, second_max is max_val.\n\nSimilarly for min_val.\n\nSo, the code can be:\n\nmax_val = max(a)\n\ncount_max = a.count(max_val)\n\nif count_max >=2:\n\n   second_max = max_val\n\nelse:\n\n   other_max = [x for x in a if x < max_val]\n\n   if other_max:\n\n       second_max = max(other_max)\n\n   else:\n\n       second_max = max_val\n\nSimilarly for min_val:\n\nmin_val = min(a)\n\ncount_min = a.count(min_val)\n\nif count_min >=2:\n\n   second_min = min_val\n\nelse:\n\n   other_min = [x for x in a if x > min_val]\n\n   if other_min:\n\n       second_min = min(other_min)\n\n   else:\n\n       second_min = min_val\n\nThis way, for [7,7,3,1], count_max is 2, so second_max is 7.\n\nFor [7,3,3,1], count_max is 1, other_max is [3,3,1], so second_max is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code, this would work.\n\nBut for n=1e5, the a.count() function may be O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute count_max and count_min in a single pass.\n\nBut for now, perhaps using the built-in functions is acceptable.\n\nWait, but in Python, a.count() is O(n), which is acceptable for 1e5 elements.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmax_val = max(a)\ncount_max = a.count(max_val)\nif count_max >= 2:\n    second_max = max_val\nelse:\n    other_max = [x for x in a if x < max_val]\n    if other_max:\n        second_max = max(other_max)\n    else:\n        second_max = max_val\n\nmin_val = min(a)\ncount_min = a.count(min_val)\nif count_min >= 2:\n    second_min = min_val\nelse:\n    other_min = [x for x in a if x > min_val]\n    if other_min:\n        second_min = min(other_min)\n    else:\n        second_min = min_val\n\nThen, for each x in a:\n\nif x == max_val:\n    new_max = second_max\nelif x == min_val:\n    new_min = second_min\nelse:\n    new_max = max_val\n    new_min = min_val\n\nCompute instability as new_max - new_min.\n\nTrack the minimum.\n\nSo, the code should look something like this.\n\nNow, let's test the code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n1 3 3 7\n\nmax_val=7, count_max=1.\n\nother_max is [1,3,3], so second_max=3.\n\nmin_val=1, count_min=1.\n\nother_min is [3,3,7], so second_min=3.\n\nSo, for each x:\n\nx=1: new_min=3. new_max=7. 7-3=4.\n\nx=3: new_max=7, new_min=1. 6.\n\nx=3: same as above.\n\nx=7: new_max=3, new_min=1. 2.\n\nMinimum is 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n1 100000\n\nmax_val=100000, count_max=1.\n\nother_max is [1], so second_max=1.\n\nmin_val=1, count_min=1.\n\nother_min is [100000], so second_min=100000.\n\nFor x=1: new_min=100000, new_max=100000. 0.\n\nFor x=100000: new_max=1, new_min=1. 0.\n\nMinimum is 0.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5].\n\nmax_val=5, count_max=3.\n\nso second_max=5.\n\nmin_val=5, count_min=3.\n\nsecond_min=5.\n\nEach x is 5.\n\nWhen x is removed, new_max=5, new_min=5. So instability 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: [3,3,1].\n\nmax_val=3, count_max=2.\n\nsecond_max=3.\n\nmin_val=1, count_min=1.\n\nother_min is [3,3], so second_min=3.\n\nSo for x=3: new_max=3, new_min=1. 2.\n\nx=3: same.\n\nx=1: new_max=3, new_min=3. 0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code.\n\nBut wait, for the case where the array has all elements same, like [5,5,5].\n\nThen, for each x, the new_max is 5, new_min is 5, so 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: [2,1,3,4,5].\n\nmax_val=5, count_max=1.\n\nother_max is [2,1,3,4], so second_max=4.\n\nmin_val=1, count_min=1.\n\nother_min is [2,3,4,5], so second_min=2.\n\nSo for x=5: new_max=4, new_min=1 → 3.\n\nx=1: new_max=5, new_min=2 → 3.\n\nx=2: new_max=5, new_min=1 →4.\n\nx=3: same as x=2.\n\nx=4: same as x=2.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\nRead n and a.\n\nCompute max_val and its count.\n\nCompute second_max.\n\nCompute min_val and its count.\n\nCompute second_min.\n\nThen, for each x in a:\n\n   if x is max_val:\n\n       new_max = second_max\n\n   elif x is min_val:\n\n       new_min = second_min\n\n   else:\n\n       new_max = max_val\n\n       new_min = min_val\n\n   compute instability and track the minimum.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmax_val = max(a)\ncount_max = a.count(max_val)\nif count_max >= 2:\n    second_max = max_val\nelse:\n    other_max = [x for x in a if x < max_val]\n    if other_max:\n        second_max = max(other_max)\n    else:\n        second_max = max_val\n\nmin_val = min(a)\ncount_min = a.count(min_val)\nif count_min >= 2:\n    second_min = min_val\nelse:\n    other_min = [x for x in a if x > min_val]\n    if other_min:\n        second_min = min(other_min)\n    else:\n        second_min = min_val\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor x in a:\n    if x == max_val:\n        current_max = second_max\n    elif x == min_val:\n        current_min = second_min\n    else:\n        current_max = max_val\n        current_min = min_val\n    inst = current_max - current_min\n    if inst < min_instability:\n        min_instability = inst\n\nprint(min_instability)\n\nWait, but for the case where all elements are same, like [5,5,5], the code correctly computes second_max as 5 and second_min as 5. Thus, for each x, current_max is 5, current_min is 5, so inst is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a = [3,3,1]\n\nmax_val=3, count_max=2 → second_max=3.\n\nmin_val=1, count_min=1.\n\nother_min = [3,3], so second_min=3.\n\nSo for x=3:\n\ncurrent_max =3.\n\ncurrent_min is min_val (1) → inst=2.\n\nfor x=3: same.\n\nfor x=1: current_max=3, current_min=3 → inst=0.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: First, compute the maximum (`max_val`) and minimum (`min_val`) values of the array.\n2. **Compute Second Max and Min**: Determine the second highest value (`second_max`) and the second lowest value (`second_min`) that would take their places if the highest or lowest value is removed.\n3. **Evaluate Each Element Removal**: For each element in the array, consider the effect of removing it on the new maximum and minimum values:\n   - If the element is the current maximum, the new maximum becomes `second_max`.\n   - If the element is the current minimum, the new minimum becomes `second_min`.\n   - Otherwise, both the maximum and minimum remain unchanged.\n4. **Calculate Instability**: For each scenario, compute the instability and track the minimum instability encountered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nmax_val = max(a)\ncount_max = a.count(max_val)\nif count_max >= 2:\n    second_max = max_val\nelse:\n    other_max = [x for x in a if x < max_val]\n    if other_max:\n        second_max = max(other_max)\n    else:\n        second_max = max_val\n\nmin_val = min(a)\ncount_min = a.count(min_val)\nif count_min >= 2:\n    second_min = min_val\nelse:\n    other_min = [x for x in a if x > min_val]\n    if other_min:\n        second_min = min(other_min)\n    else:\n        second_min = min_val\n\nmin_instability = float('inf')\n\nfor x in a:\n    if x == max_val:\n        current_max = second_max\n    elif x == min_val:\n        current_min = second_min\n    else:\n        current_max = max_val\n        current_min = min_val\n    inst = current_max - current_min\n    if inst < min_instability:\n        min_instability = inst\n\nprint(min_instability)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of elements and the array itself.\n- **Finding Max and Min**: Compute the maximum and minimum values of the array.\n- **Second Max and Min Calculation**: Determine the second highest and lowest values that would take effect if the highest or lowest value is removed.\n- **Iterate Through Elements**: For each element, simulate its removal and compute the resulting instability.\n- **Track Minimum Instability**: Keep track of the smallest instability encountered during the iteration.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum possible instability by leveraging precomputed values and iterating through the array only once, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
