Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about feeding a golorp, which is a creature that eats variables. The input is the name of the golorp, and I need to find the lex smallest sequence of variable values that can be fed to it. If it's impossible, output 'false'.\n\nHmm, from the example given, each golorp's diet is defined by its name. So the name must represent some structure that determines which variables are used and their order. Also, each variable can take a value from 0 to 9. And the goal is to find the lex smallest possible sequence, which means choosing the smallest possible digits in the earliest positions possible.\n\nWait, what's the structure of the name? It mentions something about the shape of the jaws. Oh right, probably the name represents the way variables are passed through the golorp's system. Like, each part of the name might correspond to a path where variables are assigned, and the constraints on those variables.\n\nI remember from similar problems that in Befunge-like languages, the program is written on a grid, and the path taken by the pointer (like the direction changes) defines the flow of execution. So maybe the golorp's name is similar—each character represents a direction or a choice point for the variables.\n\nSo perhaps the name is a path that defines the dependencies between variables. For example, certain variables are required before others, and each step in the path assigns a digit to a variable, with certain constraints based on the path.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Each node in the path could represent a variable. The edges between them might represent constraints: for example, one variable must be less than another, or equal, or some other relationship. But wait, looking at the problem statement, the variables can be any from 0-9, but the golorp's name defines the necessary variables and their order.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the variables' values are from 0 to 9, inclusive. So each variable is a single digit. But when a variable is consumed, it's assigned a value, and these assignments must satisfy certain conditions imposed by the name.\n\nWait, perhaps the name represents a directed graph where each edge indicates an assignment constraint. For example, moving from one character to the next in the name might involve setting a variable based on the current state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the name is a series of nodes, each representing a variable, and the path through the name defines dependencies. For instance, each step in the path might require the current variable to be less than, greater than, or equal to the next variable. Or perhaps each step corresponds to a transition in a finite automaton that tracks the possible values.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the golorp will choose the lex smallest sequence. So we need to assign the variables in such a way that the entire sequence is as small as possible lex order. Lex order is determined first by the first digit, then the second, etc.\n\nSo perhaps the variables are arranged in an order, and each step along the path imposes constraints on the possible values of the variables. Our goal is to assign values to these variables, starting from the earliest possible, ensuring that all constraints are met and the overall sequence is lex smallest.\n\nHow can I model the constraints?\n\nLet me consider each position in the name as a step in a process. At each step, certain variables are being set, and their values depend on previous steps.\n\nFor example, the name could be something like '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' and the output is '0010'. Hmm, but I'm not sure how to parse this.\n\nWait, maybe the name represents a series of operations that define the variables. Each part of the string corresponds to a function that sets certain variables based on previous ones.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each character in the string represents a step where a variable is either assigned a value or compared to another variable. For example, a '+' might indicate a sum, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the name is a path in a graph where each node is a variable, and each edge represents a condition. For instance, if you move from A to B, then the value of B must be less than A, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the name as a series of tokens where each token represents a transition that requires certain constraints on the variables involved.\n\nWait, perhaps each character in the name is a command that dictates how variables are assigned. For example, '?' might mean that the current variable can be 0 or 1, trying to minimize the lex order. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAnother approach: look for information on similar problems. Oh right, I recall a problem called \"Befunge Interpretation\" or something similar, where the name represents a path that the program takes. But this might not directly apply here.\n\nWait, perhaps the name",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values that can be fed to a golorp based on its name. The name of the golorp defines the structure of its jaws and stomach, which in turn dictates the constraints on the variables.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves parsing the golorp's name to identify the structure of its system. The name is a string where each character represents a step or a condition in the system. Each variable can take a value from 0 to 9, and we need to find the smallest possible sequence of these values that satisfies all constraints imposed by the golorp's name.\n\n2. **Graph Representation**: We model the golorp's name as a directed graph where each node represents a variable and each edge represents a constraint between two variables. For example, moving from one character to another might mean the current variable must be less than the next.\n\n3. **Topological Sorting**: To find the lexicographically smallest sequence, we use a topological sort approach. We start from the earliest possible variable and assign the smallest possible value while respecting the constraints imposed by the edges.\n\n4. **Backtracking with Pruning**: Given the constraints, we use a backtracking approach with pruning to efficiently explore possible values for each variable, ensuring we always choose the smallest possible value at each step.\n\n5. **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We implement a recursive DFS to explore all valid sequences of variable values, keeping track of the current path and constraints. If a valid sequence is found, we return it; otherwise, we backtrack and try other possibilities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input =
