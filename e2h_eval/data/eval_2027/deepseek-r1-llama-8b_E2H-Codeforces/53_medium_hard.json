    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap, so that's something to consider.\n\nLet me think about the approach. So the problem is similar to finding the longest repeated substring, but with a twist that they can be overlapping.\n\nFirst, I remember that for such substring problems, one common approach is using a suffix automaton or a suffix array. But maybe for a string of length up to 100, a brute-force approach might be feasible. Let me see.\n\nWait, the maximum string length is 100. So the number of possible substrings is O(n^2), which is 100*100=10,000. For each possible substring, I can check if it appears again somewhere else in the string.\n\nSo maybe the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the string and record their starting and ending indices.\n2. For each substring, check if there exists another occurrence (possibly overlapping) in the string.\n3. Keep track of the maximum length found.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check if a substring appears more than once?\n\nAn alternative approach: for each possible substring length l, starting from the maximum possible down to 1, check if any substring of that length appears more than once. Once we find the largest l for which this is true, we return it.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So let's outline this approach:\n\n- Iterate l from len(s) down to 1:\n   - For each possible starting index i, extract the substring s[i:i+l].\n   - Check if this substring appears again in s, possibly overlapping.\n   - If any such substring exists, return l as the answer.\n\nThis way, we start checking the longest possible substrings first and return as soon as we find the maximum l. This is efficient because once we find the maximum l, we don't need to check smaller ones.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement the check efficiently.\n\nFor each l, I can collect all the substrings of length l into a dictionary, where the key is the substring and the value is a list of starting indices. Then, if any key has a list of length >=2, then that substring appears at least twice.\n\nWait, but since the substrings can be of any length, and for each l, I process all possible substrings of that length.\n\nSo, for each l from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   Create a set to store all the substrings of length l encountered so far.\n   For each i from 0 to len(s) - l:\n       current_sub = s[i:i+l]\n       if current_sub is already in the set, then return l as the maximum.\n       else, add it to the set.\n   Wait, no, because adding it to the set only records the first occurrence. So this approach would not capture overlapping occurrences.\n\nWait, maybe I should, for each l, slide a window of size l through the string, and for each position, check if any previous substring of the same length matches the current one. If yes, then return l.\n\nAlternatively, for each l, loop through the string, and for each i, check if s[i:i+l] appears again in s, perhaps in positions i+1 onwards.\n\nBut checking for each i whether the substring occurs again could be time-consuming. Hmm.\n\nBut considering the maximum string length is 100, even a O(n^3) solution would be acceptable.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nLoop l from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   For each possible starting index i (from 0 to len(s)-l):\n\n      substring = s[i:i+l]\n\n      Check if this substring appears again in s, starting at any position j >=i+1 (allowing overlaps).\n\n      How? For each j from i+1 to len(s)-l:\n\n          if s[j:j+l] == substring:\n\n              then return l as the answer.\n\nIf after checking all l's, none are found, return 0 (since the problem says \"at least twice\", and the minimal is a substring that repeats).\n\nWait, but wait: what if the entire string is unique? Like 'a', then the output is 0. Or if the string is length 1, output is 0.\n\nSo, the algorithm would proceed as follows:\n\nFor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        for j in range(i+1, len(s) - l + 1):\n            if s[j:j+l] == substr:\n                print(l)\n                exit()\nSo, as soon as any such l is found, we can return it.\n\nBut wait, for l= len(s), it's only possible if the string is empty, which it isn't. So for l= len(s), the substring is the entire string, so it appears only once. So no.\n\nThen, for l= len(s)-1, etc.\n\nThis approach will find the maximum possible l quickly because it starts from the largest possible l.\n\nBut wait, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → Output 0.\n\nBecause no substring appears twice.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → Output 3.\n\nBecause 'aba' occurs at positions 0-2 and 2-4. So when l=3, during the loops:\n\ni=0: substr is 'aba'. Then j runs from 1, 2, etc. When j=2: substr 'aba' again. So returns 3.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → Output 2.\n\nBecause 'zz' occurs at positions 0-1 and 1-2.\n\nSo for l=2:\n\ni=0: substr 'zz', then j=1: substr 'zz' again. So returns 2.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, strings are zero-based.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nfor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        for j in range(i+1, len(s) - l + 1):\n            if s[j:j+l] == substr:\n                print(l)\n                exit()\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but len(s) can be 100, so the maximum l is 100.\n\nBut in the loops, for l=100, i can only be 0, and j can't be 1 because len(s) - l +1 is 1, so j starts at i+1=1, but len(s)-l+1 is 1, so the second loop for j is from 1 to 0 (since upper limit is 1, but j starts at 1 and ends before 1). So the inner loop doesn't run, and no match is found.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaa' → the maximum substring is 'aa', which occurs at positions 0-1 and 1-2.\n\nSo when l=2, i=0: substr 'aa'. j=1: substr 'aa' → match, so return 2.\n\nBut wait, when l=3, the substr is 'aaa' which only appears once.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nWhat about 'abab'? It has 'aba' and 'bab' but also 'ab' appearing multiple times.\n\nWait, the maximum is 2, because 'ab' appears at 0-1 and 2-3.\n\nSo when l=2, i=0: substr 'ab'. j=2: substr 'ab' → match. So returns 2.\n\nAnother case: 'abcabc' → the maximum is 3, as 'abc' appears at 0-2 and 3-5.\n\nSo the code would catch that.\n\nSo, I think the approach is correct.\n\nNow, what about the efficiency? For each l, the outer loop is O(n) steps. For each i, the inner loop is O(n) steps. Each step involves slicing the string, which is O(k) where k is the length of the substring. So for each l, the time is O(n*l). Since l decreases from n to 1, the total time is O(n^3), which for n=100 is 1e6 operations—manageable.\n\nThus, this approach is feasible.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nThe code should read the string from standard input, process it, and print the result.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 'abcd'\n\nOutput: 0\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: 'ababa'\n\nOutput: 3\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput: 'zzz'\n\nOutput: 2\n\nSo the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nWait, in the code, the print statement is inside the if condition, so as soon as a match is found, it's printed and the program exits.\n\nYes.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nCase when the string is all same characters, like 'aaaaa' → the maximum substring is 4, since 'aaaa' occurs at 0-3 and 1-4.\n\nWait, wait, no. Because for l=4, 'aaaa' appears at 0-3 and 1-4.\n\nSo in the code:\n\nl=5: only one occurrence.\n\nl=4: check i=0, substr 'aaaa'. Then j=1: substr 'aaaa' again. So returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: string of length 1: 'a' → output 0.\n\nString of length 2 with two same characters: 'aa' → returns 2.\n\nAnother case: 'abba' → the substring 'bb' appears at 1-2 and 2-3. So l=2.\n\nSo the code would find it.\n\nI think the code is correct.\n\nSo now, the final code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\nThe approach involves checking each possible substring length starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, we check if any substring of that length appears more than once in the string. If we find such a substring, we return its length immediately as it will be the longest possible.\n\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the length of the entire string and decrement down to 1.\n2. **Generate Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length.\n3. **Check for Repeats**: For each generated substring, check if it appears again in the string, possibly overlapping with itself.\n4. **Return the Length**: As soon as a valid substring is found, return its length. If no such substring is found after checking all lengths, return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the longest possible substring efficiently by leveraging the fact that we start from the largest possible substrings and work our way down.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\nfor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        for j in range(i+1, len(s) - l + 1):\n            if s[j:j+l] == substr:\n                print(l)\n                exit()\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We loop from the length of the string down to 1.\n- **Generate Substrings**: For each length `l`, generate substrings starting from each possible index `i`.\n- **Check for Repeats**: For each substring, check if it appears again starting from any subsequent index `j`. If a repeat is found, print the length `l` and exit.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If no repeating substring is found after checking all lengths, print 0.\n\nThis solution efficiently finds the longest repeating substring by leveraging nested loops and substring checks, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for strings up to the maximum length constraint.",
