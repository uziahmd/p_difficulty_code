    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the smallest non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is as small as possible. If there are multiple k's that give the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest k.\n\nHmm, let's think about this. The LCM of two numbers is equal to (product of the two numbers) divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). So, LCM(x, y) = x*y / GCD(x, y). \n\nWait, but in our case, both numbers are a +k and b +k. Let's denote d = GCD(a, b). Then, since a and b can be written as a = d * m and b = d * n, where m and n are coprime (their GCD is 1). \n\nSo when we add k to both, a + k = d*m + k and b +k = d*n + k. Let's factor this: d*(m) + k = k + d*m, and similarly for the other term. Let me think about the GCD of these two terms.\n\nWait, what's the GCD of (a + k) and (b +k)? Let's compute GCD(a +k, b +k). Since a +k - (b +k) = a - b. So the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is the same as GCD(d*m +k, d*n +k). Hmm, maybe I can find a way to express this.\n\nAlternatively, since a and b have a GCD of d, their difference is d*(m -n), assuming m > n without loss of generality. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider the expression (a +k) and (b +k). Their difference is a - b. So, GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(a - b + 2k, a +k). Wait, no, because the GCD(a +k, b +k) is the same as GCD(b +k, a +k - (b +k)) which is GCD(b +k, a - b). Or wait, more accurately, GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(b +k, a - b). Because:\n\nGCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(b +k, (a +k) - (b +k)) = GCD(b +k, a - b).\n\nSo, let me denote c = a - b. Then GCD(a +k, b +k) = GCD(c + 2k, c), right? Because b +k = (c + 2k) when c is negative, but I think that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should write it as GCD( |c|, (b +k) ) or something like that.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to note that the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) must divide their difference, which is (a - b). So the GCD is a divisor of |a - b|. Let me denote g = GCD(a, b). Then, since a = g * m and b = g * n, where m and n are coprime, the difference a - b is g*(m - n). So the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) must divide g*(m - n). Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe I can find that the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is equal to the GCD(g, 2k + (m -n)*g). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal k is such that a +k and b +k share as many factors as possible, but since they are being added, perhaps choosing k such that a +k and b +k are multiples of some divisors of d.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the problem differently. We need to minimize the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k). Since LCM is minimized when the two numbers are as close as possible, but also when they share as much common factors as possible.\n\nBut how do we find the k that achieves this?\n\nLet me think about the sample input.\n\nFirst sample: a=6, b=10. So the optimal k is 2. Let's see why.\n\na +k =8, b +k=12. LCM is 24.\n\nIf we try k=0: LCM(6,10)=30.\n\nk=1:7 and 11 â†’ LCM=77.\n\nk=2:8 and 12 â†’ 24.\n\nk=3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer \\( k \\) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) is minimized. If there are multiple values of \\( k \\) that yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the LCM of two numbers \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). The LCM of two numbers can be expressed as \\( \\text{LCM}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{\\text{GCD}(x, y)} \\). Therefore, minimizing the LCM involves finding \\( k \\) such that \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are as close as possible and share common factors.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) plays a crucial role in determining the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\). Specifically, the GCD of \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) must divide the absolute difference \\( |a - b| \\).\n\n3. **Optimal \\( k \\)**: We need to find \\( k \\) such that \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) share the largest possible common divisors. This often happens when \\( a + k \\) and \\( b + k \\) are multiples of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n\n4. **Algorithm**:\n   - Compute the GCD of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   - Determine potential values of \\( k \\) by considering the divisors of the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n   - For each candidate \\( k \\), compute the LCM and keep track of the minimum LCM and the corresponding smallest \\( k \\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef find_min_k(a, b):\n    if a >= b:\n        a, b = b, a  # To ensure a < b for easier calculation\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    diff = b - a  # Since a < b, diff is positive\n    \n    # Consider possible k's based on divisors of diff\n    candidates = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(diff)) + 1):\n        if diff % i == 0:\n            candidates.add(i)\n            candidates.add(diff // i)\n    \n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    \n    for k in candidates:\n        x = a + k\n        y = b + k\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = (x * y) // current_gcd\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k\n    \n    return best_k\n\n# Read input\na, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n# Find the optimal k\nk = find_min_k(a, b)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\).\n2. **Finding Optimal \\( k \\)**: The function `find_min_k` computes the smallest \\( k \\) by considering divisors of the difference between \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). It evaluates each candidate \\( k \\) to determine which one yields the smallest LCM.\n3. **Output**: The smallest \\( k \\) is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down potential values of \\( k \\) using the properties of divisors and GCD, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and efficient.",
