Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles that satisfy certain conditions. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about counting triangles with integer sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means that x + y > z.\n\nHmm, right. So the constraints are quite specific here. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to iterate over all possible x, y, z within their ranges. But considering that A, B, C, D can be up to 5e5, a brute-force approach is definitely not feasible. So I need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet me think about the structure of x, y, z. Since x is between A and B, y is between B and C (and must be ≥x), and z is between C and D (and must be ≥y). Also, for the triangle condition, x + y > z must hold.\n\nWait, but since y is at least B, and x is at most B, so x could be up to B, but y is from x (since x ≤ B and y ≥ B) but wait no: the condition is x ≤ B ≤ y, so y starts from B and goes up to C. So x is in [A, B], y is in [max(B, x), C], but wait, no—no, because the condition is x ≤ B ≤ y. So y must be ≥ B, but x can be anything up to B. So y is from B up to C.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], each y in [B, C], and each z in [C, D], but with the constraint that x + y > z. But even this approach would be O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)*(D-C+1)), which is way too big if the numbers are large.\n\nSo I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me consider that for a fixed x and y, what is the range of z that satisfies z < x + y, and also z ≥ C (since z is at least C), and z ≤ D.\n\nWait, but z is also at least y, since y ≤ C ≤ z. Because y is between B and C, and z is at least C. So for a given y, z starts at max(y, C) but wait, since y ≤ C, so z starts at C.\n\nWait, no. Because z has to be ≥ y? Or wait, no: the condition is y ≤ C ≤ z, so z is ≥ C, and since y is ≥ B, but y can be up to C. So for example, if y is 3 and C is 3, then z is at least 3.\n\nSo for each x and y, z can range from C to min(D, x+y-1). But z also must be ≥ y, but since C ≥ y (because y is ≤ C), because y is in [B, C], then C is >= y. So z starts from C and goes up to min(D, x+y-1).\n\nSo for each x, y, the number of valid z is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1).\n\nBut wait, z must be >= C, and <= D. So the valid z's are C <= z <= min(D, x+y-1). So the count is max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) if x + y > C; else zero.\n\nWait, no. If x + y <= C, then min(D, x+y-1) could be less than C. So in that case, there are no z's. So the total for that x and y is zero.\n\nOtherwise, it's the number of integers from C to min(D, x+y-1), inclusive.\n\nSo for each x in [A, B], and y in [B, C], compute s = x + y. Then the lower bound for z is C, upper bound is min(D, s-1). The count is max(0, upper - lower + 1) if upper >= lower; else zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to summing over all x in [A,B], y in [B,C], the value of max(0, min(D, x+y-1) - C + 1) if x+y > C, else 0.\n\nBut again, iterating through every x and y is O((B-A+1)*(C-B+1)), which can be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nI need a way to compute this efficiently without iterating each x and y.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I can find a mathematical",
