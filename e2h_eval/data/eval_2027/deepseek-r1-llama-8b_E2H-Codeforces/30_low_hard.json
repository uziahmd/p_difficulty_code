Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a game where two players, Homer and Marge, take turns picking digits from a number A, which has 2n digits. Each player makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2, which are built by appending the digits they pick each turn. The output should be a string of 'H' and 'M' indicating who picks each digit in order.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is to find the optimal sequence of H and M such that both players make exactly n moves, and the resulting S1 and S2 are as large as possible when summed together.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since each choice affects future choices, it's a dynamic programming problem. But wait, what's the state here?\n\nEach state could represent the current position in the string, how many digits have been taken so far by each player, and the current values of S1 and S2. But wait, S1 and S2 can be up to 2n digits, which is a huge number. Storing their actual values isn't feasible for n=18 because 18 digits can be up to 10^18, which is way too big for DP states.\n\nSo I need another approach. Maybe instead of tracking the actual numbers, we can track some properties that allow us to compare the outcomes without knowing the exact values.\n\nWait, since the sum S1 + S2 is what we want to maximize, perhaps we can find a way to represent the state in terms of the remaining digits and the counts of each player's digits taken so far.\n\nBut even that might not be straightforward because the order in which digits are taken affects the overall sum significantly.\n\nAnother angle: Since each move adds a digit to either S1 or S2, the earlier digits have higher weights (since they're in more significant places). So the first digits chosen should be as large as possible, but the problem is that the choice alternates between the two players.\n\nWait, no. Because each turn, one player takes a digit and appends it to their number. So the first digit goes to either S1 or S2, depending on who starts. Wait, wait—no. Actually, the players determine who will make the next move. So initially, they decide the order. Oh, no, the problem says \"before each turn, players determine who will make the next move.\" Hmm, that complicates things. So the players can choose the order in which they take the digits. So the initial step is to decide the order of turns.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"each player should make exactly n moves.\" So the total number of turns is 2n, with each making exactly n moves. So the sequence is a permutation of H and M with exactly n of each.\n\nSo the players can arrange the order of their moves, but in the end, each must have made exactly n moves. So the problem is about choosing which player takes each digit in the order that maximizes the sum of their numbers.\n\nSo the question is, given the string A of 2n digits, assign each digit to either H or M, with exactly n each, such that the sum of the numbers formed by H and M is as large as possible.\n\nAh! So the problem reduces to selecting n digits for H and n digits for M, such that the sum of the numbers they form is maximized. Then, the order in which these digits are taken also matters because the earlier digits contribute more to the sum.\n\nWait, but the order in which the digits are picked also determines their positions in S1 and S2. For example, if H picks the first digit, it's the most significant digit in S1. If M picks the second digit, it's the second most significant in S2.\n\nSo the problem isn't just about selecting which digits go to H and M, but also the order in which they are picked.\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that the order in which the digits are selected affects their contribution to the total sum. So to maximize the sum, we need to select the largest available digit at each step, and assign it to the player whose turn it is, but considering that each player must make exactly n moves.\n\nWait, but the assignment isn't fixed in the order. Players can choose to take a digit on any turn, but each must take exactly n digits. So it's like a scheduling problem where each player has to take n steps, and at each step, a player takes the next digit and adds it to their number.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can model this using dynamic programming, keeping track of the current state as:\n\n- The current position in the string.\n- The number of digits taken by H and M so far.\n- The last digit taken by each player, so that we can compare which choice leads",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for two players, Homer and Marge, such that both make exactly `n` moves each, and the sum of their numbers formed by the digits they pick is maximized.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to use dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the best possible outcome given the current state. The state will be defined by:\n- The current position in the string.\n- The number of digits taken by each player so far.\n- The last digit taken by each player, to ensure we always take the largest available digit next.\n\nThe DP state can be represented as `dp[i][h][m][a][b]`, where:\n- `i` is the current position in the string.\n- `h` is the number of digits taken by Homer.\n- `m` is the number of digits taken by Marge.\n- `a` is the last digit taken by Homer.\n- `b` is the last digit taken by Marge.\n\nThe value of the DP state will be the maximum sum achievable from that point onwards.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = list(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(pos, h, m, a, b):\n        if pos == 2*n:\n            return 0\n        res = 0\n        # Take the current digit and decide who takes it\n        current = A[pos]\n        # Option 1: assign to H\n        new_h = h + 1\n        new_m = m\n        new_a = current\n        new_b = b\n        score_h = int(current) * 10**(n -
