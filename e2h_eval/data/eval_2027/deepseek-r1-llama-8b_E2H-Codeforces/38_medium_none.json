    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read it carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph. Then, among all such graphs with that minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, what's a p-reachable graph? Oh right, it's a directed graph where exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) satisfy u < v, they are reachable from each other, and there's no path back from v to u.\n\nHmm, so for each such pair (u, v), u can reach v, but v cannot reach u, and u < v. And also, u must not be equal to v.\n\nThe goal is to find two things: first, the minimal number of nodes n needed to have exactly p such pairs. Second, for that n, maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nEach unidirectional pair is like a directed edge from u to v, but with certain conditions.\n\nBut wait, the definition says that a directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, reachable both ways? No, wait. Wait, the problem says that in a p-reachable graph, there are exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v, there exists a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So these are directed edges that are one-way, forming a kind of DAG structure within the graph.\n\nWait, no. Because for any such pair (u, v), u can reach v, but v cannot reach u. So these are directed edges that are part of a DAG, because if you have u → v, and v can't reach u, then this is a unidirectional edge.\n\nBut wait, more precisely, the existence of such a pair (u, v) implies that u can reach v via a path, but v cannot reach u. So the pair (u, v) is considered as an ordered pair where u < v. So we're counting all such pairs in the graph.\n\nSo the problem is to construct a graph with n nodes that has exactly p such ordered pairs, and n is as small as possible.\n\nThen, among all such possible graphs with minimal n, find the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs in G.\n\nHmm.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the minimal n.\n\nI think the minimal n is determined by how we arrange the edges to maximize the number of such pairs per node. Because each edge can contribute to multiple such pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to arranging the graph as a linear chain, where each edge points from lower-numbered nodes to higher-numbered ones. But wait, that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest n such that the sum from i=1 to k of (i-1) choose something equals p. Or maybe it's related to the triangular numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that (n choose 2) >= p. Because each possible unordered pair {u, v} contributes at most one to p if the directed edges go in a way that u can reach v but v can't reach u.\n\nWait, no. Because for each pair (u, v), u can have a path to v, but v can't have a path back. So the directionality determines whether this contributes to p.\n\nSo in the minimal graph, we want to arrange as many such edges as possible with as few nodes as possible.\n\nLet me think about how to arrange the edges. Each edge u → v adds 1 to p only if u < v and there's no path from v to u. So, to maximize p for a given n, we need as many edges as possible in a way that u < v and v can't reach u.\n\nWait, but in a directed acyclic graph (DAG), if u has an edge to v, and u < v, and the graph is structured so that all edges go from lower-numbered nodes to higher-numbered ones, then each such edge would be unidirectional because v can't reach u since it's a DAG and u comes before v.\n\nWait, no. Because in a DAG, if there's a path from u to v, but no path from v to u, then the pair (u, v) contributes to p. So for example, in a simple chain like 1→2→3, the pairs (1,2), (2,3), and (1,3) via the path would count as p=3. Wait, no: each pair (u, v) where u < v and u can reach v without v reaching u.\n\nSo in the chain 1→2→3, the pairs (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). For each, u can reach v but v cannot reach u. So the total p is 3.\n\nSo the minimal n for p=3 is 3.\n\nSimilarly, for p=4, what's the minimal n?\n\nIf n=3, the maximum p is 3, which is less than 4. So n=4.\n\nWait, let's see. For n=4, how many possible such pairs can we have?\n\nIn the best case, arrange the graph as 1→2→3→4. Then the pairs are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), totaling 6. But wait, that's 6, but p is 6. So for p=6, n=4 would suffice.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. The p is the count of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, u can reach v, and v cannot reach u. So in the chain 1→2→3→4, each edge u→v (where u < v) will contribute to the p count if v cannot reach u. Since the graph is a chain, for any u < v, u can reach v but v cannot reach u. So each such pair (u, v) where u < v is a pair in p.\n\nSo for n=4, the number of such pairs is 6. So for p=6, n=4.\n\nBut for p=4, what's the minimal n? Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the sum from k=1 to n of k-1 is >= p. Wait, no, that's the sum of the first n-1 integers, which is n(n-1)/2. So when p is up to n(n-1)/2, the minimal n is the smallest n where n(n-1)/2 >= p.\n\nWait, but in the case where p is 4: 3*2/2=3 <4. 4*3/2=6>=4. So n=4.\n\nWait, but maybe we can get p=4 with n=4. How? Let's think.\n\nSuppose we have 4 nodes. We can have a graph that forms two chains, say 1→2→3 and 4. So in this case, the pairs are:\n\n1→2, 1→3, 2→3.\n\nAdditionally, 4 can't reach anyone else, so no outgoing edges. So the p count is 3.\n\nThat's not enough.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the graph as 1→2, 2→3, 3→4. Then the pairs are 1→2, 1→3, 1→4, 2→3, 2→4, 3→4. That's 6.\n\nSo for p=4, perhaps n=4 is not sufficient. Or am I missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps I can have a more complex structure. Maybe 1→2, 2→3, 3→4, but also 1→3, 1→4, 2→4. So that's a lot of edges, but I'm trying to count the p pairs.\n\nWait, but each time I add an edge u→v where u < v, it could contribute to p if v can't reach u.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: for a given n, the maximum possible p is the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, which is C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2. Because each such pair can be a unidirectional edge.\n\nBut that's only possible if the graph is arranged in a way that for every u < v, u can reach v and v cannot reach u. Which is possible only if the graph is a DAG, and for every u < v, there's a direct edge from u to v, but no path from v to u. Wait, but that's not possible because if u can reach v directly, and v can't reach u, but u could reach v via some longer path.\n\nWait, no. If the graph is a DAG with a topological order 1, 2, ..., n, then for any u < v, there's a path from u to v (since in topological order, u comes before v, so all edges go from earlier to later nodes), but there's no path from v to u. So each such (u, v) pair is in p. Thus, the maximum p for a graph with n nodes is C(n,2).\n\nSo for a given p, the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n,2) >= p.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the maximum p possible for n nodes is C(n,2), so if p is less than or equal to that, then n is the minimal.\n\nSo for example, when p=3, the minimal n is 3, since C(3,2)=3.\n\nWhen p=4, C(3,2)=3 <4, so minimal n is 4, since C(4,2)=6 >=4.\n\nSo for general p, the minimal n is the smallest n such that n(n-1)/2 >=p.\n\nSo the first part of the problem is solved.\n\nNow, the second part: among all possible p-reachable graphs with minimal n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, what's an unidirectional pair? It's a pair (u, v) where u can reach v, v can't reach u, and u < v. So in the context of the problem, this is exactly the same as the p-reachability condition. So each such pair is an unidirectional pair.\n\nSo the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is exactly p.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because the problem says that in the first test case, p=3, the output was 0 unidirectional pairs. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the note:\n\nIn the first test case, p=3, the output is '3 0'. So the minimal n is 3, and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nWait, that suggests that in that case, the graph had 3 nodes, but no unidirectional pairs. So why is that?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definitions.\n\nWait, the problem says that a directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, u != v, u can reach v, and v cannot reach u.\n\nSo each such pair contributes to p, and the total is p.\n\nBut the unidirectional pairs are exactly these pairs. So the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is p.\n\nBut in the first test case, p=3, the output is 0. So that contradicts my understanding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says, \"Also, among all such p-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes, let G denote a graph which maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs of nodes. Find this number.\"\n\nSo for p=3, in the minimal graph (3 nodes), the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nWait, that's strange. So how is that possible?\n\nIn the first test case, the graph is 3 nodes, and it's p-reachable with p=3. So there are 3 such ordered pairs. But in this graph, the number of unidirectional pairs is zero.\n\nWait, that suggests that the graph is such that for each of the 3 ordered pairs (u, v), u can reach v, but v can reach u. So the pairs don't qualify as unidirectional.\n\nBut that can't be, because if u can reach v and v can reach u, then (u, v) doesn't count towards p, because the condition is that v can't reach u.\n\nSo perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem counts all the pairs (u, v) where u < v and u can reach v, regardless of whether v can reach u. But that would make p larger than the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nNo, the problem says that a p-reachable graph has exactly p ordered pairs where u < v, u !=v, u can reach v, and v cannot reach u.\n\nSo each such pair is counted once, and the total is p.\n\nSo for a graph with n nodes, the maximal number of unidirectional pairs is p.\n\nBut in the first test case, the output is 0.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the definition of unidirectional pairs and the p-reachable condition.\n\nWait, perhaps the unidirectional pairs are the same as the p-reachable pairs.\n\nSo for the first test case, the graph is such that p=3, but the number of unidirectional pairs is 0. That suggests that none of the 3 ordered pairs are unidirectional.\n\nWhich would mean that for each of the 3 pairs, u can reach v and v can reach u. But that would imply that the graph is strongly connected for those pairs.\n\nBut that's impossible because if u can reach v and v can reach u, then the pair (u, v) is not counted in p.\n\nSo perhaps the initial understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the unidirectional pairs are different from the p-reachable pairs.\n\nWait, the problem says: unidirectional pairs are ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u.\n\nWhich is exactly the same as the p-reachable condition.\n\nSo each unidirectional pair is a p-reachable pair, and vice versa.\n\nThus, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is p.\n\nBut in the first test case, p=3, the output is 0 unidirectional pairs. That's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the sample input. Let me check.\n\nSample Input: 3\n\nSample Output: 3 0.\n\nSo the minimal n is 3, and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nThat suggests that in the graph, there are no unidirectional pairs, but there are 3 p-reachable pairs.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because if a pair is p-reachable, it must be unidirectional.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem is using different definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the p-reachable graph has p pairs where u can reach v and v can reach u. Or perhaps it's the opposite.\n\nWait, no. The problem says:\n\nAn ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u != v, u can reach v, and v cannot reach u.\n\nSo for a p-reachable graph, the count of such pairs is exactly p.\n\nThus, in the first test case, the graph has 3 such pairs, but the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is 0. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect.\n\nWait, the note says:\n\nIn the first test case, the graph is 3 nodes, and the output is 0. So the graph has 3 p-reachable pairs, but none of them are unidirectional.\n\nWait, that's impossible.\n\nBecause for each p-reachable pair (u, v), by definition, v cannot reach u. So each such pair is an unidirectional pair.\n\nThus, in the first test case, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs should be 3. But the sample output is 0.\n\nThis suggests that I have a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the reverse. Perhaps the unidirectional pairs are those where v can reach u but u cannot reach v. But that's the opposite.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm reading the problem statement incorrectly.\n\nLooking again:\n\nA directed graph is called p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\n\nWait, that's different. So, for a pair (u, v) where u can reach v and v can reach u, and u < v, this counts towards p. But the unidirectional pairs are those where u can reach v but v can't reach u.\n\nSo the p-reachable graph has p pairs where u and v are mutually reachable, regardless of the directionality.\n\nAnd the unidirectional pairs are those where u can reach v, v can't reach u.\n\nSo for the first test case, p=3, the graph has 3 such mutual pairs, but the maximum unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nSo in that case, the graph is constructed such that for each of the 3 pairs (u, v), u can reach v and v can reach u. So these are mutual pairs, contributing to p but not to unidirectional.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because for a pair (u, v), if u can reach v and v can reach u, then it's a bidirectional pair, not unidirectional.\n\nThus, the p-reachable graph is a graph that has p pairs (u, v) where u < v, u != v, and u can reach v and v can reach u.\n\nWait, that's a completely different definition. So the p is the number of such pairs that are mutually reachable.\n\nSo the problem statement says:\n\nAn ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u != v, u can reach v, and v cannot reach u.\n\nA p-reachable graph has exactly p such ordered pairs.\n\nSo the p is the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nBut in the first test case, the output is 0, meaning that the graph has 3 p-reachable pairs, but none of them are unidirectional.\n\nWait, that can't happen because each p-reachable pair is unidirectional.\n\nSo perhaps I have to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I read the problem statement incorrectly. Let's read it again.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nAn ordered pair (u, v) is unidirectional if u ≠ v, there exists a path from u to v, and there are no paths from v to u.\n\nA directed graph is called p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) such that u < v and u and v are reachable from each other.\n\nAh, wait! So the graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, u and v are reachable (so u can reach v and v can reach u), and u ≠ v.\n\nSo the p is the number of such pairs where u < v, u and v are reachable from each other.\n\nSo in this case, each such pair is a bidirectional pair.\n\nSo the unidirectional pairs are separate. They are ordered pairs (u, v) where u can reach v, but v can't reach u.\n\nSo now, the problem is to find the minimal n such that the graph has exactly p such bidirectional pairs, and among all such graphs with minimal n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, that's a different problem.\n\nSo, the first task is to find the minimal n where we can have a graph with p bidirectional pairs (u, v) where u < v, and u can reach v and v can reach u.\n\nThen, among all such graphs with minimal n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo, for example, in the first test case, p=3.\n\nWe need a graph with exactly 3 such bidirectional pairs (u, v) where u < v.\n\nWhat's the minimal n? For n=3, we can have 3 such pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). But wait, in a graph with 3 nodes, each node can reach the others, but the bidirectional pairs are the ones where u < v. So for n=3, the number of such pairs is 3.\n\nSo the minimal n is 3.\n\nThen, among all such graphs with 3 nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, in the first test case, the output is 0. So the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nBut how?\n\nIf the graph is such that in each bidirectional pair (u, v), u can reach v and v can reach u, then there are no unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo for n=3, in the graph where each node can reach every other node, the number of unidirectional pairs is zero.\n\nThus, in that case, the maximum is zero.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find a graph with exactly p bidirectional pairs (u < v, u can reach v, v can reach u), and minimal n.\n\nThen, among all such graphs, find the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo, the first step is to find the minimal n such that the maximal number of bidirectional pairs for n is at least p.\n\nWait, but the problem requires exactly p bidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest n such that the maximum possible number of bidirectional pairs for n is ≥p.\n\nWait, for n nodes, the maximum possible number of bidirectional pairs is the number of possible unordered pairs, which is C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nSo for a graph to have exactly p such pairs, the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n,2) ≥ p.\n\nFor example, p=3: n=3, since C(3,2)=3.\n\np=4: n=4, since C(3,2)=3 <4 ≤6=C(4,2).\n\nBut wait, perhaps in a graph, you can have any number of bidirectional pairs up to C(n,2). So for a given n, you can choose any subset of the possible bidirectional pairs.\n\nSo the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n,2) ≥p.\n\nThus, the first part of the output is n, where n is the smallest integer satisfying n(n-1)/2 ≥ p.\n\nNow, the second part is to find, among all such graphs with exactly p bidirectional pairs, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo, the question is, for a given n, how to arrange the graph to have exactly p bidirectional pairs, while maximizing the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nEach unidirectional pair is an ordered pair (u, v) where u can reach v and v cannot reach u.\n\nEach bidirectional pair is an ordered pair (u, v) where u can reach v and v can reach u.\n\nSo, the problem is to arrange the graph in such a way that the number of bidirectional pairs is p, and the number of unidirectional pairs is as large as possible.\n\nOur goal is to find, for the minimal n, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo, for a given n, how can we arrange the graph to have exactly p bidirectional pairs, and as many unidirectional pairs as possible.\n\nLet me think about the structure of such a graph.\n\nEach unidirectional pair (u, v) is a directed edge from u to v, but no edge from v to u.\n\nEach bidirectional pair (u, v) is a pair where u can reach v and v can reach u.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to have as many directed edges as possible that don't form a bidirectional pair.\n\nBut the graph must have exactly p bidirectional pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- Create a graph where the bidirectional pairs are exactly p, and all other possible directed edges (both unidirectional and possibly others) are unidirectional.\n\nWait, but the graph must not have any cycles, because if there's a cycle, then the nodes in the cycle can reach each other in both directions, creating bidirectional pairs.\n\nThus, the graph should be a DAG.\n\nWait, but in a DAG, there can be no cycles, so for any u and v, if u can reach v, v cannot reach u unless there's a path from v back to u. But in a DAG, that's not possible because of the topological order.\n\nWait, no. In a DAG, if u can reach v, then v cannot reach u, unless there's a back edge from v to an ancestor of u.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nIn a DAG, the reachability is a transitive closure that respects the topological order.\n\nSo, in a DAG, for any two distinct nodes u and v, either u can reach v, v can reach u, or neither.\n\nBut in our case, we need to have exactly p pairs (u, v) where u < v, u can reach v, and v can reach u. So these are the bidirectional pairs.\n\nSo the graph must consist of several strongly connected components (SCCs). But since the graph is a DAG, each SCC is a single node. Because in a DAG, there are no cycles except in single-node components.\n\nWait, no. A DAG can have multiple strongly connected components, each of which is a single node.\n\nSo, each node is its own SCC.\n\nThus, in a DAG, for any two nodes u and v, u can reach v if and only if there is a path from u to v.\n\nBut in a DAG, for any two nodes u and v, either u can reach v, v can reach u, or neither.\n\nWait, no. Because in a DAG, if u can reach v, then v cannot reach u, because otherwise, there would be a cycle.\n\nYes, because if u can reach v and v can reach u, then u can reach v via u → ... → v, and v can reach u via v → ... → u, which forms a cycle, contradicting the fact that the graph is a DAG.\n\nThus, in a DAG, for any two distinct nodes u and v, exactly one of the following is true: u can reach v, or v can reach u, but not both.\n\nThus, in a DAG, the number of bidirectional pairs (u, v) where u < v and u can reach v and v can reach u is zero.\n\nWait, because in a DAG, for any u and v, u can reach v or v can reach u, but not both.\n\nSo in a DAG, there are no bidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, that's a crucial insight.\n\nThus, if the graph is a DAG, then there are zero bidirectional pairs. But the problem requires the graph to have exactly p bidirectional pairs.\n\nThus, the graph cannot be a DAG.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Because according to the previous reasoning, in a DAG, there are no bidirectional pairs. So how can a graph have p bidirectional pairs?\n\nThis suggests that the graph must contain cycles, because in a non-DAG graph, there can be bidirectional pairs.\n\nThus, the graph must have cycles, which allows for bidirectional pairs.\n\nBut then, how to model this.\n\nLet me think: For a graph to have bidirectional pairs, it must have cycles. Because, consider a cycle u1 → u2 → ... → uk → u1. Then, for any two nodes in the cycle, say u_i and u_j, if i < j, then u_i can reach u_j and u_j can reach u_i, making (u_i, u_j) a bidirectional pair.\n\nThus, the more cycles we have, the more bidirectional pairs we can have.\n\nSo, to have p bidirectional pairs, the graph must have at least one cycle.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the graph can have multiple cycles, but the exact count depends on how the cycles are arranged.\n\nSo, the problem now is to construct a graph with exactly p bidirectional pairs, using as few nodes as possible, and then among all such graphs with minimal nodes, find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the minimal n.\n\nWe need to find the minimal n such that the maximum possible number of bidirectional pairs in a graph of n nodes is at least p.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum.\n\nWait, the maximum number of bidirectional pairs in a graph is achieved when as many pairs as possible have mutual reachability.\n\nSo, the maximum number is achieved when the graph is a complete undirected graph with all possible edges, but that's not applicable here because we're dealing with directed graphs.\n\nWait, no. For a directed graph, the maximum number of bidirectional pairs is achieved when the graph is such that for as many pairs (u, v) as possible, u can reach v and v can reach u.\n\nBut in a directed graph, this is challenging because it requires that for each such pair, there are paths in both directions.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum number of bidirectional pairs occurs when the graph is a collection of cliques, where each clique is a strongly connected component.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of bidirectional pairs is the number of edges in a tournament graph, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of bidirectional pairs in a directed graph is the number of edges in a complete undirected graph, which is C(n,2). But that's not possible because each directed edge can only contribute to one bidirectional pair.\n\nWait, no. For each unordered pair {u, v}, if the directed graph has edges u→v and v→u, then (u, v) is a bidirectional pair. So the number of such unordered pairs is the number of bidirectional pairs.\n\nThus, the maximum number of bidirectional pairs is the number of unordered pairs in the graph, which is C(n,2). But this is only possible if the graph is such that for every pair {u, v}, both u→v and v→u are present. That would require a complete undirected graph, but in directed terms, that's a complete graph with all possible edges in both directions.\n\nSo, for n nodes, the maximum number of bidirectional pairs is C(n,2).\n\nThus, the minimal n is the smallest n where C(n,2) ≥ p.\n\nSo, the first part of the output is n, where n is the smallest integer such that n(n-1)/2 ≥p.\n\nNow, for the second part, we need to construct a graph with exactly p bidirectional pairs, using minimal n, and maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nEach unidirectional pair is an ordered pair (u, v) where u can reach v, but v cannot reach u.\n\nTo maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to have as many such directed edges as possible.\n\nBut the graph must have exactly p bidirectional pairs.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- For the minimal n, construct a graph where p is the number of bidirectional pairs, and the rest of the possible directed edges are unidirectional.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nPerhaps the optimal way is to arrange the graph into a structure where there is a single strongly connected component (a cycle) that includes k nodes, and the rest of the nodes form a DAG that has no connections back into the cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way.\n\nLet me think: Suppose we have a cycle of m nodes. Then, for any two nodes u and v in the cycle, if u can reach v and v can reach u, thus forming a bidirectional pair. So the number of bidirectional pairs in the cycle is C(m,2).\n\nBut wait, in a cycle, for any two nodes u and v, if u can reach v and v can reach u, regardless of their order.\n\nBut in our case, the bidirectional pairs are those where u < v. So, for a cycle of m nodes, the number of bidirectional pairs is the number of unordered pairs {u, v} where u < v and both can reach each other. So for a cycle of m nodes, each such pair is a bidirectional pair.\n\nThus, the number of bidirectional pairs contributed by the cycle is C(m,2).\n\nNow, the remaining n - m nodes can be arranged in a way that they form a DAG with no cycles, and they have no edges pointing back into the cycle.\n\nThus, for each of these n - m nodes, they can have edges pointing to nodes within themselves, but not to the cycle.\n\nThus, the unidirectional pairs can be formed as follows:\n\n- Any edge from a node outside the cycle to a node inside the cycle is unidirectional if the inside node can't reach the outside.\n\nBut wait, in the arrangement, the outside nodes can't reach the inside nodes because the inside nodes are in a cycle and the outside nodes are arranged in a way that they can't reach the cycle.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because if the outside nodes are arranged in a way that they can reach the cycle, that could create more bidirectional pairs.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs is to have a single strongly connected component (the cycle) of size m, and the remaining n - m nodes form a DAG where each can reach some nodes in the cycle but are not reachable from them.\n\nWait, but in that case, the edges from the outside nodes to the cycle may form unidirectional pairs.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to have the outside nodes form a DAG where they cannot reach the cycle, and the cycle cannot reach them.\n\nThus, the outside nodes are arranged in a way that they can reach each other but cannot reach the cycle.\n\nIn this case, any edge from an outside node to a cycle node would be unidirectional (as the cycle node cannot reach the outside node).\n\nThus, the total unidirectional pairs would include all such edges.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Choose m, the size of the cycle, such that C(m, 2) = p. Because the cycle contributes C(m,2) bidirectional pairs.\n\n2. Then, the remaining n - m nodes form a DAG where each node cannot reach the cycle, and the cycle cannot reach them.\n\n3. In this setup, the number of bidirectional pairs is exactly p.\n\n4. Then, the number of unidirectional pairs is the sum of:\n\n   a. All possible edges from the cycle to the outside nodes (each is unidirectional, since the outside nodes cannot reach the cycle).\n\n   b. All possible edges within the outside nodes, provided they are unidirectional.\n\nWait, but within the outside nodes, since they form a DAG, any edge u→v where u < v would contribute to unidirectional pairs because in a DAG, if u can reach v, v cannot reach u.\n\nSo, the number of unidirectional pairs within the outside nodes is the number of edges in the DAG.\n\nAdditionally, any edges from the outside nodes to the cycle nodes contribute to unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to maximize the number of edges from the outside to the cycle, and the number of edges within the outside.\n\nBut the outside nodes form a DAG, and each edge in the DAG is unidirectional.\n\nSo, for the outside nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is achieved when the subgraph is a complete DAG, where for any u < v, u can reach v.\n\nBut wait, in a DAG, it's possible to have a topological order, and in that case, for each pair (u, v) with u < v in the topological order, u can reach v, and v cannot reach u. So the number of unidirectional pairs in the outside DAG is the number of edges in the topological order.\n\nWait, no. Because in the topological order, the edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes. So each edge u→v is part of the topological order, and for each such edge, u can reach v, but v cannot reach u, making it an unidirectional pair.\n\nThus, the number of unidirectional pairs in the outside DAG is the number of edges in the topological order, which is the maximum possible for the outside nodes.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, the outside DAG should be a complete DAG, where each node points to every node that comes after it in the topological order.\n\nThus, the number of edges in the outside DAG is the number of edges in a complete DAG, which is m*(m-1)/2, where m is the number of outside nodes.\n\nWait, no. For m nodes in a topological order, the number of edges is m*(m-1)/2.\n\nWait, yes. For example, 3 nodes in order 1→2→3 have edges 1→2, 1→3, 2→3. Total 3 edges.\n\nWhich is 3*(3-1)/2 =3.\n\nSo, the number of edges is indeed m*(m-1)/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nGiven p, find the minimal n such that C(n,2) ≥p.\n\nThen, within that n, choose m such that C(m,2) = p.\n\nWait, but p may not be a triangular number. For example, p=4 is not a triangular number since 3*2/2=3 <4, 4*3/2=6≥4.\n\nSo in that case, m can't be 4 because C(4,2)=6>4. So what can we do?\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to have a cycle of size m, such that C(m,2) = p.\n\nBut if p is not a triangular number, then this is not possible. So perhaps the approach is to have a cycle of size m, where C(m,2) ≤ p.\n\nWait, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to have a cycle",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graph**: A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v, u != v, there exists a path from u to v, and no path from v to u.\n\n2. **Minimal Number of Nodes**: The minimal number of nodes required to form a p-reachable graph is determined by finding the smallest integer n such that the number of possible unordered pairs (C(n, 2)) is at least p.
