The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where a frog starts at position 0 and can jump either +a or -b each time. For each x from 0 to m, I need to compute f(x), which is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach without going outside [0, x]. Then, sum all these f(x) values.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. The frog's movement depends on a and b. Since a and b are positive, the frog can only move forward or backward, but not in both directions equally because subtracting b might take it below zero, but the constraints say it can't jump outside [0, x]. Wait, no, the problem states that the frog must never jump outside [0, x], so any jump that would take it beyond x or below 0 is forbidden.\n\nSo for each x, I need to calculate how many reachable positions there are, considering that the frog can't go beyond x or below 0.\n\nBut doing this for every x up to m would be too slow, especially since m can be up to 1e9. So we need a mathematical approach to find a pattern or formula that allows us to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. The frog's movement is determined by steps of +a and -b. So the reachable positions form some kind of set based on linear combinations of a and b.\n\nWait, but since the frog can make any number of jumps (including zero), the reachable positions are all numbers that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and such that the position is within [0, x].\n\nBut that might not directly help because for each x, the allowed positions depend on x. So perhaps the key is to find the minimal x after which the set of reachable positions stops changing in a certain way.\n\nWait, what's the maximum x where adding more doesn't change f(x)? Because for larger x, the frog has more options, so f(x) increases until it reaches a certain point, then becomes stable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function f(x) increases until x reaches some critical value, after which it remains constant or changes in a predictable pattern.\n\nAnother thought: For a given x, the reachable positions are the numbers that can be written as (k*a - l*b), but also satisfy 0 ≤ pos ≤ x. So the problem reduces to counting the number of such valid positions.\n\nBut the challenge is to compute this for all x from 0 to m and sum them up.\n\nWait, but perhaps the structure of reachable positions can be determined by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, all reachable positions are multiples of d. So the minimal step is d.\n\nSo the reachable positions are all numbers congruent to 0 modulo d, and within [0, x].\n\nBut wait, no. Because a and b could be such that a is a multiple of d and b is a multiple of d. So when the frog makes steps, each step adds a multiple of d. So yes, all reachable positions are multiples of d.\n\nSo first, let's compute d = gcd(a, b). Then, the reachable positions are all numbers of the form k*d, where k is a non-negative integer, and the positions are within [0, x].\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because the frog can choose to add a or subtract b. So for example, if a=5, b=3, then the reachable positions are 0,5,10,... but also 3,6, etc., depending on the steps taken.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nStarting at 0:\n- Jump +a: 5.\n- From 5, can jump back to 0 (5-3=2?), wait no, 5-3=2? Or is it 5-3=2? So from 5, the frog can jump to 2, but that's within 0, so yes. Hmm, so 2 is reachable.\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption was wrong. The reachable positions aren't just multiples of d. Because 5 and 3 have a gcd of 1, so their linear combinations can reach any integer. But in the context of the frog's movement, because the frog can't go beyond x, the reachable positions may vary.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again: the frog can make any number of jumps, and each jump is either +a or -b. So the position after some steps is the sum of a's minus the sum of b's. So the position is k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and k + l is the total number of jumps.\n\nBut this can be rewritten as (k - l) * a' where a' is a/gcd(a,b) and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the function \\( f(x) \\) from 0 to \\( m \\), where \\( f(x) \\) represents the number of distinct positions a frog can reach starting from position 0 on a number line. The frog can jump either forward by \\( a \\) or backward by \\( b \\), but cannot jump outside the interval \\([0, x]\\).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog's movement is determined by the steps it can take, which are either +a or -b. The reachable positions form a set based on the linear combinations of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). The key insight is that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) determines the periodicity of the reachable positions.\n\n2. **GCD Insight**: Let \\( d = \\text{gcd}(a, b) \\). The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of \\( d \\). This periodicity helps in efficiently determining the reachable positions for any \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Stable Points**: For a given \\( x \\), the frog's reachable positions stabilize once \\( x \\) is large enough to accommodate all possible jumps. Beyond this point, the number of reachable positions increases linearly with \\( x \\).\n\n4. **Summing Function Values**: We compute the sum of \\( f(x) \\) from 0 to \\( m \\) by breaking it into two parts: before the stable point and after the stable point.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n    b = int(input[2])\n\n    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    # Compute the minimal steps to reach the stable state\n    max_pos = 0\n    while True:\n        pos = a\n        step = (a // d) + (b // d)\n        if pos >= step * d:\n            break\n        max_pos = pos\n        pos += a\n        if pos > m:\n            break\n\n    # After the stable point, each increment adds (a + b)/d positions\n    k = (a + b) // d\n    total = 0\n\n    # Before stable point\n    for x in range(0, max_pos + 1):\n        if x < 0:\n            continue\n        count = 0\n        current = 0\n        visited = set()\n        while True:\n            if current not in visited:\n                visited.add(current)\n                if current > x:\n                    break\n                if current + a <= x:\n                    count += 1\n                if current - b >= 0 and current - b not in visited:\n                    count += 1\n                next_pos = current + a\n                if next_pos > x:\n                    break\n                current = next_pos\n                if current - b >= 0 and (current - b) not in visited:\n                    count += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        total += count\n\n    # After stable point, each x contributes x//d + 1 if x >= some value\n    # Find the first x where f(x) = (x//d + 1)\n    # Wait, no.
