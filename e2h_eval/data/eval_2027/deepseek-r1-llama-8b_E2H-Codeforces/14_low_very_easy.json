He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number m, I have to find how many positive integers n exist such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output all those n's in order.\n\nHmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros.\n\nSo the formula for the number of trailing zeros Z(n) is:\nZ(n) = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nThe task is, given m, find all n where Z(n) = m. Then count how many such n's and list them.\n\nFirst, I think I need a way to compute Z(n) quickly. But for this problem, perhaps binary search can be used to find the range of n's that give exactly m zeros.\n\nWait, right. Because as n increases, Z(n) also increases. So for a given m, the values of n that satisfy Z(n)=m form a consecutive range. So the approach is to find the smallest n where Z(n) >= m, and then see if it equals m. Then find the largest n where Z(n) <= m, but wait, no—because Z(n) is non-decreasing. So for m, we can find the first n where Z(n) = m and then find the last n where Z(n) is still m.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using binary search to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For a given m, find the smallest n where Z(n) == m.\n2. Then find the largest n where Z(n) == m.\n3. The count k will be (upper - lower + 1), unless m is not present, which would mean k=0.\n\nBut wait, how do I find the lower and upper bounds?\n\nI think I can perform two binary searches:\n- Find the smallest n_low where Z(n_low) >= m. Then check if Z(n_low) == m. If not, there's no solution.\n- Similarly, find the largest n_high where Z(n_high) <= m. Wait, no—since Z(n_high) could be m or higher. Hmm, perhaps another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, since Z(n) is strictly increasing, once I find the first occurrence where Z(n) = m, I can keep incrementing n until Z(n) > m, then the last occurrence is one before that.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- Use binary search to find the minimal n where Z(n) >= m. Let's call this low.\n- Check if Z(low) == m. If not, return 0.\n- Otherwise, find the next n where Z(n) > m. Subtract one to get high. The numbers from low to high (inclusive) are all the n's with Z(n) = m.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Implement a function count_trailing_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\n2. Binary search for the minimal n where count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this left.\n\n3. Check if count_trailing_zeros(left) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n4. Else, find the maximum n where count_trailing_zeros(n) <= m. Wait, no. Because after left, Z increases each time. So the next step is to find the smallest n where Z(n) > m, then the previous n (n-1) is the max n where Z(n) = m.\n\nAlternatively, binary search for the upper bound where Z(n) > m, then subtract 1.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input m=5.\n\nLooking at the sample:\n\nn | Z(n)\n5 → 1\n6 → 1\n7 → 1\n8 → 1\n9 → 1\n10 → 2\n\nWait, no, wait: let's calculate Z(n) for n=5: 5//5=1, others 0 → sum 1.\n\nn=6: same, sum 1.\n\nn=7: same.\n\nn=8: same.\n\nn=9: same.\n\nn=10: 10//5=2, 10//25=0 → sum 2.\n\nSo for m=5, the correct output is 5,6,7,8,9. So 5 numbers.\n\nIn this case, the minimal n where Z(n)>=5 is 10, but wait Z(10)=2 <5? No, wait wait. Wait in the sample input, the output was for m=1 and m=5. Oh wait, the sample input is ['1', '5'], so for m=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) such that the factorial of \\( n \\) ends with exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeroes. The solution involves using binary search to efficiently find the range of \\( n \\) values that satisfy this condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**: The number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) (factorial of \\( n \\)) is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the product sequence from 1 to \\( n \\). Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are usually more multiples of 2 than 5, the count of trailing zeros is effectively determined by the count of multiples of 5 in the numbers from 1 to \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: The function to count trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   Z(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   \\]\n   This sum continues until the division results in zero.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the range of \\( n \\) values where \\( Z(n) = m \\):\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) (let's call it `low`) where \\( Z(n) \\geq m \\).\n   - Check if \\( Z(low) == m \\). If not, there are no such \\( n \\), so output 0.\n   - If \\( Z(low) == m \\), find the largest \\( n \\) (let's call it `high`) where \\( Z(n) <= m \\). This can be done by finding the smallest \\( n \\) where \\( Z(n) > m \\) and subtracting 1 from it.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_low(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial high estimate\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef find_high(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Initial high estimate\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid\n    return low\n\nm = int(input().strip())\nif m == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    low = find_low(m)\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        high = find_high(m)\n        k = high - low + 1\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(low, high + 1))))\n        else:\n            print()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in \\( n! \\) by summing the integer divisions of \\( n \\) by powers of 5 until the result is zero.\n\n2. **find_low Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros is at least \\( m \\).\n\n3. **find_high Function**: This function also uses binary search but finds the smallest \\( n \\) where the number of trailing zeros exceeds \\( m \\). Subtracting 1 from this value gives the largest \\( n \\) where the trailing zeros are exactly \\( m \\).\n\n4. **Main Logic**: After determining the bounds, the code checks if the smallest \\( n \\) actually has exactly \\( m \\) trailing zeros. If so, it calculates the count and prints the range of valid \\( n \\) values. If not, it outputs 0.",
