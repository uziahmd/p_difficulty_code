In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Tokitsukaze playing a game derived from Mahjong. She has three tiles in her hand, each with a suit (m, p, s) and a number (1-9). The goal is to find the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu, which is either a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n\nHmm, right. So the task is to determine, for each possible scenario, what's the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, \"1s 2s 3s\" is a shuntsu already, so the output for that would be zero. Similarly, if all three are the same like \"9m 9m 9m\", then it's a koutsu, so output is zero.\n\nFor the third example given, the input is ['3p 9m 2p'], so the tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p. Wait, wait, no, the sample input in the note is different. Oh wait, no, in the note, the third example is ['3p 9m 2p'] as one of the inputs. Or maybe the example given in the note is different. Wait, the note says:\n\nIn the third example, she has 3p, 9m, 2p. So after adding one tile, say 1p or 4p, she can form a sequence.\n\nSo the output is 0, 0, 1? Wait, no, the sample output shows ['0', '0', '1'], but that's probably for each case. Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to process each of three possible scenarios, each considering whether the initial tiles can form a mentsu, and compute the minimal draws needed for each. Or perhaps the output is a single integer, but looking at the sample, it seems the output is three numbers, each corresponding to the three cases of the initial tiles.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" Then the input is three strings, and the output is a single integer—the minimal number of tiles she needs to draw. Or wait, maybe the output is three integers, each being the minimal for each of the three possible scenarios. Wait, no, perhaps the output is three lines, each being the minimal for each of the three possibilities. No, the sample shows an output of three numbers, each in their own quotes, implying that perhaps the output is three separate values.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nAh, so for each of the three initial hands, we need to compute the minimal number of tiles to draw to form a mentsu.\n\nSo the function needs to process each of the three given hands, compute for each the minimal number, and output them in order.\n\nSo the plan is: for each of the three initial hands, compute the minimal number of tiles to add to form at least one mentsu.\n\nEach hand is a list of three tiles.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each initial hand (each of the three), generate all possible ways to complete it to have at least one mentsu, considering adding 0, 1, 2, etc., tiles.\n\n2. Find the minimal number of tiles needed across all possibilities.\n\nBut considering that the number of possibilities could be large, we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nEach tile is a combination of suit and number. So for each hand, we can represent it as a dictionary, counting the occurrences of each tile.\n\nFor example, a hand like [\"1m\", \"2m\", \"3m\"] has counts: 1m:1, 2m:1, 3m:1.\n\nAnother example: [\"9m\", \"9m\", \"9m\"] has counts: 9m:3.\n\nWe need to find whether adding some tiles can result in a mentsu.\n\nA mentsu can be a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu).\n\nSo for each hand, we can check all possible ways of adding tiles to reach a state where at least one mentsu exists.\n\nWhat's the approach here?\n\nIdea:\n\nFor each hand, we can simulate adding 0, 1, 2, ... tiles up to some maximum (like 4, since beyond that, it's unlikely to find a minimal solution) and see if any of these additions result in a mentsu.\n\nBut even better, perhaps we can precompute all possible required tiles to form any possible mentsu, and see if the current hand can cover them, then calculate how many tiles need to be added.\n\nSo for each possible mentsu (all possible triplets and sequences), we check if the hand can form that mentsu by adding some tiles.\n\nThen, for each such mentsu, calculate how many tiles are missing, and keep track of the minimal number required.\n\nThe minimal number over all possible mentsu is the answer.\n\nBut considering that the number of possible mentsu is manageable.\n\nSo let's calculate all possible mentsu possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider all possible triplets.\n\nEach triplet is three copies of the same tile. So for each tile (like 1m, 2p, etc.), there's exactly one triplet mentsu.\n\nSo the number of triplet mentsus is 9*3=27 (since suits are m, p, s and numbers 1-9).\n\nThen, the shuntsu mentsus: for each suit, there are 7 possible sequences (since 1-9 allows for 7 sequences: 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9). So 3 suits *7 =21 shuntsus.\n\nSo total mentsus are 27 +21=48.\n\nSo for each hand, we need to check against these 48 possibilities.\n\nFor each mentsu, determine the minimal number of tiles that need to be added to the current hand to form it.\n\nThen, take the minimal across all mentsus.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo the steps for each hand are:\n\n1. Create a frequency dictionary for the current tiles.\n\n2. For each possible mentsu (triplet and sequence):\n\n   a. Check if the current hand can form this mentsu by adding some tiles.\n\n   b. Calculate how many tiles are needed.\n\n3. Keep track of the minimal number of tiles needed across all mentsus.\n\nNow, for each mentsu, how do we calculate the minimal tiles needed?\n\nCase 1: Triplet.\n\nSuppose the mentsu is three 2m.\n\nCurrent hand may have 0, 1, 2, or 3 2m tiles.\n\nIf current count is >=3: no need to add anything.\n\nElse:\n\nneeded = 3 - current_count.\n\nBut wait, because other tiles can be added, but perhaps the same triplet is already present.\n\nWait, for a triplet, the minimal tiles needed is max(0, 3 - current_count).\n\nBut also, when considering that adding other tiles could allow forming another mentsu, perhaps a better option is available.\n\nBut since we're checking all possible mentsus, including the triplet, we can just compute for each triplet mentsu what's the needed tiles.\n\nSimilarly for sequences.\n\nCase 2: Sequence.\n\nA sequence is three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nE.g., 1m,2m,3m.\n\nThe current hand may have some of these.\n\nWe need to see if, after adding some tiles, the hand includes all three of the sequence.\n\nBut the order doesn't matter, and duplicates are allowed.\n\nWait, but the problem says that a shuntsu is three sequential numbers in the same suit, regardless of order.\n\nSo for a shuntsu, the hand must contain at least one of each of the three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nSo for example, if the hand has two 2m and one 3m, then adding a 1m would form a shuntsu 1m-2m-3m.\n\nSo to form a shuntsu, the hand must have at least one of each number in the sequence.\n\nSo for a given sequence (like 5m,6m,7m), the current hand must have at least one of each of 5m,6m,7m, possibly more.\n\nBut in terms of counts, the hand can have multiple copies, but as long as each required tile is present at least once, it's okay.\n\nSo for each sequence, the required tiles are the three distinct tiles.\n\nSo for each shuntsu, we need to ensure that for each of the three numbers in the sequence, the current hand has at least one copy.\n\nBut wait, no. Because the hand can have more than one copy of a tile. So, for example, if the hand has two 2m and one 3m, and the sequence is 2m,3m,4m, then it's missing 4m, so adding one 4m would complete the sequence.\n\nSo for a sequence, the required condition is that all three numbers are present in the current hand (after adding any tiles). Wait, no: after adding tiles, the hand must include all three of the sequence.\n\nSo, for each sequence, the current hand may have some of the required tiles. For each tile in the sequence, if it's not present in the current hand, it needs to be added.\n\nBut wait, the current hand may have multiple copies, but for the sequence, you only need at least one.\n\nSo for the sequence, the number of tiles needed is the count of the three tiles in the sequence that are not present in the current hand.\n\nBecause for each tile in the sequence, if the current hand lacks it, it must be added.\n\nSo for example, for sequence 1m,2m,3m:\n\nIf current hand has 1m and 3m, but no 2m: then adding 2m is needed. So 1 tile.\n\nIf current hand has 1m,2m,3m: 0.\n\nIf current hand has 1m,1m,3m: then 2m is needed, so 1 tile.\n\nIf current hand has 1m,2m,2m,3m: 0.\n\nSo for each shuntsu, the required tiles are the sum of 1 for each tile in the sequence that is not present in the current hand.\n\nSo, for each shuntsu, the minimal number of tiles needed is the number of tiles in the sequence that are not present in the current hand.\n\nWait, but what if the current hand has all three tiles of the sequence? Then zero.\n\nBut suppose the current hand has two of a particular tile, but none of another. Then one is needed.\n\nSo yes, for each shuntsu, the minimal tiles needed is the count of tiles in the sequence that are not present in the current hand.\n\nSo putting this together:\n\nFor each mentsu (both triplets and sequences):\n\n- If it's a triplet, calculate how many copies are needed (3 minus current count).\n\n- If it's a shuntsu, calculate how many of its three tiles are missing in the current hand.\n\nSo for each mentsu, compute the required tiles, and find the minimal across all mentsus.\n\nOnce we have this minimal for each initial hand, we can output the three results.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\n1. For each of the three initial hands, process them as follows:\n\n   a. Create a set of the tiles in the hand. This will help quickly check if a tile is present.\n\n   b. For each possible mentsu (48 total):\n\n      i. If it's a triplet, calculate the number of tiles needed as max(0, 3 - count in the hand).\n\n      ii. If it's a shuntsu, count how many of the three tiles in the sequence are missing from the hand. That's the needed tiles.\n\n   c. Keep track of the minimal needed across all mentsus.\n\n2. After processing all mentsus for a hand, output the minimal needed.\n\nNow, the question is how to efficiently generate all possible mentsus.\n\nLet's think about generating all possible mentsus.\n\nTriplets:\n\nEach triplet is a tile repeated three times. So for each suit and number, create a triplet.\n\nSo for each number from 1 to 9, and each suit m, p, s, create a triplet.\n\nThat's 9 *3=27 mentsus.\n\nShuntsus:\n\nFor each suit, generate sequences of three consecutive numbers.\n\nThe first sequence is 1,2,3; the last is 7,8,9. So for each suit, 7 sequences.\n\nSo 3 suits *7=21 mentsus.\n\nSo total 48.\n\nSo, how to represent these mentsus?\n\nFor each mentsu, represent it as a list of three tiles.\n\nWait, for a triplet, it's three copies of the same tile. For a shuntsu, it's three distinct tiles.\n\nSo for each mentsu, we can have a list of the three tiles that form it.\n\nFor example, triplet 1m is [1m,1m,1m].\n\nSequence 1m,2m,3m is [1m,2m,3m].\n\nSo, for each mentsu, generate this list.\n\nOnce we have this list, for each hand, we can check how many tiles are needed to form this mentsu.\n\nSo for each mentsu:\n\n- For each tile in the mentsu, check if the hand contains at least one copy.\n\nWait, no. For a triplet, the hand needs three copies.\n\nFor a shuntsu, the hand needs at least one copy of each of the three tiles.\n\nSo for a triplet, the needed tiles is 3 minus the count in the hand.\n\nFor a shuntsu, the needed tiles is the count of the three tiles in the mentsu that are not present in the hand.\n\nWait, no. For a shuntsu, the hand needs to have at least one of each of the three tiles. So, for each tile in the shuntsu, if the hand doesn't have it, then one tile is needed.\n\nSo for the shuntsu, the number of tiles needed is the sum over the three tiles in the sequence of (1 if not present else 0).\n\nSo, for each mentsu, we can compute the required tiles as:\n\nif it's a triplet:\n\nrequired = 3 - current count of that tile.\n\nelse:\n\nrequired = number of tiles in the sequence that are not present in the hand.\n\nSo, for each hand, for each mentsu, compute this required.\n\nThen, find the minimal required across all mentsus.\n\nNow, the implementation steps:\n\nFirst, read the three initial hands.\n\nThen, for each hand:\n\n- Convert it into a set of tiles for quick lookups.\n\nWait, but the hand may have duplicates. So for example, if the hand is ['1m','1m','1m'], the set is {'1m'}, but for a triplet, the count is 3.\n\nSo perhaps for each hand, we should create a frequency dictionary, which maps each tile to its count.\n\nYes. So for the initial hand, we can create a frequency dict, where key is the tile, value is the count.\n\nThen, for each mentsu:\n\nif it's a triplet:\n\ntile = mentsu[0]\n\ncount_in_hand = frequency.get(tile, 0)\n\nrequired = max(0, 3 - count_in_hand)\n\nelse:\n\nfor each tile in mentsu:\n\nif tile not in frequency: count +=1\n\nso required = count\n\nSo the code can proceed as:\n\nGenerate all mentsus as a list, each represented as a list of three tiles.\n\nFor each hand:\n\ncreate frequency = {tile: count for each tile in the hand}\n\nmin_draws = infinity\n\nfor each mentsu in all_mentsus:\n\n    if mentsu is triplet:\n\n        tile = mentsu[0]\n\n        current = frequency.get(tile, 0)\n\n        needed = max(0, 3 - current)\n\n    else:\n\n        needed = 0\n\n        for t in mentsu:\n\n            if t not in frequency:\n\n                needed +=1\n\n    if needed < min_draws:\n\n        min_draws = needed\n\nSo, after processing all mentsus, min_draws is the answer for this hand.\n\nSo, the code structure is clear.\n\nNow, implementing this:\n\nFirst, generate all mentsus.\n\nHow to generate the triplet mentsus:\n\nLoop through each number from 1 to 9, and each suit m, p, s.\n\nFor each, create a triplet mentsu: [tile, tile, tile], where tile is str(num) + suit.\n\nFor shuntsus:\n\nFor each suit in ['m','p','s']:\n\n    for start_num in 1..7:\n\n        create a sequence of num, num+1, num+2\n\n        each as tile: str(num) + suit.\n\n        create mentsu as [tile1, tile2, tile3]\n\nSo that's 3*7=21 shuntsus.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe can represent the mentsus as a list of lists.\n\nAll_mentsus = []\n\n# Generate triplets\n\nfor num in range(1,10):\n\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n        tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n\n        mentsu = [tile]*3\n\n        All_mentsus.append(mentsu)\n\n# Generate shuntsus\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for start in range(1,8):\n\n        tiles = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n\n        All_mentsus.append(tiles)\n\nSo this gives us 27 +21=48 mentsus.\n\nNow, for each hand:\n\nRead the three strings.\n\nFor each string, split into individual tiles.\n\nWait, each hand is a list of three tiles.\n\nSo for the first hand, it's ['1s', '2s', '3s'], which is a shuntsu.\n\nSo for each hand, process as follows:\n\ntiles_in_hand = list of three strings.\n\nfrequency = {}\n\nfor tile in tiles_in_hand:\n\n    if tile in frequency:\n\n        frequency[tile] +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        frequency[tile] =1\n\nThen, for each mentsu in All_mentsus:\n\ncompute needed.\n\nKeep track of the minimal needed.\n\nNow, the code can loop through each hand, compute the minimal, and output the three minimal numbers.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSo three hands.\n\nFirst hand: ['1s','2s','3s']\n\nfrequency: {'1s':1, '2s':1, '3s':1}\n\nCheck each mentsu.\n\nFor triplet 1s: current count is 1. Needed 2.\n\nBut for the triplet 1s, needed is 2, but perhaps another mentsu requires less.\n\nBut in this case, the first hand already has a shuntsu 1s,2s,3s, so the required is zero.\n\nThus, min_draws is zero.\n\nSecond hand: ['9m','9m','9m'].\n\nfrequency: {'9m':3}.\n\nCheck triplet 9m: needed is 0.\n\nThus, min_draws is zero.\n\nThird hand: ['3p','9m','2p'].\n\nfrequency: {'3p':1, '9m':1, '2p':1}.\n\nNow, let's see which mentsus can be formed with minimal draws.\n\nLooking for shuntsus:\n\nPossible options include:\n\nLooking for 2p,3p,4p: current hand has 2p and 3p, missing 4p: needed 1.\n\nOr 3p,4p,5p: current has 3p, missing 4p and 5p: needed 2.\n\nOther options: 9m, but that's part of a triplet, but current has 9m once.\n\nSo for the triplet 9m: needed 2.\n\nBut the minimal is 1, achieved by adding 4p or 1p.\n\nWait, wait, in the third hand, the user can add 4p or 1p.\n\nWait, the third hand is 3p,9m,2p.\n\nAdding 1p: then the tiles are 3p,9m,2p,1p.\n\nDoes this form a shuntsu? Yes, 1p,2p,3p.\n\nSo needed 1.\n\nAlternatively, adding 4p: tiles become 3p,9m,2p,4p: which forms 2p,3p,4p.\n\nThus, for this hand, the minimal is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code correctly finds this.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All three tiles are the same.\n\nHand is [x,x,x], so triplet is already formed. So needed 0.\n\nEdge Case 2: Hand has two tiles of a triplet, and one tile elsewhere.\n\nE.g., [1m,1m,2p]. To form triplet 1m: need 1 more.\n\nEdge Case 3: Hand has two tiles of a triplet, but they are part of a shuntsu.\n\nE.g., [2m,3m,4m]: this is a shuntsu, needed 0.\n\nBut also, the triplet 2m needs 1 more.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nEdge Case 4: Hand has no tiles of a particular triplet or shuntsu.\n\nE.g., [5m,6m,7m]: this is a shuntsu. So needed 0.\n\nAnother example: [1m, 3m, 5m]. No shuntsu. So what's the minimal?\n\nWe need to find a triplet or a shuntsu.\n\nFor triplet, any triplet requires 3 tiles. So for 1m: current count is 1, needed 2.\n\nFor 3m: current count is 1, needed 2.\n\nFor 5m: current count is 1, needed 2.\n\nFor shuntsu, check sequences.\n\nCheck 1m,2m,3m: current has 1m and 3m. Need 2m: add one.\n\nThus, the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the code should return 1.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, time to write the code.\n\nFirst, read the input.\n\nThe input is three strings, each representing a hand.\n\nEach string is like '1s 2s 3s'.\n\nSo, read the input line, split into three parts.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nhands = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n\nThen, for each hand in hands:\n\nprocess.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nall_mentsus = []\n\nfor num in 1-9:\n\n   for suit in m,p,s:\n\n       add triplet [tile]*3\n\nfor suit in m,p,s:\n\n   for start in 1-7:\n\n       add [tile1, tile2, tile3]\n\nThen, for each hand in hands:\n\n   create freq dict.\n\n   min_needed = something big.\n\n   for each mentsu in all_mentsus:\n\n       if triplet:\n\n           count = freq.get(t,0)\n\n           needed = max(0, 3 - count)\n\n       else:\n\n           count = 0\n\n           for t in mentsu:\n\n               if t not in freq:\n\n                   count +=1\n\n       if needed < min_needed:\n\n           min_needed = needed\n\n   print(min_needed)\n\nSo, coding this.\n\nNow, test the sample.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nProcessing first hand:\n\nfreq is {'1s':1, '2s':1, '3s':1}.\n\nFor each mentsu:\n\nTriplet 1s: needed 2.\n\nBut for shuntsu 1s,2s,3s: needed 0.\n\nThus, min is 0.\n\nSecond hand: all 9m. So triplet needed 0.\n\nThird hand:\n\nfreq is {'3p':1, '9m':1, '2p':1}.\n\nFor shuntsu 2p,3p,4p: needed 1.\n\nFor triplet 3p: current 1, needed 2.\n\nSo minimal is 1.\n\nThus, outputs are 0,0,1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: hand is ['1m', '3m', '5m'].\n\nMentsu possibilities:\n\nTriplet 1m: needed 2.\n\nTriplet 3m: needed 2.\n\nTriplet 5m: needed 2.\n\nShuntsus:\n\nCheck 1m,2m,3m: current has 1m,3m. Need 2m: 1 tile.\n\nAlso, 3m,4m,5m: current has 3m,5m.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw so that she can form at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Tokitsukaze has three tiles in her hand, each represented by a suit (m, p, s) and a number (1-9). A mentsu can be a triplet (three identical tiles) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit). We need to find the minimum number of additional tiles required to form a mentsu.\n\n2. **Generate All Possible Mentsus**: There are 48 possible mentsus in total:\n   - **Triplets**: Each suit (m, p, s) can form 9 triplets (one for each number from 1 to 9).\n   - **Sequences**: For each suit, there are 7 sequences (from 1-2-3 up to 7-8-9).\n\n3. **Check Each Hand**: For each of the three initial hands, we check all possible mentsus to determine the minimum number of tiles needed to form any of them.\n\n4. **Frequency Dictionary**: Convert each hand into a frequency dictionary to keep track of the count of each tile.\n\n5. **Calculate Required Tiles**: For each mentsu, calculate the number of tiles needed to complete it based on the current hand's frequency dictionary.\n\n6. **Determine Minimum Tiles**: Track the minimum number of tiles needed across all mentsus for each hand.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    hands = sys.stdin.readline().split()\n    \n    # Generate all possible mentsus\n    all_mentsus = []\n    \n    # Add triplets\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n        for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n            tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n            all_mentsus.append([tile, tile, tile])\n    \n    # Add shuntsus\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n            tiles = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n            all_mentsus.append(tiles)\n    \n    # Process each hand\n    results = []\n    for hand_str in hands:\n        # Create frequency dictionary\n        freq = {}\n        for tile in hand_str.split():\n            if tile in freq:\n                freq[tile] += 1\n            else:\n                freq[tile] = 1\n        \n        min_draws = float('inf')\n        for mentsu in all_mentsus:\n            if len(mentsu) != 3:\n                continue  # This should not happen as per generation\n            \n            if mentsu[0] == mentsu[1] == mentsu[2]:\n                # Triplet case\n                tile = mentsu[0]\n                current = freq.get(tile, 0)\n                needed = max(0, 3 - current)\n            else:\n                # Shuntsu case\n                needed = 0\n                for t in mentsu:\n                    if t not in freq:\n                        needed += 1\n            \n            if needed < min_draws:\n                min_draws = needed\n        \n        results.append(str(min_draws))\n    \n    # Output the results\n    print(' '.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three strings, each representing a hand of three tiles.\n2. **Generating Mentsus**: We generate all possible mentsus (48 in total) which include both triplets and sequences.\n3. **Frequency Dictionary**: For each hand, we create a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each tile.\n4. **Checking Each Mentsu**: For each mentsu, we determine how many more tiles are needed to complete it. For triplets, this is the number of tiles missing to make three copies. For sequences, this is the number of tiles missing to have at least one of each required tile.\n5. **Finding Minimum Draws**: We track the minimum number of tiles needed across all mentsus for each hand and output these values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible ways to form a mentsu and find the minimum number of draws required.",
