    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an array of integers, and we need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, my goal is to remove one element such that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible element to remove, I need to compute the instability of the remaining array and then find the minimum among all those possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 1e5, which is 10^5. If I try to iterate over each element, compute the max and min each time, that would be O(n^2) time, which is definitely too slow. So I need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet me think: what's the effect of removing an element on the max and min of the array? Well, the new max is either the original max (if the removed element wasn't the max) or the second max. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo maybe if I precompute some information about the array, like the sorted version and track the max and min when each element is excluded.\n\nWait, but even that might not be straightforward. Another idea is to sort the array first. Once sorted, for each position i, the current max is a[n-1], and the min is a[0]. But if I remove an element at position i, perhaps the new max could be a[i+1], but only if a[i] was the previous max.\n\nWait no, because if the array is sorted, the max is the last element. So if I remove any element, the new max is still the same unless that element was the max. Wait, no—if I remove the last element, the new max is a[-2].\n\nSimilarly for the min. So here's the thing: when you remove an element, the new min could be a[0] (if the removed element wasn't the min), or a[1] if it was the min.\n\nWait, but in a sorted array, the min is always the first element. So if I remove the first element, the new min becomes the second element. For other elements, the min remains the same.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n2. Compute the initial instability as max(a) - min(a).\n3. Then, consider two cases:\n   a. Remove the first element. The new min is a[1], and the new max is a[-1]. So the new instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n   b. Remove the last element. The new max is a[-2], and the min is a[0]. So the new instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n4. Additionally, for each element in between (i.e., from 1 to n-2), if we remove a[i], the new max could be a[-1] (unless a[i] was the max, which it isn't because the array is sorted). Similarly, the new min is a[0] unless a[i] was the min, but in the sorted array, a[0] is the min. So if I remove a non-min element, the min remains a[0], and the max remains a[-1], unless the removed element was the max. Wait, but in a sorted array, the max is a[-1], so if I remove that, then the new max is a[-2]. Otherwise, the max stays a[-1].\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the possible candidates for the minimal instability. Since when you remove an element, the max and min can change only in specific ways.\n\nSo the minimal instability will be either:\n\n- After removing the first element: new_min is a[1], new_max is a[-1]. Instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n- After removing the last element: new_max is a[-2], new_min is a[0]. Instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n- Or, perhaps when removing a middle element, if that element was the max or the min. Wait, but in a sorted array, the first element is the min, last is the max. So when you remove an element that's not the first or last, the min remains a[0], the max remains a[-1], unless you remove the last element, which changes the max.\n\nWait, wait. Let's clarify.\n\nIn the sorted array, the min is a[0], and the max is a[-1]. When you remove any element except a[0], the min remains a[0]. When you remove any element except a[-1], the max remains a[-1].\n\nSo when you remove an element, the new instability depends on whether the removed element was the current max or min.\n\nThus, the possible instabilities to consider are:\n\n1. Removing the first element: new instability is (a[-1] - a[1]).\n2. Removing the last element: new instability is (a[-2] - a[0]).\n3. Also, for any element that is equal to the current max, if there are multiple max elements, perhaps removing one of them doesn't change the max. So in this case, removing a max element (but not the last element) won't change the max, so the new instability is a[-1] - a[0], same as the original.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Suppose the array has multiple elements with the same max value. For example, [1,3,3,7]. The max is 7. If I remove one of the 3s, the max is still 7. So the instability remains 7-1=6. But if I remove 7, the new max is 3, so the instability is 3-1=2, which is lower.\n\nSo, in such cases, removing a non-last max element may not help reduce the instability as much as removing the last element.\n\nSo, how do I handle this?\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal instability can be found by considering:\n\n- The current instability is max - min.\n- The minimal possible instability is the minimum between:\n   a. The current instability minus some delta, but I'm not sure.\n   Or perhaps, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n      (current max - min after removing first)\n      (current max - min after removing last)\n      (current max - min after removing any other element, but that's either same as current or worse).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because when you remove an element that is not the first or last, the min remains the same, but the max remains the same unless it's the last element.\n\nWait, no. The max remains the same unless you remove the last element. So if the array is sorted, and you remove any element except the last, the max remains a[-1]. So the new instability is a[-1] - a[0], same as before.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because suppose you have [1,2,4,5,6]. If you remove 4, the new array is [1,2,5,6]. The max is 6, min is 1. So the instability is 5, same as before. So in this case, removing an element in the middle doesn't change the max or min.\n\nSo, in general, the only way to possibly reduce the instability is to remove either the first element (to possibly lower the min) or the last element (to possibly lower the max). Because any other removal leaves the max and min unchanged.\n\nWait, but what if the array has multiple elements equal to the max? For example, [1,3,3,7]. If I remove one of the 3s, the max is still 7, min is 1. So instability is 6, same as before. Only if I remove 7, the max becomes 3, so instability is 2, which is better.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal instability is achieved by removing the last element.\n\nSo, putting this together, the minimal instability can be found by considering:\n\n- The original instability is max - min.\n- The option of removing the first element: new instability is (max - new_min) = a[-1] - a[1].\n- The option of removing the last element: new instability is (new_max - min) = a[-2] - a[0].\n- Additionally, if the array has multiple max elements, perhaps removing one of them (not the last) doesn't help. Because the max remains the same, so the instability is same as original. So the only way to improve is by removing the last element.\n\nWait, but if the array has multiple max elements, the last element is the max. So if I remove the last element, the new max is a[-2], which may be less than the original max. So that's where the improvement comes in.\n\nSo, to find the minimal instability, I should compute all possible candidates:\n\n1. The current instability (without removing any element) is max - min, but since we have to remove exactly one element, we can't choose this option. Wait, no: the problem says we must remove exactly one element. So our options are to compute the instability after removing each element and find the minimum.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis shows that removing elements in the middle doesn't change the max or min, so the instability remains the same as the original. So the minimal instability would be the minimum between:\n\n- The instability when removing the first element: a[-1] - a[1]\n- The instability when removing the last element: a[-2] - a[0]\n- And perhaps, any other scenario where removing a certain element reduces the max or increases the min, but in reality, in the sorted array, that's not possible unless you remove the first or last.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nIn the sorted array, the min is a[0], max is a[-1].\n\nIf I remove an element that's not the first or last, the min remains a[0], the max remains a[-1]. So the instability remains a[-1] - a[0].\n\nWhich is same as the original. So, the only way to get a better instability is to remove the first or the last element.\n\nBecause when you remove the first element, the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1]. So instability is a[-1] - a[1], which could be less than the original.\n\nWhen you remove the last element, the new max is a[-2], and the min is a[0]. So instability is a[-2] - a[0], which could be less than the original.\n\nSo, to find the minimal possible instability, I just need to compute these two options and pick the smallest between them and the original instability (but wait, no, because when I remove an element, the instability is either a[-1]-a[1], a[-2]-a[0], or same as original. So the minimal is the minimum of these three possibilities.\n\nWait no, because in the sorted array, when you remove an element that's not first or last, the instability is a[-1] - a[0], same as the original. So the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]), and (a[-1] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but the original instability is (a[-1] - a[0]). So if I remove a middle element, the instability is same as original.\n\nSo, the candidates for the minimal instability are:\n\n- a[-1] - a[0] (original)\n- a[-1] - a[1] (after removing first)\n- a[-2] - a[0] (after removing last)\n\nWait, but wait: in the original array, when you have to remove exactly one element, the minimal instability is the minimum of all possible (n) options. But in practice, only the first and last options can lead to better instability.\n\nSo, for example, if the original array is [1, 3, 3, 7], the original instability is 6. Removing the first element gives us [3,3,7], instability is 4. Removing the last element gives us [1,3,3], instability is 2. So the minimal is 2.\n\nIn another example, [1, 100000], removing either element gives 0, which is better than the original 99999.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n2. Compute the original instability: max - min.\n3. Compute the candidate instabilities:\n   a. remove first: a[-1] - a[1]\n   b. remove last: a[-2] - a[0]\n4. Find the minimum among these candidates.\n\nBecause for any other element, removing it would leave the instability as the original.\n\nSo, the minimal possible instability is the minimum between a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], and the original.\n\nWait, but wait: is a[-1] - a[1] necessarily better than the original? Not always. For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4], removing the first gives instability 3 (4-1), which is same as original. Removing the last gives 3 (3-1), which is better. So the minimal is 3.\n\nWait, no: in the original array, instability is 3. After removing first, it's 3. After removing last, it's 3. So minimal is 3.\n\nAnother example: [1,3,4,5]. Original is 4. Removing first gives 4 (5-1=4). Removing last gives 4 (4-1=3). So the minimal is 3.\n\nSo yes, in this case, the minimal is better than the original.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute:\n\ncandidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\ncandidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nmin_instability = min(candidate1, candidate2, original)\n\nWait, but wait: the original is a[-1]-a[0], which is the same as the instability without removing any element. But since we have to remove exactly one element, the minimal could be either candidate1, candidate2, or something else.\n\nWait, no: because when you remove any other element, the instability is a[-1] - a[0], same as the original. So, the minimal instability is the minimum of the original, candidate1, and candidate2.\n\nWait, but the original is the same as the case when you remove any middle element. So, the minimal instability can't be higher than the original. So, the minimal is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and the original.\n\nWait, no. Because when you remove a middle element, the instability is same as original. So, the minimal could be the same as original.\n\nFor example, in [1,2,3,4], removing any middle element doesn't change the instability. So the minimal is same as original.\n\nBut when you have [1,3,4,5], removing last gives 4-1=3, which is better than original 4.\n\nSo, the minimal is the minimum between candidate1, candidate2, and the original.\n\nWait, but candidate1 is a[-1] - a[1], which is 5-3=2 in [1,3,4,5]? Wait, no: a[-1] is 5, a[1] is 3. So 5-3=2. Candidate2 is a[-2] - a[0] =4-1=3. So the minimal is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in code, after sorting, calculate the three values:\n\n1. original: a[-1] - a[0]\n2. candidate1: a[-1] - a[1]\n3. candidate2: a[-2] - a[0]\n\nThen, the minimal instability is the minimum of these three.\n\nWait, but why are we including the original in the min? Because if the original is already the best, then it's better than removing any element. But according to the problem statement, we have to remove exactly one element, so the minimal is the minimal of the three.\n\nWait, no: because in some cases, the original is worse than both candidate1 and candidate2. For example, in the first example given in the problem statement:\n\nInput is [1,3,3,7]. After sorting: [1,3,3,7]. Original is 6.\n\ncandidate1: 7-3=4.\n\ncandidate2:3-1=2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,100000]. Original is 99999.\n\ncandidate1: 100000 - 1 =99999.\n\ncandidate2:1 -1=0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\noriginal = sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[0]\n\ncandidate1 = sorted_a[-1] - sorted_a[1]\n\ncandidate2 = sorted_a[-2] - sorted_a[0]\n\nmin_instability = min(original, candidate1, candidate2)\n\nWait, but wait: in the sorted array, when n is 2, sorted_a[-2] is sorted_a[0], so candidate2 is sorted_a[0] - sorted_a[0] = 0.\n\nWhich is correct, as removing either element would give 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute original = a[-1] - a[0]\n\nCompute candidate1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\nCompute candidate2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nresult is min(original, candidate1, candidate2)\n\nPrint result.\n\nWait, but wait: what if n is 2?\n\nIn that case, a has two elements.\n\nAfter sorting, a is [x, y], x <= y.\n\ncandidate1: y - x.\n\ncandidate2: x - x =0.\n\nSo min is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3.\n\nLike [1,2,3].\n\nOriginal is 2.\n\ncandidate1:3-2=1.\n\ncandidate2:2-1=1.\n\nSo min is 1.\n\nWhich is correct, because removing either 1 or 3 would leave instability 1.\n\nWait, but if we remove 2, the array is [1,3], which has instability 2, which is worse than 1.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal is 1, achieved by removing 1 or 3.\n\nSo code correctly finds 1.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nThe input is given as two lines.\n\nFirst line is n.\n\nSecond line is the array, which can be read as a list of integers.\n\nSo, in Python, something like:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, sort a.\n\nCompute the three candidates.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first case is written as ['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000'], but that's probably a mistake. The actual input is two lines: the first is n, the second is the array.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, proceed as above.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nWait, but in Python, for n=2, a has two elements. So, when n is 2, a[-2] is a[0], a[-1] is a[1].\n\nSo, candidate2 is a[0] - a[0] =0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7\n\nAfter sorting: [1,3,3,7]\n\noriginal:6\n\ncandidate1:7-3=4.\n\ncandidate2:3-1=2.\n\nmin is 2.\n\nSample Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n1 100000\n\nAfter sorting: [1,100000]\n\noriginal:99999.\n\ncandidate1:100000-1=99999.\n\ncandidate2:1-1=0.\n\nmin is 0.\n\nSo, outputs are correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, a=[1,2,3].\n\ncandidate1:3-2=1.\n\ncandidate2:2-1=1.\n\nmin is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, a=[5,4,3,2,1].\n\nAfter sorting: [1,2,3,4,5]\n\noriginal:4.\n\ncandidate1:5-2=3.\n\ncandidate2:4-1=3.\n\nmin is 3.\n\nBut wait, what if I remove 5, the last element. The new array is [1,2,3,4], which has instability 3. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5]. n=4.\n\ncandidate1:5-5=0.\n\ncandidate2:5-5=0.\n\nSo min is 0.\n\nSo, the code works.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
