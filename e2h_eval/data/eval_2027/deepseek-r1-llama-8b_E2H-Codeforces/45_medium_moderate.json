There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where n players participate in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, so for example, when n=2, there's only one game, so the output is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games: first against someone, then against another. But wait, how does that work exactly?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. Since it's a knockout, each game eliminates one player. So the total number of games is always n-1 because each game reduces the count by one.\n\nBut we're not just counting all possible games; we need the maximum number that the winner could have played. Because the winner has to win all their games, but the way the matches are arranged affects how many times they can play.\n\nSo the question is, what's the maximum possible games the winner can participate in, given that each match they play must be with someone who has played either the same number or one less game than them.\n\nI think the approach is to model the tournament as a tree where each node represents a player, and edges represent the matches they play. The winner must be the root, and each path from the root to a leaf represents a sequence of games the winner plays.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model it as the maximum depth of a binary tree where each level corresponds to a game. But no, maybe not exactly. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to building a Fibonacci heap where each new match can only happen if the opponent is someone who has played a certain number of games before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be approached by finding the largest k such that the sum of a certain series is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose the winner plays m games. Then, for each of these games, the opponents must have played either m-1 or m-2 games, right? Because the difference in the number of games can't be more than one.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the rule is that two players can play only if the number of games they've played so far differs by at most one. So, when the winner plays a game, say their i-th game, the opponent must have played either i-1 or i-2 games. Because the winner has already played i-1 games before this current game.\n\nWait, let's clarify: Each time the winner plays a game, they have already played a certain number of games before. The opponent must have played either one less (so the winner's current game is the opponent's next) or the same as the opponent's previous count.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the number of required players based on the maximum number of games the winner can have. Let's denote f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have played k games.\n\nFor example:\n- To have 1 game, you need 2 players.\n- For 2 games, the winner needs to beat two opponents. Each opponent must have played 0 or 1 games before facing the winner. But wait, in the second game, the opponent could have come from a bracket where they had to play one game themselves. Hmm, perhaps it's more complex.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) is the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have played k games. So for each k, f(k) is the minimal number of players that allows the winner to have played k games.\n\nThen, the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where f(k) ≤ n.\n\nSo, let's try to compute f(k) for various k.\n\nLet's start with small k:\n\nk=1: The winner plays one game. They need at least two players (the opponent). So f(1)=2.\n\nk=2: The winner needs to play two games. How? Let's see. For the first game, the opponent has played 0 games. After winning, the winner has played 1 game. For the second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1 game. If the opponent has played 0, then that means they haven't played any previous games. But that would require the opponent to have come from a different branch where they didn't have to play any games before. But in a knockout tournament, each player except the winner loses once. So perhaps the minimal way to arrange this is to have the winner beat two players, each of whom has played zero games. But wait, that's impossible because each of those two would have to come from different brackets. So maybe for k=2, you need f(2)=3 players: the winner, and two others. The winner plays the first against player 2, then against player 3. But wait, in that case, the third player hasn't played any games, but the winner has played one. So the second game is allowed because 1-0 is a difference of one. So yes, that works. So f(2)=3.\n\nWait, but what about if you have more players? Like, for k=3.\n\nWait, for k=3, the winner needs to have three games. Each game must be against an opponent who has either played one less or same number of games.\n\nSo for the third game, the opponent must have played two or one games.\n\nBut let's think about how to construct this. The winner's first game: opponent has 0 games. Then, after that, the winner has 1. Next game, opponent has 0 or 1. Let's say they have 0, which is allowed. Then, the winner has 2 games. Now, for the third game, opponent must have 1 or 2.\n\nIf the opponent has 1, that means they must have beaten someone else in their previous game.\n\nSo the structure would be:\n\nWinner plays against A: A has 0, winner has 1.\n\nThen, winner plays against B: B has 0, so after that, winner has 2, B has 0 (but wait, no: when the winner plays against B, B's previous games are 0, so the difference is 2 (winner has 2, B has 0), which is more than one. That's not allowed.\n\nOh right! So that's a problem. So, the opponent in the third game must have either 1 or 2 games.\n\nWait, in the third game, the winner has 2 games played. So the opponent must have either 1 or 2.\n\nSo, how to arrange that.\n\nPerhaps the winner's third opponent must have played 2 games.\n\nSo, for the third game:\n\nOpponent C has played 2 games. How?\n\nWell, opponent C must have come from a subtree where they played two games.\n\nSo, to create opponent C, they must have beaten someone, say D, and then someone else, say E.\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Let's think step by step.\n\nFor the third game, the opponent (C) must have played 2 games. So C must have won two games. So C must have been part of a subtree where two games were played leading up to their third game.\n\nSo, to build this:\n\nThe winner plays against A (1 game), then against B (second game). Then, for the third game, the opponent C must have played two games.\n\nSo, how many players do we need for this?\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Winner: 3 games.\n\n- Game 1: opponent A (played 0)\n- Game 2: opponent B (played 0)\nWait, no, because after game 1, winner has 1, B has 0. So when the winner plays against B, the difference is 1, which is allowed.\n\nNow, the third game: opponent C has to have played either 1 or 2 games.\n\nIf C has played 2 games, then they must have beaten two opponents themselves.\n\nSo, C has beaten D and E.\n\nWait, but then C's two wins require that D and E each have played one game. But how does that fit into the overall structure.\n\nThis seems like it's getting too big. Let's calculate the minimal number of players needed for k=3.\n\nHmm, perhaps f(3) is 4?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWinner has 3 games.\n\nEach game is allowed only if the difference in the number of games is <=1.\n\nSo, for the third game, the opponent must have played 2 games.\n\nBut how do we structure this.\n\nAlternative approach: for each k, f(k) is the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games.\n\nWe can model f(k) as follows.\n\nWhen the winner plays the k-th game, their opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nWait, no: when the winner has played i games before the k-th game, the opponent must have played i-1 or i-2 games.\n\nBecause the difference between the number of games can't be more than one.\n\nSo, for the k-th game, the winner is playing their (k)th game. Before that, they have played (k-1) games. So the opponent must have played either (k-1 - 1) = k-2 or (k-1) - 0 = k-1? Or wait, perhaps the opponent has played either (k-2) or (k-1) games before this match.\n\nWait, the condition is that the two players can play only if the number of games they've already played differs by no more than one.\n\nSo, when the winner has already played w games, the opponent must have o games, where |w - o| ≤1.\n\nIn the case of the k-th game, the winner has already played (k-1) games. So the opponent must have played either (k-2) or (k-1) games.\n\nSo, for the k-th game, the opponent must have played either k-2 or k-1 games.\n\nSo, for each k, we need to consider the sum of the minimal players required for each of these possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) is the sum of the minimal players required for the winner to have k games plus the minimal players for the opponent's path.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(k) can be built recursively.\n\nLet's think about f(k):\n\nTo have the winner play k games, they must have beaten k opponents. Each of these opponents must have played either (i-1) or (i-2) games before facing the winner in their i-th game.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) is the sum of f(k-1) and f(1), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps for each game i of the winner, the opponent in that game must have played either (i-1) games or (i-2) games.\n\nWait, maybe f(k) is the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games. So, for each step, the opponent must have played a certain number of games, which requires some players.\n\nSo, let's try to model f(k).\n\nf(1) = 2 (needs one opponent)\n\nFor f(2), the winner plays two games. The first game's opponent has 0, the second's opponent must have 0 or 1.\n\nWait, but in the second game, the winner has played 1 game. So the opponent must have played 0 or 1.\n\nWait, if the second opponent has played 1 game, then he must have already played one game before. That would require that opponent to have beaten someone else, adding to the total.\n\nSo for the second game, the opponent could have played one game, meaning that in order to reach that point, he needed to have beaten someone else. So, for f(2), we need the winner, plus two opponents: one for the first game, and another who has to have beaten one opponent.\n\nSo f(2) would be 3: winner, opponent A (game 1), opponent B (who has beaten opponent C). So total players 3.\n\nWait, that's correct because for n=3, the output is 2.\n\nWhat about f(3)?\n\nThe third game's opponent must have played either 2 or 1 games.\n\nIf the opponent has played 2 games, then he must have beaten two people. So, to get to that point, he has beaten someone, say D, and then E.\n\nBut then, the winner's third game is against F, who has played two games.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to model this as a recursive function.\n\nLooking online, I recall that this problem is similar to the \"Fibonacci sequence\" problem, where the minimal number of players needed for k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(k) is the (k+1)-th Fibonacci number.\n\nWait, let's compute f(k) for small k and see.\n\nCompute f(1)=2.\n\nf(2)=3.\n\nf(3): To have 3 games, the third opponent must have played 2 or 1 games.\n\nIf the opponent has played 2 games, then the number of players needed is f(2) + something.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either one less or the same number of games as the winner before that game.\n\nSo, for the third game, the opponent has played two games.\n\nTo have two games, the opponent must have beaten two opponents.\n\nBut each of those opponents must have played one or zero games.\n\nWait, perhaps for f(k), the minimal number of players is the sum of the minimal players required for the opponent's paths.\n\nSo, for the third game, the opponent has played two games.\n\nHow many players are needed for that opponent to have played two games?\n\nIt's f(2) = 3 players.\n\nSo, the total for f(3) would be f(2) + f(1) + ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nBecause for the k-th game, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nIf the opponent has played k-1 games, then that requires f(k-1) players. If they played k-2, that requires f(k-2) players.\n\nBut wait, that's not quite accurate because the opponent is part of the same tournament.\n\nWait, maybe f(k) is the minimal number of players required for the winner to have played k games, considering that each opponent in their k-th game has played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nSo, for the k-th game, the opponent is either:\n\nCase 1: the opponent has played k-1 games. So, the opponent's path is a sequence of k-1 games, which requires f(k-1) players.\n\nBut since the opponent is now facing the winner, that adds one more player (the winner) to the f(k-1) players.\n\nWait, no. Because the winner is already part of the count in f(k). So, perhaps the total is f(k-1) + 1, but that might not capture the entire picture.\n\nAlternatively, for the k-th game, the opponent has played either k-1 or k-2 games.\n\nIn case the opponent has played k-1 games, then their own f(k-1) players are needed, but the winner is separate.\n\nBut then, the total players would be f(k-1) + 1 (winner) plus any other players involved.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal f(k) is f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) is f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1. Let's test this.\n\nf(1) = 2.\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) + 1. But what's f(0)? Well, f(0) could be considered as 1 (no games played, just the winner). So f(2) = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. But earlier we saw that f(2) is 3, so this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAnother way: think of each game the winner plays as requiring a certain number of players. For the first game, it's 2 players (winner and one other). For the second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. If the opponent has played 1 game, that means they have beaten someone else. So for the second game, the opponent's path requires 2 players (the opponent and their victim). So the total players for two games is 2 (winner) + 2 (opponent and their victim) = 4? But earlier thought said f(2)=3.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the counts.\n\nWait, for the second game, the winner's second opponent can be someone who has played one game. So that opponent has beaten one person, which requires two players (opponent and their victim). So the winner, plus opponent and their victim: 3 players. So f(2)=3.\n\nBut for the third game, the opponent must have played two games. So that opponent has beaten two people, which requires 3 players (opponent, two victims). So the total players would be 3 (winner) + 3 (opponent and two victims) = 6? No, that's probably overcounting.\n\nWait, perhaps for each game, the opponent's path adds a certain number of players.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) is the sum of the first k Fibonacci numbers.\n\nWait, let's try to compute f(k) for small k:\n\nf(1) = 2.\n\nf(2) = 3.\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1) + 1 = 3+2+1=6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1.\n\nTesting:\n\nf(1)=2.\n\nf(2)=f(1)+f(0)+1. What is f(0)? Assuming f(0)=1, then f(2)=2+1+1=4. But earlier analysis says f(2) is 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the process.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either one less or the same number of games.\n\nSo, for the first game, the opponent has 0, so f(1)=2.\n\nFor the second game, the opponent can have 0 or 1.\n\nIf the opponent has 0, then it's easy: the opponent hasn't played any games before. So the winner plays against someone, then against someone else. So for f(2), it's 3 players: the winner, A, and B.\n\nIf the opponent has 1, then they must have beaten someone else, which requires 2 players (opponent and their victim). So the total players would be winner (1) + opponent (1) + their victim (1) = 3 players. So either way, f(2)=3.\n\nFor the third game, the opponent can have 1 or 2.\n\nWait, after the second game, the winner has played two games. So the third game's opponent must have played one or two.\n\nIf the opponent has one game, then they must have beaten someone. So that's two players: opponent and their victim.\n\nSo the total players would be 3 (from f(2)) + 2 (opponent and their victim) =5?\n\nBut wait, perhaps that's not the right way to add.\n\nAlternatively, for the third game, the opponent has played two games.\n\nSo, for that opponent to have played two games, they must have beaten two players, which requires f(2) players (since f(2) is 3: opponent and their two victims).\n\nSo the total players would be f(2) + 1 (winner) = 3+1=4? Or is it f(2) + something else?\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to model f(k) as the sum of the first k Fibonacci numbers, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of players for k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nf(1) = 2.\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) + 1. Assuming f(0) = 1, f(2) = 2 +1 +1=4. But earlier analysis suggests f(2)=3.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: For each game k, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. So, for the k-th game, the opponent is either from a path that took k-1 games or k-2.\n\nThus, the minimal number of players for the k-th game is f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1 (the winner). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of players for the k-th game is f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1, because the opponent's path requires f(k-1) or f(k-2) players, and the winner is part of the count.\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nf(1) = 2.\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) + 1 = 2 + 1 +1=4. No, but earlier f(2) is 3.\n\nNot matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1.\n\nBut for k=3, f(3)=f(2)+f(1)+1=3+2+1=6.\n\nIs that correct? Let's see.\n\nIf the third game's opponent has played two games, then that opponent's path is f(2)=3 players. So the total players would be 3 (winner's two games) + 3 (opponent's two games) = 6.\n\nBut in that case, the winner's third game is against a player who has played two games. So the total players needed are the ones in the winner's path (3) and the ones in the opponent's path (3) minus the winner, because the winner is counted in both.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 3+3=6. So f(3)=6.\n\nBut wait, when the third game happens, the opponent has played two games. So the opponent's path includes two games, which requires 3 players (opponent, D, E). So the winner's path is 3 players (winner, A, B), and the opponent's path is 3 players (C, D, E). So the total is 3+3=6.\n\nSo f(3)=6.\n\nSimilarly, f(4)=f(3)+f(2)+1=6+3+1=10.\n\nBut let's verify.\n\nFor k=4, the fourth game's opponent must have played 3 or 2 games.\n\nIf the opponent has played 3 games, then their path is f(3)=6 players. So the total would be 6 (opponent's path) + 3 (winner's path) =9.\n\nBut according to the formula, f(4)=10.\n\nHmm, perhaps my formula is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal number of players is the sum of f(k-1) and f(k-2), plus 1.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) + 1.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nf(1) =2.\n\nf(2)=f(1)+f(0)+1=2+1+1=4. But earlier analysis says f(2)=3.\n\nSo this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the minimal number of players f(k) can be found by the following recurrence:\n\nf(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)\n\nWith base cases f(1)=2, f(2)=3.\n\nTesting this:\n\nf(3)=3+2=5.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis suggested f(3)=6.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus 1.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFibonacci sequence starting from 1: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.\n\nFor k=1: f(1)=2. Which is Fib(3) = 2.\n\nk=2: f(2)=3. Fib(4)=3.\n\nk=3: f(3)=5. Fib(5)=5.\n\nk=4: f(4)=8. Fib(6)=8.\n\nHmm, this seems to fit.\n\nSo, f(k) = Fib(k+2) - 1.\n\nWait, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8.\n\nYes, that fits.\n\nSo, the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is Fib(k+2) - 1.\n\nWhere Fib is the Fibonacci sequence, with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo, for example, for k=4, Fib(6)=8, so f(4)=7.\n\nWait, wait: Fib(6) is 8, so 8-1=7.\n\nBut earlier analysis for k=3: Fib(5)=5, 5-1=4. But earlier thought was that f(3)=6.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's re-examine:\n\nIf f(k) = Fib(k+2) -1, then:\n\nk=1: Fib(3)=2 → f(1)=2.\n\nk=2: Fib(4)=3 → f(2)=3.\n\nk=3: Fib(5)=5 → f(3)=5-1=4.\n\nBut earlier analysis suggested that for k=3, the minimal number of players is 6. So this contradicts.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(k) = Fib(k+2).\n\nBecause Fib(3)=2, which is f(1)=2.\n\nFib(4)=3, which is f(2)=3.\n\nFib(5)=5, which would be f(3)=5.\n\nWait, but then for k=3, f(3)=5.\n\nBut according to earlier analysis, the third game would require 6 players.\n\nSo perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players is f(k) = Fib(k+2).\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nk=1: 2 → Fib(3)=2.\n\nk=2:3 → Fib(4)=3.\n\nk=3:5 → Fib(5)=5.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial steps are different.\n\nWait, let's think about k=3.\n\nThe winner plays three games.\n\nThe third game's opponent must have played two or one games.\n\nIf the opponent has played two games, then the minimal number of players required for that path is 3 (as per f(2)=3).\n\nSo the total players would be 3 (winner's path) + 3 (opponent's path) =6.\n\nBut according to the formula f(k)=Fib(k+2), f(3)=5, which is less than 6.\n\nSo perhaps the formula is not correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the minimal number of players. Perhaps the minimal number is the sum of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players is the (k+2)-th term in the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, let's compute f(k) for several k and see.\n\nLet me list the f(k) values as per the earlier reasoning:\n\nk=1: 2.\n\nk=2: 3.\n\nFor k=3:\n\nThe third game's opponent must have played two games. So that opponent's path requires 3 players (opponent, D, E). So the winner's path is 3 players (winner, A, B). So total players is 3 (winner's path) + 3 (opponent's path) =6.\n\nBut wait, the winner is part of both paths, right? Because the winner is the one playing the third game.\n\nNo, because the winner's path is separate from the opponent's path.\n\nWait, no. The winner's path includes the games they played to reach the third game, and the opponent's path includes their own games to reach the third game.\n\nSo for the third game, the opponent is someone who has played two games, which requires 3 players (opponent, D, E). The winner's path is 3 players (winner, A, B). So the total is 3 +3 =6 players.\n\nSo f(3)=6.\n\nSimilarly, for k=4:\n\nThe fourth game's opponent must have played three or two games.\n\nIf the opponent has played three games, then their path requires 5 players (f(3)=5). So the total players would be 5 (opponent's path) + 3 (winner's path) =8.\n\nBut according to the earlier formula, Fib(6)=8, so f(4)=8.\n\nWait, that's matching.\n\nSo f(4)=8.\n\nSimilarly, for k=5, the fifth game's opponent must have played four or three games.\n\nIf the opponent has played four games, then their path requires f(4)=8 players. So the total would be 8 (opponent's path) +3 (winner's path) =11.\n\nBut according to the formula, Fib(7)=13, so 13 vs 11. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula is not directly the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) follows the Fibonacci sequence starting from f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, f(4)=8, etc. So f(k) = Fib(k+2) - 1.\n\nWait, Fib(3)=2, so f(1)=2.\n\nFib(4)=3 → f(2)=3.\n\nFib(5)=5 → f(3)=5.\n\nFib(6)=8 → f(4)=8.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, for each k, f(k) = Fib(k+2) -1.\n\nSo, the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games is Fib(k+2) -1.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum k such that f(k) ≤n.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain point (since n can be up to 1018, we need to compute until Fib(k+2) -1 <=1018.\n\nOnce we have the Fib sequence, for each k, compute f(k) = Fib(k+2)-1, and find the largest k where f(k) <=n.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where Fib(m) exceeds n+1.\n\n2. For each k, compute f(k) = Fib(k+2)-1.\n\n3. Find the maximum k where f(k) <=n.\n\n4. If no such k exists (like when n=2, f(1)=2<=2, so k=1 is the answer), return that k.\n\nSo, the plan is to generate the Fib sequence, compute f(k) for each possible k, and find the largest k where f(k) <=n.\n\nLet's test this with examples.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2.\n\nf(1)=2 <=2 →k=1.\n\nSample Output: 1.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3.\n\nf(1)=2<=3.\n\nf(2)=3<=3 →k=2.\n\nSample Output:2.\n\nSample Input3: n=4.\n\nf(1)=2<=4.\n\nf(2)=3<=4.\n\nf(3)=5>4 → so maximum k is 2.\n\nSample Output:2.\n\nSample Input4: n=10.\n\nf(1)=2<=10.\n\nf(2)=3<=10.\n\nf(3)=5<=10.\n\nf(4)=8<=10.\n\nf(5)=13>10 → maximum k is 4.\n\nSample Output:4.\n\nWhich matches the given examples.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n- Read n.\n\n- Compute the Fib sequence, stopping when Fib(m) > n.\n\n- For each k, compute f(k) = Fib(k+2)-1.\n\n- Find the maximum k where f(k)<=n.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, generate the Fib sequence.\n\nWe can start with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1.\n\nThen, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, etc.\n\nCompute until Fib(m) exceeds n+1.\n\nThen, for each k starting from 1, compute f(k) = Fib(k+2) -1.\n\nFind the maximum k where f(k) <=n.\n\nLet's write a function to compute this.\n\nImplement steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Generate Fib sequence up to m where Fib(m) >n.\n\n3. For each k from 1 upwards, compute f(k) = Fib(k+2)-1.\n\n4. Keep track of the maximum k where f(k) <=n.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nn=2 →k=1.\n\nn=3→k=2.\n\nn=4→k=2.\n\nn=5→f(3)=5<=5→k=3.\n\nn=6→f(3)=5<=6→k=3.\n\nn=7→k=3.\n\nn=8→f(4)=8→k=4.\n\nn=9→f(4)=8<=9→k=4.\n\nn=10→f(4)=8<=10→k=4.\n\nn=11→f(4)=8<=11→k=4.\n\nn=12→f(4)=8<=12→k=4.\n\nn=13→f(5)=13-1=12? Wait, no.\n\nWait, f(5) = Fib(5+2) -1 = Fib(7)-1=13-1=12.\n\nSo if n=13, f(5)=12<=13 →k=5.\n\nWait, no: Fib(7) is 13.\n\nf(k=5) = Fib(5+2)-1=13-1=12.\n\nSo, for n=13, 12<=13 →k=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code needs to correctly compute f(k) for each k.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute Fib sequence:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > n*2: break  # since we need Fib(k+2) -1 <=n.\n\n    fib.append(next_fib)\n\nBut wait, perhaps it's better to keep generating until Fib(m) exceeds n+1.\n\nWait, because for k to be as large as possible, f(k)=Fib(k+2)-1 <=n.\n\nSo, for k_max, Fib(k_max+2) -1 <=n → Fib(k_max+2) <=n+1.\n\nThus, the maximum m is the first Fib(m) >n+1.\n\nSo, the code can generate the Fib sequence until Fib(m) >n+1.\n\nOnce we have all the Fib numbers up to that point, for each k, compute f(k)= Fib(k+2)-1.\n\nNow, for each k starting from 1, compute f(k) and see if it is <=n.\n\nOnce f(k) exceeds n, stop and take the previous k.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n <2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    fib = [1, 1]\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n        if next_fib > n+1:\n\n            break\n\n        fib.append(next_fib)\n\n    max_k =0\n\n    for k in range(1, len(fib)+1):\n\n        # compute f(k) = fib[k+1] -1 ?\n\n        # Wait, because for k=1, f(k)= Fib(3)-1=2-1=1?\n\n        # Wait, no.

No, that's wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) is Fib(k+2).\n\nBecause for k=1, Fib(3)=2=f(1).\n\nk=2, Fib(4)=3=f(2).\n\nk=3, Fib(5)=5=f(3).\n\nYes, this makes sense.\n\nSo, f(k)= Fib(k+2).\n\nThus, the code should compute for each k, f(k) = Fib(k+2).\n\nSo, for n=2, f(1)=2<=2 →k=1.\n\nFor n=3, f(2)=3<=3 →k=2.\n\nFor n=4, f(2)=3<=4, f(3)=5>4 →k=2.\n\nFor n=10, f(4)=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe problem can be approached by recognizing a pattern in the minimal number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games. This pattern is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus one.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the point where the next Fibonacci number exceeds `n + 1`. This helps us determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n2. **Determine Maximum Games**: For each possible number of games `k`, compute the minimal number of players required using the Fibonacci sequence. The largest `k` such that this number is less than or equal to `n` gives the answer.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Generate Fibonacci numbers until Fib(m) > n + 1\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_fib > n + 1:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_fib)\n    \n    max_games = 0\n    for k in range(1, len(fib)):\n        required_players = fib[k + 1]  # since f(k) = Fib(k+2)\n        if required_players - 1 <= n:\n            max_games = k\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    print(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input value `n`, which represents the number of players.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If `n` is less than 2, output 0 because a single player cannot play any games.\n3. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: Compute Fibonacci numbers until the next number exceeds `n + 1`.\n4. **Determine Maximum Games**: For each possible number of games `k`, check if the minimal number of players required is within the limit `n`. The largest valid `k` is the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring that we handle all edge cases and constraints effectively.",
