Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about moving from home to university in Crazy Town, which is divided into blocks by roads. Each road is an infinite line. The key point is that you can move between two adjacent blocks in one step if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the goal is to find the minimal number of steps needed to get from the home block to the university block.\n\nHmm. The first thing I notice is that each road is a straight line, and these lines divide the plane into regions. The home and university are in some regions, and we need to find how many such regions (blocks) separate them, but only via the roads.\n\nWait, but how do the roads affect the blocks? Each road is a line, and each new road can potentially split existing regions into more regions. But for our problem, perhaps the key lies in determining on which side of each road the home and university lie. Because, if both are on the same side of a road, then that road doesn't contribute to the separation between them.\n\nSo, let me think: For each road, check whether the home and university are on the same side or different sides. If they're on different sides, then that road contributes to the separation. The total number of such roads is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nWait, why is that? Because each such road would require crossing once, and the order of crossing doesn't matter because each crossing can be done in any order as long as you go from one side to the other. So the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the approach is:\n\n1. For each of the n roads, determine whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides.\n2. Count how many roads have the home and university on opposite sides.\n3. That count is the minimal number of steps.\n\nYes, because each such road must be crossed exactly once, regardless of the order.\n\nSo, the plan is to process each road, compute the sign of the home and university when plugged into the line equation. If the signs differ, increment the count. Finally, output that count as the answer.\n\nHow to compute the sign? For each line ax + by + c = 0, evaluate f(x,y) = a*x + b*y + c. Then, for a point (x0,y0), compute f(x0,y0). If it's positive, it's on one side; if negative, the other. If zero, but according to the problem statement, neither home nor university are on any road, so we don't have to handle that case.\n\nSo, for each road, compute f_home and f_univ. If f_home * f_univ < 0, then they are on opposite sides. Otherwise, same side.\n\nBut wait, what about the equality? Since f could be zero, but the problem says home and university are not on any road, so f cannot be zero for either. So, no need to worry about that.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read home coordinates (x1, y1)\n- Read university coordinates (x2, y2)\n- Read n, then for each of the n lines:\n   - Read a, b, c\n   - Compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   - Compute f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n   - If f1 and f2 have opposite signs, increment the count.\n- Output the count as the result.\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let's test this with the example given.\n\nIn the example input:\n\nHome is at (1,1), university at (-1,-1).\n\nThere are two roads in the first case.\n\nFirst road: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. Home is (1,1): plug in, 0*1+1*1+0=1>0. University is (-1,-1): 0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 = -1 <0. So opposite sides: count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x + 0y +0=0 → x=0. Home (1,1) gives 1>0. University (-1,-1) gives -1<0. Opposite sides: count +=1. So total is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample where n=3:\n\nLines are:\n\n1x +0y +0=0 → x=0.\n\n0x +1y +0=0 → y=0.\n\n1x +1y -3=0 → x+y=3.\n\nEvaluate each line.\n\nFor the first two lines, same as before: count increases by 2.\n\nThird line: home (1,1) → 1+1-3= -1 <0.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3= -5 <0. So same side. So third line doesn't contribute. So total count is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nWe need to read the inputs correctly. The home and university are given as strings in the first two lines, but in the problem statement, it's written as the input being three lines. Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1.\n\nThe second line contains two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line: integer n.\n\nThen n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nSo, in code, perhaps read the first two lines as home and university, then read n, then read n lines for roads.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input shown, the user wrote the input as ['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '...'], which may imply that the actual input is three lines: the home, university, and n.\n\nWait, no, perhaps the initial part was a formatting issue. In any case, in code, we'll read the first two lines as home and university, third as n, then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nSo, in Python, using input().split() for each line.\n\nNow, handling large numbers: since x1, y1, etc., can be up to 1e6, but in Python, integers are handled fine.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nRead home: x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nRead uni: x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of n roads:\n\n   a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n   f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n   f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n   if f1 * f2 < 0:\n\n       count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting with sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nCompute for first line: f1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0, f2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0=-1<0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line:1*1 +0*1 +0=1>0, 1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0=-1<0 → count +=1. Total 2.\n\nSample Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nSame home and uni.\n\nn=3.\n\nLines:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 1 -3 → x+y=3.\n\nLine 1: home is (1,1) →1>0; uni is (-1,-1) →-1<0 → count +=1.\n\nLine 2: same logic →count becomes 2.\n\nLine3: home: 1+1-3= -1<0; uni: -1-1-3= -5<0 → same side. No increment.\n\nTotal count is 2.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nWhat about cases where a road is vertical or horizontal?\n\nNo problem, because the formula works for any a and b.\n\nWhat about a road like 0x + 0y +c=0? Well, the problem states that ai and bi are not both zero, so that's impossible.\n\nAlso, the code handles all lines correctly.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings, but in practice, the code will read via standard input, so it's fine.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n",
