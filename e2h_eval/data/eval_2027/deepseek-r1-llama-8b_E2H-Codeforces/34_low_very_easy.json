And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over a week for Polycarp. The input gives me n days of sleep data and k consecutive days as a week. I need to find the average across all possible weeks.\n\nHmm, right. So the first thing I should think about is how to compute this efficiently because n can be up to 2*1e5, which is pretty big. So any O(n^2) approach is probably not going to work because that would be way too slow.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved. For each possible window of size k, I need to sum the values in that window and then compute the average over all windows.\n\nWait, but adding each window from scratch every time would take O(k) per window, which when multiplied by O(n) windows gives O(nk) time—this would be 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way to calculate the sums of all sliding windows. Oh right! That's where the sliding window technique comes in, using a prefix sum array or a sliding window sum variable that gets updated as we move the window.\n\nYes, the sliding window approach is the way to go here. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the input: n and k, then the list of a_i.\n2. Compute the sum of the first k elements to get the initial window sum.\n3. Add this sum to a total sum variable.\n4. Then, slide the window one step at a time:\n   a. Subtract the element that's leaving the window (the one at position i - k + 1).\n   b. Add the new element entering the window (position i).\n   c. Add this new window sum to the total.\n5. After processing all windows, divide the total sum by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n6. Output the result with enough decimal precision.\n\nWait, but wait: no, that's not exactly right. Because each window is a separate week, and each contributes equally to the average. So the correct approach is to sum all window sums and then divide by the number of windows.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the process is:\n\n- Compute the sum for each window of size k in the array a.\n- Sum all these window sums.\n- Divide by the number of such windows (which is n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute the sums of the windows efficiently.\n\nImplementing the sliding window approach:\n\nWe can initialize the sum as the sum of the first k elements. Then, for each position from k to n-1 (assuming 0-based), we subtract the element that's leaving the window (a[i - k]) and add the new element a[i]. Each time, this gives us the sum of the current window. We accumulate this into a total sum.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nBut wait, what if k is equal to n? Then there's only one window, so the sum is just the sum of all elements.\n\nLet me think about some test cases.\n\nTake the example given in the problem:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo n=8, k=2. The number of windows is 7.\n\nEach window is two consecutive elements:\n\n1+2 =3, 2+4=6, 4+100000=100004, 100000+123=100123, 123+456=579, 456+789=1245, 789+1=790.\n\nAdding all these:\n\n3 +6 =9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201960; +790=202750.\n\nTotal sum is 202750. Number of windows is 7. 202750 /7 is 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nAnother sample: when n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7].\n\nWindows are [3,4] sum 7, [4,7] sum 11. Total is 18, average 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is given as two lines: the first line has n and k, the second line has n integers.\n\nIn Python, I'll read the first line as a split, convert to integers. Then the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen, compute the initial window sum.\n\nThen, for each next element, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new one, updating the current window sum and adding to the total.\n\nBut wait: in",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks based on given sleep records for consecutive days. The goal is to efficiently calculate the average using a sliding window technique to handle large input sizes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** The input consists of two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (number of days in a week), followed by a list of `n` integers representing the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique:** To efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive window of `k` days:\n   - Initialize the sum of the first window of size `k`.\n   - Slide the window one element at a time across the list, updating the current window sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters.\n3. **Accumulating Sums:** Maintain a running total of all window sums as you slide through the list.\n4. **Calculating Average:** After processing all windows, compute the average by dividing the total sum of all windows by the number of windows, which is `n - k + 1`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we only traverse the list once after the initial setup, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total = current_sum\n    for i in range(k, n):\n        current_sum += a[i] - a[i - k]\n        total += current_sum\n    \n    num_windows = n - k + 1\n    average = total / num_windows\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The code reads the input values and converts them into appropriate data types.\n- **Initial Window Sum:** The sum of the first `k` elements is computed to initialize the sliding window.\n- **Sliding Window Update:** For each subsequent element, the current window sum is updated by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element.\n- **Total Sum Accumulation:** Each window sum is added to a total sum.\n- **Average Calculation:** The total sum is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time, which is then printed with the required precision.\n\nThis method ensures that the solution is both efficient and easy to understand, handling all edge cases within the constraints provided.",
