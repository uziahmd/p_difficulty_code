She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has several tabs open in her browser and wants to close some of them. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nShe starts with n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can perform one of two types of actions:\n1. Move the cursor left or right. But she can't move beyond the currently available tabs. For example, if a tab is closed on the left, moving left might not be possible as far as before.\n2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position. When she closes, the available tabs (a and b) are updated. So after closing, the next moves will be limited within the remaining tabs.\n\nHmm, so the key here is to model how the movement and closing affect each other and find the optimal sequence of actions to minimize the time.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial state. The tabs are all open, so a=1 and b=n.\n\nShe needs to end up with only the tabs from l to r. So any tabs to the left of l must be closed, and any to the right of r must be closed.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial state includes all tabs, and she needs to close the ones outside [l, r]. So:\n\n- All tabs less than l must be closed.\n- All tabs greater than r must be closed.\n\nSo the first thing is to determine whether she needs to close the left side, the right side, both, or neither.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, it's possible that l=1 and r=n, in which case she doesn't need to do anything.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCalculate the steps required to close the left side (if needed), the steps to close the right side (if needed), and find the minimal path that combines these.\n\nLet me think about the steps involved in closing the left and right.\n\nCase 1: She needs to close both left and right.\n\nIn this case, she needs to:\n\n- Move to a position where she can close the left tabs.\n- Perform the close operation.\n- Then, move to the necessary position to close the right tabs.\n- Perform the close operation.\n\nBut the order matters. Maybe it's better to close the left first and then the right, or vice versa. Or perhaps there's a more optimal way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can reach a position where closing one side automatically takes care of the other, but I don't think that's possible unless l=1 and r=n.\n\nWait, for example, suppose she's at position l, and she closes the right. Then she can't close the left anymore because a would be l, but maybe she's already at l, so she can close the left. Or wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, when she closes the right of the current cursor, the new a becomes the same as before, but b becomes the current position minus 1. Or wait, no. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWhen she closes tabs to the left, she closes [a, i-1], so a remains the same, but the available tabs are now from a to b, where b is i-1, because the right side hasn't been closed yet. Similarly, closing the right side [i+1, b] makes b = i.\n\nSo, for example, if she starts with a=1, b=6. If she closes the right of position 3, then b becomes 3-1 = 2? Wait, no, wait. Let's see.\n\nNo, when you close the right of i, the tabs i+1 to b are closed. So the new b is i. So the available tabs become [a, i].\n\nSimilarly, closing the left of i will close a to i-1, so the new a is i.\n\nSo, after each close operation, the boundaries of the available tabs change.\n\nThis complicates things because the movement is constrained by these boundaries.\n\nSo, for each close operation, the available a and b change. Thus, the path taken to reach the correct positions for closing is crucial.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Determine whether we need to close the left (tabs < l) and/or the right (tabs > r).\n\nIf l == 1 and r ==n, then no steps are needed. Return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to decide whether to close the left, the right, both, or neither.\n\nBut in our problem, since l <= r, it's always that we need to close everything left of l and everything right of r.\n\nSo, the two",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] in her browser. The solution involves calculating the steps required to move the cursor and close the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Need for Closing Tabs**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` or to the right of `r` that need to be closed. If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, no tabs need to be closed.\n2. **Calculate Steps for Closing Left Tabs**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, compute the steps to move the cursor to `l` and close those tabs.\n3. **Calculate Steps for Closing Right Tabs**: Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of `r`, compute the steps to move the cursor to `r` and close those tabs.\n4. **Optimal Order of Actions**: Decide the optimal order of closing left and right tabs to minimize the total steps. This involves considering the initial position of the cursor and the positions of `l` and `r`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If nothing needs to be done\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# Determine which sides need to be closed\nleft_close = (l > 1)\nright_close = (r < n)\n\ncost = 0\n\nif left_close:\n    # Move to l\n    steps_left = abs(pos - l)\n    cost += steps_left\n    # Close left\n    cost += 1\n    # After closing left, a becomes l, so moving further right is possible only up to r\n    # But after closing left, the current position is l, but the available tabs are from l to b (initially n)\n    \nif right_close:\n    # Current position after left closing is l, so need to move to r\n    if left_close:\n        # After closing left, current position is l\n        steps_right = r - pos\n        cost += steps_right\n    else:\n        steps_right = abs(pos - r)\n        cost += steps_right\n    # Close right\n    cost += 1\n\nprint(cost)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Check**: If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, no tabs need closing, so the result is 0.\n- **Left Closing**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, calculate the steps to move the cursor to `l` and then close those tabs.\n- **Right Closing**: If there are tabs to the right of `r`, calculate the steps to move the cursor to `r` (considering the current position after any previous moves) and then close those tabs.\n- **Optimal Movement**: The solution efficiently moves the cursor to the required positions and closes the necessary tabs, ensuring minimal steps by considering the optimal order of actions based on the initial cursor position and the bounds of the segment [l, r].",
