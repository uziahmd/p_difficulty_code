They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I have to solve this problem where I need to find all winning integers x such that there's a permutation p of 1 to 2^n where the team with skill x becomes the champion. The tournament structure is a knockout style with each phase determining which teams move on based on the given string s.\n\nFirst, let me understand the tournament structure. It's a single-elimination tournament, and each phase is a round where teams are paired against each other. The winner of each match proceeds to the next round. The phases are structured so that in each phase, the number of games is halved, until only one remains.\n\nThe string s represents the outcome of each phase. Each character s_i corresponds to a phase. For example, for n=3, s has length 3, each phase being the first, second, third phase. Wait, no: wait, the phases are from i=0 to i=n-1. So phase 0 is the first phase, which has 2^(n-1) games, then phase 1 has 2^(n-2) games, etc., down to phase n-1 with 1 game (the final).\n\nEach s_i can be '0' or '1'. When s_i is '0', in each game of that phase, the lower-skilled team wins. So, for example, if two teams play and the lower-skilled one (say 3) has a higher index than the higher-skilled one (4), then 3 would win. But wait, no: the actual skill is determined by the permutation p. So for s_i='0', the lower-skilled team (lower p_i) wins each match. For s_i='1', the higher-skilled team wins each match.\n\nMy goal is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the overall winner.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? It seems like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming or some kind of bitwise manipulation, but considering the constraints, n can be up to 18, which means 2^18 = 262144 possible x values. That's manageable.\n\nI think the approach is to model for each possible subset of teams remaining after each phase, which x could be the winner. But since the phases are dependent on each other, we need to simulate each step.\n\nWait, but the way the tournament progresses is hierarchical. Each phase depends on the winners of the previous phase. So perhaps for each phase, we can determine the possible winners based on the current s_i.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose I have a function that, given the current set of active teams, and the current phase, returns all possible x that can be the eventual winner.\n\nBut even that might be too slow because for each step, the number of possible subsets is too big.\n\nAlternatively, since the tournament is a binary tree structure, perhaps the key is to model the selection process as a series of matches where each match's outcome depends on the current phase's rule.\n\nWait, another idea: the winner must come from certain positions in the initial bracket. Each phase determines which part of the bracket can contribute to the next phase.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. In the first phase, teams are paired as 1v2, 3v4, etc. The winners proceed to the next phase, which is structured as the winners of the first pair playing against the winners of the second pair, and so on. So each phase is a grouping of the previous winners into new pairs, but the groupings depend on the phase.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the tournament as a binary tree, where each node is a match, and the leaves are the initial matches. The root is the final match.\n\nIn this structure, each internal node has two children, which represent the two matches that feed into it. So for each phase, the matches are at different levels of this tree.\n\nNow, for each match in the tournament, whether a particular team can reach that match depends on the outcomes of the previous matches.\n\nSo, for a team x, to become the champion, it must win all its matches in each phase. Each phase corresponds to a level in the binary tree.\n\nWait, but the way the phases are structured, each phase is a specific level of the binary tree. For example, phase 0 corresponds to the first layer (leaves), phase 1 is the next layer, and so on up to phase n-1, which is the root.\n\nSo, for each phase i (from 0 to n-1), each match at that level depends on the outcomes of the matches in the previous phase.\n\nThus, for a team to reach the final (phase n-1), it must have won all its matches in phase 0, phase 1, ..., phase n-2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can model the possible winners for each level of the tournament.\n\nLet's denote for each phase i, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all possible winning integers x such that there exists a permutation of team skills where the team with skill x becomes the champion of a tournament. The tournament structure is a knockout style with each phase determining which teams move on based on given rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The tournament is structured in phases where each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one remains. Each phase has a rule that determines the winner of each match: either the lower-skilled or higher-skilled team wins.\n2. **Binary Tree Structure**: The tournament can be visualized as a binary tree where each node represents a match, and the leaves are the initial matches. Each internal node has two children representing the previous matches.\n3. **Dynamic Programming**: For each phase, we track possible winners by considering the outcomes of matches based on the given rules. We use a bitmask to represent the set of possible winners at each phase.\n4. **Bitmask Representation**: Each bit in an integer represents whether a team can win at a specific phase. This helps efficiently track and update possible winners through each phase.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    max_x = 1 << n\n    dp = [0] * (max_x + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_phase = 1 << (n - 1 - i)\n        rule = s[i]\n        new_dp = [0] * max_x\n        for mask in range(max_x):\n            if dp[mask] == 0:\n                continue\n            block_size = 1 << (i + 1)\n            for j in range(0, block_size, 2):\n                left = (mask >> (j)) & 1\n                right = (mask >> (j + 1)) & 1\n                if left > right:\n                    winner = left\n                else:\n                    winner = right if rule == '1' else left\n                pos = j // 2\n                if (winner << (pos)) & 1:\n                    new_mask = ((mask >> j) << (j - 1)) | ((mask >> (j+1)) << (j))\n                    new_dp[new_mask] = 1\n        dp = new_dp\n    \n    result = []\n    for x in range(max_x):\n        if dp[x]:\n            result.append(x)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(result))) + ' ')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read input values for n and the string s representing the tournament rules.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Initialize a list `dp` where each index represents a bitmask of possible winners.\n3. **Phase Processing**: For each phase, update the possible winners based on the current phase's rule. Each phase processes pairs of teams, updating the possible winners for the next phase.\n4. **Result Compilation**: After processing all phases, collect all indices (teams) that can be the final winner and print them in ascending order.\n\nThis approach efficiently tracks possible winners through each phase using bitwise operations, ensuring the solution is both optimal and scalable for large values of n.",
