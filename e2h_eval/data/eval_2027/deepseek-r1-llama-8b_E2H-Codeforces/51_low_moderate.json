Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be used to exactly form two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters of the guest and host, they should exactly match the pile, without any extra letters left over or missing.\n\nHmm, so the input has three lines. The first line is the guest's name, the second is the host's name, and the third is the pile. All are uppercase letters. I need to determine if the pile can be rearranged to form both names together.\n\nSo, the approach here seems clear. We need to count all the letters in the guest and host names combined, and then compare that to the counts in the pile. If they match exactly, then output YES; otherwise, NO.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle this in Python? Let's think.\n\nFirst, I'll read the three lines from the input. Then, I'll process each of them by counting the frequency of each character.\n\nFor each line (guest, host, pile), I can convert them into a Counter object. Then, for the guest and host, I'll add their counters together. If the sum equals the counter of the pile, then it's possible.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Read the three lines: guest, host, pile.\n2. Combine guest and host into a single string.\n3. Count the letters in this combined string.\n4. Count the letters in the pile string.\n5. Compare the two counts. If they are equal, print \"YES\"; else, print \"NO\".\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, because the problem allows any permutation. So the actual order doesn't matter, just the counts.\n\nSo in Python, using the collections.Counter class would be perfect for this.\n\nLet me think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All names and pile are empty? But according to the problem statement, each line is not empty, so that's not possible.\n\nCase 2: The combined length of guest and host is not equal to the pile's length. That's an easy check before even doing the full count. Like, len(guest) + len(host) must equal len(pile). Because each letter must be used exactly once. So if the lengths don't add up, immediately return \"NO\".\n\nThat's a good point. For example, if the guest has 5 letters, host 3, pile has 8: but maybe the sum is 8, but perhaps some letters are missing. But the length check is a quick way to eliminate impossible cases.\n\nSo step 0: Check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output \"NO\".\n\nOtherwise, proceed to count the letters.\n\nAnother edge case: the pile is exactly the same as guest + host, but with different counts. Like, if the guest is 'A' and host is 'B', the pile should be 'AB'; if it's 'BA', it's still okay. But if the pile has an extra 'A', it's no good.\n\nWait, no— in that case, the combined guest+host is 'AB', which is length 2. The pile is 'AA'— that's length 2, but counts are wrong, so output is \"NO\".\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Read all three lines.\n- Check if the sum of the first two's lengths equals the third's. If not, output 'NO'.\n- Else, create a combined counter of the first two.\n- Compare with the third's counter.\n- If equal, 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nImporting Counter from collections is necessary.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nThe guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ'. Wait, no, looking back at the example:\n\nWait, in the sample input given, the first sample's guest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ, and the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. When you combine guest and host, the letters should be equal to the pile.\n\nIn code:\n\nRead each line as a string.\n\nSo, something like:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, total_letters = guest + host\n\nIf len(total_letters) != len(pile): print('NO')\n\nElse:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\ncombined_counts = Counter(total_letters)\npile_counts = Counter(pile)\n\nif combined_counts == pile_counts:\n    print('YES')\nelse:\n    print('NO')\n\nWait, that's the plan.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, the order doesn't matter because we're counting each letter's frequency.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given pile of letters can be rearranged to form the names of a guest and a host exactly. The solution involves counting the frequency of each letter in the guest's and host's names combined and comparing it with the frequency of letters in the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters from the input.\n2. **Check Lengths:** Verify if the combined length of the guest's and host's names is equal to the length of the pile. If not, immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Count Letters:** Use a counter to count the frequency of each letter in the combined guest and host names.\n4. **Compare Counts:** Compare the counter of the combined guest and host names with the counter of the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the possibility of rearranging the pile to form the exact names without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the total number of letters matches\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Count the letters in the combined guest and host\n    combined = guest + host\n    combined_counter = Counter(combined)\n    pile_counter = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the two counters\n    if combined_counter == pile_counter:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The guest's name, host's name, and the pile are read as strings.\n- **Length Check:** This step quickly eliminates cases where the total number of letters does not match, ensuring efficiency.\n- **Counting Letters:** Using `collections.Counter`, we create a frequency count of each letter in the combined guest and host names and the pile.\n- **Comparison:** By comparing the two counters, we determine if the pile can be rearranged to form the exact names, ensuring no extra or missing letters.\n\nThis method efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures correctness by directly comparing the letter frequencies.",
