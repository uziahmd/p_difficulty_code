String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of beautiful strings based on given constraints. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nSo, a beautiful string is a binary string (only 0s and 1s) that has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's more to it: we can modify the string through some operations, and the resulting string after modifications must be equal to g. Wait, no—wait, the problem says that the string after modifications must consist of either all 0s or all 1s. Because g is either 0 or 1. So the modified string must be all 0s or all 1s, depending on g.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that for each beautiful string s, when you perform some modifications, you get a string consisting entirely of 0s or 1s. And that modified string must be equal to g. So the beautiful string can be transformed into a string of all 0s if g is 0, or all 1s if g is 1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So the modified string must be such that all its characters are g. So for example, if g is 0, then after modifications, the string must consist entirely of 0s. Similarly for g being 1.\n\nSo the beautiful string s must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. It has exactly n zeros and m ones.\n2. After performing some number of allowed modifications, the string becomes a string of all 0s (if g=0) or all 1s (if g=1).\n\nNow, the key is to figure out what these modifications do. Each modification is replacing the last two characters with one character. Specifically, if the two are both 0, replace them with a 0; if both are 1, replace with a 1. Otherwise, perhaps? Wait, the problem says \"exactly\" one other character. So if the two last characters are 0 and 1, then replacing them would result in what? Let me see the note in the problem statement: for example, \"01010\" becomes \"0100\" after one modification. So the last two are '0' and '5'? Wait, no, the example says replacing two zeros with one zero. Wait, the example given is that the string \"01010\" transforms into \"0100\" after one modification. So the last two were '0' and '0', so they become a single '0'. Then, another modification on \"0100\" (last two are 0 and 0 again) becomes \"011\".\n\nWait, but what happens if the last two are different? Like 0 and 1. For instance, consider a string ending with \"01\". What happens when we perform a modification? According to the problem statement, the modification replaces the last two characters by one. But which one?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"this character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" Oh right! So if the two last characters are both zeros, replace them with one zero. If they are not both zeros, i.e., if at least one is not zero, then you replace them with a zero. Wait, wait, no— wait, the problem says: \"this character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\n\nSo the replacement is as follows:\n\n- If the two last characters are both 0 → replace with 0.\n- Else, replace with 0.\n\nSo regardless of whether the two are 0 and 0, 0 and 1, 1 and 0, or 1 and 1, the replacement is always 0 unless they are both 0, in which case it's 0 as well. Wait no— let me read it again: \"one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise zero.\" So if the two are two zeros, replace with one. Else, replace with zero.\n\nWait, that's confusing. So if the two are two zeros, the replacement is 1? Or is it 0?\n\nWait the problem says: \"we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\"\n\nOh, okay. So when the two are 00, the replacement is 1. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nWait, no: because the problem says \"this character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So:\n\n- if the two are 0 and 0 → replace with 1.\n- else → replace with 0.\n\nSo for example, if the last two are 11 → replaced with 0.\n\nIf the last two are 01 → replaced with 0.\n\nOnly when the last two are 00, the replacement is 1.\n\nThis is an important detail because it affects how the string can be modified.\n\nSo each modification reduces the length of the string by one, since two characters are replaced by one.\n\nSo the process of modifying is iterative, each time reducing the length by one, until the string can't be modified anymore (length is less than 2). But during each step, the modifications can change the structure of the string.\n\nOur goal is to find all beautiful strings s (with exactly n 0s and m 1s) that can be transformed into a string of all g's via some number of modifications.\n\nHmm. So for each beautiful string s, we need to determine whether there's a sequence of modifications that leads to a string of all g's.\n\nBut considering the possible lengths of s, it's impossible to model this directly for large n and m. So we need a dynamic programming approach or some combinatorial way to model this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the necessary conditions for a beautiful string to be transformable into all g's.\n\nLet me think about the end state. After all modifications, the string is all g's. So for the initial string, there must be a way to perform modifications such that eventually, all characters are g.\n\nBut how does the process of modifying affect the counts of 0s and 1s?\n\nEach modification step replaces two characters with one, which is determined by the two characters. So each modification step can change the total number of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, but in each modification:\n\n- If the two characters are 00 → replaced by 1. So this reduces the count of 0s by 2 and adds 1, net loss of 1 zero. The count of 1s increases by 1.\n\n- If the two are 01 or 10 or 11 → replaced by 0. So:\n\n   - For 01 or 10: the two characters are replaced by 0. So each such modification reduces the number of 1s by 1 (since two 1s are replaced by 0, but wait no— no, for 01, you have one 0 and one 1. Replacing them with 0: the 0 remains, and the 1 is removed. So the 0 count remains same, and 1 count decreases by 1.\n\nWait, no: the original two are 0 and 1. After replacement, it's 0. So the 0 count remains the same (1 was subtracted, 1 added), and 1 count decreases by 1.\n\nSimilarly, for 11: replaced by 0. So the two 1s are gone, replaced by a 0. So 0 count increases by 1, 1 count decreases by 2.\n\nSo each modification can affect the counts of 0s and 1s differently based on which pair is being replaced.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can model the problem by considering the possible transformations and tracking how the counts of 0s and 1s change.\n\nBut given that n and m can be up to 105, a dynamic programming approach may be feasible.\n\nLet me think about what the initial and final states look like.\n\nThe initial state is a string with exactly n 0s and m 1s. We need to reach a state where all characters are g. So, the final state has:\n\n- If g == 0: all 0s. So total zeros = k, where k is the initial length minus the number of modifications. Wait, no. Let me think: each modification reduces the length by 1. So the initial length is n + m. After t modifications, the length is (n + m) - t.\n\nIn the final state, the length is (n + m) - t. Since all characters are g, the count of g's must be equal to that length.\n\nSo, for the final state:\n\nIf g is 0: the count of 0s is (n + m - t).\n\nIf g is 1: the count of 1s is (n + m - t).\n\nBut in the initial state, the counts are fixed as n and m. So for the transformation to be possible, certain conditions must be met.\n\nLet me consider the cases for g=0 and g=1.\n\nCase 1: g = 0.\n\nWe need to reach a state where the count of 0s is L, where L is the length of the string after t modifications, and all are 0s.\n\nSo, L = (n + m) - t.\n\nAlso, the count of 0s in the final state is L.\n\nBut during the process, each modification can change the counts. So the initial 0s and 1s must allow for a path to the final state.\n\nHmm. So perhaps for the transformation to be possible, the final count of 0s (which is (n + m - t)) must be achievable through the allowed modifications.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the minimal and maximal possible 0 counts that can be achieved.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to model this as a problem where we can reach certain 0 and 1 counts through a series of steps, each of which reduces the length by 1.\n\nSo, let's model the problem using DP, where the state is (a, b, t), representing the current number of 0s (a) and 1s (b), and the current length (t = a + b). But since the length is a + b, we can just track a and b.\n\nWait, but t is a + b, and each step reduces t by 1. So the state can be represented by (a, b), since t is known as a + b.\n\nBut the transitions are determined by the current pair of last two characters. However, since the actual arrangement of the string isn't tracked, except for the counts, perhaps we can model the possible transitions based on the current a and b.\n\nWait, but this might not capture all possibilities, as the order of the characters could influence the possible modifications. However, considering that the problem allows any sequence of modifications, perhaps the order doesn't matter beyond the counts, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe not. For example, suppose we have a string with a=3, b=1. How can we modify it? The last two could be 0 and 0, leading to a=2, b=1, and the new last two are 0 and 0. Another modification leads to a=1, b=1. Now, the last two are 0 and 1. When we modify them, we get 0, so a=2, b=0. Now, the string is all 0s. So for g=0, this is a valid path.\n\nBut suppose the initial string is 0,0,0,1. The last two are 0 and 1. So modification replaces them with 0, leading to 0,0,0. So that's another path.\n\nBut in terms of a and b, the transitions depend on the last two characters, which can vary based on the string structure. However, since we don't track the actual string, but only the counts, perhaps the transitions can be modeled based on the current a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for a given a and b, the last two characters could vary, leading to different possible transitions.\n\nWait, but the problem is about whether any possible sequence of modifications can lead to the desired outcome. So perhaps we need to model the possible transitions based on the current a and b, but considering all possible ways the last two characters could be arranged.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transitions are deterministic based on a and b, because the last two could be any possible pair, but the modifications can only reduce the counts in certain ways.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Let's think differently.\n\nLet me think about the necessary conditions for a beautiful string s to be transformable into all g's.\n\nAfter all modifications, the string is all g's. So the total length after t modifications is l = (n + m) - t.\n\nIn the final state, the count of g's must be l.\n\nSo for g=0: the final count of 0s is l.\n\nBut initially, the count of 0s is n. So the change in 0s is (l - n). Each modification can change the count of 0s in specific ways.\n\nEach modification step can change the count of 0s and 1s based on the pair being modified.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach: think about the parity of the number of 1s and the possible transformations.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that each modification reduces the length by 1, and the sum a + b must decrease by 1 each time.\n\nSo the final length is (n + m) - t, which must equal the number of g's.\n\nFor g=0: the final count of 0s is (n + m - t). Also, since the final string is all 0s, the count of 1s is zero.\n\nSo for g=0, the condition is that the initial count of 1s can be reduced to zero via the allowed modifications.\n\nSimilarly, for g=1: the initial count of 0s must be reducible to zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's not sufficient because the way modifications work can influence the possibility.\n\nWait, but perhaps the necessary and sufficient condition is that the initial count of non-g characters can be completely eliminated through the allowed modifications.\n\nWait, for g=0: the final string has zero 1s. So the initial number of 1s must be reducible to zero via the modifications.\n\nSimilarly, for g=1: the initial number of 0s must be reducible to zero.\n\nBut how does each modification affect the count of 1s or 0s?\n\nEach modification can either:\n\n- Replace two 0s with one 1 (so 0 count decreases by 2, 1 count increases by 1).\n- Replace two 1s with one 0 (so 1 count decreases by 2, 0 count increases by 1).\n- Replace a 0 and a 1 with a 0 (so 1 count decreases by 1, 0 count remains same).\n\nWait, no— when the two are 0 and 1, replacing them with 0:\n\n- Before: 1 zero and 1 one.\n- After: 1 zero (unchanged) and 0 ones.\nSo the 1 count decreases by 1.\n\nSimilarly, when two 1s are replaced by 0:\n\n- 1 count decreases by 2, 0 increases by 1.\n\nWhen two 0s are replaced by 1:\n\n- 0 count decreases by 2, 1 increases by 1.\n\nSo each modification can change the counts in various ways.\n\nBut the problem is, given the initial a = n and b = m, can we reach a state where either:\n\n- a_final = l, b_final = 0, where l = a + b - t, and t is the number of modifications.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAlternative approach: think about the parity of the number of 1s and the number of modifications needed.\n\nWait, perhaps for g=0, the number of 1s in the initial string must be even or something like that.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=1, m=1, g=0.\n\nThe beautiful strings are \"01\" and \"10\". Each of these can be modified once to become \"0\", which is all 0s.\n\nSo for each of these, the initial 1s count is 1. After one modification, the 1s count is zero.\n\nSo in this case, m=1 can be reduced to zero with one modification.\n\nAnother sample: second input is n=2, m=2, g=0.\n\nThe output is 4. The beautiful strings are those that can be modified to \"00\" (but wait, the modified string is all 0s, so the count is 2, since the initial length is 4, and one modification is done (4-2=2). Wait, no: initial length is 4, after t=2 modifications, length is 4-2=2, which is the final length. So for g=0, the final count of 0s is 2. So initial a=2, b=2.\n\nWait, but according to the note, the four beautiful strings are \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\". Let's take \"0011\":\n\nWe can perform modifications as follows:\n\n- Modify the last two 1s: replace with 0. Now the string becomes \"0010\" (length 4 → 3).\n\n- Then, the last two are 0 and 0: replace with 1. Now the string is \"010\" (length 3 → 2).\n\nWait, but now the string has two 0s and one 1. Hmm, but this doesn't lead to all 0s. Alternatively, perhaps another path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the required condition for a beautiful string to be able to be transformed into all g's.\n\nLet's denote:\n\nFor g=0: the initial number of 1s must be reducible to zero through the allowed modifications.\n\nEach modification can change the count of 1s as follows:\n\n- If two 0s are replaced by 1 → 1s increase by 1. So this could potentially create more 1s, making it harder to eliminate them.\n\n- If two 1s are replaced by 0 → 1s decrease by 2.\n\n- If a 0 and 1 are replaced by 0 → 1s decrease by 1.\n\nSo, for g=0, we need to eliminate all 1s. The problem is, if during the process, we replace two 0s with 1, increasing the 1s count, that could prevent us from eliminating them.\n\nBut perhaps, the initial number of 1s (m) must be such that m is congruent to 0 modulo 1, which it always is. Hmm, that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to see that in the process of modifications, the number of 1s can only decrease by even numbers when replacing pairs of 1s, and by 1 when replacing a 0 and 1.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern here.\n\nAn alternative idea: the minimal number of 1s that can remain after all possible modifications is 0 or 1, depending on whether m is even or odd.\n\nWait, let me think: each time we replace two 1s, we decrease the count by 2. That's an even change. When we replace a 0 and 1, the count decreases by 1, which is odd.\n\nSo the parity of the number of 1s can change depending on the type of modification.\n\nSo, for g=0, the final count of 1s must be zero, which is even.\n\nSo, if the initial count of 1s (m) is odd, then it's impossible to reach zero, because each modification can change the count by 1 or 2. Let's see:\n\nSuppose m is odd.\n\nEach modification that changes m by 1 (like replacing 0 and 1) changes the parity. Each modification that changes m by 2 (replacing two 1s) preserves the parity.\n\nSo, starting from m (odd), any number of modifications that change by 1 (odd) will toggle the parity. So, can we reach zero?\n\nZero is even. So, if m is odd, and we can make an odd number of modifications that change m by 1, then the final m can be zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's possible.\n\nWait, for example, if m is 1:\n\n- You can replace the two last characters (0 and 1) with 0. This reduces m by 1, making it zero. So yes, it's possible.\n\nSo, for m=1, it's possible.\n\nBut wait, when m is 1, the initial string has one '1'. So, the last two characters could be 0 and 1. Replacing them gives a 0, so m becomes zero.\n\nSo, in this case, it's possible.\n\nSo, the parity of m is not a barrier. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the minimal and maximal possible 1s counts after any number of modifications.\n\nEach modification can change the 1s count in the following ways:\n\n- Replace two 0s: m increases by 1.\n- Replace two 1s: m decreases by 2.\n- Replace 0 and 1: m decreases by 1.\n\nSo, the 1s count can go up or down, depending on the modifications.\n\nBut this makes it difficult to model.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node is (a, b), and edges represent possible transitions based on the types of modifications.\n\nBut since a + b can be up to 210 (since n and m are up to 105 each), this is manageable.\n\nSo, the state is (a, b), and each edge represents a possible modification, leading to a new (a', b').\n\nBut how to model the transitions correctly?\n\nBecause each modification depends on the last two characters, which could vary based on the current arrangement of the string.\n\nHowever, since the problem is about whether any possible path exists that leads to the desired final state, perhaps the transitions can be considered based on the current a and b, without knowing the exact arrangement.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because, for a given a and b, the last two characters could be anything, leading to different transitions.\n\nSo, perhaps it's possible that for a given a and b, there's no possible transition, but in reality, the arrangement of the string allows for it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transitions can be modeled in a way that captures all possibilities, assuming that for any a and b, all possible transitions are possible.\n\nBut that's not accurate, because the actual arrangement determines the available transitions.\n\nThis seems tricky. Perhaps I should look for another angle.\n\nAlternative idea: the process of modifying the string can be viewed as a way to merge the last two characters. Each modification reduces the length by one.\n\nThe final string is a single character, which is g.\n\nSo, the question is: can the initial string be merged step by step into a single g, following the rules of merging.\n\nBut again, the exact merging steps are unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be considered as building a binary tree, where each internal node represents a merge operation.\n\nEach leaf is a character in the string, and each internal node represents a merge.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming, where dp[a][b] represents the number of ways to reach a state with a zeros and b ones, considering the current length.\n\nBut then, how to model the transitions?\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the final state. For the string to be all 0s (g=0), the initial string must have a certain property. Similarly for g=1.\n\nSo, for each beautiful string, the question is: can it be reduced to a single 0 or 1, depending on g.\n\nWait, but the final string after modifications must be a single character if the initial length is greater than 1. Or, wait, no: the modifications can stop at any point as long as the string is all g's.\n\nWait, no: the problem says that the string can be modified any number of times (including zero), as long as after all modifications, it's all g's.\n\nSo, the final string can be of any length >=1.\n\nWait, no: the initial string is of length n + m. Each modification reduces the length by 1. So the final string's length is (n + m) - t, where t is the number of modifications. The final string must be all g's, so the length can be any positive integer.\n\nSo, for example, the final string can be of length 2 (if t = n + m - 2), or any smaller size.\n\nWait, but for a beautiful string s to be transformed into all g's, it's sufficient that after some t modifications, the string is all g's.\n\nSo, for the initial string s, we need to check if there exists some t such that the counts of 0s and 1s can be adjusted to (L, 0) or (0, L), where L is the length after t modifications.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother thought: perhaps for the string to be reducible to all g's, the initial counts of non-g bits must be reducible to zero through the allowed modifications.\n\nBut given the complexity of the modification rules, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the possible parities or other invariants.\n\nWait, for example, for g=0: the final string has no 1s. So the initial number of 1s must be reducible to zero.\n\nEach modification can change the number of 1s in several ways:\n\n- Replace two 0s: m increases by 1.\n- Replace two 1s: m decreases by 2.\n- Replace 0 and 1: m decreases by 1.\n\nSo, the problem is, can the initial m be reduced to zero via a series of these operations.\n\nBut this seems like a Diophantine equation problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal number of 1s that can be left is zero, but certain conditions must be met.\n\nLet me consider the possible changes to m:\n\nEach step can change m by:\n\n- +1 (when replacing two 0s)\n- -2 (when replacing two 1s)\n- -1 (when replacing a 0 and 1)\n\nSo, the possible changes are adding 1, subtracting 1, or subtracting 2.\n\nWait, but adding 1 complicates things because it could increase the number of 1s, making it harder to reach zero.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is to never perform a modification that increases m.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nWell, the problem allows any sequence of modifications, including those that could increase m. So the presence of such a possibility complicates the analysis.\n\nBut perhaps for certain initial m values, it's impossible to reach zero.\n\nFor example, in the third sample input where n=1, m=1, g=1:\n\nThe initial string has one 0 and one 1. Can it be transformed into all 1s?\n\nLet's see:\n\nPossible modifications:\n\n- Replace the last two (0 and 1): becomes 0. So the string is \"0\", which is all 0s. Not what we want.\n\n- Or, perhaps another approach: is there a way to merge the two into a 1?\n\nNo, because the last two are 0 and 1. According to the rules, when they are not both 0s, the replacement is 0. So, the only possible modification is to replace them with 0, resulting in a single 0.\n\nThus, the string cannot be transformed into all 1s, so the answer is zero.\n\nWhich matches the third sample.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that for g=1, the initial number of 0s must be reducible to zero through the allowed modifications.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach: for each beautiful string, check if it can be reduced to all g's. Since the number of beautiful strings can be up to C(200 choose 100), which is about 9e57, this is impractical.\n\nThus, we need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me think about the problem for g=0:\n\nWe need to reach a state where the count of 1s is zero.\n\nEach modification can change the count of 1s in the following ways:\n\n- +1: when two 0s are replaced by a 1.\n- -1: when a 0 and 1 are replaced by 0.\n- -2: when two 1s are replaced by 0.\n\nSo, the question is: can we reach zero 1s from the initial m, using any combination of these changes.\n\nBut since some changes can increase m, it's possible that even if m is small, it's impossible to reach zero.\n\nWait, but perhaps the only way to reduce m to zero is to avoid ever adding 1s.\n\nBecause adding 1s would only make it harder to reach zero.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal strategy is to never add any 1s.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\nBecause during the process, the last two characters could be 0s, leading to a modification that increases m by 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to whether the initial m can be reduced to zero without any modifications that add 1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of 0s in the initial string allows for some modifications that can avoid adding 1s.\n\nWait, for example, if the initial string ends with 0 and 0, modifying them would add a 1, increasing m. But perhaps if you modify other parts first, you can avoid that.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nThis is getting quite complex. Perhaps I should consider the problem in terms of the minimum and maximum possible m after any number of modifications.\n\nWait, but this also seems challenging.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the possible transitions.\n\nEach modification can change m by:\n\n- +1: when two 0s are replaced by a 1.\n\n- -1: when a 0 and 1 are replaced by 0.\n\n- -2: when two 1s are replaced by 0.\n\nSo, the problem is to find a path from initial m to zero, where each step is one of these changes.\n\nBut the issue is that steps can also add to m, which complicates things.\n\nBut perhaps, for the purposes of reaching zero, we can avoid any steps that add to m.\n\nIs it possible to perform all modifications that reduce m, without ever having to perform a step that increases m?\n\nI think that's the key. Because if during the process, you can always find a way to reduce m without ever increasing it, then perhaps it's possible to reach zero.\n\nSo, the question becomes: can we find a sequence of modifications that reduces m to zero, without ever having to perform a modification that increases m.\n\nHow?\n\nWell, the only way to increase m is if the last two characters are 0s, which would cause a modification that replaces them with a 1.\n\nTo avoid this, perhaps we can ensure that during the process, the last two characters are never both 0s.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis depends on the structure of the string. Without knowing the exact arrangement, it's difficult to say.\n\nBut perhaps, for the problem, the necessary condition is that the initial number of 0s is sufficient to allow for a series of modifications that can eliminate all 1s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to consider that each modification can either increase or decrease m, but the overall problem is whether it's possible to reach zero.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative Idea: Think of the problem as a graph where each node is the count of 1s (m), and edges represent possible changes (±1, ±2). We need to find if there's a path from initial m to zero.\n\nBut since each step can be any of the three possible changes, and the problem allows any number of steps, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a BFS.\n\nBut for each m, we can compute whether it's reachable from zero or not.\n\nWait, but for our problem, the initial m is given, and we need to see if zero is reachable.\n\nBut considering that steps can increase or decrease m, perhaps it's possible to reach zero from any m.\n\nBut wait, for example, initial m=2.\n\nCan we reach zero?\n\nYes:\n\n- Replace two 1s: m decreases by 2 → 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAnother example: m=3.\n\nReplace a 0 and 1: m decreases by 1 → 2.\n\nThen replace two 1s: m decreases by 2 → 0.\n\nSo yes.\n\nWhat about m=4.\n\nReplace two 1s: m=2.\n\nReplace two 1s: m=0.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about m=1.\n\nAs before, replace 0 and 1 → m=0.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about m=5.\n\nReplace 0 and 1 → m=4.\n\nReplace two 1s → m=2.\n\nReplace two 1s → m=0.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about m=6.\n\nReplace two 1s → m=4.\n\nReplace two 1s → m=2.\n\nReplace two 1s → m=0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for m even or odd, it's possible to reach zero.\n\nWait, but what about m=7.\n\nReplace 0 and 1 → m=6.\n\nReplace two 1s → m=4.\n\nReplace two 1s → m=2.\n\nReplace two 1s → m=0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, it seems that regardless of m, it's possible to reach zero by a series of modifications that avoid adding 1s.\n\nBut wait, is that always possible?\n\nBecause in each step, if you can choose to replace a pair that doesn't add 1s, then you can proceed.\n\nBut how to know whether such a pair exists in the string.\n\nAh, that's the crux.\n\nBecause the modifications depend on the last two characters, which can vary based on the string structure.\n\nSo, for example, if the string is structured such that the last two characters are always 1s, then replacing them would decrease m by 2.\n\nBut if the string is structured such that the last two are 0 and 1, replacing them would decrease m by 1.\n\nBut if the string is structured with two 0s, replacing them would increase m by 1, which is bad.\n\nSo, the ability to reduce m depends on the arrangement of the string.\n\nBut since the problem counts all possible beautiful strings, perhaps for some strings it's possible to reach the desired final state, while for others it's not.\n\nBut this complicates the problem further.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the purpose of counting, the only thing that matters is the initial n and m, and the value of g.\n\nBecause the beautiful strings are all possible binary strings with exactly n 0s and m 1s.\n\nSo, the question is, among all such strings, how many can be transformed into a string of all g's.\n\nSo, perhaps the count depends solely on n, m, and g, not on the specific arrangement of the string.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem can be solved by finding a condition based on n, m, and g, and then computing the number of such strings that meet the condition.\n\nSo, what is this condition?\n\nLet me think about the case when g=0.\n\nWe need to have a way to eliminate all 1s.\n\nBut the way modifications work, this is possible if the initial number of 1s can be reduced to zero through the allowed operations.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the number of 1s must be ≤ the number of 0s plus something.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nWait, let's think about the minimal number of 1s that can be present after all possible modifications.\n\nEach modification can reduce the number of 1s by 1 or 2.\n\nBut when you have a 0 and 1, you can reduce by 1.\n\nWhen you have two 1s, you can reduce by 2.\n\nBut if you have two 0s, you can increase the 1s count by 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is whether it's possible to perform modifications that never touch the 0s, thus avoiding any increases in 1s.\n\nBut that's only possible if the last two characters are not both 0s.\n\nBut in a beautiful string, the arrangement can vary.\n\nSo, perhaps the condition is that the number of 0s is sufficient to allow for a series of modifications that can eliminate all 1s without ever needing to merge two 0s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering that any beautiful string can be transformed into all g's if and only if:\n\nFor g=0: m is even or something like that.\n\nBut earlier examples show that m can be any number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to consider the minimal number of 0s required.\n\nWait, perhaps for g=0, the number of 0s must be ≥ the number of 1s.\n\nBecause, each time you replace a 0 and 1, you need a 0 to pair with a 1.\n\nIf there are more 1s than 0s, then perhaps it's impossible to eliminate all 1s.\n\nWait, let's test this hypothesis.\n\nSample 1: n=1, m=1 → n >= m (1 >=1). So possible.\n\nSample 2: n=2, m=2 → n >= m (2 >=2). Possible.\n\nSample 3: n=1, m=1, g=1 → n < m? No, n=m=1. So not possible.\n\nHmm, that seems to fit.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=3.\n\nCan we eliminate all 1s?\n\nWe have n=2, m=3.\n\nWe need to reduce m to zero.\n\nBut n=2, m=3: n < m.\n\nSo according to the hypothesis, it's impossible.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nInitial m=3.\n\nWe can replace a 0 and 1, but to do that, the last two must be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string consisting entirely of a specific character (either '0' or '1') after performing a series of modifications. Each modification replaces the last two characters with one character based on specific rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**:\n   - A beautiful string consists of exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones.\n   - The goal is to determine if each beautiful string can be modified such that it becomes a string of all zeros (if `g=0`) or all ones (if `g=1`).\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - For `g=0`, we need to ensure that the number of ones (`m`) can be reduced to zero through modifications.\n   - For `g=1`, we need to ensure that the number of zeros (`n`) can be reduced to zero through modifications.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   - We use dynamic programming to track the number of ways to reduce the count of non-`g` characters to zero.\n   - The state `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reduce `i` zeros and `j` ones to zero.\n\n4. **Transition**:\n   - If `g=0`, we can replace pairs of zeros or a zero and a one, which reduces the count of ones.\n   - If `g=1`, we can replace pairs of ones or a one and a zero, which reduces the count of zeros.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**:\n   - Since the result can be large, we take results modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nif g == 0:\n    # Need to reach all zeros.
