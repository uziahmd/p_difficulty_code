    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting something over a certain set of trees. The trees are edge-weighted with each edge being either 1 or -1. We need to find the sum of d(1,n) for all \"good\" trees.\n\nWait, what's a good tree? Oh right, a good tree is one where for every vertex i, the product of the edge weights adjacent to it is -1. So for each node, the number of -1 edges connected to it must be odd because the product is -1. Because each edge contributes a factor of either 1 or -1. If the product is -1, that means there's an odd number of -1s around the node.\n\nHmm, okay. So each node must have an odd number of -1 edges attached to it.\n\nI remember that in graph theory, trees are connected and have exactly n-1 edges. So for each node in the tree, the degree is at least 1, but here we're talking about the edges' weights, not their existence.\n\nSo the first thing I need to figure out is: under what conditions does a tree become \"good\"? And then, for all such good trees, calculate the sum of d(1,n), which is the sum of the edge weights along the unique path from node 1 to node n.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nEach edge is either 1 or -1. So each tree has 2^{n-1} possible weight assignments. But only a subset of these are good trees.\n\nOur goal is to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nBut since the number of good trees could be huge, we can't enumerate them. So we need a mathematical approach.\n\nLet me consider small cases to find a pattern.\n\nCase n=1: There's only one tree, and the sum is 0 because d(1,1) is 0. So the output is 0.\n\nCase n=2: The tree has two nodes connected by one edge. For the tree to be good, each node must have an odd number of -1 edges. Let's see:\n\nEach node has exactly one edge. So the product is the weight of that edge. So for both nodes, the product must be -1. That means the edge must be -1. So there's only one good tree. The path from 1 to 2 is the same edge, so d(1,2) is -1. Sum is -1 mod 998244353, which is 998244352 as per the example.\n\nNow, n=4: According to the sample, there are 16 good trees. So the sum of d(1,4) across all 16 is -10, which modulo 998244353 is 998244343.\n\nHmm. So how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the structure of a good tree. For each node, the number of -1 edges is odd. So each node has an odd degree in terms of the weight -1.\n\nWait, in a tree, each node has some edges connected to it. Each edge contributes to the product of that node. So if a node has k edges, each with weight either 1 or -1, the product is (-1)^m, where m is the number of -1 edges. For the product to be -1, m must be odd.\n\nSo each node must have an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nIn a tree, the number of edges is n-1. So the sum of the degrees (in terms of edges, not the node's degree in the tree sense) is 2*(n-1). Because each edge contributes to two nodes.\n\nWait, but each edge is counted twice, once for each endpoint.\n\nSo the sum of m_i across all nodes is 2*(n-1), where m_i is the number of -1 edges adjacent to node i.\n\nBut each m_i is odd. So the sum of m_i is the sum of (2k+1) for each node. So sum m_i = n + sum (even numbers) because each m_i is 2k+1.\n\nWait, wait: each m_i is odd, so m_i = 2a_i + 1 for some integer a_i >=0.\n\nThen sum m_i = sum (2a_i +1 ) = 2 sum a_i + n.\n\nBut sum m_i is also equal to 2*(n-1) because each edge contributes to two nodes.\n\nSo 2 sum a_i + n = 2(n-1).\n\nSimplify: 2 sum a_i = 2n - 2 - n = n-2.\n\nBut n is at least 1. Let's see:\n\nIf n=2: 2 sum a_i = 0 → sum a_i=0. Which is okay because there's one edge, and m_1 + m_2 = 2 → each is 1, which is odd.\n\nWait, but for n=2, 2 sum a_i = 2*1-2=0. So yes.\n\nFor n=4: 2 sum a_i =4-2=2 → sum a_i=1.\n\nSo sum a_i=1. So one of the nodes will have m_i=3, others can vary, but overall, the sum of a_i must be 1.\n\nBut wait, for n=4, each node must have an odd number of -1 edges. So for four nodes, each m_i is odd. Their sum is 2*(4-1)=6. So 6 must equal the sum of four odd numbers.\n\nBut four odds add up to an even number. Because each odd is 2k+1, so four odds sum to 2*(sum k) +4, which is even.\n\nSo 6 is even, so that's okay.\n\nSo for n=4, the sum of m_i is 6.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo general condition: for a tree to be good, each node must have an odd number of -1 edges, and the sum of these counts is 2(n-1).\n\nThis must hold for any n ≥1.\n\nSo how can we count the number of such trees?\n\nWait, perhaps each node's parity is fixed. Since each m_i is odd, and sum m_i = 2(n-1), which is even, because 2*(n-1) is obviously even.\n\nBecause each m_i is odd, the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even. So for n nodes, if n is even, the sum is even; if n is odd, the sum would be n * (odd) → but wait, no. Wait, the sum of an even number of odd terms is even, but if n is odd, then the number of terms is odd.\n\nWait, for n nodes, each m_i is odd. The sum is n terms of odd, which is n mod 2. So 2(n-1) is the sum, which must be congruent to n mod 2.\n\nSo 2(n-1) ≡ n mod 2.\n\nBut 2(n-1) is always even, so n must be even.\n\nWait, 2(n-1) is even, so n can be any.\n\nWait, let me see: 2(n-1) is even for any n.\n\nBut the sum of m_i is 2(n-1), which is even.\n\nBut the sum of m_i is the sum of n odd numbers. So the sum is n mod 2.\n\nBecause each odd number is 1 mod 2, so sum is n mod 2.\n\nSo 2(n-1) must be congruent to n mod 2.\n\nSo 2(n-1) ≡ n mod 2.\n\nBut 2(n-1) is 0 mod 2 regardless of n. So n must be even.\n\nSo for the sum to be even, n must be even.\n\nWait, because sum of m_i is 2(n-1), which is even, and sum of m_i is n mod 2.\n\nThus, n mod 2 must be 0.\n\nSo for the tree to be good, n must be even. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nWait, that can't be right because for n=1, it's allowed, but n=1 is odd. But for n=1, the tree has zero edges, so each node (just node 1) has zero edges, which is even. So zero edges, but the product is 1 (since product over zero terms is 1). But the condition requires the product to be -1. So for n=1, there are zero edges, so the product is 1. So it's not good.\n\nSo for n=1, the tree is not good. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo for n=2, which is even, it works.\n\nWait, but what about n=3?\n\nFor n=3, the sum of m_i must be 4 (since 2*(3-1)=4). But 3 nodes, each m_i is odd. So sum is 3 mod 2 =1. But 4 mod 2 is 0. So 1≠0. Thus, it's impossible. So for n=3, no good trees exist.\n\nSo for n even, it's possible. For n odd, it's not possible except when n=1, but in that case, it's also not possible.\n\nWait, but n=1: the tree has zero edges. So for node 1, the product is 1. So the condition is not met. So no good trees for n=1.\n\nSo the conclusion is: a good tree exists only when n is even, except for n=1, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait n=4 is even and works. What about n=5?\n\nWait for n=5, the sum of m_i is 8. The sum of five odd numbers is 5 mod 2 =1, but 8 mod 2 is 0. So 1≠0. So no good trees exist for n=5.\n\nSo for n to have any good trees, n must be even. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to solving for even n.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test n=4 again.\n\nYes, according to the sample, n=4 has 16 good trees.\n\nSo now, the problem is: for even n, compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nWhat's d(1,n)? It's the sum of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n.\n\nWe need to find the total of this sum across all good trees.\n\nHmm. So perhaps for each edge on the path, we can determine how many times it contributes +1 or -1, multiply by the number of good trees where that edge is part of the path, etc.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as a linear algebra problem over GF(2). Because each condition imposes a constraint on the edges.\n\nEach edge is a variable that can be 1 or -1. But for the purposes of constraints, perhaps we can model the product conditions as linear equations over GF(2), treating 1 as 0 and -1 as 1. Because multiplying two -1s gives 1, which is 0 in GF(2).\n\nWait, maybe that's a way to model the constraints.\n\nLet me see: for each node i, the product of its adjacent edges is -1. So the product is -1, which is equivalent to 1 in GF(2) if we represent 1 as 0 and -1 as 1. Or maybe it's better to represent 1 as 1 and -1 as 0 in GF(2).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the product as exponents. Let me think:\n\nEach edge can be represented as a variable x_e ∈ {1, -1}. For each node i, the product of x_e for all edges e incident to i must be -1.\n\nTaking logarithms, perhaps in exponents mod 2. Because the product is -1, which is (-1)^1. So the sum of the exponents for the edges incident to i must be 1 mod 2.\n\nSo for each node i, sum_{e ∈ E(i)} exponent(e) ≡ 1 mod 2, where exponent(e) is 0 if x_e=1, and 1 if x_e=-1.\n\nSo this is a system of linear equations over GF(2), where each equation corresponds to a node, and variables are the exponents of the edges.\n\nThe number of variables is n-1 (the edges), and the number of equations is n.\n\nBut wait, the system might be overdetermined. However, for n even, the system may be consistent.\n\nWait, let's see: the sum of all equations (summing the left-hand side) is equal to the sum of 1 for each node, which is n. But the sum of all variables is 2 times the sum of variables in GF(2), since each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint). So the sum of all left-hand sides is 0 mod 2 because 2 is 0 in GF(2).\n\nSo the sum of the right-hand sides must also be 0 mod 2. So n must be even.\n\nWhich aligns with our earlier conclusion that n must be even for a solution to exist.\n\nSo for even n, the system has a solution space of dimension (number of variables) - rank of the system.\n\nBut what is the rank of this system?\n\nLet's consider the system: for each node i, sum_{edges e incident to i} x_e = 1 mod 2.\n\nThis is similar to the Laplacian matrix of the tree, but over GF(2).\n\nWait, but for a tree, which is a connected acyclic graph, the Laplacian has a certain structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the system has a certain dependency. For example, the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2, as n is even.\n\nSo the system has rank (n-1) -1 = n-2.\n\nSo the solution space has dimension 1.\n\nWait, for a connected graph, the Laplacian has rank n-1, so the kernel has dimension 1. But I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the system for the tree, the equations are independent except for the sum constraint. So the system's rank is n-1, but since the sum is 0, the actual rank is n-2. So the solution space has dimension 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution space is affine, meaning that all solutions can be expressed as a particular solution plus a vector in the kernel.\n\nSo the number of solutions is 2^d, where d is the dimension of the solution space.\n\nEarlier, for n=2, the solution space has one solution. So d=0, since 2^0=1.\n\nWait, for n=2, the system has two equations:\n\nx_1 = 1 (edge between 1 and 2)\nx_1 = 1 (for node 2)\n\nSo the system is consistent, but both equations are the same. So the solution is x_1=1. So the solution space has dimension 0.\n\nSo for n=2, the solution is unique, hence the number of good trees is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the number of good trees is 2^k, where k is the dimension of the solution space.\n\nFor n=4, the solution space has dimension 1, so 2^1=2 possibilities? But the sample says there are 16 good trees. Hmm, perhaps my reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, no. Because for each edge, the variable is whether it's 1 or -1. So the solution space for the exponents (variables in GF(2)) is 2^k, but each solution corresponds to a specific assignment of 1/-1 to the edges, but the exponents determine the sign.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of good trees is 2^{d}, where d is the dimension of the solution space of the system.\n\nWait, for n=4, the solution space has dimension 1, so 2^1=2 possible exponent configurations. But each configuration leads to a certain number of good trees.\n\nWait, no. Because each edge can be either 1 or -1, but subject to the constraints. So each solution in the exponent variables (over GF(2)) corresponds to a particular assignment of signs.\n\nSo for each solution in the exponents, the number of ways to assign signs is 2^{n-1 - (n-2)} }= 2^1=2. Because the solution space has dimension 1, so the number of free variables is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me rephrase.\n\nEach edge's sign is determined by the exponents variables. So for each solution to the system, the exponents variables (mod 2) give us the signs of the edges. So the number of possible assignments is 2^{n-1}, but constrained by the system.\n\nWait, no. Because each solution to the system represents a valid assignment of signs. So the number of good trees is equal to the number of solutions to the system.\n\nBut how many solutions are there?\n\nThe system is a linear system over GF(2), and its solution space has dimension k, where k is the number of free variables.\n\nSo the number of solutions is 2^k.\n\nSo for n=2, the solution space has k=0, so 1 solution.\n\nFor n=4, the solution space has k=1, so 2 solutions.\n\nBut the sample says for n=4, there are 16 good trees. So perhaps each solution corresponds to multiple trees.\n\nWait, perhaps each solution in the exponent variables (each vector in the solution space) corresponds to a certain number of edge sign assignments.\n\nWait, no, because the exponent variables uniquely determine the signs. Because x_e is either 0 or 1, representing 1 or -1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let's clarify:\n\nEach edge is assigned a value of 1 or -1.\n\nThe product of edges around each node must be -1.\n\nSo, for each node, the product is (-1)^{m_i}, where m_i is the number of edges with -1 adjacent to it.\n\nWe require this product to be -1, so m_i must be odd.\n\nSo the condition is that for each node, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it is odd.\n\nEach edge is either 1 or -1. So the problem is to assign each edge a value in {1, -1}, such that for each node, the count of -1 edges is odd.\n\nSo, the problem can be viewed as a system of linear equations over GF(2), where each variable is 0 (edge is 1) or 1 (edge is -1). Then, for each node i, the sum of variables (mod 2) must be 1.\n\nThe system is thus:\n\nFor each node i, sum_{e ∈ E(i)} x_e ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nThis is a linear system, and the variables are the edges.\n\nThe number of variables is n-1, and the number of equations is n.\n\nBut as before, the sum of all equations is n ≡ 0 mod 2, since n is even.\n\nSo the system is solvable only when n is even.\n\nThe number of solutions depends on the rank of the system.\n\nThe system's rank is (n-1) - 1 = n-2, because the sum of all equations is zero in GF(2).\n\nWait, perhaps. Because the sum of all equations is the sum of 1 for each node, which is n. Since n is even, the sum is 0 mod 2.\n\nSo, the system has a solution, and the rank is (n-1) - 1 = n-2.\n\nThus, the solution space has dimension 1.\n\nSo the number of solutions is 2^1 = 2.\n\nWait, but for n=4, the sample says there are 16 good trees.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the number of solutions is more than 2.\n\nSo perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is 2^{n-1} multiplied by some factor based on the system.\n\nWait, no. Because the system is over-constrained. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the analysis.\n\nWait, another way: for a tree, the edges form a spanning tree. So for each edge, it's either present or not. Wait, no, in this problem, all edges are present, but each has a weight of 1 or -1.\n\nWait, no, the tree structure is fixed. Only the edge weights vary.\n\nSo the structure of the tree is fixed as any possible tree, and the edge weights are assigned as 1 or -1.\n\nBut the problem is about all possible trees (labeled trees) with edge weights as 1 or -1, and the sum over all good trees.\n\nWait, Cayley's formula says that the number of labeled trees on n nodes is n^{n-2}.\n\nEach edge can be assigned a weight of 1 or -1, giving 2^{n-1} possible weightings.\n\nSo the total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}.\n\nBut among these, only the ones that are \"good\" contribute to the sum.\n\nSo the question is, for each tree (structure) and each possible edge weighting, whether the weighting is good.\n\nBut it's difficult to handle all possible trees and their weightings.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the sum can be computed by considering each edge's contribution to the path from 1 to n, and then determining how often it appears in the path across all good trees.\n\nWait, but the path varies depending on the tree structure and the edge weights. So perhaps it's too complex.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible edge in the tree, determine how many times it lies on the path from 1 to n, across all good trees, and what is the expected contribution of that edge to the sum d(1,n).\n\nBut again, the problem is that the trees vary in structure, which complicates things.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed by considering each possible edge and the probability that it is part of the path from 1 to n in a random good tree.\n\nBut again, considering the randomness may not help directly.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps model the problem using linear algebra, considering each edge's contribution.\n\nWait, another observation: the sum over all good trees of d(1,n) is equal to the sum over all good trees of the sum of edges on the path from 1 to n multiplied by their weights.\n\nSo, for each edge e, let’s compute the total number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the sum of e's weight in those trees.\n\nBut the weight of e is either 1 or -1, depending on the assignment.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the contribution to the total sum is the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the average weight of e in those trees.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the contribution is the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by the probability that e's weight is 1 or -1 in such trees.\n\nWait, but the problem is to sum the weights along the path. So for each tree, the path's weight is the sum of the edge weights on that path. So the total sum is the sum over all good trees of the sum of the weights of the edges on their respective paths.\n\nSo, the sum can be rewritten as the sum for each edge e, of the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the weight of e in those trees.\n\nBut the weight of e in a good tree is either 1 or -1, so it's equivalent to adding either 1 or -1 for each occurrence.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the contribution is (number of good trees where e is on the path) × (average weight of e in those trees).\n\nBut how to find the average weight.\n\nWait, but for each edge e, in the set of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, the weight of e can be 1 or -1. So the average is (number of times e is 1) minus (number of times e is -1) in those trees.\n\nBut perhaps there's a symmetry.\n\nWait, considering that for each edge e, in the set of good trees where e is on the path, the number of times e is 1 is equal to the number of times it is -1. So the average is 0.\n\nBut that's not necessarily true. Because the choice of e's weight may be influenced by the constraints of the good tree.\n\nWait, but the constraints are about the parities of the edges around each node. So perhaps for each edge e, the weight is determined by other constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each edge's weight is equally likely to be 1 or -1 in the good trees.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path and e is 1 is equal to the number where it's on the path and e is -1. So the average is 0, leading to no contribution from e.\n\nBut in the sample for n=2, the edge is always -1, so it contributes -1.\n\nSo that idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees where e is on the path, multiplied by the number of good assignments of edge weights that satisfy the constraints.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAnother angle: since the problem is about the sum over all good trees of d(1,n), perhaps we can model this as a linear function over the edges, and use properties of expectation or linearity of summation.\n\nWait, the sum can be written as the sum over all good trees T of sum_{e in path(T)} w(e), where w(e) is the weight of edge e in T.\n\nSo this is equal to the sum over all edges e of the sum over all good trees T where e is in the path from 1 to n of w(e).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing for each edge e, the sum of w(e) over all good trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nBut since each edge's weight is determined by the constraints, perhaps we can find this sum.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, let's fix an edge e. Let's say e connects u and v. Let's compute the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, and the weight of e is 1, plus the number where it's on the path and the weight is -1.\n\nThen the total contribution of e is (count_1 - count_-1).\n\nBut perhaps there's a symmetry or a way to find this difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path and w(e)=1 is equal to the number where e is on the path and w(e)=-1, making the contribution zero.\n\nBut in the sample for n=2, it's not the case.\n\nWait, for n=2, the edge is on the path, and it's always -1. So the contribution is -1.\n\nSo perhaps the symmetry doesn't hold.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe I should look for another way.\n\nWait, let me think about the problem in terms of linear algebra. The constraints form a system of linear equations over GF(2), and the solution space is a subspace of the edge variables.\n\nEach solution corresponds to a certain assignment of edge weights. So the number of good trees is equal to the number of solutions to the system.\n\nWait, but each solution is a vector indicating the exponents (0 or 1) for each edge. Each 1 represents a -1 weight.\n\nSo for each solution, the edges are assigned 1 or -1 according to the solution. So each solution corresponds to exactly one edge-weighted tree.\n\nSo the number of good trees is equal to the number of solutions to the system.\n\nWhich, as earlier analysis, for even n, is 2^{n-2}.\n\nWait, no. Earlier analysis suggested that for even n, the system has a solution space of dimension 1, so the number of solutions is 2^1=2.\n\nBut for n=4, the sample shows 16 good trees, which is 2^4=16. So perhaps my earlier analysis is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution space is larger.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rank calculation.\n\nLet me reconsider the system.\n\nThe system is:\n\nFor each node i, sum_{e ∈ E(i)} x_e ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nThe variables are x_e, for e in edges.\n\nThe system has n equations and n-1 variables.\n\nBut the sum of all equations is n ≡ 0 mod 2, since n is even.\n\nSo the system is consistent, but the rank is n-1 -1 =n-2.\n\nSo the solution space is a coset of the kernel, which has dimension 1.\n\nSo the number of solutions is 2^1=2.\n\nBut for n=4, the sample shows 16=2^4 solutions.\n\nSo that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps the system's rank is different.\n\nWait, perhaps for a tree, the system is of rank n-2. So the solution space has dimension 1.\n\nSo for n=4, the solution space has 2 solutions. But the sample says 16, which is 2^4.\n\nSo this suggests that the solution space is not 2^1=2, but 2^something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking of the problem differently. Because the problem allows any tree structure, not just a single tree.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem considers all possible edge-weighted trees, which are all possible trees (as per Cayley's formula) multiplied by all possible edge weight assignments.\n\nSo each solution to the system is a specific edge-weighting of a specific tree. So for each tree, the edge assignments that make it good are a subset of 2^{n-1} possibilities.\n\nBut for each tree, the number of good assignments depends on whether the system is satisfied.\n\nWait, but the system is the same for all trees, as it's based on the nodes' constraints.\n\nWait, no. Because each tree has a different structure, the equations change. So for each tree T, the system is different.\n\nWait, but the system is defined per the tree's structure. So for each tree, the equations are different, depending on which nodes are connected by which edges.\n\nSo the problem is more complicated because for each tree, the system is different.\n\nThis complicates the analysis, as each tree may have a different number of solutions.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach of trying to model the problem with linear algebra is not feasible because the system varies per tree.\n\nHmm, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the path from 1 to n.\n\nEach edge on this path contributes its weight to d(1,n). So the sum over all good trees is the sum of all such contributions.\n\nBut how often does each edge lie on the path, and what is the average weight in those cases.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge, the number of good trees where it's on the path is proportional to some property of the tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into considering each possible edge and determining how it contributes to the sum.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the sum over all good trees is zero for even n≥4.\n\nBut the sample for n=4 shows a non-zero sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is zero for even n>2, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for even n, the sum is equal to zero, but that contradicts the sample.\n\nWait, in the sample for n=4, the sum is -10, which mod 998244353 is 998244343.\n\nSo the sum is not zero.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum is equal to (-1)^{(n/2)-1} * 2^{n-2}.\n\nBut for n=2, that's (-1)^0 * 2^0=1. Sum is -1, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is (-1)^{(n-1)/2} * something, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum is zero for n≥4 and even.\n\nBut for n=4, it's -10, which isn't zero.\n\nSo perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the sum can be computed using combinatorial methods, considering the structure of the tree and the constraints.\n\nEach good tree must satisfy that each node has an odd number of -1 edges. So the sum of all the -1 edges around each node is odd.\n\nBut perhaps the parity of the edges affects the structure of the tree in a way that allows us to compute the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees is zero for even n>2.\n\nBut the sample for n=4 is -10, which isn't zero.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is equal to the number of good trees multiplied by the average value of d(1,n).\n\nBut without knowing the average, this doesn't help.\n\nWait, for each tree, the path from 1 to n is unique. So the sum is the sum of all these paths' weights.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the sum can be expressed as a product of certain factors based on the number of edges in the path.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps each edge on the path contributes a certain amount, and the total sum is the product of these contributions.\n\nBut again, not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be computed using dynamic programming, but for n up to 5e5, that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should look for a generating function approach.\n\nWait, considering that each edge can be either 1 or -1, and that the constraints are on the nodes' products, perhaps the problem can be modeled using generating functions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: since the constraints impose that each node has an odd number of -1 edges, perhaps the edges can be considered as forming a cycle basis or something similar.\n\nBut I'm not familiar enough with that to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed as a function of n, possibly involving powers of 2 and (-1).\n\nBut without more insight, it's challenging.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a pattern in small cases.\n\nn=2: 1 good tree, sum is -1.\n\nn=4: 16 good trees, sum is -10.\n\nn=6: perhaps we can compute it manually or find a pattern.\n\nBut n=6 is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum for even n is (-1)^{n/2} * 2^{n-2}.\n\nBut for n=2, that would be 1 * 2^{0}=1, but the sum is -1.\n\nNope.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is (n choose n-1) * something.\n\nNot sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum can be expressed as 2^{n-2} multiplied by (-1)^{k}, where k is the number of edges in the path.\n\nBut that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum is zero for all even n except n=2.\n\nBut the sample for n=4 is non-zero.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me consider that each edge e is on the path from 1 to n in a certain number of good trees. For each such tree, e contributes either 1 or -1.\n\nSo the total contribution of e is the number of good trees where e is on the path and e is 1, minus the number where it's on the path and e is -1.\n\nSo the net contribution is (A_e - B_e), where A_e is the count of good trees where e is on the path and e=1, and B_e is the same for e=-1.\n\nSo the total sum is the sum over all edges e of (A_e - B_e).\n\nBut how to compute A_e and B_e.\n\nAssuming that for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path and e=1 is equal to the number where it's on the path and e=-1. Then the contribution is zero.\n\nBut for n=2, it's not the case.\n\nSo perhaps this is not generally true.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path is equal to C_e, and the weight of e is equally likely to be 1 or -1 in those trees. So the contribution is C_e * (1 - 1) = 0.\n\nBut again, for n=2, this is not the case.\n\nSo perhaps this approach won't work.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be computed as follows:\n\nFor each good tree, the path from 1 to n is a certain collection of edges. The sum of their weights is d(1,n).\n\nSo the total sum is the sum over all good trees of the sum of their edge weights on the path.\n\nBut this can be rewritten as the sum over all edges e of the number of good trees where e is on the path, multiplied by the weight of e in those trees.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path, and the sum of the weights of e in those trees.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the weight of e is determined by the constraints. For each edge e, in the good trees where e is on the path, the weight of e is determined by the other edges in the tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the weight of e can be considered as a Bernoulli random variable that is 1 or -1, with some probability, in those trees.\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the number of good trees is 2^{n-2},",
