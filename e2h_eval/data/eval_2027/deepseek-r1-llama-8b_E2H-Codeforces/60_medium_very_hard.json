Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$)Â â€” the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code and counting certain substrings after each modification of a string S. Hmm, the input is a series of '0's and '1's being added one by one. After each addition, I need to compute how many non-empty sequences of English letters are represented by some substring of the current S.\n\nWait, right. Each letter in the alphabet has a unique Morse code string of length 1-4, except for four bad strings that don't correspond to any letter. So any substring of S that forms one of these good Morse codes contributes to the count.\n\nSo, for example, if S is \"111\", the substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\". All are valid, so the count is 3 (each single letter) + 2 (overlaps like \"TT\" and \"TM\") but wait no, the problem says all possible substrings that form a valid Morse code. So each substring is considered as a possible Morse code letter.\n\nWait, but each substring must represent a valid Morse code string. So for each position in S, I can look at all possible substrings starting or ending there, but only those that form a valid Morse code contribute to the count.\n\nBut wait, more precisely: for every possible substring of S (all possible lengths from 1 to 4), check if it's a valid Morse code string (i.e., not one of the four bad ones). If it is, then it represents a letter, so we count it.\n\nBut the question is, after each modification, how many such substrings exist.\n\nThis sounds computationally heavy if done naively because for each step m, we could have up to O(m^2) substrings to check, which would be too slow for m up to 3000.\n\nHmm. So I need a dynamic approach that efficiently tracks the number of valid substrings as each character is added.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Maybe using a dynamic programming approach where, for each position i, we track the number of valid substrings ending at i.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can keep track of all possible valid substrings as they are built incrementally.\n\nWait, let's consider that each time a new character is added (let's say c), it can form new substrings with the previous characters. For example, if the current string is s_1 s_2 ... s_n, adding s_{n+1} creates new substrings ending at n+1 of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4 (if n+1 >=4).\n\nEach of these new substrings needs to be checked if they are valid Morse codes. If they are, then they add to the total count.\n\nBut for each new character, how do we efficiently find all the possible valid substrings ending at that character?\n\nAnother approach: for each position, keep track of all possible substrings ending at that position that are valid. Then, for each new character, we can build upon the previous state.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this with a DP table where dp[i] represents the number of valid substrings ending exactly at position i.\n\nThen, the total count is the sum of dp[1] + dp[2] + ... + dp[m].\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing dp[i] for each i, and then keeping a running sum.\n\nHow to compute dp[i]? For each i, we can look back 1, 2, 3, 4 positions and see if the substring from i-k to i (where k ranges from 1 to min(i,4)) is a valid Morse code. If yes, then add 1 to dp[i] for each such k.\n\nWait, but checking all possible substrings ending at i of length up to 4 may be manageable since for each i, it's only up to 4 steps back.\n\nSo for each new character, for each possible k in 1..4, we check the substring ending at i with length k. If that substring is a valid Morse code, then dp[i] += 1.\n\nBut we need to make sure that k doesn't exceed the current length of the string minus 1.\n\nWait, but when building the string incrementally, for each new character, we can check all possible k=1,2,3,4 (but ensuring that the substring is long enough).\n\nSo, for example, when the string has length 5, adding the sixth character can form substrings of length 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Wait, no, because each substring can't be longer than 4. So for each new character, the maximum substring length to consider is 4.\n\nSo for each new character, we look back up to 4 steps:\n\nFor k=1: just the new character.\n\nk=2: new and previous.\n\nk=3: new, prev two, etc.\n\nk=4: new, prev three, etc.\n\nEach of these substrings must be checked if they are in the set of valid Morse codes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute a set containing all valid Morse code strings (excluding the four invalid ones mentioned).\n\n- For each step, append a new character to S.\n\n- For this new character, check the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters (if available) to form substrings of length 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n- For each such substring, if it's in the valid set, add 1 to dp[i], where i is the current position.\n\n- Sum all dp's to get the total count.\n\nWait, but the initial string starts empty, and each step appends a character, so the indices are 1-based? Or 0-based? Well, in code, it's easier to use 0-based, but let's think in terms of 1-based.\n\nSo for each new character, say at position i, we look back 1,2,3,4 positions (but ensuring that i - k >= 0), and for each k, extract the substring s[i-k+1 ... i], and check if it's in the valid set.\n\nIf yes, then add 1 to dp[i].\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because for each k, the substring is from i-k to i, inclusive. So the length is k.\n\nWait, no, for k=1: substring is s[i], length 1.\n\nFor k=2: substring is s[i-1], s[i], length 2.\n\nSo for each i, we can loop k from 1 to min(4, i+1). Because for i=0, k can be 1; for i=1, k can be 1 and 2, etc.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprecompute valid_codes = {'0', '00', '000', '0000', ..., all valid Morse codes except the four bad ones}.\n\nWait, but what exactly are the valid codes? The problem states that there are 26 letters, each with a unique code of 1-4 length. And four strings (0011, 0101, 1110, 1111) are invalid. So the valid set consists of all 30 possible 1-4-length binary strings except these four.\n\nSo first, I need to generate all possible 1-4-length binary strings, excluding those four.\n\nYes. So the first step is to generate all possible valid codes.\n\nSo, for k from 1 to 4:\n\n   for all combinations of 0 and 1 of length k:\n\n       if it's not one of the four bad codes, add to valid_codes.\n\nOnce I have this set, I can proceed.\n\nNow, for each step, I process the new character.\n\nLet's say the current string is s, and I append a new character c.\n\nThen, for each possible k in 1..4:\n\n   start = len(s) - k\n\n   if start >=0:\n\n       substring = s[start:start+k]\n\n       if substring in valid_codes:\n\n           dp[i] +=1\n\nWait, but when appending c, the new length is len(s)+1, which is i+1 (if 0-based). So for each k, we can check if the last k characters (including the new c) form a valid code.\n\nSo for each new character, for k=1,2,3,4:\n\n   if the current length of s is >=k:\n\n       substring is s[-k:]\n\n       if substring is in valid_codes:\n\n           dp +=1\n\nWait, but the current length is len(s) before adding the new character. So when we add the new character, len(s) becomes len(s)+1, and for each k up to 4, we can check if len(s) >= k.\n\nWait, no. Because when you add the new character, the new string has len(s)+1, so for k=1, you can always take the last 1 character.\n\nFor k=2, you can take last 2 characters only if the new string's length is at least 2.\n\nSimilarly for k=3 and 4.\n\nSo for each new character, after appending it, for k in 1 to 4:\n\n   if len(s) >=k:\n\n       substr = s[-k:]\n\n       if substr in valid_codes:\n\n           add 1 to the current dp contribution.\n\nWait, but the dp array is supposed to track the number of valid substrings ending at each position. So perhaps for each new character, the new dp[i] is the sum of all valid substrings ending at i, which are of lengths 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize a list dp, where dp[i] is the number of valid substrings ending at position i (0-based or 1-based, depends on the implementation).\n\nInitially, dp is empty.\n\nFor each new character c in the input:\n\n   append c to s.\n\n   current position is len(s)-1.\n\n   for k in 1..4:\n\n       if len(s) >=k:\n\n           substr = s[-k:]\n\n           if substr in valid_codes:\n\n               dp.append(1)\n\n   else:\n\n       do nothing.\n\nWait, but no, because if len(s) is less than k, you can't have a substring of length k. So for each k, check if len(s) >=k before considering.\n\nWait, but for the current step, the len(s) is after appending c. So for k=1, len(s) is at least 1, so substr is c.\n\nFor k=2, len(s) must be >=2, which is true if len(s) was at least 1 before appending, but wait, no: if len(s) was 1, after appending, it's 2, so k=2 is allowed.\n\nSo for each step, after appending c, for k in 1 to 4:\n\n   if len(s) >=k:\n\n       substr = s[-k:]\n\n       if substr in valid_codes:\n\n           current_dp_contribution +=1\n\n   else:\n\n       continue\n\nSo, for each new character, we can collect all the valid substrings ending at that position, and add them to a temporary variable, then add that to the total sum.\n\nBut also, for the next steps, these substrings might contribute to further substrings. But wait, no: each substring is considered as a separate entity. So for each new character, the new substrings are those that end with it, and have length up to 4.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n- Maintain a set of all valid Morse codes.\n\n- Maintain a list dp, where dp[i] is the number of valid substrings ending at position i.\n\n- Also, maintain a variable total, which is the sum of all dp[i] up to the current step.\n\nBut wait, no. Because each step adds a new character, which can create new valid substrings ending at that character. So for each step, the new contribution to the total is the number of such new valid substrings.\n\nThus, the total is the sum of all dp[i] up to the current step.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor each new character:\n\n   append it to s.\n\n   compute the new_dp_contribution: 0.\n\n   for k in 1..4:\n\n       if len(s) >=k:\n\n           substr = s[-k:]\n\n           if substr in valid_codes:\n\n               new_dp_contribution +=1\n\n   add new_dp_contribution to total.\n\n   output total modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when you have a longer substring, it includes previous valid substrings. For example, if the previous characters had a substring of length 2, and the new character makes a substring of length 3, which is valid. So the new substring is a longer version, but it's a new substring, so it should be counted.\n\nBut in this approach, for each new character, we are only looking at the substrings that end at that character, regardless of their length. So each time, the new_dp_contribution is the number of new valid substrings ending at the current position.\n\nSo for each step, the total increases by new_dp_contribution.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for each step, we are adding all the possible substrings that end at the current character, which can be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4, provided they are valid.\n\nThus, the approach is to, for each new character, check all possible k (1-4) substrings ending at that character, and if they are valid, add 1 to the current contribution.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\n1. Precompute the valid Morse code strings.\n\n   How to generate them:\n\n   The problem says there are 26 letters, each with a unique Morse code of length 1-4. So the total number is 26 letters, but the total possible strings is 30 (as per the note). So the four bad strings are 0011, 0101, 1110, 1111.\n\n   So the valid codes are all 30 possible 1-4-length binary strings except these four.\n\n   So, I can generate all possible binary strings of length 1 to 4, then remove the four bad ones.\n\n   How to generate all possible binary strings of length 1-4:\n\n   For k in 1 to 4:\n\n       generate all binary numbers of length k, convert each to a string.\n\n   For example, for k=1: '0', '1'\n\n   For k=2: '00', '01', '10', '11'\n\n   And so on.\n\n   So in code, I can write a function to generate all such strings.\n\n   Alternatively, in Python, I can use itertools.product to generate all possible combinations.\n\n   So for each k from 1 to 4:\n\n       for bits in itertools.product('01', repeat=k):\n\n           s = ''.join(bits)\n\n           if s not in bad_strings:\n\n               add to valid_codes.\n\n   Where bad_strings is ['0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'].\n\n   So that's how we can precompute the valid_codes.\n\n2. Read the input.\n\n   The input is m followed by m lines, each line is a string (either '0' or '1'). So for each step, we read a character and append it to the string S.\n\n   So in Python, perhaps read all lines first, then process each character one by one.\n\n3. For each step:\n\n   a. Append the new character to S.\n\n   b. For k in 1 to 4:\n\n       if len(S) >=k:\n\n           substr = S[-k:]\n\n           if substr in valid_codes:\n\n               current_contribution +=1\n\n   c. Add current_contribution to the total.\n\n   d. Output the total modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1']\n\nSo m=3, and the three characters are '1', '1', '1'.\n\nSo after each step:\n\nStep 1: S is '1'\n\nCheck for k=1: '1' is valid.\n\ncurrent_contribution =1.\n\nTotal=1.\n\nOutput 1.\n\nStep 2: S is '11'.\n\nCheck k=1: '1' is valid.\n\nk=2: '11' is valid.\n\ncurrent_contribution=2.\n\nTotal=1+2=3.\n\nOutput 3.\n\nStep3: S is '111'.\n\nk=1: '1' â†’ valid.\n\nk=2: '11' â†’ valid.\n\nk=3: '111' â†’ valid.\n\ncurrent_contribution=3.\n\nTotal=3+3=6.\n\nBut according to the sample, after all three steps, the output is '1\\n3\\n7'. Wait, that's not matching.\n\nWait, no. Wait the sample shows the output as ['1\\n3\\n7'], which is for each step. So after each of the 3 modifications, we have outputs.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nIn the first sample, the input is three '1's. So the string S is '1', '11', '111' after each step.\n\nAfter the first step, S is '1' â†’ only '1' is valid. So count is 1.\n\nAfter the second step, S is '11' â†’ substrings are '1' (counted once for the first character) and '11' (counted once for the second character). So total is 2, but the sample output after the second step is 3.\n\nWait, wait, perhaps my understanding is wrong. Let's re-examine the sample.\n\nIn the note, the first sample after all three modifications is '111' and the total is 7.\n\nWait, that suggests that each step adds to the total, but the output is the total after each step.\n\nWait, the sample output is '1\\n3\\n7' for three steps.\n\nSo step 1: 1.\n\nstep 2: 3.\n\nstep3:7.\n\nWait, how does that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Because when a new character is added, it can create new substrings that are part of longer valid substrings. So, for example, adding a third '1' can create '111', which is a valid code. But also, it can create new substrings that are part of existing substrings.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is not correct because when a new character is added, it can form new substrings of length up to 4, but also, the new substrings can overlap with previous substrings in a way that the same substring can be part of multiple counts.\n\nWait, but each substring is considered as a distinct occurrence. For example, in the string '111', the substrings are:\n\nPositions 0: '1' â†’ valid.\n\nPositions 0-1: '11' â†’ valid.\n\nPositions 0-2: '111' â†’ valid.\n\nPositions 1: '1' â†’ valid.\n\nPositions 1-2: '11' â†’ valid.\n\nPositions 2: '1' â†’ valid.\n\nSo, the total is 6 valid substrings.\n\nBut according to the note, the count is 7. So my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait, the note says that in the first sample, after all three steps, the count is 7.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nSubstrings:\n\n1 (from position 0) â†’ T.\n\n1 (position 1) â†’ T.\n\n1 (position 2) â†’ T.\n\n11 (positions 0-1) â†’ M.\n\n11 (positions 1-2) â†’ M.\n\n111 (0-2) â†’ O.\n\nSo that's 7 substrings. Oh, okay! So the count is 7, which is the sum of all these.\n\nSo why did I think earlier that the count was 6? Because I thought each of the 3 single '1's, 2 '11's, and 1 '111' gives 3+2+1=6, but that's wrong because each single '1' is a separate substring.\n\nWait, no. Each single '1' is a separate occurrence. So for the string '111', the substrings are:\n\n'1' (pos 0), '1' (pos1), '1' (pos2) â†’ 3.\n\n'11' (0-1), '11' (1-2) â†’ 2.\n\n'111' â†’1.\n\nTotal 3+2+1=6. But the note says the count is 7. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, no. Wait the note says that the count is 7, but according to this, it's 6. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nWait, each substring corresponds to a single English letter. So each occurrence of a valid Morse code substring is counted as one.\n\nSo for '111', the substrings are:\n\n1 (pos0) â†’ T.\n\n1 (pos1) â†’ T.\n\n1 (pos2) â†’ T.\n\n11 (0-1) â†’ M.\n\n11 (1-2) â†’ M.\n\n111 (0-2) â†’ O.\n\nSo that's 6 substrings, but the note says 7. So I'm missing something.\n\nWait, wait in the note, the list is:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\nWait, wait, that's seven elements. So the count is 7.\n\nAh, because the substrings can be overlapping in a way that they form different letters. For example, the '11' in positions 0-1 is M, and the same '11' in positions 1-2 is another M.\n\nSo each occurrence is counted separately.\n\nSo in '111', the substrings are:\n\n1 â†’ T (3 times).\n\n11 â†’ M (2 times).\n\n111 â†’ O.\n\nThat's 3 + 2 + 1 =6.\n\nBut according to the note, the count is 7. So why?\n\nBecause the note lists seven substrings, including 'TT' and 'TTT'.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Morse code mapping. Let me refer to the note.\n\nIn the note, the conversion is:\n\n\"1\" â†’ T.\n\n\"11\" â†’ M.\n\n\"111\" â†’ O.\n\nSo the substrings in '111' are:\n\nIndices 0-0: T.\n\nIndices 1-1: T.\n\nIndices 2-2: T.\n\nIndices 0-1: M.\n\nIndices 1-2: M.\n\nIndices 0-2: O.\n\nSo that's six substrings. But the note lists seven. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem statement.\n\nWait, maybe the problem counts all possible substrings, including those that have the same Morse code as other letters but are different in the string.\n\nNo, that doesn't change the count.\n\nWait, perhaps the note's example is not for the '111' string but after all the modifications, which is the third step.\n\nWait, no, the note says that after all three modifications, S is '111' and the count is 7.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Because my initial approach counts only the new substrings added in the current step, but that's not sufficient.\n\nWait, because when a new character is added, it can create new substrings that are longer than 1, but also may extend existing substrings.\n\nFor example, when you add the third '1', it creates the substring '111' which is valid. But also, the substrings '11' at positions 1-2 and 0-1 are now extended to form '111' but they themselves are still valid.\n\nBut in the initial approach, I'm only considering the substrings that end at the current character, which in this case is 3, but the substrings that start earlier and end at the current character may have been considered in previous steps.\n\nWait, no. Because for each step, when a new character is added, the new substrings are those that end at the current character, which may include substrings of length 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nBut in the initial approach, each time, for the current character, it's looking at the last k characters (1<=k<=4) and adding to the count if they are valid.\n\nSo in the first step:\n\nS = '1' â†’ valid, count is 1.\n\nSecond step:\n\nS='11' â†’ check k=1 and 2.\n\nk=1: '1' â†’ valid, adds 1.\n\nk=2: '11' â†’ valid, adds 1.\n\nTotal count is 1 + 2 =3.\n\nThird step:\n\nS='111' â†’ check k=1,2,3.\n\nk=1: '1' â†’ valid, adds 1.\n\nk=2: '11' â†’ valid, adds 1.\n\nk=3: '111' â†’ valid, adds 1.\n\nSo current contribution is 3.\n\nTotal becomes 3 (previous sum) +3=6.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output after the third step is 7.\n\nSo that suggests that the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh, I think I see the problem. Because when you add a new character, the new substrings can be formed by combining the new character with previous ones, but the way the initial approach counts only the new substrings that end at the current character. However, the previous substrings may have overlapped, and their extensions could form new valid substrings.\n\nWait, for example, in the third step, the new substrings are:\n\n- '1' at position 2.\n\n- '11' at positions 1-2.\n\n- '111' at 0-2.\n\nSo the current approach correctly adds 3.\n\nBut the previous steps had:\n\nAfter step 2: '11' had 2 substrings ('1','11').\n\nAdding step3, the new substrings are 3, bringing the total to 2+3=5, but that's not correct because the total should be 6.\n\nWait, no. The initial approach accumulates the total as the sum of all contributions.\n\nWait, after step 1: total=1.\n\nAfter step 2: total=1+2=3.\n\nAfter step3: total=3+3=6.\n\nBut the sample expects 7.\n\nSo the initial approach is undercounting.\n\nHmm. So what's the issue?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach misses the fact that some substrings are extended beyond the current step.\n\nWait, for example, in the second step, the substring '11' is added. When the third '1' is added, the substring '111' is added, but also, the substrings '11' (positions 0-1) and (1-2) are also present.\n\nBut in the initial approach, each step only adds the new substrings ending at the current position, which may miss the fact that some substrings are now part of longer valid substrings.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the sample is wrong. No, that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the initial approach counts each valid substring once, but the problem requires counting all possible substrings, even those that are part of longer valid substrings.\n\nWait, but that's not the case. Each substring is considered as a separate entity. So for example, in '111', the '11' substring at positions 0-1 and 1-2 are two separate substrings, both valid.\n\nSo the initial approach, which counts each valid substring that ends at the current position, is correct.\n\nBut according to the sample, after three steps, the count is 7, but according to the initial approach, it's 6.\n\nSo this indicates that the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the valid codes are being miscomputed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing some valid codes. Because the initial approach uses a set of valid codes, but perhaps the Morse code for the letters includes more possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach should include all possible 1-4-length binary strings except the four bad ones.\n\nSo the valid_codes set includes all 30-4=26 valid codes.\n\nBut in the sample, the count is 7. Let's see how many valid substrings are in '111':\n\nPossible substrings:\n\nLength 1: 3 (all '1's).\n\nLength 2: 2 ('11's).\n\nLength3: 1 ('111').\n\nTotal 6.\n\nBut the note says 7.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is referring to the sample after the third step, but the sample output is given as '7'.\n\nWait, the sample output after the third step is 7. So why is the count 7?\n\nLooking back at the note:\n\nThe sample after all three modifications is '111'.\n\nThey list the following:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\nWait, that's 7 substrings.\n\nBreaking down:\n\n- 'T' appears three times (positions 0,1,2).\n\n- 'M' appears twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2).\n\n- 'O' appears once (positions 0-2).\n\n- 'TT' appears once (positions 0-1).\n\n- 'TM' appears once (positions 0-2).\n\n- 'MT' appears once (positions 1-2).\n\n- 'TTT' appears once (positions 0-2).\n\nWait, that's 7.\n\nSo why are there 7 substrings? Because 'TT' is another valid substring.\n\nWait, but 'TT' is '11' in Morse code, which is 'M'.\n\nSo 'TT' is a substring, but it's the same as 'M' as well.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, each substring that forms a valid Morse code is counted as one.\n\nSo the count is the number of substrings, regardless of whether they represent the same letter.\n\nSo, for '111', the substrings are:\n\n1, 1, 1 â†’ 3.\n\n11, 11 â†’ 2.\n\n111 â†’ 1.\n\nTT is '11', which is already counted in the 2 instances.\n\nWait, but in the note, 'TT' is a separate substring.\n\nAh, so perhaps the note is considering all possible substrings, including those that are parts of longer substrings.\n\nSo, in '111', the substrings are:\n\npositions 0-0: '1' â†’ T.\n\npositions 0-1: '11' â†’ M.\n\npositions 0-2: '111' â†’ O.\n\npositions 1-1: '1' â†’ T.\n\npositions 1-2: '11' â†’ M.\n\npositions 2-2: '1' â†’ T.\n\nSo that's 6 substrings.\n\nBut according to the note, it's 7.\n\nWait, perhaps the note is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts all possible substrings, including those that are part of the same Morse code.\n\nWait, but in the sample, the count is 7, but according to my analysis, it's 6.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the initial approach doesn't account for the fact that some substrings of length 2 could be part of a longer substring, but are also valid on their own.\n\nWait, but the initial approach correctly counts each valid substring ending at the current position.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the sample explanation is wrong.\n\nBut that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial approach is missing some cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows for overlapping substrings, and each occurrence is counted.\n\nBut the initial approach counts each occurrence correctly.\n\nSo why is the sample expecting 7, but the initial approach is giving 6?\n\nI must have a misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem counts all possible substrings, not just those ending at the current position.\n\nWait, that would be a different approach.\n\nSo for example, for the string '111', the initial approach counts the substrings ending at each position, but the problem requires counting all possible substrings across the entire string.\n\nIn that case, the approach needs to be different.\n\nBut that would be computationally expensive.\n\nWait, but in the sample, after three steps, the output is 7.\n\nWhich is the count of all possible valid substrings in '111'.\n\nWhich is 6 according to my previous analysis.\n\nSo perhaps the note is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting the valid Morse codes.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but the sample is expecting the cumulative sum of the number of valid substrings that end at the current position.\n\nWait, no. Because the sample output after three steps is 7, but according to the initial approach, the sum would be 1+2+3=6.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach is to calculate the number of valid substrings that end at each position, but also include the substrings that are entirely contained within the current string.\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the count of all possible valid substrings, regardless of where they end.\n\nSo for each step, the total is the number of valid substrings in the current string.\n\nBut that would require for each step to recompute all valid substrings in the current string, which is O(n^2) for each step, which is O(m^3) overall, which is too slow for m=3000.\n\nBut m is 3000, and n can be up to 3000, so 3000^3 is 27e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThus, that approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo I'm stuck trying to figure out why the initial approach isn't working as per the sample.\n\nAlternative approach: perhaps the initial approach should not just track the new substrings ending at the current character, but also track the previous valid substrings that can be extended.\n\nWait, perhaps for each position, instead of just tracking the number of valid substrings ending at that position, we can track the number of valid substrings that end at that position, along with the lengths.\n\nBut that's complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this using a finite automaton, tracking the possible prefixes of valid codes.\n\nAlternatively, for each position, track the possible lengths of valid substrings ending at that position.\n\nBut that's getting complicated.\n\nAnother idea: the valid Morse codes are prefixes or suffixes of the current string.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each position, track the number of valid substrings ending at that position for each possible length (up to 4).\n\nSo, for each i, have dp1[i], dp2[i], dp3[i], dp4[i], which represent the number of valid substrings ending at i with lengths 1,2,3,4 respectively.\n\nThen, when a new character is added, for each possible k (1-4), we can update the current dp values based on the previous dp values.\n\nThis approach may help in capturing the extension of previous substrings.\n\nWait, for example, suppose at position i-1, we have a substring of length 2 ending at i-1. When we add a new character, the substring from i-2 to i is length 3. If this is a valid code, then dp3[i] += dp2[i-1].\n\nSimilarly, for k=1: check if the new character alone is valid, add 1.\n\nFor k=2: check if the previous character plus new is valid. If so, add dp1[i-1].\n\nFor k=3: check if the previous two plus new is valid. If so, add dp2[i-1].\n\nFor k=4: check if the previous three plus new is valid. If so, add dp3[i-1].\n\nAdditionally, for each k, if the substring is valid on its own, add 1.\n\nWait, perhaps this is the right way to model it.\n\nLet me think.\n\nEach time a new character is added, for each possible k (1-4), we can consider the last k characters and see if they form a valid code.\n\nBut also, for k>1, the last k-1 characters may have ended at the previous position and could form a valid substring that can be extended.\n\nSo, for example, if the last k-1 characters form a valid substring ending at i-1, then adding the new character may create a valid substring of length k.\n\nThus, for each k, the number of new valid substrings ending at i is equal to:\n\n   a. whether the last k characters (including new) form a valid substring â†’ 1.\n\n   b. for k>1: the number of valid substrings of length k-1 ending at i-1, multiplied by whether the new character extends them to a valid substring of length k.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly, but something like that.\n\nSo, for each new character, the new valid substrings ending at i can be computed as follows:\n\nfor k in 1..4:\n\n   substr = last k characters.\n\n   if substr is valid:\n\n       if k ==1:\n\n           new_count +=1.\n\n       else:\n\n           new_count += dp[k-1][i-1]\n\nSo, for each k, the new_count is 1 plus the count from the previous step if applicable.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nWe can have a 2D array, where dp[k][i] is the number of valid substrings ending at position i with length k.\n\nBut since k can be up to 4, and i can be up to 3000, this is manageable.\n\nSo, for each step i:\n\n   for k in 1..4:\n\n       substr = s[-k:]\n\n       if substr in valid_codes:\n\n           if k ==1:\n\n               dp[k][i] =1.\n\n           else:\n\n               dp[k][i] = dp[k-1][i-1] +1.\n\n       else:\n\n           dp[k][i] =0.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for k>1, the substr may consist of the new character plus the previous k-1, but also, if the previous k-1 were a valid substring, then adding the new character may form a new substring.\n\nWait, perhaps for each k, the new dp[k][i] is equal to:\n\n   if substr is valid:\n\n       dp[k][i] = dp[k-1][i-1] +1.\n\n   else:\n\n       0.\n\nBut only if k",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters represented by substrings in Morse code after each modification to an initially empty string.
