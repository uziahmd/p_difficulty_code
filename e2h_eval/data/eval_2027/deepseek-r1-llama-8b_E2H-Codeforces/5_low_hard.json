Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. And also, output all these pairs along with the count.\n\nHmm. So each left boot can be paired with a right boot, but each can only be in one pair. Also, the colors must be compatible. \n\nWhat's compatible? Two specific colors are compatible if they are the same. If one is a question mark, it's compatible with any. So for example, 'a' and 'a' are compatible, '?' and 'b' are compatible, 'a' and '?' are compatible, but 'a' and 'c' are not.\n\nSo the task is to match as many left and right boots as possible under these rules.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. Maybe I can represent the left and right boots in a way that allows me to count the maximum possible pairs efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n\nI remember that for matching problems where each element can be matched to another, often using a greedy approach or some kind of frequency counting helps.\n\nWait, but here the compatibility depends on the specific characters. So maybe we can group the left and right boots by their color (or question mark), and then find the best way to match them.\n\nBut since question marks can match anything, including other question marks, this adds some complexity.\n\nPerhaps the strategy is to first handle the question marks as much as possible because they can pair with anything.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should process specific colors first, ensuring that exact matches are made, and then use the question marks to fill in any remaining slots.\n\nBut wait, what's more optimal: making as many exact matches as possible, or using question marks to pair with others?\n\nNot sure. Maybe we need to find a way to maximize the total pairs by considering both possibilities.\n\nAnother thought: for each position i in left and j in right, check if l[i] and r[j] are compatible, and find the maximum matching.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, an O(n^2) approach is impossible. So we need an efficient method.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right boots that are compatible. Then the problem reduces to finding the maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n\nBut maximum matching in a bipartite graph with n nodes on each side would be O(n * sqrt(m)), which could be acceptable since m could be up to n^2, but that's still too slow for n=15e4.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: since the compatibility is based on the color, perhaps we can group the left and right boots by their color (including '?'), and then for each color c, the number of lefts with c is L[c], and the number of rights with c is R[c]. The maximum possible pairs for c is min(L[c], R[c]). But that's only for exact matches.\n\nBut wait, no—because the question marks can pair with any color. So maybe we need to consider the question marks separately.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are as follows:\n\n1. For each specific color c (a-z), compute the maximum possible exact matches between left and right boots of that color. This is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\n2. Then, for the question marks, see how many can be used to pair with the remaining left and right boots.\n\nWait, but that might not be optimal. Because perhaps it's better to use some question marks to pair with exact colors, thereby freeing up some exact color pairs to match elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal approach is to maximize the sum of exact matches plus the possible matches from the question marks after considering exact matches.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Perhaps it's better to model this as a problem where for each possible color, including '?', we can find how many left and right boots can be paired, considering that '?' can pair with any.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is:\n\n- For each left boot, if its color is not '?', then it can only pair with a right boot of the same color. Similarly, for right boots with non-'?' color, they can only pair with left boots of the same color.\n\n- The '?' left boots can pair with any right boot, and vice versa.\n\nSo perhaps the plan is:\n\n- Compute the exact matches for each color, subtract those from the counts, and then pair the remaining left and right boots via the question marks.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is equal to the sum over all colors c of min(L[c], R[c]), plus the number of possible pairs where one is a question mark and the other is any.\n\nWait, no. Because when you pair a question mark with a specific color, you're using up that right boot,",
