            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to convert a number from base a to base b, but if the base is 'R', it's the Roman numeral system. Hmm, let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the input has two parts: the first line is a and b. But b can be 'R' which represents the Roman numeral system. Then, the next line is c in base a, which could be a very long string. My task is to convert this number into base b, without leading zeros.\n\nFirst, I think I should parse the input correctly. The second line of input is a string representing a number in base a. So, for example, if a is 10 and the string is '16', that's 16 in decimal. But if a is 10 and the string is 'A', that's 10 in base 10? Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, because in base a, the digits are 0 to a-1. So for base a=10, digits are 0-9. So letters like A would not be part of base a unless a is higher than 10. Oh right, because in the problem statement, when b is R, it's the Roman numerals, which use letters beyond 10. So in the input, when a is, say, 16, the digits can be up to F (15), etc.\n\nBut for the conversion, the number is given in base a, so I need to parse each digit as an integer in base a.\n\nWait, but the string is in base a, which may include letters if a > 10. For example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-F (0-15). So I need to handle each character in the string, converting them to their respective values in base a.\n\nSo the first step is to process the input string and convert it into a decimal (base 10) integer.\n\nThen, once I have the number in decimal, I need to convert it into base b, which could be either a standard base or Roman numerals.\n\nWait, but the output depends on what b is. So, for example, if b is 2, the output is binary. If b is 13, it's base 13 with digits 0-12, represented as 0-9 and A (10), B (11), C (12). And if b is 'R', then it's the Roman numeral representation.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Read a and b.\n2. Read the string c in base a.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer N.\n4. Then, convert N into base b, following the rules for Roman numerals if b is 'R'.\n5. Output the resulting string without leading zeros.\n\nNow, the main challenges are:\n\n- Parsing the input string c correctly, considering that each character represents a digit in base a. For example, if a is 10, 'A' is invalid because base 10 only has digits 0-9. But wait, the problem says that in the case where Roman numerals are used (i.e., b is R), the number is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 300010, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but wait: the input string c is in base a, so the characters must represent valid digits in base a. So, for example, if a is 10, the string can't have 'A' in it because base 10 uses digits 0-9. Only when a is greater than 10 can the string have letters beyond 9, like A, B, etc.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is correct, so we don't have to handle invalid inputs. So we can proceed under the assumption that the input string c is a valid number in base a.\n\nSo, the first thing is to parse each character in c into its corresponding value in base a.\n\nHow to do that? Let's think about each character:\n\n- For digits 0-9: their value is the same in any base.\n- For uppercase letters: they represent 10 and above. But wait, the problem says that the input is in base a, so for example, if a is 16, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So for a base a, the maximum digit is a-1. So for a=16, the maximum is 15, which is F.\n\nSo, for each character in the input string, we need to find its value as per base a.\n\nSo, for each character in the string, if it's a digit, convert to int. Else, if it's a letter, we need to map it to the corresponding value.\n\nWait, but how do we know if it's part of the Roman numeral system? Because the string is in base a, so for bases higher than 10, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from base `a` to base `b`. The conversion involves handling both standard numeral systems and Roman numerals, which adds complexity. Here's the approach to solve the problem efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Parse Input**: Read the bases `a` and `b`, where `b` can be 'R' indicating Roman numerals.\n2. **Convert String to Decimal**: Convert the given number string from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n3. **Convert Decimal to Base `b`**: Depending on whether `b` is a standard base or 'R', convert the decimal number to the appropriate representation:\n   - For standard bases, convert to the specified base using digits 0-9 and letters for bases greater than 10.\n   - For Roman numerals, use the specific rules of Roman numeral conversion.\n4. **Output the Result**: Ensure the result has no leading zeros and is in the correct format.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n\n    # Read input\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    a_b = lines[0].strip()\n    c = lines[1].strip()\n\n    # Parse a and b\n    parts = a_b.split()\n    a = int(parts[0])\n    b_str = parts[1]\n    if b_str == 'R':\n        b = 'roman'\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n\n    # Helper function to convert a character to its value in base a\n    def char_to_value(c):\n        if c.isdigit():\n            return int(c)\n        else:\n            val = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n            return val - 10 if val > 10 else val\n\n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    decimal = 0\n    for ch in c:\n        val = char_to_value(ch)\n        decimal = decimal * a + val\n\n    # Function to convert decimal to base b\n    def decimal_to_base(n, base):\n        if base == 'roman':\n            return roman_numerals(n)\n        res = []\n        while n > 0:\n            rem = n % base\n            if rem < 10:\n                res.append(str(rem))\n            else:\n                res.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n            n = n // base\n        return ''.join(reversed(res))\n\n    # Function to handle Roman numerals conversion\n    def roman_numerals(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return ''\n        roman_map = {\n            1000: 'M',\n            900: 'CM',\n            500: 'D',\n            400: 'CD',\n            100: 'C',\n            90: 'XC',\n            50: 'L',\n            40: 'XL',\n            10: 'X',\n            9: 'IX',\n            5: 'V',\n            4: 'IV',\n            1: 'I'\n        }\n        res = []\n        for i in range(1000, 0, -1):\n            while n >= i:\n                res.append(roman_map[i])\n                n -= i\n        return ''.join(res)\n\n    # Get the result\n    result = decimal_to_base(decimal, b)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Parsing Input**: The input is read and split into the bases `a` and `b`, and the number string `c`.\n2. **Character Conversion**: A helper function converts each character of `c` into its corresponding value in base `a`.\n3. **Decimal Conversion**: The number string is converted into a decimal integer by iterating through each character and applying the base conversion rules.\n4. **Base Conversion**: Depending on whether `b` is a standard base or Roman numerals, the decimal number is converted into the target base. For Roman numerals, a specific mapping is used to construct the numeral string.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed without leading zeros, ensuring the correct format for both numeric and Roman numeral outputs.",
