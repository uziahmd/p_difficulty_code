For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are given as strings separated by spaces, and they can be in any order. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a major and minor triad. From the description:\n\n- A major triad has a specific order where the first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) are 3 semitones apart. So, for example, C E G: C to E is 4, E to G is 3. So the total from C to G is 7 semitones.\n- A minor triad is the opposite: the first two are 3 semitones apart, and the next two are 4. Like, C# B F would be ordered as B, C#, F. So B to C# is 3, C# to F is 4.\n\nSo the approach is to generate all possible permutations of the three notes, arrange them in a circular manner (since after H comes C again), compute the distances between consecutive notes, and check if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nWait, but since the triad is an unordered set, we need to consider all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor pattern.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Read the three notes.\n2. Generate all possible orderings (permutations) of these three notes.\n3. For each permutation, calculate the semitone distances between each consecutive pair, considering the circular arrangement.\n4. Check if any permutation meets the major or minor criteria.\n5. Based on which condition is met, output 'major', 'minor', or 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the circular aspect? Because the notes are cyclic, the distance between a note and the next higher note could wrap around from H to C, which is one semitone. So for example, H to C is 1 semitone.\n\nSo, for each pair of notes, I need to compute the distance in both directions. But perhaps the correct way is to find the minimal distance moving forward, but no—because the distance is always taken from lower to higher. So for any two notes X and Y, the distance is (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, multiplied by 0.5? Or wait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone, so each step is 0.5 tone. Wait no: each consecutive note is one semitone, but the problem says \"the distance between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone.\" Wait, wait, no. Wait, the distance is measured in semitones. So each step is 1 semitone. So, between C and C# is 1 semitone, C to D is 2, etc. Because the problem says, the distance is taken from the lower to the upper.\n\nWait, the problem says: the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Because C to C# is 1, C# to D is another, D to D# is third, D# to E is fourth. So yes, 4 semitones. So each step between consecutive notes is 1 semitone.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance is (y - x) mod 12, where x and y are their positions in the list [C, C#, D, ..., H].\n\nWait, but the order is important. So for example, the distance from E to C is 8 semitones because moving from E up to F, F#...H, C is 8 steps (E to F:1, F# 2, G 3, G#4, A5, A#6, B7, H8, then C is 9th? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's create a mapping of each note to its index. Let's list the notes in order:\n\nnotes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nEach note has an index from 0 to 11.\n\nSo for any two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) % 12. Because moving up from X to Y, you go through the notes in order, wrapping around.\n\nFor example:\n\nX = E (index 4), Y = C (0): (0 -4) mod12 is 8. So distance is 8 semitones.\n\nYes, that matches the problem statement: the distance between E and C is 8 semitones.\n\nSo the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are provided in any order, and we need to check all possible permutations to classify the triad correctly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: First, map each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: Since the triad can be in any order, generate all permutations of the three given notes.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, calculate the semitone distance between consecutive notes, considering the circular nature of musical notes (after H comes C again).\n4. **Check Conditions**: For each permutation, check if it meets the criteria for a major or minor triad:\n   - **Major Triad**: The first two notes must be 4 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) must be 3 semitones apart.\n   - **Minor Triad**: The first two notes must be 3 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) must be 4 semitones apart.\n5. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, determine if the triad is major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read the input notes\nnotes = input().split()\n\n# Create a list of note names and their indices\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_indices = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n# Generate all permutations of the three notes\nfrom itertools import permutations\nall_perms = permutations(notes)\n\n# Check each permutation\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in all_perms:\n    # Calculate the indices for each note in the permutation\n    indices = [note_indices[note] for note in perm]\n    \n    # Compute the distances between consecutive notes, wrapping around\n    distances = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        current = indices[i]\n        next_note = indices[(i+1) % 3]\n        dist = (next_note - current) % 12\n        distances.append(dist)\n    \n    # Check for major triad condition: 4, 3\n    if distances[0] == 4 and distances[1] == 3:\n        is_major = True\n        break\n    # Check for minor triad condition: 3, 4\n    elif distances[0] == 3 and distances[1] == 4:\n        is_minor = True\n        break\n\nif is_major and is_minor:\n    print(\"strange\")  # As per problem statement, this case won't occur\nelif is_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif is_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Mapping**: Each note is mapped to an index from 0 to 11 based on its position in the musical scale.\n- **Permutations**: We generate all possible orderings of the three notes to check every potential arrangement.\n- **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we compute the semitone distances between consecutive notes, considering the circular nature of the scale.\n- **Triad Check**: We check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor triad and output the result accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations are considered, and the correct classification is determined efficiently.",
