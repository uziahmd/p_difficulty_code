You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value.

The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about replacing digits in a given number 'a' with digits from a sequence 's' to make 'a' as large as possible. Each digit in 's' can be used at most once. So, the goal is to strategically replace some digits in 'a' with those from 's' in such a way that the resulting number is the largest possible.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's parse the input. The first line is the integer 'a', but since it can be very long (up to 105 digits), we'll treat it as a string. The second line is the sequence 's', which is also a string of digits.\n\nSo, for example, if a is '1024' and s is '9871234567', then the output should be '1124'. Looking at the example, the replacement steps must be:\n\n- Replace the second digit (0) with 1, making it '1124'.\nBut wait, maybe there's more to it. Oh right, because the digits in 's' are processed in order, perhaps? Or maybe not. Wait, no, the selection of which digits to replace depends on the maximum possible value.\n\nLet me think about the strategy. To maximize 'a', we need to replace the leftmost possible digit in 'a' with the largest possible digit available in 's'.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the sequence 's' in descending order. That way, we have the largest digits available first.\n2. Iterate through each digit of 'a' from left to right.\n3. For each digit, check if there's a larger digit in 's' that hasn't been used yet.\n4. If yes, replace the current digit with the largest possible available, remove that digit from 's', and proceed to the next position.\n5. Continue until all digits in 's' are used or all digits in 'a' have been checked.\n\nWait, but what about when multiple digits in 's' are larger than the current digit? We should always take the largest possible for the earliest position to maximize the overall value.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Convert both 'a' and 's' into lists for easier manipulation.\n- Sort 's' in descending order so we can pop the largest available element efficiently.\n- Loop through each character in 'a':\n   - For the current position, check if the current digit is less than the largest remaining in 's'.\n   - If so, replace it with that digit and remove it from 's'.\n   - Proceed to the next position.\n   - Else, do nothing and move to the next position.\n- Once all positions are processed or 's' is empty, return the modified 'a'.\n\nWait, but in the example, the 's' is '010'. Sorting it in descending order gives '1','0','0'. Then, the initial 'a' is '1024'.\n\nLooking at each digit:\n\n1. First digit is '1' in a. The largest in s is '1'. Since it's equal, no replacement. So move on.\n2. Second digit is '0'. The largest in s is '1', which is larger. So replace '0' with '1', and remove '1' from s. Now s becomes ['0','0'].\n3. Third digit is '2'. The largest in s is '0' which is smaller. Do nothing.\n4. Fourth digit is '4'. Largest in s is '0' again, so do nothing.\n\nResulting in '1124', which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: if a is '987' and s is '1234567', after sorting s becomes '7,6,5,4,3,2,1'. Then, since all digits of a are already larger than any in s, nothing changes. So output is '987'.\n\nSo the plan seems solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\na = input().strip()\ns = input().strip()\n\nWe need to process each as a string.\n\nThen, convert s into a list, sort it in descending order, and create a stack or something.\n\nWait, but since we need to process the largest first, it's efficient to sort and then use a pointer or pop from the front. However, popping from the front is O(n), which for n up to 105 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can reverse the sorted list and use a pointer to track the current index.\n\nWait, perhaps better to sort the list in descending order, then for each digit in 'a', check if the current s digit is larger than a's digit. If so, replace and remove the s digit.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nsorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\ni = 0 ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to replace digits in a given number `a` with digits from a sequence `s` such that the resulting number is as large as possible. Each digit in `s` can be used at most once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Sequence**: Convert the sequence `s` into a list of characters and sort it in descending order. This allows us to access the largest available digits first.\n2. **Iterate Through Each Digit of `a`**: For each digit in `a`, check if there is a larger digit available in the sorted sequence `s`.\n3. **Replace Digits Strategically**: Replace the current digit in `a` with the largest available digit from `s` if it results in a larger number. Move to the next position in `a` after each replacement.\n4. **Stop When No More Replacements Are Possible**: Continue until all digits in `a` have been checked or all digits in `s` have been used.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the value of `a` by making the most significant replacements first.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na = input().strip()\ns = input().strip()\n\nsorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\ni = 0\n\nfor j in range(len(a)):\n    current_digit = a[j]\n    if i < len(sorted_s):\n        s_digit = sorted_s[i]\n        if s_digit > current_digit:\n            a = a[:j] + s_digit + a[j+1:]\n            i += 1\n    else:\n        break\n\nprint(a)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line is the number `a` as a string, and the second line is the sequence `s` as a string.\n- **Sorting `s`**: The sequence `s` is converted into a list and sorted in descending order to facilitate easy access to the largest digits.\n- **Replacing Digits**: We iterate through each digit of `a`. If the current digit in `a` is smaller than the largest remaining digit in `s`, we replace it and move to the next digit in `s`.\n- **Output the Result**: After processing all possible replacements, the modified number `a` is printed.\n\nThis method efficiently maximizes the value of `a` by prioritizing the most significant digits and using the largest available digits from `s` first.",
