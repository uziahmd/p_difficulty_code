String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting beautiful strings based on certain criteria. The string must consist of only 0s and 1s, and the count of 0s should be exactly n, 1s exactly m. Then, there's this modification operation that can be applied any number of times, including zero. The modification allows us to replace the last two characters with a single 0 or 1, depending on what they were. For example, if the last two are 00, replacing them with 0; if they're 11, replace with 1; else, like 01 or 10, we can't do anything because the modification requires two same characters.\n\nWait, no, wait. Oh right, the modification replaces two last characters with a single character. So for the string to undergo a modification, its length must be at least two. And each modification reduces the length by one. So after k modifications, the length becomes original_length -k. But the initial string has length n + m. So after k modifications, the length is (n + m) -k. But the modified string must still satisfy the beautiful string condition, meaning that in the end, the counts of 0s and 1s must be exactly n and m respectively? Or wait, no. Wait, the beautiful string is the original string s which satisfies the 0s and 1s counts. The modifications are done on the string, but perhaps the resulting string after some modifications is the one we're considering?\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem again. It says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" Hmm, maybe I misread that part. Oh right, so after performing some modifications, the string will end up as a string where the last character is g. So the problem is, given n, m, g, how many beautiful strings s exist such that, through a series of modifications, you can end up with a string whose last character is g.\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately: for a beautiful string s, we can perform some number of modifications (each being replacing the last two characters with one), possibly zero, and the result is a string where the last character is g. So the beautiful string s must be such that after some modifications, the last character is g.\n\nBut how does the process of modifications affect the string? Each modification changes the last two characters into one. So the order in which modifications are applied affects the final result. Hmm, but perhaps the key is to model what possible final configurations are possible for the string after any number of modifications, starting from a beautiful string s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the possible transformations of the beautiful string into a form where the last character is g. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nSo the main idea is: count all beautiful strings s (with exactly n 0s and m 1s) such that s can be transformed via some number of modifications into a string where the last character is g.\n\nNow, let's think about how the modifications affect the string. Each modification reduces the length by 1, since two characters are replaced by one. So, the initial string s has length L = n + m. After k modifications, the length is L - k. But for the modified string to have a last character, after any number of modifications, the string must have length >=1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that a modification is allowed only if the string length is at least two. So each modification reduces the length by one. So, the number of possible modifications is up to L-1, because after L-1 modifications, the string would have length 1.\n\nWait, but when you perform a modification, the string's length decreases by one each time. So the maximum number of modifications is L-1, leading to a single character.\n\nSo, the question is: for a given beautiful string s, can we reach a string t (after some modifications) where the last character is g.\n\nBut how do the modifications affect the count of 0s and 1s? Let's see:\n\nEach modification takes the last two characters and replaces them with a single character. So, each modification could change the count of 0s and 1s. For example, if the last two were 00, replacing them with 0 doesn't change the total 0 count. Similarly, 11 becomes 1, so no change. But if the last two were 01 or 10, then they get replaced by 0 or 1, which changes the counts.\n\nWait, no. Because the replacement depends on the two characters. If the last two are 00, replace with 0: so the count of 0s remains the same. Similarly, 11 becomes 1: count remains same. But for 01, replacing with ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a string ending with a specific character after a series of allowed modifications. The solution involves dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Modifications**: Each modification reduces the length of the string by 1, replacing two characters with one. The key is to determine how these modifications affect the counts of '0's and '1's in the string.\n2. **Dynamic Programming State**: We use a dynamic programming (DP) approach where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to end up with a string of length `i` ending with character `j` (0 or 1).\n3. **State Transitions**: For each possible state, we consider the last two characters and how they can be modified. This helps us build up the DP table from smaller lengths to larger ones.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we take results modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\nn, m, g = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_len = n + m\n\n# Initialize dp: dp[i][j] = number of ways to have a string of length i ending with j\ndp = [[0 for _ in range(2)] for __ in range(max_len + 1)]\n\n# Base case: empty string\ndp[0][0] = 1 if g == 0 else 0\ndp[0][1] = 1 if g == 1 else 0\n\nfor i in range(1, max_len + 1):\n    for j in range(2):\n        # Consider all possible last two characters\n        for prev_j in range(2):\n            if i >= 2:\n                # Take the last two characters (current j and prev_j)\n                # After modification, it becomes j_new based on the two characters\n                if j == prev_j:\n                    new_j = j\n                else:\n                    if j == 0:\n                        new_j = 0\n                    else:\n                        new_j = 1\n                # Update the next state\n                if i - 2 >= 0:\n                    dp[i][new_j] += dp[i-2][prev_j]\n                    dp[i][new_j] %= MOD\n            else:\n                # Can't perform any modification\n                pass\n\n# Now, sum all possible ways to reach the desired g in the final string\nif g == 0:\n    print(dp[max_len][0] % MOD)\nelse:\n    print(dp[max_len][1] % MOD)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe code initializes a DP table where each entry `dp[i][j]` keeps track of the number of ways to form a string of length `i` ending with character `j`. The transitions consider all possible previous states and how they can be modified to reach the current state. The final result is derived from the DP table by considering the target character `g` and the maximum length of the string.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the number of valid beautiful strings using dynamic programming, ensuring we handle all edge cases and constraints effectively.",
