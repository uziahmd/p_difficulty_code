Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices. If there are multiple optimal solutions, any will do.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the possible angles are that can be formed by selecting three vertices in a regular polygon. Since the polygon is regular, all sides and angles are equal, which might help in calculating the possible angles.\n\nWait, the angle in question is formed by two points on the sides of a vertex. So for each vertex v2, I can look at the possible pairs of points (v1, v3) such that they lie on the sides connected to v2. But wait, actually, v1 and v3 are on the two sides extending from v2. So for a given v2, the angle is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 on those sides.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. So the internal angles of the polygon itself are known; for an n-gon, each internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But that's the internal angle, not the angle formed by three vertices.\n\nWait, no. The problem is about the angle formed by three points where two are on the sides of a vertex. So for each vertex v2, the maximum possible angle is when v1 and v3 are as far apart as possible. But depending on the positions, the angle can vary.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the polygon. Each vertex has two adjacent vertices. For example, in a square (n=4), each vertex is connected to two others, forming a 90-degree internal angle. But when considering angles formed by three points, perhaps including non-consecutive vertices, the angles can vary.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently.\n\nFor each vertex v2, what are the possible angles that can be formed by choosing v1 and v3 such that v1 is on one side of v2 and v3 is on the other side.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the perimeter. Wait, no. Because the polygon is regular, the angle depends on how far apart v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this. Let's fix a vertex v2. Then, the polygon can be thought of as being arranged around v2. For each vertex, the other vertices are arranged in a circle around v2. The angle between two adjacent vertices as seen from v2 is 2π/n radians, but wait, no. Because in a regular polygon, each central angle is 2π/n radians. But the angle subtended by two points at v2 would depend on how many steps apart they are around the polygon.\n\nWait, let's think in terms of the polygon. For a regular polygon with n vertices, each vertex is spaced at an angle of (360/n) degrees apart. So for a given v2, the other vertices are placed every 360/n degrees around a circle.\n\nSo, the angle formed at v2 by two points, say, k steps away on either side, would form an angle. What's the measure of that angle?\n\nHmm. Suppose in the polygon, for a given v2, we have vertices arranged in order: ..., v_prev, v_prev+1, v_prev+2, ..., v2, ..., v_next, v_next+1, ... etc., going clockwise.\n\nIf I pick v1 as the vertex that is k steps before v2 (when moving clockwise), and v3 as the vertex that is m steps after v2, then the angle formed at v2 would be based on the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, maybe not. Wait, in a circle, the angle subtended by two points at a third point depends on the positions of those two points relative to the third. So if the two points are on opposite sides of the third, the angle can be calculated using the central angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle can be found by considering the number of edges between v1 and v3 as viewed from the center. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps for a regular polygon, the angle at v2 formed by points v1 and v3 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3, but only if the points are on a semicircle or something like that. Or maybe it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3, considering their positions relative to v2.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the possible angles.\n\nIn a regular",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given value 'a'. The output should be these three vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Polygon Structure**: A regular polygon has all sides and angles equal. For an n-sided polygon, each internal angle is ((n-2)*180)/n degrees.\n2. **Angle Formation**: For each vertex v2, the angle formed by two other vertices v1 and v3 can vary based on their positions relative to v2. The goal is to find the closest possible angle to 'a' for any valid triplet (v1, v2, v3).\n3. **Central Angle Calculation**: The central angle between consecutive vertices is 360/n degrees. The angle subtended by two points from a third point (v2) depends on how many steps apart they are around the polygon.\n4. **Optimal Triplet Search**: For each vertex v2, consider pairs of vertices (v1, v3) that form angles closest to 'a'. This involves checking the minimal steps required to reach vertices that form angles close to 'a' from v2.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef find_closest_angle(n, a):\n    # Generate all possible triplets and calculate the angles\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_triplet = []\n    \n    for v2 in range(1, n+1):\n        # For each v2, check possible k and m steps\n        for k in range(1, (n // 2) + 1):\n            v1 = v2 - k\n            if v1 < 1:\n                v1 += n\n            for m in range(1, (n // 2) + 1):\n                v3 = v2 + m\n                if v3 > n:\n                    v3 -= n\n                # Ensure v1 != v3\n                if v1 == v3:\n                    continue\n                # Calculate the angle at v2\n                # The angle is (m + k) * (360 / n) / 2\n                # Because the total arc is (m +k)*step, and angle is half that.\n                angle = (m + k) * (360 // n) // 2\n                # But wait, this is only true if the points are on opposite sides.

The other arc is (n - (k + m)) steps.\n                # The inscribed angle at v2 will be half the measure of the arc opposite to it, which is the smaller of the two arcs.\n                # So, the angle is min((k + m) * (360 / n), (n - (k + m)) * (360 / n)) / 2\n                # No, wait, the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc that the angle subtends. So if the points are on the same side, the angle would be zero, which isn't the case here. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.\n                # Maybe it's better to consider that the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 around the polygon. The angle can be calculated as follows:\n                # The central angle between v1 and v3 is (d) * (360 / n) degrees, where d is the minimal number of steps between them (could be clockwise or counter-clockwise).

Otherwise, it's the minimal arc.\n                # Wait, perhaps the angle is always half the central angle, regardless of the position.\n                # So, let's compute the central angle as (k + m) * (360 / n) degrees, and the inscribed angle is half of that.\n                # But that might not be accurate because if the points are on the same side, the angle would be larger than 180, which is impossible.\n                # So, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the minimal arc between v1 and v3, which is the minimal of (k + m) and (n - (k + m)), then the inscribed angle is half of that minimal arc.\n                # So, the angle is (min(k + m, n - (k + m))) * (180 / n)\n                # Because 360 / n is the step, so multiplying by 180 gives the angle in degrees.\n                # So, let's re-calculate:\n                arc_steps = k + m\n                minimal_arc = min(arc_steps, n - arc_steps)\n                angle = minimal_arc * (180.0 / n)\n                # Now, compare the absolute difference with 'a'\n                diff = abs(angle - a)\n                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and (best_triplet == [] or (v1, v2, v3) < best_triplet)):\n                    min_diff = diff\n                    best_triplet = (v1, v2, v3)\n                    # Also, check other permutations to find the closest\n                    # Since the polygon is regular, we can also consider the same angle but with different order\n                    # For example, if the angle is formed by v1 and v3, then v3 and another point could also form the same angle\n                    # So, we need to generate all possible triplets and find the one with minimal difference\n                    # However, this approach might be too slow for n up to 105. So perhaps we can optimize.\n                    # Instead, for each v2, try to find the minimal possible angle difference and store the triplet.\n                    # Once all v2 are checked, pick the triplet with minimal difference.\n                    # But even this approach could be O(n^3), which for n=105 is about 1e6 operations, manageable.\n                    # So, perhaps it's better to precompute all possible triplets and find the one with minimal difference.\n                    # But for n=105, the number of triplets is 105 * (104 choose 2) = around 105*1000=105000, which is manageable.\n                    # So, perhaps a brute-force approach is feasible.\n                    # So, the plan is:\n                    # Loop over all possible triplets (v1, v2, v3), compute the angle, and track the triplet with minimal difference.\n                    # So, perhaps the initial approach is not efficient, and a better way is needed.\n                    # Alternatively, for each v2, compute the best possible v1 and v3 that minimize the angle difference.\n                    # Let's think about it differently.\n                    # For each v2, the minimal possible angle is when the two points are as far apart as possible on either side.\n                    # Wait, no. The angle can vary, but perhaps for each v2, the closest angle can be found by trying a few candidates around the ideal angle.\n\n    # To make it efficient, perhaps for each v2, we can find the best k and m that make the angle as close as possible to 'a'.\n    # The angle is (k + m) * (180 / n) degrees if k + m <= n/2, else (n - (k + m)) * (180 /n)\n    # We can model this as trying to find k and m such that the angle is as close as possible to 'a'.\n\n    # So, for each v2, the ideal k + m would be a * (n / 180) degrees, but since k and m are integers, we can try to find k and m that bring (k + m) as close as possible to a * (n / 180) degrees.\n\n    # So, the target for (k + m) is a * (n / 180), but since (k + m) must be an integer, we can round it to the nearest integer and check nearby values.\n\n    # Let's compute the target steps:\n    target = a * (n / 180)\n    # Round to the nearest integer\n    target_steps = round(target)\n    # Check target_steps -1, target_steps, target_steps +1\n    for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        current_target = target_steps + delta\n        if current_target <= 0:\n            continue\n        if current_target > n:\n            continue\n        # Now, for current_target, find the best k and m\n        # But k and m must be positive integers such that k + m = current_target\n        # And k >=1, m >=1, and k + m <= n-2 (since v1 and v3 must be distinct and not equal to v2)\n        # So, for each current_target, iterate possible k from max(1, current_target - (n-2)) to min(current_target -1, n-2)\n        # But perhaps for each current_target, the best k is 1 and m is current_target -1, or vice versa, depending on which gives the minimal difference.\n        # But perhaps it's better to try all possible k and m combinations near current_target.\n        # Alternatively, since we are looking for the closest possible angle, perhaps the minimal difference occurs when (k + m) is as close as possible to the target steps.\n        # So, for each v2, loop over k from 1 to (current_target -1), and set m = current_target -k, ensuring m >=1 and k + m <= n-2.\n        # Then compute the angle and track the minimal difference.\n\n    # But this seems complicated.

Since the problem statement says \"any\" is acceptable, perhaps the order is not important, but the sample outputs show specific orders.\n\n# However, the code above may not correctly compute the angle, as there's a mistake in the angle calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle calculation is incorrect. Let me re-examine this part.\n\nThe angle at v2 is determined by the two points v1 and v3. Since the polygon is regular, the angle can be computed based on the number of steps between v1 and v3 relative to v2.\n\nFor a regular polygon, each vertex is spaced 360/n degrees apart. The angle at v2 is the angle between the two lines connecting v2 to v1 and v2 to v3.\n\nThis angle can be calculated as the difference between the angles of the two points relative to v2.\n\nFor example, if v1 is k steps clockwise from v2 and v3 is m steps counterclockwise from v2, the angle between them is (k + m) * (360/n) degrees. However, this is the central angle. The inscribed angle at v2 would be half of this, but only if the points are on opposite sides. If they are on the same side, the angle would be the supplement.\n\nAlternatively, the inscribed angle can be calculated as half the measure of the arc that does not contain v2. So, if the arc between v1 and v3 is s degrees, the inscribed angle at v2 is s/2 degrees.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\n1. Compute the minimal arc between v1 and v3, which is min(d, n - d) steps, where d is the number of steps between v1 and v3 (either clockwise or counterclockwise).\n2. Convert this arc into degrees: arc_degrees = minimal_arc * (360 / n)\n3. The inscribed angle at v2 is arc_degrees / 2.\n\nThus, in the code, the angle should be computed as (minimal_arc * (360 / n)) / 2 degrees.\n\nSo, correcting the code:\n\nangle = (minimal_arc * (360.0 / n)) / 2\n\nThis will give the correct angle at v2.\n\nTherefore, the updated code inside the loop should compute the angle correctly.\n\nNow, implementing this in the code.\n\nFinally, after computing all possible triplets, the triplet with the minimal difference is selected and printed.\n\n### Final Code\n```python\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ndef find_closest_angle(n, a):\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_triplet = []\n    \n    for v2 in range(1, n+1):\n        for v1 in range(1, n+1):\n            if v1 == v2:\n                continue\n            for v3 in range(1, n+1):\n                if v3 == v2 or v3 == v1:\n                    continue\n                # Compute the minimal arc between v1 and v3\n                d = abs(v1 - v3)\n                minimal_arc = min(d, n - d)\n                # Calculate the angle at v2\n                arc_degrees = minimal_arc * (360.0 / n)\n                angle = arc_degrees / 2\n                # Compute the difference\n                diff = abs(angle - a)\n                # Update the best triplet if this is the closest so far\n                if diff < min_diff or (diff == min_diff and (v1, v2, v3) < best_triplet):\n                    min_diff = diff\n                    best_triplet = [v1, v2, v3]\n    return best_triplet\n\n# Read input and process\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\nresult = find_closest_angle(n, a)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution iterates over all possible triplets of vertices (v1, v2, v3) in the regular polygon. For each triplet, it calculates the angle at v2 using the minimal arc between v1 and v3. The angle is computed as half the measure of this arc. The triplet with the smallest difference between the computed angle and the target 'a' is selected and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the optimal triplet efficiently, even for the maximum constraint of n=105.",
