            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Morse code and counting certain substrings after each modification to a string S. Hmm. So, the task is, for each step after adding a character to S, find the number of non-empty sequences that correspond to some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nWait, let me break it down. Each time we add a 0 or 1 to S, which represents dots and dashes. Then, for all possible substrings of S after each addition, we need to count how many of them correspond to an English letter (since Morse code can represent letters as specific sequences). But wait, not all binary strings are valid. There are four invalid ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring that's one of these four isn't counted.\n\nSo, the approach is to, for each position in S, consider all possible substrings ending at that position and determine how many of them are valid Morse codes for English letters.\n\nBut how do I efficiently compute this after each step?\n\nHmm, maybe dynamic programming could help here. Because for each new character added, the new valid substrings end at that character. So perhaps I can track, for each possible length (1-4), how many valid substrings end at the current position.\n\nWait, right. For each position i, the current character is c. Then, the new substrings ending at i are those starting from i-3 to i (for lengths 1 to 4, but ensuring we don't go out of bounds). For each possible starting point j (i-3, i-2, i-1, i), we check if the substring s[j..i] is a valid Morse code. If it is, then we add 1 to the total count.\n\nBut checking all possible substrings each time might be too slow for m up to 3000. Because for each step, you have up to 4 substrings to check, which is manageable.\n\nWait, because for each new character, the maximum number of substrings ending at that position is 4. Since the maximum length of a valid Morse code is 4.\n\nSo for each step, for each possible k (1,2,3,4), we look back k steps and see if the last k characters form a valid Morse code.\n\nIf they do, then this contributes 1 to the total. So for each new character, we can loop over k from 1 to 4, check the substring of length k ending at the current position, and if it's valid, increment the total by 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Keep track of the total number of valid substrings.\n- For each new character, process it by checking the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters.\n- For each possible k (1-4), check if the substring s[i-k+1 ... i] is a valid Morse code.\n- If yes, add 1 to the total.\n- After processing, output the current total modulo 1e9+7.\n\nWait, but how do I check if a substring is a valid Morse code? Because each substring must not be one of the four invalid strings.\n\nSo I need a set containing the four invalid strings: {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}.\n\nFor each substring of length k, I can check if it's in the invalid set. If it is, then it's not counted. Otherwise, it's valid and adds 1.\n\nSo for each new character, for k=1 to 4:\n\n- Check if the substring of length k is in the invalid set.\n- If not, add 1 to the total.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the substring has length less than 4? Like, for k=1, it's just a single character. Are there any invalid single-character substrings?\n\nNo, because the problem statement says that all strings except the four mentioned are valid. So for example, \"0\" and \"1\" are valid (they correspond to 'E' and 'T' respectively). So for any k from 1 to 4, the substring is considered only if it's not one of the four invalid.\n\nSo the steps for each new character c:\n\n1. Update S by appending c.\n2. For k = 1 to min(4, current length of S):\n   a. Take the last k characters.\n   b. Check if this substring is in the invalid set.\n   c. If not, add 1 to the total.\n3. Output the total mod 1e9+7.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently.\n\nWe can represent S as a list or string, but since we're only adding to it, we can keep appending each character.\n\nFor each new character, we'll loop through k",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of valid Morse code substrings after each modification to an initially empty string. Each modification appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1') to the string. A valid Morse code substring corresponds to an English letter and must not be one of the four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Track Valid Substrings**: For each new character added to the string, check all possible substrings ending at that character with lengths 1 to 4.\n2. **Check Validity**: For each substring, check if it is one of the four invalid strings. If not, count it as valid.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, use modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to keep the numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\ninvalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\nm = int(input())\ns = []\ntotal = 0\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    c = input().strip()\n    s.append(c)\n    current_length = len(s)\n    for k in range(1, 5):\n        if current_length < k:\n            break\n        substr = ''.join(s[-k:])\n        if substr not in invalid:\n            total = (total + 1) % MOD\n    print(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of modifications and initialize an empty list `s` to build the string incrementally.\n2. **Processing Each Modification**: For each new character, append it to `s` and check all substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at this character.\n3. **Substring Check**: For each substring length, extract the substring, check if it is invalid, and count valid substrings.\n4. **Output**: After processing each character, print the total count of valid substrings modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each possible valid substring after each modification, ensuring that we only count valid Morse code sequences, thus solving the problem within the constraints.",
