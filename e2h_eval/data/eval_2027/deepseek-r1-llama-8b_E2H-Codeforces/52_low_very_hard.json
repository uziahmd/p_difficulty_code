Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about candles and figuring out how many hours they can burn for. The process goes like this: each candle burns for an hour and then goes out. But Vasily is smart because he can take 'b' number of burned-out candles and make a new one. So the question is, what's the maximum number of hours he can keep the room lit?\n\nHmm, let's think about the example given. For instance, when a is 4 and b is 2, the output is 7. How does that work? \n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Now he has 4 stubs. He can exchange them for 4/2 = 2 new candles. Burning those adds 2 more hours, making total 6. Now he has 2 stubs left from these. But wait, 2 is equal to b, so he can make another candle. That's one more hour, bringing the total to 7. Oh right, because after burning the two candles, he gets 2 more stubs, which again give him one candle, adding another hour. Wait, no—wait, wait. Let me recount:\n\nInitial 4 burn → 4 hours. Then 4 stubs → 2 new, which gives 2 hours (total 6). Now he has 2 stubs from those 2 candles. So he can make 1 new candle, burn it for 1 hour (total 7), and now he has 1 stub. But 1 is less than b=2, so he can't make any more. So yeah, 7.\n\nAnother example: 6 3. The output is 8. Let's see. Burn 6 → 6 hours, 6 stubs. Exchange for 2 new candles (since 6/3=2). Burn them for 2 → total 8. Now he has 2 stubs, but 2<3, so no more. So total 8.\n\nSo the approach is: we need to keep track of the number of stubs, and whenever the count is enough to make new candles, do so, and add the hours accordingly.\n\nSo the algorithm would be something like this:\n\n1. Start with 'a' candles.\n2. Burn all of them, adding 'a' hours. Stubs increase by 'a'.\n3. While the number of stubs is >= b:\n   a. Make as many new candles as possible: new_candles = stubs // b\n   b. Add new_candles to the total hours.\n   c. Update stubs: (stubs % b) + new_candles (because each new candle becomes a stub after burning)\n   \nWait, no. Because when you make new_candles, you burn them, which takes new_candles hours. So each of those new candles adds 1 hour, and each contributes one stub. So the steps are:\n\n- Initialize total_hours = a\n- stubs = a\n- while stubs >= b:\n   new_candles = stubs // b\n   total_hours += new_candles\n   stubs = (stubs % b) + new_candles\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal =4, stubs=4.\n\nstubs >=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles=4//2=2. total becomes 6. stubs = (4%2) +2=0+2=2.\n\nAgain, stubs=2 >=2.\n\nnew_candles=1. total becomes 7. stubs=0 +1=1.\n\nNow stubs <2, loop ends. So total is 7.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, stubs=6.\n\n6 >=3: yes.\n\nnew_candles=2. total becomes 8. stubs=0 +2=2.\n\nNow 2 <3: loop ends. Total is 8.\n\nSo the algorithm works for these cases.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nLet's think of a=1, b=2. Then he burns 1 hour, has 1 stub. Can't make anything. So total is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5.\n\nBurn 5, stubs=5. Make 1 new candle, burn it (total 6), stubs=1+1=2. No more. So total is 6.\n\nWait, no: initial a=5, stubs=5. Since 5>=5, make 1 new. Total becomes 5+1=6. stubs=0 +1=1. Then 1<5, done.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=3.\n\nStubs=10.\n\nFirst iteration:",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can create new candles from the stubs of burned-out ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a` and calculate the initial number of hours they will burn.\n2. **Stub Exchange**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs and use them to create new candles whenever possible. Each time you create a new candle, it burns for an hour, contributing to the total hours and producing another stub.\n3. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Continue exchanging stubs for new candles until the number of stubs is less than the required number `b` to make a new candle.\n\nThe algorithm efficiently tracks the number of hours and the stubs, ensuring that every possible new candle is made and burned.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nstubs = a\n\nwhile stubs >= b:\n    new = stubs // b\n    total += new\n    stubs = stubs % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the input values `a` (initial candles) and `b` (stubs needed for a new candle). We initialize `total` hours with `a` because each candle burns for an hour.\n2. **Stub Collection**: After burning all initial candles, we have `a` stubs.\n3. **Candle Creation Loop**: While we have enough stubs to make at least one new candle:\n   - Calculate how many new candles can be made (`new`).\n   - Add these new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the number of stubs to the remainder after creating new candles plus the stubs from burning the new candles.\n4. **Termination**: The loop stops when there are not enough stubs to make a new candle, and we print the total hours.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of hours the candles can burn by optimally reusing stubs to create new candles.",
