On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a sequence of numbers representing performers' actions. Each number is either 1 or 2. Tommy wants to choose an interval [l, r] and reverse the subsequence from l to r. Then, he needs to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the modified array.\n\nHmm. The goal is to find the best possible interval to reverse so that this LNDS is as long as possible.\n\nFirst, let's understand what reversing a subarray does. Reversing can change the order of elements, which might create a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nWait, but how? For example, if the original array has a decreasing part, reversing might make it increasing, thus possibly forming a longer LNDS.\n\nBut how do we approach this for all possible intervals?\n\nLet me think about the constraints. The maximum n is 2000. So O(n^3) algorithms might be acceptable, but maybe O(n^2) is better.\n\nWait, what's the size of n? 2000. So n^2 is 4e6 operations, which is manageable. But anything higher than that could be tricky.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For every possible interval [l, r], reverse the subarray.\n2. Compute the LNDS for each such reversed array.\n3. Find the maximum among all these.\n\nBut wait, for each interval [l, r], computing the LNDS would take O(n) time. Because for each such array, the LNDS can be found using a standard DP approach. Since there are O(n^2) intervals, the total time becomes O(n^3), which is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nThat won't work. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative idea: instead of considering all possible intervals, find out which reversal can give the best improvement in the LNDS.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal reversal is such that, after reversing, some parts of the array become more non-decreasing.\n\nAlternatively, think about the original array's LNDS length. Without any reversal, what's the LNDS? We can compute that first. Then, see if by reversing some interval, we can increase this length.\n\nBut even that doesn't immediately help with finding the best interval.\n\nAnother approach: for each possible l and r, determine the impact of reversing [l..r] on the LNDS. But again, this seems computationally expensive.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as trying to find a segment where reversing it will merge two increasing sequences, thus allowing a longer LNDS.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible position, consider whether elements before and after the segment can form a longer non-decreasing sequence when the segment is reversed.\n\nHmm, maybe it's helpful to precompute some information.\n\nWait, another thought: since the elements are only 1s and 2s, maybe the problem can be simplified.\n\nFor instance, the LNDS in any array is simply the count of 1s followed by 2s as much as possible. Or something along those lines.\n\nWait, no. Because the order matters. For example, in the array [2, 1, 2], the LNDS is 2 (either [2,2] or [1,2]).\n\nWait, but in the problem, after reversing, the array may have more 1s followed by 2s, but maybe not.\n\nWait, let's think about the sample input:\n\nFirst example: 1 2 1 2\n\nReversed from 2-3 (so subarray [2,1] becomes [1,2]) → new array is 1,1,2,2. The LNDS is 4.\n\nSo the maximum possible.\n\nSecond example: 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1.\n\nAfter reversing 3-7 (elements 2,2,2,1,1), which becomes 1,1,2,2,2. So the array becomes 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1. The LNDS is 9.\n\nSo in this case, the reversed segment turned a bunch of 2s and 1s into 1s and 2s in order, allowing a longer non-decreasing run.\n\nHmm.\n\nIdea: perhaps the optimal reversal is one that takes a certain segment and reverses it so that within that segment, the 1s and 2s are arranged optimally, possibly turning a decreasing segment into an increasing one.\n\nBut how to model this efficiently.\n\nAlternative approach: for each possible segment [l..r], compute the maximum possible LNDS when that segment is reversed. Then, keep track of the maximum across all segments.\n\nBut again, the problem is that computing the LNDS for each reversed segment is O(n), leading to O(n^3) time, which is too slow for n=2000.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to compute the LNDS quickly after a reversal.\n\nWait, the LNDS can be computed with a DP approach in O(n log n) time, but that's for the original array. But when you reverse a segment, the DP would need to be recomputed.\n\nSo perhaps that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: find for each possible l and r, the effect of reversing that segment on the overall LNDS. Maybe find for each pair l, r the maximum possible contribution to the LNDS.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for all possible l and r the best possible way to connect the prefix and suffix.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the structure of the array after reversing [l..r]. The array is divided into three parts: left (before l), middle (reversed), right (after r). So perhaps the LNDS can be formed by combining the LNDS of the left, the LNDS of the reversed middle, and the LNDS of the right, as well as transitions between them.\n\nWait, but the LNDS may not necessarily start at the end of the left and continue through the reversed middle. It depends on the values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal LNDS after reversal is equal to the sum of the LNDS of the left, plus the LNDS of the reversed middle, plus the LNDS of the right, minus some overlaps.\n\nNo, that's probably not accurate because the elements in the middle can connect to the left and right.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find for each [l, r], the maximum possible contribution from the reversed segment, and then see how it can combine with the surrounding segments.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nAlternative approach: for each possible l, r, compute the LNDS of the reversed array, but find a way to compute this without O(n) time per l,r.\n\nWait, perhaps the reversed array can be considered as the original array with a certain subarray reversed. So, for the DP, can we model this in a way that allows us to compute the LNDS quickly?\n\nHmm, perhaps the DP can be adjusted. Let's think about the standard DP for LNDS. It uses a list where dp[i] is the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending at index i. We can compute this in O(n) time.\n\nIf we reverse a segment, the DP for the entire array will change. But recomputing it for each reversed segment is O(n) per segment, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of checking every possible interval, find the interval whose reversal gives the maximum possible gain in the LNDS.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible segment [l..r], determine how much the LNDS can be improved by reversing it. Then select the best one.\n\nBut again, I'm stuck on how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, let's think about the possible gains. When you reverse a segment, the elements inside the segment may be arranged in a way that allows for a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum gain comes from a segment that, when reversed, creates a longer sequence of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nWait, given that all elements are 1 or 2, the LNDS is determined by the count of 1s followed by 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come after all the 1s. But reversing a segment can potentially merge some 1s and 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is min( total_ones + total_twos, the length of the array ). Because if all 1s are before all 2s, the LNDS is total_ones + total_twos. But sometimes, due to the order, this isn't possible.\n\nBut perhaps by reversing a certain segment, we can arrange the array to have as many 1s as possible before 2s.\n\nSo, what's the maximum possible LNDS?\n\nIt's the minimum between the total number of 1s plus 2s (but since the array can't have both 1s and 2s in any order, the maximum is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s in the correct order).\n\nWait, no. For example, if all 1s come after 2s, the LNDS is 1 (all 2s) or 1 (all 1s), depending on their order.\n\nSo the maximum possible is the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s that come after all the 1s.\n\nBut that's the case when the array is sorted. So perhaps the maximum possible is the maximum between the current LNDS and the total_ones + total_twos.\n\nBut no, that's not possible because the initial arrangement may not allow that.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the maximum between the current LNDS and the sum of the count of 1s and the count of 2s in the entire array. Because if we can arrange all 1s before 2s, the LNDS is n.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem reduces to: can we find a reversal that allows all 1s to come before 2s.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first example has 2 ones and 2 twos. The output is 4, which is indeed the sum.\n\nIn the second example, the total_ones is 5 and 2s are 5. So the sum is 10, but the output is 9. Hmm, why?\n\nBecause in the original array, the 1s and 2s are not in the correct order. So after reversal, they are as close as possible but not completely sorted.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not possible to get the maximum possible sum in some cases, but we can try.\n\nWait, let's think about the problem differently. The maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the minimum between the sum of all 1s and 2s and the maximum possible when the array is split into a prefix of 1s and a suffix of 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem is to find the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum possible sum of 1s and 2s that can be arranged by a reversal.\n\nWait, but how can we find the maximum possible sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible sum is the maximum over all possible splits k, where k is the number of 1s, such that in the array, there exists a point where all 1s are before it and all 2s are after it, or something like that.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached as follows:\n\nCompute the maximum possible sum of 1s and 2s that can be arranged by any reversal.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for each possible split point, say, after position m, can we arrange the array such that all elements before m are 1s and all after are 2s. Then the LNDS is m (number of 1s) plus (n - m) (number of 2s), which is n.\n\nBut in the sample input 2, the total 1s and 2s are 10, but the output is 9. So perhaps this is not always achievable.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the current LNDS and the maximum number of 1s that can be placed before a certain position, plus the number of 2s that come after.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as finding, for each possible position i, the maximum number of 1s before i and 2s after i. Then, the sum is the maximum of these sums across all i.\n\nBut how does reversing a segment help with this?\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible segment [l, r], reversing it can allow certain 1s and 2s to be reordered, potentially allowing more 1s to be before a certain point and 2s after.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it this way: the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is either the original LNDS or the maximum possible sum of 1s and 2s that can be arranged by reversing a certain segment.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to compute the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum possible sum of 1s and 2s that can be achieved by any reversal.\n\nThus, the steps could be:\n\n1. Compute the original LNDS, call it original_max.\n\n2. For each possible interval [l, r], compute what's the maximum number of 1s that can be before a certain position and 2s after, after the reversal. But I'm not sure how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible reversal [l, r], compute the new array, and compute its LNDS. Then take the maximum across all such possibilities.\n\nBut as before, this approach would be O(n^3), which is too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for all possible [l, r] the best possible LNDS after reversal, but find a way to compute it efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal reversal is one that connects the ends of the array in a way that allows the LNDS to span the entire array, except for some small portion.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum of (the number of 1s in the prefix up to l) plus (the number of 2s in the suffix starting at r+1), for all possible l and r.\n\nWait, that's an interesting idea. Because when you reverse [l, r], the 1s in the prefix up to l can be followed by 2s in the suffix from r+1, assuming that the reversed segment allows that.\n\nBut how does the reversed segment affect this?\n\nHmm. Let me think. Suppose in the original array, the prefix up to l has x 1s, and the suffix from r+1 has y 2s. If we reverse the segment [l, r], perhaps the 1s in the prefix can now connect with the 2s in the suffix, provided that the reversed segment starts with a 1 and ends with a 2.\n\nWait, no. Because the reversed segment could have varying 1s and 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible sum is the maximum value of (number of 1s in prefix up to l) + (number of 2s in suffix starting at r+1), for all l and r, plus the LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum of (prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1]) for all possible l and r, where prefix_ones[l] is the count of 1s in the first l elements, and suffix_twos[r+1] is the count of 2s in the elements from r+1 to the end.\n\nWait, that's a possibility. Because, for example, in the first sample:\n\nOriginal array: 1 2 1 2.\n\nSuppose l=1, r=3. The prefix up to l=1 is [1], so prefix_ones[1] = 1. The suffix starting at r+1=4 is [2], so suffix_twos[4] = 1. Sum is 2. But the reversed segment is [2,1] → [1,2]. So the new array is 1,1,2,2. The LNDS is 4, which is better.\n\nBut according to the above idea, the sum is 2, which is less than the actual result.\n\nHmm, so that approach wouldn't capture that.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversal is the maximum of:\n\na) The original LNDS.\n\nb) For any l ≤ r, the maximum (prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1] + (length of the reversed segment where all 1s come before 2s)).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum LNDS after reversal is the maximum over all possible l and r of (prefix_ones[l] + the number of 2s in the reversed segment that come after the 1s in the reversed segment) + (suffix_twos[r+1]).\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the elements are 1 and 2, perhaps the maximum LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum possible number of 1s that can be followed by 2s in the array after any reversal.\n\nSo, for any possible reversal, the LNDS can be as high as the maximum number of 1s before a certain point plus the maximum number of 2s after that point, plus any 1s and 2s in the reversed segment that fit into this order.\n\nBut again, how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal reversal is such that the segment [l, r] contains a transition from 2 to 1, and reversing it changes that to 1 to 2. This could allow the 1s before l to connect with the 2s after r, thereby increasing the LNDS.\n\nSo, for each possible [l, r], check if the segment starts with 2 and ends with 1. Reversing it will make the segment start with 1 and end with 2, allowing the prefix 1s to connect to the suffix 2s.\n\nSo, the maximum LNDS would be the maximum of:\n\noriginal_LNDS,\n\nthe maximum (prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1]) for all [l, r] where the segment [l..r] starts with 2 and ends with 1.\n\nBecause reversing such a segment would allow the 1s before l to connect with the 2s after r, thus creating a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nAdditionally, for each such [l, r], the segment itself may have some 1s and 2s, which can contribute to the LNDS.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_ones array, where prefix_ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements.\n\n2. Precompute suffix_twos array, where suffix_twos[i] is the number of 2s from element i to the end.\n\n3. For each possible [l, r], check if a[l] == 2 and a[r] == 1. If yes, then reversing this segment will make a[l] = 1 and a[r] = 2.\n\n4. Then, the potential LNDS would be prefix_ones[l] (the 1s before l) plus suffix_twos[r+1] (the 2s after r) plus the LNDS of the reversed segment itself.\n\nBut wait, the reversed segment's own LNDS is just the maximum possible in that segment. Since it's a segment of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be found in O(1) time for each segment.\n\nAlternatively, for each [l, r], the reversed segment's LNDS is the same as the original segment's LNDS.\n\nWait, because the LNDS is about the order; reversing the segment doesn't change the relative order of the elements within the segment. So the LNDS of the reversed segment is the same as the LNDS of the original segment.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the LNDS of a segment is the maximum length of a non-decreasing subsequence in that segment. Reversing the segment's order doesn't change the length of the LNDS for the segment.\n\nYes, because it's about the order of elements within the segment. Reversing the order of the elements doesn't change the fact that a certain subsequence is non-decreasing.\n\nSo, the LNDS for the reversed segment is the same as for the original segment.\n\nSo, for each [l, r], the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is:\n\nprefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1] + LNDS_segment(l, r).\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because the 1s before l can connect to the 2s after r, but the reversed segment's LNDS may add more to the total.\n\nAlternatively, the total LNDS could be the sum of the 1s before l, the 2s after r, and the LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\nBut perhaps the LNDS is the maximum of all possible ways to connect the left, reversed segment, and right.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nmax_lnd = max(prefix_ones[l] + LNDS_segment(l, r) + suffix_twos[r+1])\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the first sample:\n\nOriginal array: 1 2 1 2.\n\nCompute for l=2, r=3. The segment is [2,1], which starts with 2 and ends with 1. Reversing it makes [1,2].\n\nprefix_ones[2] is 1 (only the first element is 1). suffix_twos[4] is 1 (last element is 2). LNDS_segment(2,3) is 2 (since in the reversed segment, 1 and 2 form a non-decreasing sequence of length 2).\n\nSo sum is 1 + 2 + 1 =4, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: in the second sample, after reversing [3..7], the array becomes 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1.\n\nThe LNDS is 9.\n\nLooking back, the prefix_ones[3] is 2 (elements 1,1,2?), wait no. Let me re-express the array.\n\nWait, the original array in sample 2 is 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1.\n\nSo l=3, r=7. The segment is [2,2,2,1,1]. Reversing it makes [1,1,2,2,2].\n\nSo the new array is 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1.\n\nCompute prefix_ones[3] is the number of 1s in the first 3 elements: 2 (elements 1 and 2 are 1s).\n\nsuffix_twos[8] is the number of 2s from position 8 onwards: positions 8 and 9 are 2s, so 2.\n\nThe LNDS of the reversed segment is 5 (the entire segment is 1,1,2,2,2, which is a non-decreasing sequence of length 5).\n\nSo sum is 2 +5 +2=9, which matches the sample.\n\nAh, so this seems promising.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each possible [l, r] where a[l] == 2 and a[r] ==1:\n\n- Compute the sum: prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1] + LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\nThen, take the maximum of all these sums, along with the original LNDS.\n\nThis gives the maximum possible LNDS.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_ones and suffix_twos.\n\n2. Precompute LNDS for all possible segments [l, r]. We'll need this for each [l, r] to calculate the sum.\n\n3. Iterate over all possible [l, r] where a[l] ==2 and a[r] ==1. For each such [l, r], compute the sum as above.\n\n4. Keep track of the maximum sum.\n\n5. Also, compute the original LNDS and compare.\n\nSo, the next task is to compute the LNDS for all possible segments [l, r].\n\nSince n is 2000, the number of segments is about 2e6, which is manageable.\n\nComputing LNDS for a segment can be done with a dynamic programming approach for each segment.\n\nWait, but for each segment [l, r], how to compute LNDS efficiently.\n\nEach segment has up to 2000 elements, so for each segment, computing LNDS would take O(n) time, leading to 2e6 * 2e3 = 4e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThat's a problem.\n\nSo we need a way to compute LNDS for all possible segments [l, r] in O(n^2) time.\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute for each possible starting point l, the LNDS for the subarrays starting at l.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use some data structure to compute LNDS for all possible segments quickly.\n\nWait, but I don't recall any such data structure.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each possible segment [l, r], the LNDS can be found using a DP similar to the standard LNDS algorithm, but optimized for speed.\n\nWait, the standard approach for LNDS is O(n log n) time. But for each segment, doing that would be O(n) time per segment, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative Idea: Realize that for all segments, the LNDS can be computed in O(n^2) time using a different DP approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS for all possible segments can be computed using a 2D DP table, where dp[l][r] represents the LNDS of the segment [l, r].\n\nWe can compute this with the following recurrence:\n\nFor each segment [l, r], dp[l][r] = max(dp[l][k] + dp[k+1][r] for all k >= l, but considering the transition from dp[l][k] and dp[k+1][r]).\n\nWait, but that seems unclear.\n\nWait, another approach: the LNDS of a segment [l, r] is the maximum of:\n\n- LNDS of [l, k] + LNDS of [k+1, r], but ensuring that the last element of [l, k] is <= the first element of [k+1, r].\n\nBut that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, for each position, we can keep track of the lengths of increasing subsequences.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress here.\n\nPerhaps an alternative approach: precompute for each position i, the maximum possible LNDS for each possible starting position l.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the elements are only 1 and 2, perhaps the LNDS for a segment can be determined by counting the number of 1s and 2s in a way that forms a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nWait, for a segment consisting of 1s followed by 2s, the LNDS is the length of the segment.\n\nBut if the segment has 2s followed by 1s, the LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s before the first 1.\n\nWait, perhaps for each segment [l, r], the LNDS can be calculated based on the counts of 1s and 2s and their arrangement.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that the LNDS for a segment is the maximum between the count of 1s in the segment plus the count of 2s that come after some point, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for a segment of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the length of the longest chain where each element is >= the previous.\n\nWhich can be computed as the standard LNDS problem.\n\nBut for each segment, that's O(r-l+1) time. Which is O(n^2) for all segments.\n\nBut n is 2000, so 2000^2 is 4e6. 4e6 * 2000 is 8e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach won't work.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find another way.\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of considering all possible [l, r], focus on the segments where a[l] ==2 and a[r]==1. Because only these segments can potentially bridge the 1s before l and 2s after r.\n\nThus, the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum of:\n\n- original_LNDS,\n\n- the maximum (prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1] + LNDS_reversed_segment) for all [l, r] with a[l]==2 and a[r]==1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all such [l, r] pairs and computing this sum.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute LNDS_reversed_segment quickly for all such [l, r] pairs.\n\nBut wait, the LNDS of the reversed segment is the same as the LNDS of the original segment because the order of elements within the segment is reversed, but the relative order of elements in terms of their non-decreasing property remains the same.\n\nWait, no. For example, the segment [2,1] has LNDS 1, while the reversed segment [1,2] has LNDS 2. So the LNDS of the reversed segment is different.\n\nOh, right! So the LNDS of the reversed segment is different from the original segment.\n\nSo, for each [l, r], we need to compute the LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the LNDS of the reversed segment can be computed quickly.\n\nWait, the LNDS of a segment is the same as the LNDS of the reversed segment only if the order is preserved in a non-decreasing way.\n\nWait, no. For example:\n\nOriginal segment [2,1] has LNDS 1. Reversed [1,2] has LNDS 2. So it's different.\n\nSo, for each [l, r], we need to compute the LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\nBut for n=2000, and considering up to 2e6 possible [l, r] pairs where a[l]==2 and a[r]==1, each requiring O(m) time to compute the LNDS of the segment (where m is the length of the segment), this approach is still O(n^3), which is not feasible.\n\nThus, we need a way to compute the LNDS of the reversed segment efficiently.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the elements are only 1 and 2, perhaps the LNDS of a segment can be computed quickly.\n\nWait, for a segment, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s. So, for a segment, if all 1s are before 2s, the LNDS is the length. Otherwise, it's the number of 1s plus the number of 2s after the last 1.\n\nWait, perhaps for each segment, the LNDS can be found by:\n\n- Count the number of 1s in the segment.\n\n- Count the number of 2s that appear after the last 1.\n\nThe sum is the LNDS.\n\nWait, no. Because the 2s could be in between 1s, which would not contribute.\n\nWait, perhaps for a segment, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be followed by 2s, regardless of their positions.\n\nWait, no. Because the sequence has to be non-decreasing, which requires that all elements in the subsequence are non-decreasing.\n\nThus, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s that can be taken, followed by 2s that come after the last 1.\n\nBut in a segment, the 2s can be anywhere after the last 1.\n\nSo, for a segment, the LNDS can be found as the maximum between the count of 1s, the count of 2s, or the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that appear after the last 1.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct.\n\nSo, for a segment, process from left to right, and for each position, track the last occurrence of 1. Then, for each 2 after that, add to the count.\n\nThus, the algorithm for a single segment is:\n\nInitialize last_one = -infinity.\n\ncount =0\n\nmax_len =0\n\nfor i from l to r:\n\n    if a[i] ==1:\n\n        last_one = i\n\n        count_ones +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        if last_one != -infinity:\n\n            current = count_ones + 1 (the 2 contributes 1)\n\n            if current > max_len:\n\n                max_len = current\n\n            # Also, check if the current 2 can extend a previous subsequence.\n\n            # Or perhaps the current 2 can start a new subsequence.\n\n            # Or perhaps it's better to track the current maximum.\n\nSo, perhaps the LNDS for the segment can be computed as the maximum of:\n\n- the number of 1s in the segment.\n\n- the number of 2s in the segment.\n\n- the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1.\n\nThus, for each segment, the LNDS can be computed in O(m) time, but with m being up to 2000.\n\nBut for 2e6 possible segments, that's 4e9 operations, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Precompute for each position i, the next occurrence of 1 after i. Then, for any segment, the number of 2s after the last 1 can be found quickly.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible segment, the LNDS can be computed as follows:\n\nLoop through the segment, keep track of the last position where a 1 occurred. For each 2 encountered after that last 1, add to the current count, and update the maximum.\n\nThus, for a segment, the LNDS is the maximum between the number of 1s, the number of 2s, and the maximum count achieved during the scan.\n\nThis can be done in O(m) time per segment.\n\nBut again, for 2e6 segments, this is 4e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThus, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that for each possible [l, r], the LNDS after reversal can be computed as the sum of the 1s before l, the 2s after r, and the LNDS of the reversed segment.\n\nBut how to compute this sum quickly.\n\nAnother Idea: Instead of iterating through all possible [l, r] where a[l] ==2 and a[r]==1, perhaps find the best [l, r] that maximizes this sum.\n\nBut without knowing which segments to consider, it's hard.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to precompute for all possible [l, r] the sum s = prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1] + LNDS_rev(l, r), and find the maximum s.\n\nBut with n=2000, this would involve 2000*2000=4e6 iterations, each requiring O(m) time for LNDS_rev.\n\nBut 4e6 * 2000 = 8e9 operations, which is way beyond acceptable.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to find another way to compute LNDS_rev quickly.\n\nWait, another Idea: For each possible [l, r], the LNDS_rev is the same as the LNDS of the segment [r, l] (since reversing the order of the elements). But no, because the LNDS is not symmetric under reversal.\n\nSo, perhaps for each [l, r], the LNDS_rev is the same as the LNDS of the original segment [l, r], but that's not true.\n\nWait, earlier example: [2,1] has LNDS 1, reversed to [1,2], which has LNDS 2. So, LNDS_rev is greater than LNDS_original.\n\nSo, that approach won't work.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the elements are only 1 and 2, perhaps the LNDS of a segment can be expressed in terms of the count of 1s and 2s in certain patterns.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the segment starts with 1, the LNDS is the entire segment length.\n\n- If the segment starts with 2, then the LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that appear after the last 1.\n\nWait, perhaps.\n\nThus, for each segment, the LNDS can be computed quickly based on the counts.\n\nSo, for each segment [l, r], compute:\n\ncount_ones = number of 1s in [l, r]\n\ncount_ones_after_last_one = ?\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nLoop through the segment from left to right, tracking the last position where a 1 was found. For each 2 after that, add 1 to the current streak.\n\nThus, the maximum streak is the LNDS of the segment.\n\nThis can be done in O(m) time, but again, for 4e6 segments, it's too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps we can precompute for each possible [l, r], the LNDS_rev.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a way to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternative Idea: Given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to accept that O(n^3) is not feasible and find a way to find the best [l, r] without explicitly checking all possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal [l, r] is one that starts with 2 and ends with 1, and has the maximum possible (prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1]).\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case, but perhaps it's worth trying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal [l, r] is the one that maximizes (prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1]), regardless of the LNDS_rev.\n\nBut in the first sample, the sum is 2, but the LNDS after reversal is",

By focusing on subarrays that start with a 2 and end with a 1, we maximize the potential increase in the LNDS. The algorithm iterates over all such subarrays, computes the LNDS for each, and keeps track of the maximum value found. This approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal subarray to reverse, leading to the desired result.",
