    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about an array of integers, and we need to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element. Instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, my goal is to remove one element such that the resulting array has the smallest possible max - min.\n\nHmm, right. So for each possible element to remove, I need to compute the instability of the remaining array and then find the minimum among all those possibilities.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 1e5, which is 10^5. If I try to iterate over each element, compute the max and min each time, that would be O(n^2) time, which is definitely too slow. Because 1e5 squared is 1e10 operations—way beyond what can be handled in the time constraints.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's note that the original array has a certain max and min. When I remove an element, the new max or min might change depending on whether the removed element was the current max, min, or something else.\n\nWait, but sometimes even if you remove an element that's not the max or min, the new max or min could be the next highest or lowest. So the removal can affect both ends.\n\nSo perhaps I should precompute the possible candidates for the new max and min when each element is removed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the second maximum and second minimum, and see how their combination affects the instability.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Find the global maximum and minimum of the array.\n2. For each element, consider what happens when it's removed:\n   a. The new max could be the second maximum if the current max was this element.\n   b. Similarly, the new min could be the second minimum if the current min was this element.\n3. Then, for each element, calculate the new instability as (new_max - new_min), and find the minimum across all these possibilities.\n\nWait, but this isn't entirely accurate because some elements might not be the max or min. Removing them might not change the max or min. So for each element, I need to determine what the new max and min would be if that element is removed.\n\nBut computing that for each element naively would still be O(n) per element, which is O(n^2) overall—too slow.\n\nSo I need a way to efficiently find, for each element, the next possible max and min when it's removed.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can precompute the two largest and two smallest elements. Then, for each element, decide whether it's part of the current max or min.\n\nLet me think: suppose the array has a max M and a second max m2. Similarly, the min is m and the second min is m2_min.\n\nThen, for each element a[i]:\n\n- If a[i] == M: then the new max will be m2.\n- Else: the new max remains M.\nSimilarly for the min:\n- If a[i] == m: new min is m2_min.\n- Else: new min remains m.\n\nWait, but this isn't correct because other elements could influence the new max or min. For example, if the array has multiple elements equal to M, then even if I remove one, the max remains M.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is to find all occurrences of the maximum and minimum.\n\nFor example, count how many times the max occurs. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo, for the max:\n\nIf the count of the max is greater than 1, then even if I remove one occurrence, there are still others, so the new max is still M.\n\nIf the count is exactly 1, then removing that element will make the new max the second maximum.\n\nSame for the min.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the max and min of the array.\n2. Compute the second max (the largest value less than max) and the second min (the smallest value larger than min).\n3. Also, count how many times the max appears and how many times the min appears.\n4. For each element in the array:\n   a. If the element is the current max:\n      i. If the count of max is > 1: the new max is still max.\n      ii. Else: new max is second_max.\n   b. Similarly, if the element is the current min:\n      i. If the count of min is > 1: new min is min.\n      ii. Else: new min is second_min.\n   c. For other elements, the new max and min remain the same as the original.\n5. For each element, compute the potential new instability as (new_max_candidate - new_min_candidate). Keep track of the minimum such value.\n\nThis approach would allow us to process each element in O",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Key Values**: First, find the maximum (max_val) and minimum (min_val) values of the array.\n2. **Find Second Max and Min**: Determine the second highest value (second_max) and the second lowest value (second_min) in the array.\n3. **Count Occurrences**: Count how many times the max_val and min_val appear in the array.\n4. **Evaluate Each Element Removal**: For each element in the array:\n   - If the element is the max_val, check if it's the only occurrence. If not, the new max remains max_val; otherwise, it becomes second_max.\n   - Similarly, if the element is the min_val, check its count. If it's not the only occurrence, the new min remains min_val; otherwise, it becomes second_min.\n   - Calculate the instability for the resulting array and keep track of the minimum instability.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum instability without recalculating the entire array for each removal, thus optimizing the solution to run in O(n) time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    # Find max and min\n    max_val = max(a)\n    min_val = min(a)\n    \n    # Find second max and min\n    sorted_a = sorted(a)\n    second_max = -float('inf')\n    for num in reversed(sorted_a):\n        if num < max_val:\n            second_max = num\n            break\n    second_min = float('inf')\n    for num in sorted_a:\n        if num > min_val:\n            second_min = num\n            break\n    \n    # Count occurrences of max and min\n    count_max = a.count(max_val)\n    count_min = a.count(min_val)\n    \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    for num in a:\n        # Determine new max\n        if num == max_val:\n            if count_max > 1:\n                current_max = max_val\n            else:\n                current_max = second_max\n        else:\n            current_max = max_val\n        \n        # Determine new min\n        if num == min_val:\n            if count_min > 1:\n                current_min = min_val\n            else:\n                current_min = second_min\n        else:\n            current_min = min_val\n        \n        # Calculate instability\n        inst = current_max - current_min\n        if inst < min_instability:\n            min_instability = inst\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of elements and the array itself.\n2. **Finding Key Values**: The maximum, minimum, second maximum, and second minimum values are determined using sorting and linear scans.\n3. **Counting Occurrences**: The number of times the maximum and minimum values appear in the array is counted.\n4. **Evaluating Each Element**: For each element, we determine what happens to the maximum and minimum values when that element is removed.
