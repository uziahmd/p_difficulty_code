Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Luba who has several tabs open in her browser and wants to close some of them. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds she needs to spend to achieve this.\n\nLet me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nShe starts with n tabs, numbered from 1 to n. The cursor is at position 'pos'. She needs to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive. So all other tabs outside this range must be closed.\n\nEach second, she can perform one of two types of actions:\n1. Move the cursor left or right, but within the currently available tabs. So if a tab is already closed, she can't move beyond it.\n2. Close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor. For example, if she closes to the left, all tabs before her current position (but not including the current one) are closed.\n\nI need to model the process and find the minimal steps required.\n\nHmm. So the key is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closures that leads to the desired state with the fewest steps.\n\nFirst, let's think about what needs to be done:\n\n- Any tabs to the left of l must be closed.\n- Any tabs to the right of r must be closed.\n\nSo the initial state is all tabs open. We need to end up with only [l, r] open.\n\nSo, the first step is to determine which tabs are outside [l, r] and need to be closed. That would be 1..(l-1) and (r+1)..n.\n\nWait, but perhaps some of these are already closed due to the movement? No, initially, all are open. So we have to close all tabs outside [l, r].\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the strategy:\n\nOption 1: Move to the leftmost position in [l, r], then close all to the left. Then move to the rightmost, close all to the right. But perhaps there's a more efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to close either the left or right first, depending on where the cursor is located.\n\nWait, but the movement is constrained because as you close tabs, the available a and b change. So when you close tabs to the left, a increases. Similarly, closing to the right reduces the available tabs on the right.\n\nSo, for example, suppose initially a=1, b=n. After closing to the left of pos, a becomes pos. Similarly, closing to the right sets b to pos.\n\nSo the approach should consider the order of closing and moving.\n\nLet me break it down into cases.\n\nCase 1: The current position is inside [l, r]. So any tabs outside [l, r] can be closed without needing to adjust the cursor position much.\n\nCase 2: The current position is outside [l, r]. So she needs to move into the [l, r] segment before being able to close any tabs outside.\n\nWait, no. Because if the cursor is at pos, which is not in [l, r], but she can still close some tabs. Wait, no—because closing requires that she's at a certain position. Like, if she is at pos=5 and needs to close tabs to the left, but l=3 and r=4, she can't close to the left because 3 is part of the needed segment. Or wait, no. When she is at pos=5, which is outside the [l=3, r=4] segment, but she can choose to close the right side (but since r=4, nothing is to the right). Alternatively, she can move to the correct positions to close the necessary tabs.\n\nWait, maybe I should model the problem differently. Let's see.\n\nWe need to close all tabs outside [l, r]. So the tabs to the left of l and the right of r must be closed.\n\nSo the steps would involve:\n\n1. Moving to a position where she can close the left side (if any).\n   - This could be l or any position in [l, r].\n2. Close the left side.\n3. Move to a position where she can close the right side (could be r or any position in [l, r]).\n4. Close the right side.\n\nAdditionally, she might need to do these in a different order, like close the right first, then the left, depending on the starting position.\n\nBut sometimes, she can do both closures in a single movement and closure step. For example, if she is at position r, she can close the right side in one step, and then move to l and close the left side.\n\nSo, the plan is to compute the minimal steps considering all possible orders of closing left and right.\n\nLet me outline the possibilities:\n\nPossibility 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nPossibility 2: Close right first, then left.\n\nFor each possibility, calculate the steps and take the minimum.\n\nBut also, perhaps there's a scenario where you don't need to close both sides. For example, if l=1 and r=n, then nothing needs to be done. Or if l=1 and r=n, but you're already there.\n\nWait, yes. So first, I should check if the current state already satisfies the condition. That is, if l=1 and r=n, and pos is anything, but all tabs are needed, so no action is needed.\n\nSo first, handle the trivial case: if l=1 and r=n, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for the non-trivial cases.\n\nLet me model each possibility.\n\nPossibility 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Move from pos to a position where she can close the left (i.e., to l). Because to close the left, she needs to be at a position >= l. Or wait, no. Because after closing, the a increases. So she can choose any position in [a, b], which includes the current a and b.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial a is 1, and b is n.\n\nTo close the left, she needs to be at a position i such that i-1 <= l-1, and when she closes to the left, all tabs to the left of i (but not including i) are closed. So, to close the left, she needs to be at a position i where i >= l.\n\nBecause if she is at i = l, then the left closure will close tabs 1..l-1.\n\nSimilarly, if she's at a higher position, say i > l, then the left closure will close 1..i-1, which includes 1..l-1.\n\nSo, the first step is to reach a position where she can close the left.\n\nSo, for the first possibility, to close the left first:\n\na. Move to l, then close left. Steps taken: (distance from pos to l) + 1.\n\nb. Then, move to r, then close right. Steps taken: (distance from l to r) + 1.\n\nTotal steps: (pos to l) + 1 + (l to r) + 1 = (|pos - l|) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, but movement is per step. So moving from pos to l: |pos - l| steps.\n\nThen, close left: 1 step.\n\nThen, move from l to r: (r - l) steps.\n\nClose right: 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nPossibility 2: Close right first, then left.\n\nSo:\n\na. Move to r, close right: (r - pos) steps (if pos < r) plus 1.\n\nb. Move to l, close left: (r - l) steps (since moving from r to l) plus 1.\n\nTotal steps: (r - pos) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWait, but what if pos is greater than r? Then moving to r would require (pos - r) steps.\n\nSo perhaps it's better to model this as the sum of the movements and closures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps between the two possibilities is the minimal of the two.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's another way. What if the starting position is such that she can close both left and right without moving much?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can close the left and right without having to move all the way to l or r.\n\nWait, for example, if she's at a position where she can close both in a single step. But that's probably not possible except for specific cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps are the sum of the distance to l and r, plus 2, but that depends on the order.\n\nWait, let's think of the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4\n\nSo n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nWe need to close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\nWhat's the minimal steps?\n\nIn the note, it's 5 steps:\n\nMove to 2 (cost 1), close left (cost 1). Then move to 3 (cost 1), then to 4 (cost 1). Close right (cost 1). Total 5.\n\nSo according to our earlier formula for possibility 1, the steps are |3-2|=1, r-l=2, plus 2 steps for closures: 1+2+2=5, which matches.\n\nAnother sample: 6 3 1 3.\n\nHere, l=1, r=3. So she needs to close 4,5,6.\n\nShe can just close to the right of current position (pos=3), so no need to move. So steps: 1 (close right).\n\nWhich is the second sample.\n\nSo the approach seems to hold.\n\nThird sample: 5 2 1 5. So l=1, r=5. So no need to do anything. Output is 0.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nBut wait, what about when it's better to close right first, then left.\n\nLike, for example, n=10, pos=5, l=3, r=7.\n\nIf she closes right first:\n\nShe needs to move to r=7 (cost 2), close right (cost 1). Then move to l=3 (cost 4 steps). Close left (cost 1). Total steps: 2+1+4+1=8.\n\nIf she closes left first:\n\nMove to l=3 (cost 2), close left (1). Then move to r=7 (4 steps). Close right (1). Total: 2+1+4+1=8.\n\nSame steps.\n\nWhat if pos is closer to r?\n\nSay pos=8, l=3, r=7.\n\nWait, no, because r is 7, which is less than pos=8. So she can't close the right first because r is 7, which is the end of the needed segment.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial approach needs to account for whether l <= pos <= r.\n\nWait, no. Because even if pos is outside [l, r], she can move into it.\n\nBut let's think of another case.\n\nSuppose pos is to the right of r.\n\nn=10, pos=9, l=3, r=5.\n\nShe needs to close 6-10.\n\nSo option 1: close left first.\n\nShe needs to move to l=3: 9-3=6 steps. Close left (1). Then move to r=5: 3-5=2 steps (wait, 3 to 5 is 2 steps forward). Close right (1). Total steps: 6+1+2+1=10.\n\nOption 2: close right first.\n\nShe is at 9. To close right, she can do it immediately, but wait: to close right, she needs to be at a position i, and then close [i+1, b]. Initially, b is 10. So if she is at 9, closing right will close 10. But that's just one tab. But she needs to close 6-10, which is more than that.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when she is at 9, closing the right will close all tabs to the right of 9, which is only 10. So that's insufficient. So she needs to get to 6 to close the right.\n\nSo for option 2:\n\nShe needs to move to 6, then close right. Steps: 9-6=3 steps. Close right (1). Then she needs to move to 3: 6-3=3 steps. Close left (1). Total steps: 3+1+3+1=8 steps.\n\nThat's better than option 1's 10 steps.\n\nSo in this case, closing right first gives a better result.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach of considering both possibilities (close left first or right first) and taking the minimal of the two is necessary.\n\nSo the algorithm should compute both possibilities and choose the minimal.\n\nSo, let's formalize this.\n\nCompute two options:\n\nOption A: close left first, then right.\n\nOption B: close right first, then left.\n\nCompute the steps for each, then take the minimal.\n\nWait, but what about when l == r? Then, there's nothing to close on either side. So if l == r, the answer is zero.\n\nWait, no. Because l and r could be the same, but there might be tabs to close. Wait, no, if l=r, then [l, r] is a single tab, so all other tabs must be closed.\n\nBut in this case, the steps would involve moving to l, then closing left and right.\n\nWait, for example, n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3.\n\nShe needs to close tabs 1,2,4,5.\n\nSo she can:\n\nOption A: move to 3, close left (closes 1,2). Then move to 3, close right (closes 4,5). Steps: 0 (already at 3) + 1 (close left) + 0 (already at 3) +1 (close right) = 2 steps.\n\nOption B: same thing.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nSo the approach remains the same.\n\nSo, the steps for each option are as follows.\n\nFor Option A:\n\n1. Move from pos to l: cost is |pos - l|.\n\n2. Close left: cost 1.\n\n3. Move from l to r: cost is |l - r|.\n\n4. Close right: cost 1.\n\nTotal steps for option A: |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nFor Option B:\n\n1. Move from pos to r: cost is |pos - r|.\n\n2. Close right: cost 1.\n\n3. Move from r to l: cost is |r - l|.\n\n4. Close left: cost 1.\n\nTotal steps for option B: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nWait, but what if l > r? Because in the problem statement, l ≤ r, so that's not possible.\n\nSo, the total steps for each option is:\n\nOption A: (pos to l) + (l to r) + 2.\n\nOption B: (pos to r) + (r to l) + 2.\n\nWait, but (r to l) is same as (l to r), just in reverse. So |r - l| is the same as |l - r|.\n\nSo, the minimal steps would be the minimal between option A and option B.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where pos was 9, l=3, r=5:\n\nOption A steps: (9-3) + (5-3) + 2 = 6 + 2 + 2 = 10.\n\nOption B steps: (9-5) + (5-3) + 2 =4 +2 +2=8. Which is better.\n\nSo the minimal is 8.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nAnother test case: when l == r.\n\nAs in the third sample, but in a case where l != r.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nIn this case, l=1, r=3.\n\nOption A: move from 3 to 1: 2 steps. Close left: 1. Then move to 3: 2 steps. Close right: 1. Total 2+1+2+1=6.\n\nOption B: move to 3 (already there). Close right: 1. Then move to 1: 2 steps. Close left:1. Total steps: 0 +1 +2 +1 =4. Which is better.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the formula correctly computes the minimal steps.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- If l == r: then we need to close all tabs except l. So the steps would be 2: move to l (if needed), close left and right. Or, if l is already the current position, then 2 steps.\n\nWait, no. For example, if l=3, r=3, and pos is 3: then steps are 0 (no movement) + close left (1) + close right (1) → total 2.\n\nBut if l=3, r=3, and pos is 2: then steps for option A would be |2-3| (1) + 0 (since l to r is 0) + 2 → 3 steps. Option B: |2-3| (1) + 0 + 2 → 3 steps. So the minimal is 3 steps.\n\nWait, but why not just close left and right? So movement is needed.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, back to the approach.\n\nThus, the algorithm is as follows:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the steps for option A and option B as above, then take the minimal.\n\nBut wait, what if l == 1 and r < n? Or r == n and l >1? Then, the steps would include closing both ends.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\nCompute the steps for both options (A and B) and choose the minimal.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nSo, in Python, the steps would be:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nIf l == 1 and r == n:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   compute option_a = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2\n\n   compute option_b = |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2\n\n   min_steps = min(option_a, option_b)\n\n   print(min_steps)\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where l == r, the code would compute option_a and option_b as |pos - l| + 0 + 2, and |pos - l| + 0 +2. So same value.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nBut wait, let's test the case where l=3, r=3, pos=5.\n\noption_a: 5-3=2 +0 +2 →4.\n\noption_b:5-3=2 +0 +2 →4.\n\nSo minimal is 4.\n\nWhich is correct: move to 3 (2 steps), close left (1), close right (1). Or close right first, same steps.\n\nBut wait, when l=r, the code correctly adds 2 steps regardless.\n\nSo, the code seems solid.\n\nWait, but what about when l=2, r=4, and pos=3. Then option_a is 0 +2 +2=4. option_b is 0 +2 +2=4. So 4 steps. But in the first sample, it's 5 steps. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, in the first sample, the steps were 5, but according to the code, for pos=3, l=2, r=4:\n\noption_a: |3-2|=1, (4-2)=2, +2 → total 5 steps.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=10, pos=9, l=3, r=5.\n\noption_a: |9-3|=6, 5-3=2, +2 → 10.\n\noption_b: |9-5|=4, 5-3=2, +2 →8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=5, pos=5, l=3, r=3.\n\noption_a: 5-3=2, 0, +2 →4.\n\noption_b:5-3=2, 0, +2 →4.\n\nSo minimal is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: pos is 1, l=3, r=4.\n\nn=6.\n\nSo option_a: move from 1 to 3 (2 steps), close left (1). Then move to 4 (1 step), close right (1). Total 2+1+1+1=5.\n\noption_b: move to 4 (3 steps), close right (1). Then move to 3 (1 step), close left (1). Total 3+1+1+1=6.\n\nSo option_a is better.\n\nSo code returns 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when l=1, r=5, and pos=3.\n\nThen, according to the code, option_a is |3-1|=2, 5-1=4, +2 → 2+4+2=8.\n\nBut in reality, she needs to close all tabs to the right of 5 (none), and left of 1 (none). So she doesn't need to do anything. So the code should return 0.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, the initial check is if l==1 and r ==n, then output 0.\n\nIn this case, l=1, r=5, n=5 → yes, so output is 0.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r=5, but n is larger, say n=10.\n\nIn that case, l=1, r=5, n=10. So she needs to close 6-10.\n\nSo option_a: |pos -1| + (5-1) +2.\n\nOption_b: |pos-5| + (5-1)+2.\n\nBut in the code, the initial check is if l ==1 and r ==n → which is false here.\n\nSo the code proceeds.\n\nSo the code correctly handles that.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code, the initial check is if l ==1 and r ==n, output 0.\n\nIn the case where n=10, l=1, r=5, the initial check fails, so the code proceeds to compute the steps.\n\nWhich is correct, because she needs to close 6-10.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nIf l ==1 and r ==n:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   option_a = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n   option_b = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n   min_steps = min(option_a, option_b)\n\n   print(min_steps)\n\nWait, but wait: in the case where l> r, but according to the problem statement, l ≤ r.\n\nSo no need to handle that.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nBut let me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4.\n\nl=2, r=4.\n\nl !=1 and r !=6.\n\noption_a: |3-2|=1, 2, +2 →5.\n\noption_b: |3-4|=1, 2, +2 →5.\n\nSo min is 5. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\n6 3 1 3.\n\nl=1, r=3 <6.\n\noption_a: |3-1|=2, 2, +2 →6.\n\noption_b: |3-3|=0, 2, +2 →4.\n\nSo min is 4. Correct.\n\nSample3:\n\n5 2 1 5 → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=10, pos=9, l=3, r=5.\n\noption_a: 6+2+2=10.\n\noption_b:4+2+2=8.\n\nSo min is 8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=3, r=3.\n\noption_a: 2+0+2=4.\n\noption_b: same.\n\nSo correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=3, r=5.\n\noption_a: |2-3|=1, 2, +2 →5.\n\noption_b: |2-5|=3, 2, +2 →7.\n\nSo min is 5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nShe can move to 3 (1 step), close left (1 step). Then move to 5 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code correctly computes it.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo, now, time to write the code.\n\nThe code needs to read four integers from input.\n\nHandle the case where l==1 and r==n → output 0.\n\nElse, compute option_a and option_b as described, and output the minimal.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option_a = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n    option_b = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n    print(min(option_a, option_b))\n\nWait, but wait! What about when the initial position is outside [l, r]? For example, pos is 0 (invalid) or n+1 (invalid), but according to the problem statement, pos is between 1 and n, inclusive.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nWait, but in the code, when l=1 and r=5, but n=10, the code correctly proceeds.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=1, r=2, n=2.\n\nShe needs to close nothing, because l=1, r=2 equals n=2. So code prints 0.\n\nBut wait, n=2, l=1, r=2.\n\nSo yes, output 0.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=2, n=5. She needs to close 1,3,4,5.\n\nShe can:\n\nOption A: move to 2, close left (1 step). Then move to 2, close right (1 step). So steps: |pos -2| + 0 + 2.\n\nWait, pos is say 3.\n\noption_a: 1 +0 +2 →3.\n\noption_b: |3-2|=1 +0 +2 →3.\n\nSo code returns 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nSo, the final code is as written.\n",

The goal is to minimize the time taken to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n2. **Key Insight**: We need to consider two main strategies:\n   - Close the left side first, then the right side.\n   - Close the right side first, then the left side.\n\n3. **Steps Calculation**:\n   - **Option A**: Move to the left end of the segment (l), close the left tabs, then move to the right end (r), and close the right tabs.\n   - **Option B**: Move to the right end of the segment (r), close the right tabs, then move to the left end (l), and close the left tabs.\n\n4. **Formula**: For each option, compute the total steps required and take the minimum of the two.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option_a = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n    option_b = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n    print(min(option_a, option_b))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Trivial Case Check**: If the segment [l, r] covers all tabs from 1 to n, no action is needed, so we print 0.\n- **Option A Calculation**: Calculate the steps to move to l, close the left tabs, move to r, and close the right tabs.\n- **Option B Calculation**: Calculate the steps to move to r, close the right tabs, move to l, and close the left tabs.\n- **Result**: Print the minimum steps required from both options.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal steps needed by considering both possible orders of closing the tabs, thus providing an optimal solution.",
