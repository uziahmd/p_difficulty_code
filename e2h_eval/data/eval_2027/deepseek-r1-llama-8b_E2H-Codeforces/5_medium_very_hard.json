Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves.

The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. And also, output these pairs along with the count.\n\nHmm. Let me try to understand the problem better.\n\nSo, each left boot has a color (a lowercase letter or '?'), same for right boots. Two colors are compatible if they're the same or one is '?'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, according to the description: an indefinite color (i.e., '?') is compatible with any specific or indefinite color. So, when either is '?', they are compatible. Otherwise, their colors must be exactly the same.\n\nSo, for example:\n- 'f' and 'f' are compatible.\n- '?' and 'z' are compatible.\n- 'a' and '?' are compatible.\n- '?' and '?' are compatible.\n\nBut 'f' and 'g' are not, and 'a' and 'z' aren't.\n\nSo, the task is to pair each left boot with a right boot, without reusing any, such that the number of compatible pairs is maximized.\n\nI need to compute the maximum possible k, and then list all such pairs.\n\nThe output requires the count and then each pair in order, with all left indices unique and right indices unique as well.\n\nNow, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, considering the constraints: n can be up to 150,000, which is quite large. So any O(n^2) solution is out of the question. We need something efficient, probably O(n log n) or similar.\n\nLet me think about what we can do.\n\nOne approach is to model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between left and right boots that are compatible. Then, finding the maximum matching would give the maximum number of pairs. However, maximum bipartite matching for n=1.5e5 is impossible because that's way too big.\n\nSo, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: group left and right boots by their color (or more precisely, by their compatible groups), and find the maximum possible matches between these groups.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to represent the left and right boots in a way that allows us to count the overlaps and match them optimally.\n\nLet me think: for each left boot, determine which right boots are compatible. Then, find the best way to assign lefts to rights without conflicts.\n\nBut again, this seems too slow for n=150,000.\n\nAlternative approach: since the compatibility is based on whether the pair is the same or at least one is '?', maybe we can model this by counting the frequency of each color and handling the '?' cases.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nFor each left boot, it can be paired with any right boot that has the same color as it, or any right boot that is '?'.\n\nSimilarly, a right boot can be paired with any left that is the same color, or any left that is '?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal strategy involves:\n\n1. Pairing as many '?' on the left with specific colors on the right, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the '?' can be on both sides, so perhaps we need to consider how to utilize them.\n\nAlternatively, let's separate the problem into two parts:\n\na) Non-'?' pairs: For each color c, find the minimum of the count of lefts and rights of color c. Summing these gives the base number of pairs.\n\nb) Then, handle the '?' leftovers: the remaining lefts (after non-'?' pairs) can be paired with the remaining rights (which may include '?'), but wait, no—because the remaining could have '?' on either side.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because '?' can be matched with anything.\n\nSo, perhaps the process is:\n\n1. First, for each specific color c, count how many lefts and rights have color c. The minimum of those is added to the total.\n\n2. Then, collect all the remaining lefts (those that couldn't be paired in step 1) and all the remaining rights (similarly). Now, any left can be paired with any right, including the remaining '?'. So, the maximum possible additional pairs is the minimum of the counts of the remaining lefts and remaining rights.\n\nWait, but that might not capture all possibilities correctly because some lefts could have been '?' and some rights could have been '?', but after step 1, the '?''s are still there and can form more pairs.\n\nHmm, maybe I should model this as:\n\nCompute the maximum number of pairs as:\n\nmax_pairs = sum for each color c (min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])) + min(remaining_left, remaining_right)\n\nwhere remaining_left is the total number of lefts not accounted for in step 1, and similarly for remaining_right.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because in step 1, we've only considered pairs where both are specific colors. But the remaining lefts could include '?', and the remaining rights could include '?', which can form pairs among themselves.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\n- Compute for each color c, the number of lefts and rights of color c, add min of those to the total.\n\n- Then, calculate the number of lefts that are '?', say L_q, and the number of rights that are '?', R_q.\n\n- Additionally, any left that's not '?', say L_notq, and any right that's not '?', R_notq.\n\nWait, no. Maybe after step 1, all the specific colors are used as much as possible. The remaining lefts and rights can be any color (including '?').\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional pairs is the minimum of the total remaining lefts and total remaining rights.\n\nBut wait, because any remaining left can pair with any remaining right, regardless of their specific colors.\n\nYes, because if a left is '?', it can pair with any right (even if the right is '?'). Similarly, if a right is '?', it can pair with any left.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional pairs is the minimum of (number of lefts remaining) and (number of rights remaining).\n\nSo, the total pairs would be sum_c min(left_c, right_c) + min(total_remaining_left, total_remaining_right).\n\nBut how do we calculate the sum correctly, and how do we manage the remaining lefts and rights?\n\nWait, let's think about the steps.\n\nStep 1: For each color c (excluding '?'), compute how many lefts and rights have that color. Take the minimum of the two and add to the total.\n\nThis handles all pairs where both are specific colors.\n\nThen, the remaining lefts and rights are those that are either '?' or were part of the unpaired specific colors.\n\nWait, no. Because after step 1, the specific colors are fully accounted for. So, the remaining lefts are the ones that couldn't be paired in step 1, i.e., either their color wasn't present on the right, or the right's count was less than the left's.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose for color c, left has 5, right has 3. Then, 3 pairs are made. The remaining lefts for color c are 2, but these lefts cannot pair with any right of color c anymore because all 3 are used.\n\nBut perhaps these lefts can pair with other colors or '?'\n\nNo, because in step 1, we've already considered all possible pairs between the same color. So, the remaining lefts can't pair with any right of the same color beyond what's been accounted for.\n\nBut when considering the remaining, they can pair with any right (including '?').\n\nSo, after step 1, the remaining lefts and rights can be any color, including '?', and they can pair with each other.\n\nSo, the total additional pairs would be the minimum of the number of remaining lefts and the number of remaining rights.\n\nBut how do we compute the remaining lefts and rights?\n\nWait, the initial left and right counts can be broken down as:\n\nleft_counts[c] = number of lefts of color c.\n\nright_counts[c] = number of rights of color c.\n\nAfter step 1, for each c, we take min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]) pairs. So, the remaining lefts for color c is left_counts[c] - min(...), which is max(0, left_counts[c] - right_counts[c]).\n\nSimilarly for right_counts[c].\n\nBut wait, the remaining lefts and rights are the sum over all colors of (left_counts[c] - min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c])), but only if that difference is positive.\n\nWait, no. Because for each color c, the lefts that couldn't be paired are (left_counts[c] - right_counts[c]) if left_counts[c] > right_counts[c]. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSimilarly for the rights: for each color c, the rights that couldn't be paired are (right_counts[c] - left_counts[c]) if right_counts[c] > left_counts[c], otherwise zero.\n\nSo, the total remaining lefts is sum over c (max(0, left_counts[c] - right_counts[c])).\n\nSimilarly, the total remaining rights is sum over c (max(0, right_counts[c] - left_counts[c])).\n\nWait, no. Because for each color c, the number of lefts that couldn't be paired is (left_counts[c] - right_counts[c]) if left_counts[c] > right_counts[c], else 0.\n\nSo, the total remaining lefts is sum for all c of max(0, left_counts[c] - right_counts[c]).\n\nSimilarly, the total remaining rights is sum for all c of max(0, right_counts[c] - left_counts[c]).\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect. Because for each color c, the sum of all lefts is equal to sum_c left_counts[c], but after pairing, the sum of all paired lefts is sum_c min(l_c, r_c), which is the same as sum_c min(r_c, l_c) because min is symmetric.\n\nWait, no, because for each c, we take min(l_c, r_c), so the sum is the same as the sum of min(l_c, r_c) across all c.\n\nBut that doesn't directly help with the remaining lefts and rights.\n\nWait, perhaps the total remaining lefts is the sum for all c of (left_counts[c] - min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]))).\n\nWhich simplifies to sum(max(left_counts[c] - right_counts[c], 0)).\n\nSimilarly, the total remaining rights is sum(max(right_counts[c] - left_counts[c], 0)).\n\nBut adding these two together, we get sum_{c} (left_counts[c] - min(l_c, r_c) ) + sum_{c} (right_counts[c] - min(l_c, r_c)) )\n\nWhich is equal to sum (left_counts[c] - min(l_c, r_c) + right_counts[c] - min(l_c, r_c)) \n\n= sum (left_counts[c] + right_counts[c] - 2 * min(l_c, r_c))\n\nBut min(l_c, r_c) is the same as the smaller of the two, so for each c, left_counts[c] + right_counts[c] - 2*min(l_c, r_c) is equal to |left_counts[c] - right_counts[c]|.\n\nSo the total remaining lefts plus remaining rights is equal to sum |l_c - r_c| for all c.\n\nBut that's just a mathematical property; perhaps it's not directly useful here.\n\nWait, but the total remaining lefts and rights is sum (max(0, l_c - r_c)) + sum (max(0, r_c - l_c)) ) = sum |l_c - r_c|.\n\nBut when you add the total remaining lefts and the total remaining rights, you get sum |l_c - r_c|.\n\nBut the maximum additional pairs is the minimum between the total remaining lefts and the total remaining rights.\n\nBecause each pair uses one left and one right.\n\nSo, the additional pairs can't exceed the minimum of these two.\n\nThus, the total maximum pairs is the sum from step 1 plus the minimum of the remaining lefts and the remaining rights.\n\nSo, to compute this:\n\n1. For each color c, compute l_c and r_c.\n\n2. For each c, add min(l_c, r_c) to the total.\n\n3. Compute the sum of (l_c - r_c) where l_c > r_c, which is the total remaining lefts.\n\n4. Compute the sum of (r_c - l_c) where r_c > l_c, which is the total remaining rights.\n\n5. The additional pairs is min(remaining_lefts, remaining_rights).\n\n6. Total pairs is sum_min + additional_pairs.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where some of the remaining lefts are '?', and some of the remaining rights are '?'. Because '?' can pair with each other.\n\nIn our current approach, the additional_pairs is the minimum of the remaining lefts and rights, regardless of their color. Because any left can pair with any right.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the remaining lefts and rights, there are some '?', which can pair with each other. So, for example, if after step 1, there are 5 lefts that are '?', and 3 rights that are '?', the additional_pairs can be 3, using 3 of the 5 '? lefts.\n\nBut in our approach, the additional_pairs is min(5,3)=3, which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach seems valid.\n\nBut now, the next step is to model this correctly.\n\nBut wait, another point: the '? can also pair with non-'? 'boots. So, in step 1, when we handle specific colors, the '?' are not considered. Then, in step 2, the remaining includes the '?'.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute all the pairs.\n\nBut the output requires not just the count, but the actual list of pairs.\n\nSo, how to model this.\n\nWe need to collect all the pairs, ensuring that each left is used once, each right is used once.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nBecause the initial approach only gives the count, but the actual selection of pairs matters.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each color c, create as many pairs as possible between l and r of color c.\n\n2. For the remaining lefts (those not used in step 1) and the remaining rights, create as many pairs as possible, regardless of color.\n\nBut how to do this in code, especially in a way that can be implemented efficiently.\n\nSo, perhaps the algorithm is:\n\n- For each color c, pair as many l and r as possible.\n\n- Collect all the l indices and r indices used in these pairs.\n\n- Then, for the remaining l's and r's, pair them as per the additional_pairs.\n\nBut the challenge is to track which indices to use.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, this needs to be done efficiently.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each color c, pair the first min(l_count, r_count) lefts and rights.\n\n   - We can collect these pairs, mark the used lefts and rights.\n\n   - For each c, take the first x lefts and x rights, where x is the min of l_count and r_count.\n\n   - So, for each c, the pairs are (i, j) where i is the ith left in c, and j is the ith right in c.\n\n2. After step 1, collect all the remaining lefts and rights.\n\n3. For step 2, we can pair the remaining lefts with the remaining rights, regardless of their color.\n\n   - How? We can collect all the remaining lefts (in order) and all the remaining rights (in order), then pair the first 'k' of each, where k is the additional_pairs.\n\n   - But we need to select which ones to pair.\n\nBut the issue is that the selection of which pairs to take in step 2 is arbitrary, as long as the count is correct. So, for the purpose of the problem, any valid selection is acceptable.\n\nBut for the output, we need to print the actual pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps in step 1, we can collect all the pairs for each c, and in step 2, collect all the remaining lefts and rights, and then pair the first 'k' of each.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining lefts and rights in a way that allows us to pair as many as possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps in step 1, for each color c, the first x lefts and rights are used. So, for each c, we can collect the list of left indices and right indices for that c, and then mark them as used.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, the remaining lefts are all the ones not marked as used, and similarly for the rights.\n\nThen, in step 2, the additional_pairs can be formed by pairing the remaining lefts and rights.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\n- For each left and right, determine if it's used in step 1.\n\n- Then, collect the remaining lefts and rights.\n\n- Sort them in some order, and pair the first min(k, len(remaining_lefts), len(remaining_rights)) of them.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nWait, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n- Create a list for each color c, containing the indices of lefts and rights of that color.\n\n- For each c, take min(l_count, r_count) pairs, using the first min(l_count, r_count) lefts and rights.\n\n- Mark these lefts and rights as used.\n\n- Collect the remaining lefts and rights, which are all the ones not used in step 1.\n\n- Then, for the remaining, pair the first k of each, where k is the additional_pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining lefts and rights.\n\nPerhaps:\n\n- Have arrays used_left and used_right, initialized to False.\n\n- For each c in all colors (including '?'):\n\n   - x = min(l_counts[c], r_counts[c])\n\n   - For i in 0..x-1:\n\n      - mark used_left[l_indices[c][i]] = True\n\n      - mark used_right[r_indices[c][i]] = True\n\n      - record the pair (l_indices[c][i]+1, r_indices[c][i]+1) [since output is 1-based]\n\n- Then, collect all the lefts not marked as used. These are the remaining lefts.\n\n- Similarly, collect all the rights not marked as used. These are the remaining rights.\n\n- Then, take the first min(k, len(remaining_lefts), len(remaining_rights)) pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining_lefts and remaining_rights.\n\nWait, but the order in which we process the colors may affect which lefts and rights are used first, thus affecting which ones are available for step 2.\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid selection, it's acceptable.\n\nBut the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nNow, let's think about data structures.\n\nEach color can be represented as a key in a dictionary, with the value being a list of left indices and a list of right indices.\n\nBut for n up to 1.5e5, and each left and right having a color, the storage is manageable.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\n- l_counts: a dictionary mapping color to list of left indices.\n\n- r_counts: a dictionary mapping color to list of right indices.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to precompute for each color, the list of left indices in the order they appear, and same for right.\n\nSo, for the left string l, for each position i, we can group the indices by their color.\n\nSame for the right string r.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\ncolor_l = defaultdict(list)\ncolor_r = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor idx, c in enumerate(l):\n    color_l[c].append(idx+1)  # since output is 1-based\n\nfor idx, c in enumerate(r):\n    color_r[c].append(idx+1)\n\nNow, for each color c, the lists color_l[c] and color_r[c] contain the 1-based indices of left and right boots of color c.\n\nThen, for each color c, we can process as follows:\n\ntotal_pairs = 0\nused_left = [False] * (n+1)\nused_right = [False] * (n+1)\n\nfor c in color_l:\n    # Get the list of left indices for color c\n    l_list = color_l[c]\n    r_list = color_r.get(c, [])\n    x = min(len(l_list), len(r_list))\n    total_pairs += x\n    for i in range(x):\n        used_left[l_list[i]] = True\n        used_right[r_list[i]] = True\n\n# Now, collect remaining lefts and rights\nremaining_left = []\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    if not used_left[i]:\n        remaining_left.append(i)\n\nremaining_right = []\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    if not used_right[i]:\n        remaining_right.append(i)\n\nadditional_pairs = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right))\ntotal_pairs += additional_pairs\n\n# Now, we need to collect all the pairs.\n\npairs = []\n\n# Step 1: add the pairs from the color processing\nfor c in color_l:\n    l_list = color_l[c]\n    r_list = color_r.get(c, [])\n    x = min(len(l_list), len(r_list))\n    for i in range(x):\n        pairs.append( (l_list[i], r_list[i]) )\n\n# Step 2: add the additional pairs\nk = additional_pairs\nif k > 0:\n    # Take the first k from remaining_left and remaining_right\n    for i in range(k):\n        pairs.append( (remaining_left[i], remaining_right[i]) )\n\n# Now, ensure that all lefts and rights are unique in the pairs.\n\nWait, but in the pairs collected, the left indices may not be unique if some color processing added the same index multiple times. But no, because in step 1, each left index is used once at most, as for each color c, the same left index cannot appear in multiple color lists.\n\nWait, no. Each left index corresponds to exactly one color. Because in the l string, each character is a color or '?'. So, each left index is in exactly one color's list.\n\nSo, in step 1, each left index is added once.\n\nSimilarly for right indices.\n\nSo, the pairs in step 1 are all unique.\n\nIn step 2, the remaining_left and remaining_right are all left and right indices that were not used in step 1, so they are unique.\n\nThus, the pairs collected in step 2 are also unique.\n\nSo, the entire list of pairs is correct.\n\nBut wait, in step 2, the order in which we take the pairs may vary. Since the problem allows any valid solution, the order does not matter.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in step 2, when collecting the remaining_left and remaining_right, the order in which they are stored is the order of their original positions. So, the first element in remaining_left is the earliest unused left index, etc.\n\nSo, when we pair them in order, the first k elements will be the earliest possible, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, testing this approach against the sample input.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\ncodeforces\ndodivthree\n9\nbambarbia\nhellocode\n10\ncode??????\n??????test\n\nSample Output:\n\n5\n7 8\n4 9\n2 2\n9 10\n3 1\n\nWait, perhaps the code needs to correctly group and pair.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps it's better to proceed.\n\nSo, in code, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n.\n\n2. Read l and r.\n\n3. Preprocess color_l and color_r.\n\n4. Process each color in color_l, pairing as much as possible.\n\n5. Collect the used_left and used_right flags.\n\n6. Collect the remaining lefts and rights.\n\n7. Compute additional_pairs.\n\n8. Collect all the pairs in the order of step 1 and step 2.\n\nFinally, output the total_pairs, followed by the list of pairs.\n\nBut now, the issue is that in the sample input, the code may not produce the same order as the sample output, but the problem statement allows any valid output.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All lefts are '?', and all rights are '?': then, the maximum pairs is min(n, n) = n.\n\n- Some lefts are '?', and some rights are '?', but others are specific.\n\nAnother edge case: some colors have left counts and right counts, but one color has more lefts than rights, and another has more rights than lefts. For example, color 'a' has 3 lefts and 5 rights, and color 'b' has 5 lefts and 3 rights. Then, step 1 would pair 3 'a's with 3 'a's, and 3 'b's with 3 'b's. Then, the remaining lefts are 2 'a's and 2 'b's, and the remaining rights are 2 'b's and 2 'a's. The additional_pairs would be min(4,4) =4, which would pair the remaining 2 'a's and 2 'b's (wait, no, the remaining lefts would be 2 'a's (3-3=0?), no, wait: for 'a', left is 3, right is 5. So, step 1 pairs 3 'a's with 3 'a's. So, remaining lefts for 'a' is 0, and remaining rights for 'a' is 2.\n\nFor 'b', left is 5, right is 3. So step 1 pairs 3 'b's with 3 'b's. Remaining lefts for 'b' is 2, and remaining rights for 'b' is 0.\n\nSo, the total remaining lefts are 0 + 2 = 2. Remaining rights are 2 (from 'a') + 0 = 2. So, additional_pairs is 2.\n\nSo, total_pairs is 3 + 3 + 2 = 8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the approach works.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the code may have issues with the order in which colors are processed. Because, for example, if a color 'c' appears later in the color list, but has higher priority, but the way the code processes the colors may affect which lefts are used in step 1.\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid selection, the order of processing colors in step 1 doesn't matter.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that the remaining lefts and rights are collected in the order of their original indices, so the code may pick them in that order, which is fine.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the output has 5 pairs, which is the maximum possible.\n\nAnother thing: in the code, when processing the colors, we loop through color_l. But the order of the colors is based on the keys in the defaultdict, which is insertion order in Python 3.7 and above. So, the order is determined by the order of appearance in the strings l and r.\n\nBut since the order doesn't matter, it's acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should proceed as described.\n\nNow, the code outline is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nBuild color_l and color_r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as arrays of False, size n+1.\n\nLoop through each color c in color_l:\n\n   l_list = color_l[c]\n\n   r_list = color_r[c] if exists, else empty list.\n\n   x = min(len(l_list), len(r_list)).\n\n   for i in 0 to x-1:\n\n      mark used_left[l_list[i]] and used_right[r_list[i]] as True.\n\n      add (l_list[i], r_list[i]) to pairs.\n\nCollect the remaining_left and remaining_right.\n\nadditional_pairs = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right)).\n\nAdd to pairs as (remaining_left[i], remaining_right[i]) for i in 0 to additional_pairs-1.\n\nSort the pairs? No, because the output can be in any order, as long as all left and right indices are unique.\n\nWait, but in the sample output, the pairs are listed in a particular order, but the problem says any valid order is acceptable.\n\nThus, no need to sort.\n\nFinally, output the total_pairs, followed by the list of pairs.\n\nBut wait, the code in the sample output seems to have variable orderings, but in any case, the code as written will collect the pairs in the order of step 1 and then step 2.\n\nBut in the sample output, the step 2 pairs are ordered in a way that may not match, but since any order is acceptable, it's okay.\n\nNow, let's test the code.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l='?', r='a'.\n\nThen, step 1: for color 'a', l_list is empty, r_list has 1. So, no pairs.\n\nThen, step 2: remaining_left is 1 (the left '?'), remaining_right is 1 (right 'a'). additional_pairs is 1.\n\nSo, total_pairs is 1.\n\nAnd the pair is (1, 1).\n\nWait, no: the pair is (1, 2) since it's 1-based.\n\nWait, no, the left is index 1, right is 2.\n\nSo, the pair is (1,2).\n\nThus, the code would output 1, followed by (1,2).\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l='a?'; r='?a'.\n\nSo, l is ['a', '?'].\n\nr is ['?', 'a'].\n\ncolor_l['a'] = [1], color_l['?'] = [2].\n\ncolor_r['?'] = [1], color_r['a'] = [2].\n\nProcessing step 1:\n\nFor 'a':\n\nl_list is [1], r_list is [2].\n\nx=1. So, pair (1,2). used_left[1]=True, used_right[2]=True.\n\nFor '?': l_list is [2], r_list is [1].\n\nx=1. Pair (2,1). used_left[2]=True, used_right[1]=True.\n\nRemaining_left is empty. So, additional_pairs is 0.\n\nTotal pairs: 2.\n\nOutput would be:\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2 1\n\nWhich is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3.\n\nl = \"abc\"\n\nr = \"cba\"\n\ncolor_l: a:1, b:2, c:3.\n\ncolor_r: c:1, b:2, a:3.\n\nstep 1: for each color, min(1,1) for a, b, c.\n\nso, 1+1+1=3 pairs.\n\nused_left: 1,2,3.\n\nused_right:1,2,3.\n\nremaining_left: none. So, additional_pairs 0.\n\nThus, total_pairs 3.\n\nPairs are (1,3), (2,2), (3,1).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the final code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when processing the color_l, the code iterates over all keys in color_l, which may not include '?', but perhaps '? 'is a possible color.\n\nYes, because in the color_l and color_r, '?' is treated as a color.\n\nThus, the code correctly processes '? 'boots.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots. Each boot has a color, which can be a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Two boots are compatible if they have the same color or if one of them is a question mark.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Boots by Color**: First, we group the left and right boots by their respective colors using dictionaries. This helps in efficiently finding pairs for each color.\n2. **Pair Specific Colors**: For each color, we count the minimum number of left and right boots available and form pairs. This ensures that we maximize the number of specific color pairs.\n3. **Handle Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, any remaining left or right boots that couldn't be paired with a specific color can still form pairs if either is a question mark. We collect these remaining boots and form additional pairs based on the minimum count of remaining left and right boots.\n4. **Collect and Output Pairs**: Finally, we collect all the pairs formed in both steps and output the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    color_l = defaultdict(list)\n    for idx, c in enumerate(l):\n        color_l[c].append(idx + 1)  # Using 1-based indexing\n\n    color_r = defaultdict(list)\n    for idx, c in enumerate(r):\n        color_r[c].append(idx + 1)\n\n    used_left = [False] * (n + 1)\n    used_right = [False] * (n + 1)\n    pairs = []\n\n    for c in color_l:\n        l_list = color_l[c]\n        r_list = color_r.get(c, [])\n        x = min(len(l_list), len(r_list))\n        for i in range(x):\n            used_left[l_list[i]] = True\n            used_right[r_list[i]] = True\n            pairs.append((l_list[i], r_list[i]))\n\n    remaining_left = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            remaining_left.append(i)\n\n    remaining_right = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            remaining_right.append(i)\n\n    additional_pairs = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right))\n    total_pairs = len(pairs) + additional_pairs\n\n    for i in range(additional_pairs):\n        pairs.append((remaining_left[i], remaining_right[i]))\n\n    print(total_pairs)\n    for pair in pairs:\n        print(pair[0], pair[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective colors.\n2. **Grouping by Color**: The left and right boots are grouped into dictionaries where each key is a color and the value is a list of indices (1-based) of the boots having that color.\n3. **Forming Pairs for Specific Colors**: For each color, we form as many pairs as possible by taking the minimum count of left and right boots of that color.\n4. **Handling Remaining Boots**: Any left or right boot that couldn't be paired with a specific color is collected, and additional pairs are formed by matching these remaining boots.\n5. **Output**: The total number of pairs is printed, followed by the list of pairs in the order they were formed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently maximize the number of compatible pairs while handling both specific colors and question marks appropriately.",
