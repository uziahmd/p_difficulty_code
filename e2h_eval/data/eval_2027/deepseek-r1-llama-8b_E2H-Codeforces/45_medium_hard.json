There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where n players participate in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, so for example, when n=2, there's only one game, so the output is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games: first against someone, then against another. But wait, how does that work exactly?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. Each game eliminates one player, so the total number of games is always n-1. But the question isn't about the total; it's about the path the winner takes.\n\nThe winner starts with zero games played. Each time they win, they play a game and their count increases by one. But the opponent must have a game count that's either equal or differs by one.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the longest possible sequence of games the winner can participate in, given the constraints on the opponents' previous game counts.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to building a binary tree where each node represents a game the winner plays. Each node (game) must have children that represent the next possible games, ensuring the difference in game counts is at most one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a Fibonacci-like sequence. Because each step depends on the sum of certain previous steps.\n\nLet me consider small examples:\n\nn=2: 1 game.\nn=3: 2 games. How? The winner plays two games. So the first game is against someone (say A), then in the second game, they face someone else (B). But wait, B could have played one game before, since the winner has played one. So yes, that works.\n\nn=4: The sample says the maximum is 2. So the winner plays two games. How? Maybe the initial structure is such that the winner plays in two rounds, but the third round isn't possible because the opponent would have two more games than the winner.\n\nWait, let's see: for n=4, the winner can't play three games. Why? Because after two wins, the winner has played two games. To play a third game, the opponent must have played either one or two games.\n\nBut wait, in the third game, the opponent could be someone who has also played two games. How is that possible?\n\nLike, the opponent could have won two games themselves. So the tournament structure would be something like:\n\nRound 1: 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4. Winners are 1 and 3 (assuming they win).\nRound 2: 1 vs 3. Then the final is 1 vs someone else? No, that's not possible because n=4. Wait, perhaps the tournament is arranged so that the winner can't have a third game because there aren't enough players left.\n\nHmm, perhaps the way the tournament is structured is such that the winner can't have more than a certain number of games based on the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k where the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to n.\n\nBecause each step in the Fibonacci sequence represents adding a new layer of possible opponents.\n\nFor example:\n\nk=1: needs 2 players → F(3)=2\nk=2: needs 3 players → F(4)=3\nk=3: needs 5 players → F(5)=5\nk=4: needs 8 players → F(6)=8\n\nWait, but in the sample input where n=10, the output is 4. Let's check:\n\nF(7)=13, which is larger than 10. So the maximum k where F(k+2) <=10 is k=4, since F(6)=8 <=10 < F(7)=13.\n\nYes, that matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=4.\n\nF(6)=8>4, so the maximum k is 2 (since F(4)=3<=4 < F(5)=5). So the output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSimilarly, n=3: F(4)=3<=3 < F(5)=5, so k=2.\n\nSo the approach is to find the largest k where F(k+2) <=n. The maximum number of games the winner can play is k.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, what's the relation between k and F numbers.\n\nLet me see:\n\nk=1: F(3) = 2\nk=2: F(4)=3\nk=3: F(5)=5\nk=4: F(6)=8\nk=5: F(7)=13\n\nSo for a given k, the minimal number of players required is F(k+2). So the maximum k is the largest integer where F(k+2) ≤n.\n\nSo, our task is to compute the largest k such that F(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo, for example, n=10:\n\nF(6)=8 <=10, F(7)=13>10. So k=4.\n\nWhich gives 4 games.\n\nSo, the algorithm should be:\n\n1. Precompute Fibonacci numbers until F(k) exceeds n, keeping track of k.\n\n2. For each n, find the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n.\n\nOnce we have k, that's the answer.\n\nWait, let's test another case. For n=5:\n\nF(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5.\n\nSo for k=3, F(5)=5<=5. So the answer is 3.\n\nWhat would the tournament look like? The winner would have to play 3 games.\n\nLet me see:\n\nGame 1: winner plays someone (needs 0 games from opponent, so possible).\n\nGame 2: plays someone who has 0 or 1 games. Since they've just started, the opponent could have 0.\n\nGame 3: Now the winner has 2 games. The opponent must have 1 or 2. So the opponent could have 1 game.\n\nHow is that possible? The opponent could have beaten someone in the first round, then lost in the next.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is:\n\nRound 1: winner (W) vs A (0 games) → W wins, now W has 1 game.\n\nRound 2: W vs B (who has 1 game). W wins, now W has 2 games.\n\nRound 3: W vs C (who has 0 games). Wait, no, because C hasn't played any games yet. So the difference is 2, which is more than 1. So that's not allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the third game requires the opponent to have 1 game.\n\nSo, how can the opponent have 1 game? They must have won once, meaning they had to beat someone.\n\nSo, perhaps the tournament structure is:\n\nRound 1: W vs A → W wins (1 game)\nRound 2: B vs C → B wins (1 game)\nRound 3: W vs B → W wins (2 games)\nRound 4: D vs E → D wins (1 game)\nRound 5: B vs D → B wins (2 games)\nRound 6: W vs B → W wins (3 games)\n\nWait, but n=5. So that would require 5 players, but perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of games is 3 when n=5, as per the logic above.\n\nSo, the approach is to precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to F(k) where F(k+2) > n, then take the maximum k.\n\nNow, the plan is to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, I'll generate the Fibonacci sequence, starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, etc., but wait, no. Let me think about the base cases.\n\nWait, the initial conditions for the Fibonacci sequence in this context are:\n\nk=1: needs F(3)=2 players.\n\nk=2: F(4)=3 players.\n\nk=3: F(5)=5 players.\n\nSo the sequence for k is 1,2,3,4,... and the required players are 2,3,5,8,13...\n\nSo the code will:\n\n- Initialize a list or variables for the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n- Iterate, adding the next Fibonacci number each time, until the number exceeds n.\n\n- Keep track of the current maximum k.\n\nWait, let's outline the steps:\n\nInitialize a and b as the first two Fibonacci numbers beyond the base case.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to generate the Fibonacci numbers in order, starting from 2, 3, 5, etc., and for each, determine the k value.\n\nWait, for each i, F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2). So perhaps:\n\nWe can start with f_prev = 2 (for k=1), f_curr = 3 (for k=2). Then, each next step is f_prev += f_curr, and so on.\n\nWait, but in code:\n\nWe can have a loop where we keep track of the current and next Fibonacci numbers.\n\nLet me see:\n\nInitialize:\n\na = 2 (F(3))\n\nb = 3 (F(4))\n\nk = 2.\n\nThen, while b <=n:\n\n   increment k by 1.\n\n   a, b = b, a + b.\n\nWait, no. Because for each step, the next required players is a + b.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWe need to find the largest k where F(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo for k=1: F(3)=2.\n\nk=2: F(4)=3.\n\nk=3: F(5)=5.\n\netc.\n\nSo, the code can:\n\nstart with fib_3 =2, fib_4=3, fib_5=5, etc.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfib = [2,3]\n\nwhile True:\n\n   next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n   if next_fib >n:\n\n       break\n\n   fib.append(next_fib)\n\n   max_games +=1\n\nWait, but this would give us the maximum k.\n\nWait, let's test for n=10.\n\nfib starts as [2,3].\n\nnext_fib is 5: <=10 → add to fib → [2,3,5], max_games=2.\n\nnext_fib is 8 → <=10 → add → [2,3,5,8], max_games=3.\n\nnext_fib is 13 → >10 → break.\n\nSo the maximum k is 3, but according to the sample, n=10, output is 4.\n\nWait, that's conflicting. So my initial approach may be wrong.\n\nWait, wait. What's the correct k for n=10.\n\nSample says the output is 4.\n\nSo according to earlier reasoning, the maximum k is 4, which requires F(6)=8 ≤10, and F(7)=13>10.\n\nSo, the code needs to find k=4.\n\nIn the code I wrote above, the 'fib' list after processing n=10 would be [2,3,5,8]. So the length is 4, but the max_games is 3.\n\nSo that's incorrect.\n\nAh, I see. So the way I'm counting is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial fib list should be [2,3,5,8,13], and for each step, I track the index.\n\nSo, for each step, the number of games is (current index -2). Or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to build a list where each element corresponds to F(k+2), and find the maximum k where F(k+2) <=n.\n\nSo, the list would be:\n\nk=1 → F(3)=2\n\nk=2 → F(4)=3\n\nk=3 → F(5)=5\n\nk=4 → F(6)=8\n\nk=5 → F(7)=13\n\nSo, for n=10, F(6)=8 is the largest F(k+2) <=10, so k=4.\n\nThus, the code should generate F(k+2) values until they exceed n, and track the maximum k.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should be:\n\nfib = [2,3,5,8,13,...]\n\nfor each fib_i in fib:\n\n   if fib_i >n → break\n\n   else, record the corresponding k.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the code can generate the Fibonacci numbers and keep track of the maximum k where fib[k] <=n.\n\nWait, let's think of it as follows:\n\nWe need to find the largest m such that fib(m) <=n, where fib(m) represents F(m+2).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to model the problem as finding the maximum number of games k, such that the (k+2)th Fibonacci number is <=n.\n\nSo, for each k, we have F(k+2) = F(k+1) + F(k).\n\nSo, the code can:\n\nInitialize a and b as the first two terms beyond the base case.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the process as:\n\nWe start with a=2 (F3), b=3 (F4), c=5 (F5), etc.\n\nWe keep track of the current term, and the next term.\n\nFor each step, if the current term is <=n, we can consider it as a possible F(k+2), and update the max_k.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\nmax_k = 0\n\na, b = 2,3\n\nwhile a <=n:\n\n    if a >n:\n\n        break\n\n    max_k +=1\n\n    # compute next term\n\n    c = a + b\n\n    a, b = b, c\n\nWait, no. Let's see for n=10.\n\nInitial a=2, b=3.\n\nCheck a=2 <=10 → max_k becomes 1.\n\nCompute c=5.\n\na becomes 3, b becomes5.\n\nNext iteration: a=3 <=10 → max_k=2.\n\nc=3+5=8.\n\na=5, b=8.\n\nNext: a=5 <=10 → max_k=3.\n\nc=5+8=13.\n\na=8, b=13.\n\nNow, a=8 <=10 → max_k=4.\n\nc=8+13=21.\n\na=13, which is >10 → break.\n\nSo, the max_k is 4, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nInitialize a =2, b=3, max_k=0.\n\nLoop:\n\nif a >n → break.\n\nElse:\n\n   max_k +=1\n\n   compute next term as a + b.\n\n   set a = b\n\n   b = next term.\n\nWait, no, because in each iteration, a is F(k+2), and b is F(k+3).\n\nWait, let's re-examine:\n\nInitially, a=2 (F3), b=3 (F4). So for each step, when a is considered, it's part of F(k+2).\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\nmax_k = 0\n\na = 2  # F3\n\nb = 3  # F4\n\nwhile a <=n:\n\n    max_k +=1\n\n    # compute next a and b\n\n    next_a = b\n\n    next_b = a + b\n\n    a, b = next_a, next_b\n\nWait, no. Because in each step, a is F(k+2). So for each a, if it's <=n, we can increase max_k by 1.\n\nBut wait, for a=2, which is F3, that's for k=1.\n\nWhen a=3, which is F4, that's for k=2.\n\nWhen a=5, which is F5, that's for k=3.\n\nSo the loop should:\n\nCheck if a <=n. If yes, increment max_k by 1.\n\nThen compute next a and b.\n\nWait, let's try for n=10.\n\nInitial a=2, b=3.\n\na<=10 → max_k=1.\n\nCompute next_a =3, next_b=5.\n\na=3, b=5.\n\na<=10 → max_k=2.\n\nCompute next_a=5, next_b=8.\n\na=5, b=8.\n\na<=10 → max_k=3.\n\nCompute next_a=8, next_b=13.\n\na=8, b=13.\n\na<=10 → max_k=4.\n\nCompute next_a=13, next_b=21.\n\na=13>10 → loop breaks.\n\nSo max_k is 4, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=4.\n\na=2 → yes, max_k=1.\n\nnext_a=3, next_b=5.\n\na=3<=4 → max_k=2.\n\nnext_a=5>4 → loop breaks.\n\nSo max_k is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\na=2 → yes, max_k=1.\n\na=3 → yes, max_k=2.\n\na=5 → yes, max_k=3.\n\na=8>5 → break.\n\nSo output is 3.\n\nWhich seems correct.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize a=2, b=3, max_k=0.\n\nWhile a <=n:\n\n    max_k +=1\n\n    a, b = b, a + b\n\nPrint max_k.\n\nWait, but wait, what about n=1? But the problem says n>=2.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nTesting for n=2:\n\na=2 <=2 → max_k=1.\n\nThen a becomes3, which is >2.\n\nSo output is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=8.\n\na=2→1.\n\na=3→2.\n\na=5→3.\n\na=8→4.\n\na=13>8 → stop.\n\nSo output is4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\na, b =2,3\n\nmax_k=0\n\nwhile a <=n:\n\n    max_k +=1\n\n    a, b = b, a + b\n\nprint(max_k)\n\nWait, but wait: for n=10, the code gives 4, which is correct. For n=3, the code gives 2, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what about n=7?\n\na=2 → yes, 1.\n\na=3 → yes, 2.\n\na=5 → yes, 3.\n\na=8>7 → stop.\n\nSo max_k is3.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWhat's the maximum number of games for n=7.\n\nThe required players for k=3 is 5, which is <=7.\n\nCan the winner play 3 games?\n\nYes.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAnother example: n=6.\n\na=2→1.\n\na=3→2.\n\na=5→3.\n\na=8>6 → stop.\n\nSo max_k=3.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nSo now, implementing this in Python.\n\nThe input is a single integer, n.\n\nSo, the code reads n, computes the max_k as described, and prints it.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me write it.\n\nRead n:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nThen initialize a=2, b=3, max_k=0.\n\nloop while a <=n:\n\n   max_k +=1\n\n   a, b = b, a + b\n\nprint(max_k)\n\nWait, but wait: in the first iteration, a=2 is <=n, so max_k increments by1.\n\nIn the next iteration, a=3 is compared, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\na, b = 2, 3\nmax_k = 0\nwhile a <= n:\n    max_k +=1\n    a, b = b, a + b\nprint(max_k)\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\nWait, for n=2, the code gives 1.\n\nn=3 → 2.\n\nn=4 →2.\n\nn=10 →4.\n\nYes, matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5 →3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. Each game the winner plays increases their count, and the opponent must have either the same count or one less. This structure means that the maximum number of games the winner can play corresponds to the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to the number of players, `n`.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The maximum number of games the winner can play, `k`, is such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`. This is because each step in the Fibonacci sequence represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play an additional game.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: We generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively until the next number exceeds `n`. Each iteration gives us a new Fibonacci number which helps us determine the maximum `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na, b = 2, 3\nmax_k = 0\nwhile a <= n:\n    max_k += 1\n    a, b = b, a + b\nprint(max_k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start with the first two Fibonacci numbers beyond the base case (F(3) = 2 and F(4) = 3).\n- **Loop**: We iterate while the current Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`. In each iteration, we update the maximum number of games (`max_k`) and compute the next Fibonacci number.\n- **Termination**: The loop terminates when the current Fibonacci number exceeds `n`, ensuring we find the largest valid `k`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 1018`.",
