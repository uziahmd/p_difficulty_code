Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be used to exactly form two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the guest's and host's names, their letters should exactly match the pile, with no extra letters and no missing ones.\n\nHmm, right. So, the input consists of three lines: the first is the guest's name, the second the host's, and the third is the pile. We need to check if the combined letters of guest and host equal exactly the pile.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, I think the steps are:\n\n1. Combine the guest and host strings into one.\n2. Count the frequency of each letter in this combined string.\n3. Do the same for the pile string.\n4. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they're identical, output YES; else, NO.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, considering how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, I'll read the three lines from standard input. Then, concatenate the first two lines into one string, and compare the character counts with the third line.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the lengths don't match? Oh right, because if the combined length of guest and host is different from the pile's length, then we can immediately return NO. So that's an easy check to add at the beginning.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\n- Read the three lines: guest = input().strip(), host = input().strip(), pile = input().strip().\n- Check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, print 'NO' and exit.\n- Else, create a frequency dictionary for guest + host.\n- Create another frequency dictionary for pile.\n- Compare the two dictionaries. If all counts match, print 'YES'; else, 'NO'.\n\nNow, how to create these frequency dictionaries efficiently in Python.\n\nOne way is to use collections.Counter, which counts the occurrences of each character in a string.\n\nSo, import Counter from collections.\n\nThen, combined = guest + host\nguest_host_counter = Counter(combined)\npile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\nIf guest_host_counter == pile_counter, then YES else NO.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? Because Counter objects compare by the counts of each key. So, if every key has the same count, the counters will be equal.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, test the example given.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined guest and host: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ → let's see.\n\nWait, combining 'SANTACLAUS' and 'DEDMOROZ' gives 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'. The pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'—wait, perhaps the sum is correct.\n\nIn any case, according to the sample, the output is YES.\n\nIn the second sample, the pile is missing a 'P' and has an extra 'L', so the counters won't match.\n\nThird sample: the pile has an extra 'L', so the counters differ.\n\nSo, the code should handle all these cases.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the case where the combined guest and host have more letters than the pile. For example, if the guest is \"AB\", host is \"CD\", pile is \"ACD\"—then the combined length is 4, pile is 3. So, the initial length check will catch it and return NO without further processing.\n\nWhat about empty strings? But according to the problem statement, all lines are non-empty, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nAlso, all letters are uppercase, so no case sensitivity issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nThe code structure would be:\n\nRead the three lines.\n\nCheck if the sum of guest and host lengths equals the pile's length. If not, print NO.\n\nElse, create the counters.\n\nCompare them.\n\nPrint YES or NO accordingly.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nWait, but in Python, when reading from standard input using input().strip(), it's possible that the lines might have leading or trailing newlines. Oh, wait, the problem statement says that each line is a string, but perhaps the input uses '\\n' as separators. So, for example, in the sample input provided, the three lines are the guest, host, and pile.\n\nSo, the code would read each line as follows:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nBut wait, what if the pile is something like 'ABC\\nDEF'? No, because the third line is the pile, which is a single string. So, using strip() may remove any leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines. But the problem says the pile is a single line, so perhaps the third line is read correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should read the entire input as a single string, split into three parts.\n\nBecause sometimes, the input could be given with \\n separating the lines, but when read via input().strip(), it may cause issues.\n\nWait, for example, if the guest is \"A\\nB\", then input().strip() would read as \"A B\" if there was a space after the newline. Hmm, perhaps better to read all the input at once and split into three lines.\n\nSo, perhaps read all the data, split into three lines.\n\nLike:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nguest = lines[0]\nhost = lines[1]\npile = lines[2]\n\nThis way, each line is treated as a separate string, regardless of any newlines in them (though the problem states that each line doesn't contain newlines, just uppercase letters).\n\nYes, that's probably safer.\n\nSo, the code becomes:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\nguest = lines[0]\nhost = lines[1]\npile = lines[2]\n\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the efficiency? The problem says that the length of each line does not exceed 100, so the total length of guest+host is up to 200, which is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, Counter is efficient enough for this.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\nWait, no—the first line is guest, second host, third pile.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the first sample is:\n\nInput:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSo, the first guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined guest+host length: len('SANTACLAUS') is 10, 'DEDMOROZ' is 8, total 18. Pile is 18. So, length matches.\n\nCombined: 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → let's count letters.\n\nPile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' → same letters?\n\nWell, Counter will compare each letter's count, so it should match.\n\nSample 2: guest is 'PAPAINOEL', host is 'JOULUPUKKI', pile is 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'\n\nWait, guest is 'PAPAINOEL' → P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nHost is 'JOULUPUKKI' → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined: P:2+1=3, A:2, I:1+1=2, etc. Wait, let me count.\n\nWait, 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI' → letters:\n\nP: 2 (from guest) + 1 (from host) = 3\nA: 2\nI: 1 (guest) + 1 (host) = 2\nE: 1 (guest)\nL: 1 (guest) + 1 (host) = 2?\nWait, no. Guest is 'PAPAINOEL' → letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L. So L appears once.\n\nHost is 'JOULUPUKKI' → letters: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. So L appears once.\n\nTotal L: 2.\n\nIn the pile, let's see:\n\nThe pile is BABONATALE FATHERCHRISTMAS BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nWait, maybe I should count the letters. But perhaps the sample says that the pile is missing a 'P' and has an extra 'L'—so the counters won't match.\n\nSo, the code would detect that and output NO.\n\nThird sample: the pile has an extra 'L', so the counters would have more Ls than expected.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: empty lines? But the problem says each line is non-empty.\n\nWhat about when the guest is 'A', host is 'A', pile is 'AA' → should output YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is 'AB', host is 'CD', pile is 'ABCD' → YES.\n\nIf the pile is 'ACD', then the combined length is 4, pile is 3 → output NO.\n\nWhat if the guest and host have letters that exactly match the pile?\n\nYes, the code would handle that.\n\nSo, the code looks solid.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the code reads the three lines correctly, regardless of how they are split.\n\nWait, in the code, after reading the three lines, we process them. So, if any line has leading or trailing spaces, the strip() would remove them. But according to the problem statement, each line contains only uppercase letters. So, the strip() is safe.\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says each line is a string of uppercase letters, so leading/trailing spaces are not present. So, the strip() may not be needed. But including it ensures that any accidental whitespace is stripped.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to read the entire input as one string and split it into three lines, each stripped.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\nWait, but that's similar to [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin], but the problem says each line is a single line without newlines, so stripping all whitespace is acceptable.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to read each line, including any possible trailing newlines, but in the problem statement, each line is given as a single line, so perhaps the correct way is to read each line, and then strip any leading/trailing whitespace (including newlines).\n\nSo, the code should work as written.\n\nThus, the final code is as above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given pile of letters can be used to exactly form the names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the combined letters of the guest's and host's names match exactly with the letters in the pile, without any extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n2. **Check Lengths**: Verify if the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. If not, print \"NO\".\n3. **Count Frequencies**: Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each letter in the combined guest and host names.\n4. **Compare Frequencies**: Compare the frequency counts of the combined guest and host names with the frequency counts of the pile. If they match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    guest = lines[0]\n    host = lines[1]\n    pile = lines[2]\n    \n    if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as three separate lines, each representing the guest's name, host's name, and the pile of letters respectively.\n2. **Length Check**: Before proceeding further, we check if the sum of the lengths of the guest's and host's names equals the length of the pile. This is an initial quick check to avoid unnecessary computations.\n3. **Frequency Counting**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each letter in both the combined string of guest and host names and the pile.\n4. **Comparison**: By comparing the two frequency counters, we determine if the letters can be rearranged to form the exact names. If they match, it means the pile can be used to form the names exactly, and we print \"YES\". Otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine if the pile can be used to reconstruct the names without any extra or missing letters.",
