Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning Rebel spaceships to guard B bases. Each base must have exactly one spaceship, and each spaceship must be assigned to exactly one base. So, it's a perfect matching between R rebels and B bases.\n\nBut there's an additional condition: the straight paths from each base to its assigned spaceship shouldn't intersect. So, no two paths can cross each other in the galaxy plane.\n\nHmm. So, I need to determine if such a matching exists.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input consists of R spaceships and B bases. The coordinates are given, and no three points are colinear, which probably helps because it reduces some cases where lines could overlap.\n\nThe output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" based on whether a valid matching exists.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Read the input correctly.\n2. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the spaceships and bases.\n3. For each matching, check if any two paths intersect.\n4. If any matching satisfies that no paths intersect, output \"Yes\".\n5. If none do after checking all possibilities, output \"No\".\n\nWait, but wait. The number of matchings depends on the minimum of R and B. Oh, wait no, since R and B can be up to 10 each. But if R != B, then it's impossible to have a perfect matching. So first, I should check if R == B. Because each spaceship must assign to a base, and vice versa.\n\nWait, the problem says R and B are the numbers of spaceships and bases. So for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible, so output \"No\".\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe first line has R and B, with 1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10. Then, R lines for the spaceships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nSo the assignment is a perfect matching only if R equals B. So, if R != B, then it's automatically \"No\".\n\nSo, step zero: if R != B, output \"No\".\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for the case when R == B.\n\nWe need to find a bijection from spaceships to bases such that the paths (from base to spaceship) don't intersect.\n\nWait, the path is from the base to the spaceship. So each spaceship is connected to a base via a straight line. We need to ensure that no two such lines cross each other.\n\nSo, the lines cannot cross.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation (since it's a bijection) of the bases, where each base is matched to a spaceship, such that the lines between them don't intersect.\n\nHow to model this?\n\nAn alternative way: for the given set of points, we can represent the assignment as a bipartite graph, where one partition is the spaceships and the other is the bases. An edge exists between a spaceship and a base if the line connecting them doesn't intersect with any other line in the current matching.\n\nWait, but that's not directly applicable because edges depend on other edges. So maybe a backtracking approach would work here.\n\nAnother thought: Since the points are fixed, perhaps the order in which we connect them matters. Maybe the problem can be modeled as finding a non-crossing perfect matching.\n\nWait, in computational geometry, a non-crossing matching is one where no two edges cross each other. So this seems similar to finding a non-crossing bipartite matching.\n\nBut I'm not familiar with a standard algorithm for this. So perhaps a brute-force approach is feasible here, given that R and B are small (up to 10). So for R=10, the number of possible permutations is 10! = 3,628,800, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of edges in the permutation to see if they cross. That might be computationally expensive, but for R=10, 10! is around 3.6 million, and for each permutation, checking all C(10,2) =45 pairs. So total operations would be 3.6e6 * 45 = ~160 million, which is acceptable for Python, considering each operation is simple.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Check if R != B. If so, output No.\n- Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (each permutation represents a possible assignment).\n- For each permutation:\n   - Check if any two edges (base to spaceship) in the permutation cross each other.\n   - If a permutation has no crossing edges, then output Yes.\n- After checking all permutations, if none satisfy, output No.\n\nBut wait, the permutation is a mapping from spaceship indices to base indices. Or perhaps the other way around.\n\nWait, the spaceships are given as R points, and the bases as B points. When R=B, the assignment is a bijection between the two sets.\n\nSo each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and vice versa.\n\nSo for each possible bijection, which is a permutation of the bases, we can create a list of edges. Then, for each pair of edges, check if they cross.\n\nIf any permutation has no crossing edges, then it's a valid solution.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read R and B. If R != B, print No.\n2. Read R spaceship coordinates into a list, say S = [ (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ... ].\n3. Read B base coordinates into a list, Bases = [ (x1,y1), (x2,y2), ... ].\n4. Generate all possible permutations of the Bases list. Each permutation represents a possible assignment: the i-th spaceship is assigned to the j-th base in the permutation.\n5. For each permutation:\n   a. For each spaceship index i, get the base point at permutation[i].\n   b. Collect all the edges as tuples of (base_point, spaceship_point).\n   c. Check if any two edges in this collection cross.\n   d. If no edges cross, return Yes.\n6. If after all permutations checked, none found, return No.\n\nNow, the key is to implement the function that checks if a set of edges has any crossings.\n\nHow to check if two line segments cross?\n\nI remember that two line segments AB and CD cross each other if and only if the points A and B are on opposite sides of CD and C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nAlternatively, using the cross product approach.\n\nWait, but the line segments are infinite? No, line segments are finite. So, to determine if two line segments AB and CD cross, we can use the following approach:\n\nCompute the orientation of various points.\n\nOrientation of triplet (p, q, r) is determined by the sign of the cross product of vectors pq and pr.\n\nIf orientation(p, q, r) is different from orientation(q, r, p), then p and r are on opposite sides of the line qr.\n\nSo, the steps for two segments AB and CD:\n\nCheck if points A and B are on opposite sides of CD, and points C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nIf both conditions are true, then AB and CD cross.\n\nWait, but that's not sufficient. Because even if those conditions are met, the segments may not cross. Or wait, perhaps it's a necessary condition.\n\nWait, no. For example, if two segments are in a 'cross' shape but their endpoints are on the same side, but the lines intersect elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should refer to the standard method for determining if two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nAccording to computational geometry resources, two line segments AB and CD intersect if and only if:\n\n1. The points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n2. The points C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n3. The intersection point lies within the segments.\n\nWait, but in our case, the segments are finite. So, perhaps the correct approach is to check if the two segments cross each other in their interiors.\n\nBut for our problem, the line segments are between a base and a spaceship. Each segment is from a base point to a spaceship point.\n\nSo, for each pair of segments in the current assignment, we need to check if they cross.\n\nSo, for two segments s1 and s2, where s1 connects base B1 to spaceship S1, and s2 connects base B2 to spaceship S2.\n\nWe need to check if s1 and s2 cross each other.\n\nSo, the algorithm for checking if two line segments cross is as follows:\n\nImplement a function that takes two line segments (each represented by two points) and returns True if they cross.\n\nImplementing that function is crucial.\n\nLet me think about writing that function.\n\nFunction signature: segments_intersect(s1, s2) -> bool\n\nEach segment is a tuple of two points.\n\nSo, for s1 = (p1, p2) and s2 = (p3, p4).\n\nWe can compute the four orientations needed.\n\nCompute:\n\no1 = orientation(p1, p2, p3)\no2 = orientation(p1, p2, p4)\no3 = orientation(p3, p4, p1)\no4 = orientation(p3, p4, p2)\n\nIf the general case: the segments intersect if (o1 != o2 and o3 != o4).\n\nBut also, in the special case where the segments are collinear and overlapping, but not coinciding entirely.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says that no three points are colinear. So, for any two line segments, the four points are all distinct and no three are colinear. So, the case where two segments are colinear and overlapping isn't possible except in the case where all points are colinear, which is prohibited.\n\nSo, in our problem, the line segments can't have overlapping colinear segments because the problem states that no three points are on the same line.\n\nThus, the function can safely assume that if the general case holds, the segments cross.\n\nSo, the function can be written as:\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n    # s1 is ((x1,y1), (x2,y2)), s2 is ((x3,y3), (x4,y4))\n    (p1, p2) = s1\n    (p3, p4) = s2\n\n    def ccw(A, B, C):\n        return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\n    # Check if the segments AB and CD intersect.\n    # Using the CCW method.\n    # Check if A and B are on opposite sides of CD and C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\n    ccw1 = ccw(p3, p4, p1)\n    ccw2 = ccw(p3, p4, p2)\n    if (ccw1 == 0 and ccw2 == 0):\n        # p1 and p2 are on the same line as CD, but since no three points are colinear, this is impossible.\n        # So, this case won't happen.\n        return False\n\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2) < 0:\n        ccw3 = ccw(p1, p2, p3)\n        ccw4 = ccw(p1, p2, p4)\n        if (ccw3 * ccw4) < 0:\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, perhaps I should refer to the standard implementation of the line segment intersection.\n\nLooking it up, the standard approach is:\n\nSegments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n- Points A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n- Points C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nWhich can be determined by checking the signs of the cross products.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n    # s1 is (a, b), s2 is (c, d)\n    a, b = s1[0], s1[1]\n    c, d = s2[0], s2[1]\n\n    # Compute cross products\n    cross1 = (b.x - a.x)*(d.y - c.y) - (b.y - a.y)*(d.x - c.x)\n    cross2 = (b.x - a.x)*(c.y - c.y) - (b.y - a.y)*(c.x - c.x)\n\n    cross3 = (d.x - c.x)*(b.y - a.y) - (d.y - c.y)*(b.x - a.x)\n    cross4 = (d.x - c.x)*(c.y - a.y) - (d.y - c.y)*(c.x - a.x)\n\n    # Check if a and b are on opposite sides of c-d\n    if (cross1 * cross2) < 0:\n        # Check if c and d are on opposite sides of a-b\n        if (cross3 * cross4) < 0:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to write the function as:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n    a, b = s1[0], s1[1]\n    c, d = s2[0], s2[1]\n\n    # Check if AB and CD cross.\n    # Check if a and b are on opposite sides of CD.\n    # Which is equivalent to checking if ccw(c, d, a) and ccw(c, d, b) have different signs.\n    if ccw(c, d, a) * ccw(c, d, b) < 0:\n        # Now check if c and d are on opposite sides of AB.\n        if ccw(a, b, c) * ccw(a, b, d) < 0:\n            return True\n    return False\n\nYes, this should handle the cases.\n\nSo now, the plan is solid.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print No.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R spaceship points, store as a list S.\n\nRead B base points, store as a list Bases.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the Bases list. Since each permutation is a possible assignment of bases to spaceships.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   Create a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple of (base_point, spaceship_point). So for i in 0..R-1, edges.append( (permutation[i], S[i]) )\n\n   For each pair of edges in this list, check if they cross.\n\n   If any pair crosses, skip this permutation.\n\n   If all pairs don't cross, output Yes.\n\nIf after all permutations, none found, output No.\n\nBut generating all permutations of Bases is not efficient, but with B up to 10, it's manageable.\n\nWait, but for each permutation, the edges are in the order of the permutation. So, each permutation is a list of Bases, and for each spaceship index i, the base is permutation[i]. So, the edges are (permutation[i], S[i]) for i in 0..R-1.\n\nBut wait, the order of the permutation is important. Because, for example, if two edges are connected to the same spaceship, but that's not possible since it's a bijection.\n\nWait, no, each permutation is a unique assignment.\n\nSo, for each permutation, the edges are a set of R line segments between the Bases and the Spaceships.\n\nNow, for each pair of these edges, check if they cross.\n\nWait, but the edges are in the permutation. So for each pair (i, j), edges[i] and edges[j] are two segments. We need to check if any of them cross.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, we can loop over all pairs of edges, and for each pair, check if they cross.\n\nIf any pair crosses, we break and try the next permutation.\n\nElse, if none cross, return Yes.\n\nSo, implementing this:\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport itertools\n\nR, B = map(int, input().split())\n\nspaceships = []\nfor _ in range(R):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n\nbases = []\nfor _ in range(B):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    bases.append( (x, y) )\n\nif R != B:\n    print(\"No\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n        edges = [ (perm[i], spaceships[i]) for i in range(R) ]\n        # Check all pairs of edges\n        conflict = False\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                s1 = edges[i]\n                s2 = edges[j]\n                if segments_intersect(s1, s2):\n                    conflict = True\n                    break\n            if conflict:\n                break\n        if not conflict:\n            found = True\n            break\n    print(\"Yes\" if found else \"No\")\n\nWait, but wait. The permutation is a tuple of B points. So for each spaceship index i, the base is perm[i]. So the edges are (perm[i], spaceships[i]). That's correct.\n\nBut for each permutation, we're considering all possible assignments. But this will involve a lot of redundant checks.\n\nFor example, if R is 10, 10! is 3.6 million. For each, we have to check C(10,2) =45 pairs of edges. So 3.6e6 * 45 = 162 million operations. In Python, this could be slow.\n\nHmm, but for R=10, it's about 3.6e6 permutations. Wait, but 3.6e6 is manageable. And each permutation requires 45 checks, but in Python, loops can handle that.\n\nBut wait, the code above is O(R^2) for each permutation, which is O(R^2 * R!) time.\n\nWait, R is up to 10, so R! is 3.6e6, and R^2 is 100, so 3.6e8 operations. Hmm, that's 360 million operations. Python can handle that, but it's tight.\n\nIs there a way to optimize this?\n\nAlternative approach: find a way to represent the problem as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the two segments (spaceship to base) do not cross. Then, perform a bipartite matching, but it's unclear how to precompute the allowed edges.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the allowed edges are dependent on the existing edges in the matching, making it difficult to precompute. Because adding one edge may affect whether another edge can be added.\n\nSo, perhaps backtracking is the only way.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, another idea: the problem is to find a non-crossing matching between the two sets. So, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a graph where edges are allowed only if the two points are connected without crossing any other edges.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order in which the edges are added doesn't matter. So, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding a non-crossing bipartition, but I'm not aware of an efficient algorithm for this.\n\nAnother idea: arrange the points in convex hull order and find a matching accordingly, but I'm not certain.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the initial approach is manageable.\n\nWait, let me test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWait, no, the sample input is given as:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps it's a formatting issue, but in reality, the input is:\n\nFirst line: 3 3\n\nThen 3 lines of spaceship coordinates:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nThen 3 lines of base coordinates:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a representation of two test cases, but the problem says that the first line contains R and B, then R lines for ships, then B lines for bases.\n\nSo, in the first test case, R=3, B=3.\n\nSpaceships:\n\n(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)\n\nBases:\n\n(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)\n\nThe second test case is R=2, B=1, which is impossible because R != B, so output is No.\n\nBut wait, according to the sample output, the first case is Yes, the second is No.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nThe first part is a string containing the input for the first test case, and the second part is the input for the second test case.\n\nWait, but perhaps the code should read from stdin, not from a list.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is presented as a list, but in reality, the code should read from standard input, which comes as lines.\n\nSo, in code, it's better to read from stdin line by line.\n\nSo, the code needs to read R and B from the first line.\n\nThen read R lines for spaceships.\n\nThen read B lines for bases.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, it's given as a single string with newlines, but perhaps it's just for illustration.\n\nSo, moving on.\n\nIn the first test case, R=3, B=3.\n\nThe code would generate all 3! = 6 permutations of the 3 bases.\n\nFor each permutation, it creates edges between the spaceship and the permuted base.\n\nThen, for each permutation, it checks all pairs of edges.\n\nFor the first permutation that matches, say, base1 -> ship1, base2->ship2, base3->ship3.\n\nWait, but how does the sample's edges look?\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order. So, perhaps the permutation is (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2) assigned to the three ships.\n\nWait, but the order of the permutation is the order in which the bases are assigned to the ships.\n\nSo, for each permutation, the edges are created in the order of the permutation.\n\nIn the sample, the edges would be:\n\nbase1 (-2,1) to ship1 (0,0)\n\nbase2 (0,3) to ship2 (2,0)\n\nbase3 (2,2) to ship3 (3,1)\n\nThen, we need to check all pairs of edges.\n\nDo any of these cross?\n\nEdge1: from (-2,1) to (0,0)\n\nEdge2: from (0,3) to (2,0)\n\nEdge3: from (2,2) to (3,1)\n\nCheck Edge1 and Edge2:\n\nSegments are (-2,1)-(0,0) and (0,3)-(2,0).\n\nDo they cross?\n\nLet's compute the orientations.\n\nPoint A=(-2,1), B=(0,0), C=(0,3), D=(2,0).\n\nCompute ccw(C,D,A) and ccw(C,D,B).\n\nccw(C,D,A): C is (0,3), D is (2,0), A is (-2,1).\n\ndx = 2-0=2, dy=0-3=-3.\n\nVector CA: (-2 -0, 1-3) = (-2, -2).\n\nCross product: (2)(-2) - (-3)(-2) → -4 -6 = -10.\n\nccw(C,D,A) is negative.\n\nccw(C,D,B): B is (0,0).\n\ndx=2, dy=-3.\n\nVector CB: (0-0, 0-3) = (0,-3).\n\nCross product: 2*(-3) - (-3)*0 = -6.\n\nSo ccw(C,D,B) is negative.\n\nSo, both are negative. So, points A and B are on the same side of CD.\n\nThus, segments AB and CD don't cross.\n\nSimilarly, check other pairs.\n\nEdge1 and Edge3: from (-2,1) to (0,0) and from (2,2) to (3,1).\n\nCheck if they cross.\n\nCompute the orientation.\n\nC is (2,2), D is (3,1).\n\nA is (-2,1), B is (0,0).\n\nccw(C,D,A):\n\ndx=3-2=1, dy=1-2=-1.\n\nVector CA: (-2-2, 1-2) = (-4, -1).\n\nCross product: 1*(-1) - (-1)*(-4) → -1 -4 = -5.\n\nccw(C,D,B):\n\ndx=1, dy=-1.\n\nVector CB: (0-2, 0-2)= (-2, -2).\n\nCross product: 1*(-2) - (-1)*(-2) → -2 - 2 = -4.\n\nSo, both are negative. So A and B are on the same side of CD. So, no crossing.\n\nEdge2 and Edge3:\n\nEdge2 is from (0,3) to (2,0).\n\nEdge3 is from (2,2) to (3,1).\n\nCheck if they cross.\n\nCompute ccw for (2,2) as point A and (3,1) as point B.\n\nPoints C=(0,3), D=(2,0).\n\nCompute ccw(C,D,A) and ccw(C,D,B).\n\nccw(C,D,A) = (2-0)(2-3) - (0-3)(3-2) → 2*(-1) - (-3)(1) → -2 +3=1.\n\nccw(C,D,B) = (2-0)(0-3) - (0-3)(2-2) → 2*(-3) - (-3)(0) → -6 -0 = -6.\n\nSo, signs are positive and negative. So, A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nNow, check if C and D are on opposite sides of AB.\n\nAB is from (0,3) to (2,0).\n\nC is (0,3), D is (2,0).\n\nCompute ccw(A, B, C) and ccw(A,B,D).\n\nWait, AB is from (0,3) to (2,0). So A is (0,3), B is (2,0).\n\nccw(A,B,C) is (2-0)(3-3) - (0-3)(0-0) → 2*0 - (-3)*0=0. But since the points are colinear, but according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so this can't happen.\n\nWait, but in this case, point C is (0,3), which is the same as A. So, perhaps the code would treat this as a special case.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that no two points coincide, but perhaps in the sample input, the points are arranged in such a way.\n\nWait, the sample input has bases as (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2), and spaceships as (0,0), (2,0), (3,1).\n\nSo, in the permutation, the bases are assigned in the order of the permutation. So, in the sample, the permutation is the first base, then the second, then the third.\n\nSo, the edges are:\n\nBase (-2,1) → (0,0)\n\nBase (0,3) → (2,0)\n\nBase (2,2) → (3,1)\n\nSo, when checking edge2 and edge3:\n\nedge2 is from (0,3) to (2,0).\n\nedge3 is from (2,2) to (3,1).\n\nSo, the segments are (0,3)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(3,1).\n\nDo these cross?\n\nCompute the orientation:\n\nCompute ccw for edge2: points (0,3), (2,0), and point (2,2).\n\nThe cross product is (2-0)*(2-3) - (0-3)*(2-0) → 2*(-1) - (-3)*2 → -2 +6=4>0.\n\nSo, point (2,2) is on one side of edge2.\n\nThen, point (3,1) is on the same line?\n\nWait, no. Because edge3 is (2,2)-(3,1). So, for edge2, (2,0) is point D.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the ccw for edge2 and edge3.\n\nBut regardless, in the sample, it's said that the assignment is possible, so this permutation must have no crossing edges.\n\nBut according to my earlier analysis, edge2 and edge3 might cross.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculations.\n\nLet me recompute.\n\nEdge2 is from (0,3) to (2,0). Let's call this segment AB.\n\nEdge3 is from (2,2) to (3,1). Call this segment CD.\n\nCompute ccw(A, B, C) and ccw(A, B, D).\n\nA is (0,3), B is (2,0), C is (2,2), D is (3,1).\n\nccw(A,B,C) is (2-0)*(2-3) - (0-3)*(2-0) → 2*(-1) - (-3)*2 → -2 +6 =4.\n\nccw(A,B,D) is (2-0)*(1-3) - (0-3)*(3-0) → 2*(-2) - (-3)*3 → -4 +9=5.\n\nSo, both are positive. So, points C and D are on the same side of AB. So, segments AB and CD do not cross.\n\nSo, the function would return False for segments_intersect(edge2, edge3).\n\nSo, in this permutation, all pairs of edges do not cross. Thus, the code would find it and output Yes.\n\nSo, the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother sample is when R=2, B=1, which is invalid, so output is No.\n\nNow, what about other cases.\n\nCase where R=1, B=1.\n\nJust one spaceship and one base. So, no possibility of crossing. Output Yes.\n\nAnother case: R=2, B=2.\n\nTwo spaceships and two bases. Check all possible permutations.\n\nEach permutation has two edges. So, for each permutation, check if the two edges cross.\n\nIf any permutation has no crossing edges, output Yes.\n\nFor example, suppose the two edges are non-crossing.\n\nLike:\n\nS1 at (0,0), S2 at (2,0).\n\nBases at (1,1) and (3,3).\n\nIn the permutation, assign S1 to (1,1), S2 to (3,3).\n\nEdges are (1,1)-(0,0) and (3,3)-(2,0).\n\nThese two segments don't cross.\n\nThus, the code would output Yes.\n\nAnother case: R=4, B=4.\n\nNeed to find a permutation where all four edges don't cross.\n\nBut with 24 permutations, the code would have to check each.\n\nBut it's manageable.\n\nPotential optimizations:\n\nInstead of generating all permutations, perhaps pre-sort the points in some way, like by x-coordinate, then y-coordinate, and then try to assign in order.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Since the segments are non-crossing, the permutation must be such that the order of the bases corresponds to the order of the spaceships in a certain way.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nBut perhaps for the problem's constraints, the initial approach is sufficient.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nBut wait, the code as written will have R! * R^2/2 operations. For R=10, 10! is 3.6 million, multiplied by 45 (approx) gives 162 million operations. In Python, each iteration is relatively slow, so this could be a problem.\n\nWait, but in Python, 1e8 operations take about 10 seconds, right? So 162 million is about 1.62e8, which would take about 16 seconds. But for R=10, that's the worst case.\n\nBut the problem constraints allow R and B up to 10. So, 10 is the maximum. So, perhaps this is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to optimize.\n\nAlternative approach: Precompute for each possible pair of spaceships and bases whether the line between them crosses any other line.\n\nBut no, because the edges are added incrementally, so each edge added may influence whether others can be added.\n\nAnother Idea: Use memoization or pruning to avoid unnecessary permutations.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as finding a non-crossing perfect matching in a bipartite graph where edges are only between a spaceship and a base whose line does not cross any other edges in the current matching.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nAnother Idea: Represent the problem as a bipartite graph where edges are only those that do not cross any other edges. Then, perform maximum bipartite matching. But this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a bipartite graph where an edge exists between a spaceship and a base only if the line connecting them does not cross any other line in the current partial matching.\n\nBut this complicates the algorithm.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is the best, even with the high computational cost.\n\nBut for R=10, the code may not pass within the time limits in Python.\n\nAlternative Idea: Optimize the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut I think it's already as optimized as possible.\n\nAnother Idea: Precompute all possible pairs of spaceships and bases and determine if their lines cross, then build a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the two points can be connected without crossing any other edges. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the line between the two points does not cross any other edges in the matching.\n\nBut building such a graph dynamically is difficult.\n\nPerhaps, for each spaceship, precompute all bases that can be connected to it without crossing any other edges.\n\nBut again, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps proceed with the initial code.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\nSpaceships:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBases:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nAs discussed, the code would find a valid permutation and output Yes.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\nR != B, so output No.\n\nSo, the code would handle this.\n\nAnother Test Case:\n\nR=2, B=2\n\nSpaceships:\n\n(0,0), (2,0)\n\nBases:\n\n(1,1), (3,3)\n\nPossible permutations:\n\n[(1,1), (3,3)] and [(3,3), (1,1)]\n\nCheck each permutation.\n\nFor the first permutation:\n\nedges are (1,1)-(0,0) and (3,3)-(2,0).\n\nDo they cross?\n\nCompute ccw for the two segments.\n\nSegment 1: (0,0) to (1,1).\n\nSegment 2: (2,0) to (3,3).\n\nDo these cross?\n\nCompute ccw for segment1 and segment2.\n\nFor segment1, points A=(0,0), B=(1,1). For segment2, points C=(2,0), D=(3,3).\n\nCheck if A and B are on opposite sides of CD.\n\nCompute ccw(C, D, A) and ccw(C, D, B).\n\nccw(C, D, A) is (3-2)(0-0) - (3-0)(2-2) → (1)(0) - (3)(0) = 0.\n\nccw(C, D, B) is (3-2)(1-0) - (3-0)(1-2) → 1*1 -3*(-1) → 1 +3=4.\n\nSo, A and B are on same side of CD. So, no crossing.\n\nThus, this permutation is valid, so code outputs Yes.\n\nSo, the code would handle this.\n\nAnother Test Case:\n\nR=4, B=4.\n\nSpaceships arranged in a square.\n\nBases arranged in a square.\n\nPerhaps the code can find a non-crossing matching.\n\nBut the code would have to check all 24 permutations, which is manageable.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nPotential Optimizations:\n\n- Prune the permutation search early. As soon as a permutation is found that has no crossings, output Yes.\n\n- Implement the segments_intersect function as efficiently as possible.\n\nThus, the code is as written.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nBut in Python, the code may be too slow for R=10. So, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternative Idea: Represent the problem as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if the line between the two points does not cross any other line in the matching. Then, perform maximum bipartite matching.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but the maximum bipartite matching is what we're trying to find. So, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where edges exist only if the two points can be connected without crossing any other edges in the matching.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to note that the problem is to find a non-crossing perfect matching. Such a matching can be found using algorithms for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to guard B bases such that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. Additionally, the paths from each base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect in the galaxy plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires a perfect matching between spaceships and bases where no two paths (lines) connecting a base to its assigned spaceship intersect. This can be approached by checking all possible permutations of base assignments to spaceships and verifying if any permutation results in non-intersecting paths.\n\n2. **Reading Input**: Read the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R does not equal B, output \"No\" immediately as a perfect matching is impossible.\n\n3. **Generating Permutations**: For each permutation of bases, create a list of edges representing the connections from each spaceship to the corresponding base in the permutation.\n\n4. **Checking for Intersections**: For each permutation, check all pairs of edges to see if they intersect. If any permutation results in edges that do not intersect, output \"Yes\".

The `ccw` function calculates the orientation of three points to determine if they are collinear or on opposite sides of a line, which helps in detecting intersections between line segments. The `segments_intersect` function uses these orientations to check if two segments cross each other. By iterating through all permutations and checking each for non-intersecting paths, we efficiently determine if a valid assignment exists.",
