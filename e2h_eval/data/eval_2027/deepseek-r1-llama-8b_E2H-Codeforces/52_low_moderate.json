Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vasily and his candles. He starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for exactly one hour and then goes out. But the smart part is that he can take 'b' of these burned-out candles and make a new one. So, the question is, how many total hours can he keep the room lit?\n\nHmm. So the idea is that each time he has enough burned candles, he can create new ones, which in turn provide more hours. But I need to calculate the total hours until he can't make any more candles.\n\nLet me think about the process step by step.\n\nInitially, he has 'a' candles. Each burns for 1 hour, so that's 'a' hours. Then, those 'a' candles become 'a' burned ones. He can exchange them for new candles if possible.\n\nWait, but wait: the number of new candles made from 'b' used ones is (number_of_used_candles // b). So, every time he has some used candles, he can make as many new ones as possible.\n\nSo here's the approach:\n\n1. Start with the initial 'a' candles.\n2. The total hours is initially 'a'.\n3. Then, add the number of new candles he can make from the used ones.\n4. For each new candle, it contributes 1 hour, and also adds to the used pile.\n5. Repeat this until the number of used candles is less than 'b', meaning he can't make any more new candles.\n\nSo let's model this with an example. Like the first sample input: 4 2.\n\nInitial a=4, so total is 4. Then he has 4 used candles. 4 divided by 2 is 2, so he makes 2 new candles. Now, burning these 2 gives another 2 hours, and adds 2 used candles. Now he has 2+2=4 used, which again can make 2 more candles. Those burn for 2 hours, adding 2 used. Now he has 2 used, which is less than b=2, right? Wait no: 2 is equal to b. So he can make one more candle, which burns for 1 hour, adding another used candle. Now he has 1 used candle, which is less than b=2, so he can't make any more.\n\nLet's count the hours:\n\nStart with 4 → 4 hours.\n\nThen make 2 → 2 hours added → total 6.\n\nThen after burning 2, he has 4 used → again 2 made → 2 hours, total 8. Now he has 2+2=4 used → make 2 again. Burn them for 2 hours → total 10. Now he has 2 used → make 1 more, which burns for 1 hour → total 11. Now he has 1 used, can't make more.\n\nWait, but according to the sample, the output is 7. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait wait, the sample input is 4 2. The note says that he gets 7 hours. How?\n\nLet me recount:\n\nHe has 4 initial candles, which give 4 hours. Then, he uses 4 to make 2 new. He burns those 2, adding 2 hours, total 6. Now he has 4 used (from the initial 4) plus 2 used from the new ones, so 6 used. Wait, no—wait, no. Wait, when he uses the 4 used to make 2 new, those 4 are converted into 2 new. So after burning the new 2, they become 2 used. So the total used now is 4 - 4 (used to make 2) + 2 = 2? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, maybe the way it works is that each time he uses 'k' used candles to make new ones, the 'k' are consumed, and the new ones are added. So let's model it as follows:\n\n- Initialize total_hours = a\n- used = a\n\nThen, while used >= b:\n    new_candles = used // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    used = (used % b) + new_candles  # because the remainder is leftover, and new_candles are now used.\n\nSo let's apply this to the sample.\n\nSample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal = 4\nused =4.\n\nLoop:\n\n4 >=2 → yes.\n\nnew =4//2=2. total becomes 6.\n\nused =4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nNow, used is 2 >=2 → loop again.\n\nnew=2//2=1. total becomes7.\n\nused= 0 +",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using the candles he has, considering he can create new candles from the stubs of burned-out ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles `a`, which will burn for exactly `a` hours.\n2. **Recycling Process**: After burning all initial candles, collect the stubs and use them to create new candles. Each time `b` stubs can be recycled into one new candle.\n3. **Iterative Recycling**: Continuously recycle the stubs until the number of stubs is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n4. **Accumulate Hours**: Each time new candles are made and burned, add the corresponding hours to the total.\n\nThe process can be broken down into the following steps:\n1. Burn all initial candles, adding their count to the total hours.\n2. Collect stubs from these candles.\n3. Recycle stubs into new candles as long as possible, updating the total hours and the count of stubs each time.\n4. Stop when no more stubs can be recycled.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = (used % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initial Burn**: The initial number of candles `a` burns for `a` hours, so we start with `total = a`.\n- **Recycling Loop**: While there are enough stubs (`used`) to make at least one new candle (`b`):\n  - Calculate how many new candles can be made (`new = used // b`).\n  - Add the hours from these new candles to `total`.\n  - Update the count of stubs: the remainder of `used % b` plus the newly made candles `new`.\n- **Termination**: The loop stops when the number of stubs is less than `b`, meaning no more new candles can be made.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the maximum hours by iterating through the recycling process, ensuring all possible hours from both initial and recycled candles are accounted for.",
