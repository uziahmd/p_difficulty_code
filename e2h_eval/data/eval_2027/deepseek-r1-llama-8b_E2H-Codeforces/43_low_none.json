He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's. Then C appends some 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's (could be equal to both). The final string must follow certain conditions regarding the order and counts.\n\nFirst, the string must be in the form \"a...ab...bc...c\", right? So any other order would make it invalid. For example, if after the 'a's come 'c's before 'b's, that's wrong.\n\nThen, let's think about the counts:\n\n1. The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. Also, it's allowed that the count is equal to both.\n\nBut wait, how do we determine the counts? Because the 'c's are added after all the 'a's and 'b's. So the count of 'c's is whatever C added, which is equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point.\n\nWait, but the string is the result after all steps. So when C adds the 'c's, the total 'a's and 'b's are fixed. So the 'c's count is equal to the number of 'a's (before C adds anything) or the number of 'b's (before C adds anything). Because when C appends, he appends based on the current counts of 'a' and 'b', which are already in the string.\n\nWait no: Wait, when B appends 'b's, the string has some 'a's followed by some 'b's. Then C appends 'c's. But the 'c's count is equal to the number of 'a's OR the number of 'b's in the string before C adds them. Because the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string. So, the count of 'c's is either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's in the string before C adds them.\n\nBut then, what about the counts after that? Because C appends some 'c's, so the total 'c's will be the count determined by C.\n\nWait, the process is:\n\n- A's string: a^A (some 'a's)\n- B appends b^B: so string becomes a^A b^B\n- C appends c^C: c^C is equal to A or B (the counts of a and b before C adds).\n\nSo, the total 'c's in the final string is exactly the number of 'a's or 'b's, whichever C chooses (but could choose either).\n\nBut wait, no. C can choose either the count of 'a's or 'b's. So the 'c's count is equal to one of these two numbers, not necessarily both.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\" So, the count is equal to either 'a's count or 'b's count, not necessarily both. So, for example, if 'a's count is 3 and 'b's count is 5, C can choose to append 3 or 5 'c's.\n\nSo, the 'c's count in the final string is equal to either the 'a's count or 'b's count in the string after B's step, before C appends.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the correct order: first all 'a's, then all 'b's, then all 'c's.\n\nIf the string doesn't follow this order, return NO.\n\n2. Once the order is correct, count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n\nLet a = number of 'a's, b = number of 'b's, c = number of 'c's.\n\nNow, check whether c is equal to a or equal to b.\n\nBecause C appends c^C which is equal to a or b.\n\nWait, no. Because when C appends, the a and b counts are already fixed. Because after B's step, the a's and b's are known. So, C can choose to add either a or b number of 'c's.\n\nSo, in the final string, the c count must be either a or b.\n\nWait, but wait. When C appends, the 'c's are added at the end. So the count is exactly the number chosen by C, which is equal to a or b.\n\nSo",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific process involving appending characters in a certain order and count. The string must be formed by first appending 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's, with the number of 'c's being equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must be in the form \"a...ab...bc...c\". If it doesn't follow this order, the answer is \"NO\".\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is in the correct order\nparts = []\ncurrent_char = None\nfor c in s:\n    if current_char != c:\n        if current_char is not None:\n            # If a new character starts, but previous was not 'c', invalid\n            parts.append(current_char)\n            current_char = c\n        else:\n            if c == 'c':\n                # 'a' followed by 'c' without 'b' is invalid\n                parts.append('a')\n                current_char = 'c'\n            else:\n                # First character is neither 'a' nor 'c'\n                parts.append('invalid')\n                break\n    else:\n        pass  # same as previous, continue\n\nif len(parts) == 1:\n    # Only 'a's\n    if len(parts) > 0 and parts[0] == 'a':\n        pass\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\nelif len(parts) == 2:\n    # After 'a's comes 'b's\n    if parts[1] == 'b':\n        pass\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\nelse:\n    # Shouldn't reach here, parts can only be ['a', 'b'] or 'invalid'\n    if parts[0] == 'a' and parts[1] == 'b':\n        pass\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        exit()\n\n# Now check counts\na_count = s.count('a')\nb_count = s.count('b')\nc_count = s.count('c')\n\nif c_count != a_count and c_count != b_count:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The code first verifies that the string follows the correct order of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and ending with 'c's. If any other order is detected, it immediately returns \"NO\".\n2. **Character Counting**: It counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n3. **Validation**: Finally, it checks if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's. If so, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that the string adheres to the specified formation rules efficiently and correctly.",
