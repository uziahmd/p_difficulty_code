There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit.

The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with certain restrictions and maximizing the profit. Each house can be built on a spot, and each spot has a height between 0 and h. The profit for each spot is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in a specific range of spots (l_i to r_i), the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to find the maximum possible profit by choosing the heights appropriately.\n\nHmm. So, how do I model this? It feels like a problem where I need to assign heights to each spot, subject to some constraints, and maximize the sum of squares. \n\nLet me think about the constraints. Each restriction l_i to r_i imposes that the maximum height in that interval is <= x_i. So for each interval, the maximum of all the heights in that interval can't exceed x_i.\n\nBut wait, the same spot might be covered by multiple restrictions. For example, a spot in the middle of several overlapping restrictions. So each spot's height must satisfy all the restrictions that include it.\n\nWait, no. Because each restriction is a separate constraint on the maximum in its own interval. So for each spot, the height is limited by any restriction that includes it. So for example, if a spot is part of two different restrictions, say one with x=5 and another with x=3, then the height for that spot can't exceed 3 because the second restriction is more restrictive.\n\nSo, for each spot i, the height a_i must be <= min of all x_j where the j-th restriction includes spot i. Additionally, a_i can't exceed h.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because each restriction is a maximum for its own interval. So, for each interval [l, r], the maximum a_i in that interval must be <= x. So, for a particular spot i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x's from the restrictions that include i, and also <= h.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each spot, the maximum possible height it can have is the minimum of x across all restrictions that cover it, as well as h.\n\nSo the first step is: for each spot i, compute the maximum allowed height as the minimum x among all restrictions that include i, and also at least 0 (since a_i can be zero). Also, since the default h is the maximum, any x_i >=h would effectively cap a_i at h.\n\nWait, no. If a restriction says x_i is larger than h, then the spot's maximum height is still h. Because h is the maximum allowed. So for each spot, the maximum possible is the minimum of all x's (from the applicable restrictions) and h.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each spot i, determine all the restrictions that apply to it. That is, all restrictions where l_i <= spot <= r_i.\n\n2. For each spot, the maximum possible height is the minimum of x across all applicable restrictions, and h. So a_i can be up to that value.\n\nOnce I know the maximum possible for each spot, I need to choose a_i such that the sum of squares is maximized. Since the sum is maximized when each a_i is as large as possible, given the constraints.\n\nBecause the square function is increasing for non-negative numbers, to maximize the sum, each a_i should be as high as possible under the constraints.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is to set each a_i to the maximum allowed by the restrictions. Because higher a_i contributes more to the sum.\n\nWait, yes. Because for a_i, increasing it beyond the maximum allowed would violate a restriction. So the maximum sum is achieved when each a_i is set to the maximum possible, which is the minimum of x_j (for applicable restrictions) and h.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each spot i:\n   - Find all restrictions that include i.\n   - Take the minimum x_j among those restrictions.\n   - a_i = min(h, this minimum x_j)\n   - Then, calculate the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping restrictions? Like, suppose spot i is covered by two restrictions, one with x=5 and another x=3. So the maximum allowed is 3. So a_i is 3.\n\nSo the process is to compute for each spot the tightest restriction (the smallest x) that applies to it. Then, a_i is the min of that and h.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward:\n\nInitialize an array a of size n, all zeros.\n\nFor each spot i from 1 to n:\n   current_max = h\n   for each restriction in the list:\n       if l_i <= i <= r_i:\n           current_max = min(current_max, x_i)\n   a[i] = current_max\n\nThen, compute the sum of squares of a.\n\nWait, but the restrictions are given as l_i and r_i, but in the code, how are they stored?\n\nIn the input, each of the m lines gives l_i, r_i, x_i. So, for each restriction, I can store it as a tuple (l, r, x). Then, for each spot i (1-based?), we check all restrictions to see if i is within l and r.\n\nWait, but for n up to 50, and m up to 50, this is manageable.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen, for each of m lines, read l, r, x. Note that l and r are 1-based indices.\n\nStore these as a list of tuples.\n\nThen, for each spot i in 1..n:\n\n   max_allowed = h\n\n   for each (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n       if l <= i <= r:\n\n           if x < max_allowed:\n\n               max_allowed = x\n\n   a_i = max(0, max_allowed)  # Wait, can x be negative? No, input constraints say x_i >=0.\n\nWait, no, the problem says x_i can be zero or up to h. So x is non-negative. So a_i is at least zero.\n\nSo the a_i will be max_allowed, which is min of x_j's and h.\n\nSo after computing a_i for all i, compute sum of a_i^2.\n\nThat's the approach.\n\nWait, let's test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n3 3 3\n1 1 1\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\nSo for spot 1:\n\nCheck each restriction.\n\nRestriction 1: l=1, r=1. i=1 is inside. x=1. So current_max is 1.\n\nOther restrictions don't include spot 1. So a_1 = 1.\n\nSpot 2:\n\nRestriction 2: l=2, r=2. x=3. current_max starts as 3.\n\nNo other restrictions apply here. So a_2=3.\n\nSpot3:\n\nRestriction3: l=3, r=3, x=2. So a_3=2.\n\nSo sum is 1+9+4=14. Which matches the example.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput:\n4 10 2\n2 3 8\n3 4 7\n\nSo restrictions are:\n\nFirst: l=2, r=3, x=8.\n\nSecond: l=3, r=4, x=7.\n\nFor spot 1:\n\nNo restrictions apply. So a_1 = min(h, ...) which is 10.\n\nSpot 2:\n\nIn first restriction, x=8. Second restriction starts at 3. So a_2=8.\n\nSpot3:\n\nBoth restrictions apply. So min(8,7) is7.\n\nSpot4: Only second restriction, x=7.\n\nSo a = [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 +64+49+49=262.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAnother test case: what if a spot is covered by multiple restrictions with varying x.\n\nFor example, spot 3 is covered by a restriction with x=5 and another with x=3. So a_i is 3.\n\nWhat about a spot not covered by any restriction? Then a_i is h.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe'll need to read n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines of l, r, x.\n\nWe can store the restrictions as a list of tuples.\n\nThen, for each spot i from 1 to n:\n\n   current_max = h\n\n   for each (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n       if l <= i <= r:\n\n           if x < current_max:\n\n               current_max = x\n\n   a_i = current_max\n\nCompute sum of squares.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead input:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\nThen, for each i in 1..n:\n\nmax_a = h\n\nfor (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n    if l <= i <= r:\n\n        if x < max_a:\n\n            max_a = x\n\na_i = max_a\n\nsum += a_i **2\n\nWait, but in the code, the variables are 1-based or 0-based? Because the input uses 1-based for l and r.\n\nSo for i in 1 to n:\n\nSo in code:\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    current_max = h\n\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n        if l <= i <= r:\n\n            if x < current_max:\n\n                current_max = x\n\n    total += current_max ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting with the first example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nrestrictions are (1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2).\n\nFor i=1:\n\nCheck each restriction:\n\n(1,1,1): yes, x=1. current_max becomes 1.\n\nothers don't apply. So a_i=1.\n\ni=2:\n\nonly (2,2,3). x=3. current_max remains 3.\n\ni=3:\n\nonly (3,3,2). current_max=2.\n\nSum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nSuppose n=1, h=5, m=1. Restriction is 1 1 3.\n\nSo a_1 is 3.\n\nSum is 9.\n\nIf m=0, then a_1 is 5.\n\nSo the code should handle m=0.\n\nWhat if a spot is covered by multiple overlapping restrictions, with varying x.\n\nLike, spot 2 is covered by a restriction with x=5 and another with x=3.\n\nSo the code picks 3.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nSo the final code is:\n\nRead the inputs as described.\n\nCompute for each spot i from 1 to n, the minimum x from all applicable restrictions, then take the min with h.\n\nSum squares.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    max_allowed = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < max_allowed:\n                max_allowed = x\n    total += max_allowed **2\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that should do it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible by building houses on a street with given constraints. Each house can be built at a specific spot with a height that must comply with certain zoning restrictions, and we aim to maximize the profit from these houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves maximizing the sum of squares of heights of houses built on each spot, subject to the constraints provided by the zoning restrictions. Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a given range must not exceed a certain height.\n2. **Constraints Handling**: For each spot, the maximum allowed height is determined by the smallest value among all applicable restrictions (if any) and the global maximum height `h`. This ensures that we respect all restrictions for each spot.\n3. **Optimal Height Assignment**: To maximize profit, each house should be as tall as possible within the constraints. Thus, each spot's height is set to the minimum value derived from the applicable restrictions and the global maximum height `h`.\n4. **Sum of Squares Calculation**: Once the optimal heights for all spots are determined, the total profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    max_allowed = h\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n        if l <= i <= r:\n            if x < max_allowed:\n                max_allowed = x\n    total += max_allowed ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code starts by reading the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`. Each restriction is then read and stored as a tuple in a list.\n2. **Iterating Over Spots**: For each spot from 1 to `n`, the code initializes the maximum allowed height to `h`.\n3. **Applying Restrictions**: For each spot, the code checks all restrictions to find the minimum height allowed by any restriction that applies to that spot. This minimum height is then used to update the maximum allowed height for that spot.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: The profit from each spot is calculated as the square of its maximum allowed height, and these values are summed up to get the total profit.\n5. **Output**: Finally, the total profit is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit by assigning the tallest possible heights to each spot.",
