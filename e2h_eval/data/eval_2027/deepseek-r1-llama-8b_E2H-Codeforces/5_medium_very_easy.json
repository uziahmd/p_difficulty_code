Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. And then output the pairs along with the count.\n\nHmm, let me break it down.\n\nEach left boot has a color (a lowercase letter or '?'), same for right boots. Two colors are compatible if they are the same or one is '?'. So, for example, 'a' and 'a' are compatible, '?' and 'b' are compatible, but 'a' and 'c' are not.\n\nThe task is to pair each left boot with exactly one right boot, ensuring all pairs are unique in their indices. So no two pairs can share a left or right boot.\n\nI need to compute the maximum possible number of such pairs.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. It seems like a bipartite graph matching problem, but with n being up to 150,000, standard algorithms like the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm would be too slow because their time complexity is O(E√V), which could be high here.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's consider that each left boot can be matched to any right boot that is compatible. Since each pair is just a one-to-one mapping, perhaps we can model this as a graph where edges represent compatibility, and find the maximum matching.\n\nBut with n=150,000, building such a graph isn't feasible. So we need a more efficient approach.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe count the number of possible pairs and figure out how to maximize them by grouping similar colors.\n\nSo, for each position i, the left boot l[i] can be paired with any r[j] where j is not already used, and l[i] is compatible with r[j].\n\nThe key is to find a way to match as many as possible without overlapping.\n\nAn alternative approach: for each color c (including '?'), find how many left boots are c and how many right boots are compatible with c. Then, the maximum possible pairs for c is the minimum of the left count and the sum of right compatible counts.\n\nBut wait, this isn't straightforward because the right boots can't be reused across different c's. So the problem is more complex than that.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be transformed into finding a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes that are compatible. Then, the maximum matching in this graph is the answer. But again, with n=15e4, the standard methods won't work.\n\nHmm, so what's the structure of the bipartite graph here? Each left node is connected to multiple right nodes. The question is, can we model this in a way that allows us to compute the maximum matching quickly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it using frequency counts of certain groups and find a way to maximize the pairs based on these groups.\n\nAnother idea: group the right boots by their color. For each color c, we can have a count of how many right boots are c or '?'. Similarly, group the left boots.\n\nThen, for each left color, determine which right colors are compatible and calculate the maximum possible matches considering overlaps.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the following:\n\n- For each left boot, the right boots that can pair with it are those with the same color as the left or '?'.\n\nSo, for each left boot, collect all right boots that are compatible, and then find the maximum matching where each right is used at most once.\n\nThis sounds like the bipartite matching problem, but with large n, so we need an efficient way.\n\nWait, but in bipartite graphs where each left node has a lot of edges, but the right nodes are arranged in a certain way, perhaps there's a greedy approach.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: since the '?' is compatible with everything, perhaps we can use the '?'s as a way to fill in the gaps.\n\nLet me think about the '?' in left and right.\n\nFor example, any left '?' can pair with any right (since right could be '?', a specific color, etc.). Similarly, any right '?' can pair with any left.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum matching can be found by considering the number of '?' in left and right, and also the counts of specific colors.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me try to outline steps:\n\n1. Count the number of left and right boots that are '?'.\n\n2. For each specific color c (a-z), count the number of lefts and rights that have color c.\n\n3. Then, for each color c, the maximum possible pairs between left c and right c is the minimum of left_c and right_c.\n\nBut wait, the right c can also be paired with left c, but also any left that is '?'.\n\nWait, this approach is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nAlternative approach inspired by the problem constraints:\n\nWe can model this as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes that are compatible. We need to find the maximum matching in this graph.\n\nBut for n=15e4, the standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms won't work due to time constraints.\n\nWait, but perhaps the structure of the graph allows for some optimization.\n\nEach left node is connected to a subset of right nodes. What if the right nodes are sorted, and for each left, we can efficiently find compatible rights that are still available?\n\nThis sounds like the problem can be modeled using the greedy algorithm with some optimizations, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to a range of right nodes, allowing for some kind of interval-based matching.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of this problem in terms of the maximum possible pairs, and find a way to count them without explicitly building the graph.\n\nAnother idea: The maximum number of pairs is the sum over all possible color pairs of the minimum between left count and right compatible count, but this isn't correct because the right counts are shared across different left color pairs.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe we can model it as a bipartitioned graph with left and right nodes, and for each left node, precompute the compatible right nodes. Then, for the maximum matching, perhaps a greedy approach could work.\n\nWait, but for n=15e4, even O(n) per left node is 1e10 operations, which is way too much.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find a way to represent the compatible right nodes for each left node in a way that allows for efficient processing.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. For each right node, which left nodes can it pair with?\n\nFor each right node, the compatible left nodes are those whose color is equal to the right's color or '?'.\n\nSo, for each right node, the compatible left nodes are the ones with color equal to r_j or '?'.\n\nThus, each right node can potentially connect to all left nodes that have color r_j or '?'. So, the problem is to select a subset of left and right nodes such that each selected right is connected to a selected left, and vice versa, with no overlaps.\n\nBut again, how to do this efficiently.\n\nHmm, perhaps the solution lies in counting the number of left and right '?' and specific colors, and then greedily assigning as many pairs as possible.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nCase 1: Pairing left '?' with right '?'.\n\nThese can all be paired together, as both are compatible.\n\nBut wait, the left '?' can pair with any right, including non-'?'.\n\nSimilarly, the right '?' can pair with any left, including non-'?'.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is to first pair as many '?' as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me outline a plan:\n\n1. First, process all the '?'.\n\n   a. The number of left '?' is L_q.\n\n   b. The number of right '?' is R_q.\n\n   Now, any left '?' can pair with any right '?'.\n\n   So, the maximum possible pairs from left '?' and right '?' is min(L_q, R_q).\n\n   But wait, some right '?' may also be paired with left specific colors, which could affect the total.\n\n   Hmm, maybe not. Because pairing a left '?' with a right '?' takes away a right '?', which could have been used elsewhere.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first pair as many left '?' with right '?' as possible, then handle the remaining left '?' and specific colors.\n\n   Or perhaps, the '?' can be treated as a special case.\n\nWait, perhaps the following steps can be considered:\n\nStep 1: Compute the number of left and right '?'.\n\nStep 2: The maximum possible pairs using left '?' and right '?' is min(left_q, right_q). Let's say this gives x pairs.\n\nBut then, the remaining left '?' (left_q -x) can pair with any right that are not yet used. Similarly, the remaining right '?' can pair with any left that are not used.\n\nBut this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '?' can be handled separately.\n\nAnother approach: For each left, find the best possible right that can be paired with it, ensuring that each right is used only once.\n\nBut again, this is O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes that are compatible. Then, the maximum matching can be found.\n\nBut with n=15e4, this is impossible.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is to model the problem using frequency tables and greedy assignment.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the graph.\n\nEach left node can be connected to:\n\n- All right nodes with color equal to the left's color.\n\n- All right nodes with color '?'\n\nSo, for each left color c, the compatible right colors are c and '?'.\n\nThus, for each left color c, the compatible right nodes are:\n\nright_c + right_?.\n\nSimilarly, for each right color d, the compatible left nodes are:\n\nleft_d + left_?.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum matching can be found by considering the counts of each color and '?'.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nLet me define:\n\nFor each color c (including '?'), count the number of lefts (lc[c]) and rights (rc[c]).\n\nThen, for each color c, the number of possible pairs is the minimum of lc[c], rc[c].\n\nBut this doesn't account for the fact that a right can be used in multiple ways.\n\nWait, no. Because a right can be used either for its own color or as a '?', but not both.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to assign as many as possible within each color, then handle the leftovers.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought: the maximum possible pairs is the sum for each c of min(lc[c], rc[c]) plus the number of pairs where one is '?' and the other is not, but ensuring that we don't double count.\n\nNo, that's not accurate because a left '?' can pair with any right, including those with their own color.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be broken down into three parts:\n\n1. Pairs where both are '?': the number is min(left_q, right_q).\n\n2. Pairs where left is a specific color c and right is c.\n\n3. Pairs where left is a specific color c and right is '?'.\n\n4. Pairs where left is '?' and right is a specific color d.\n\n5. Pairs where left is '?' and right is '?': this is part of 1.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to model this as:\n\n- For each specific color c, the maximum possible pairs are min(lc[c], rc[c]).\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right '?', assign as many as possible.\n\nBut then, after handling specific colors, the remaining '?' can pair with each other.\n\nWait, but perhaps that's not optimal.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to first assign as many pairs as possible between specific colors, and then handle the '?'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '?' can be used to cover any remaining spots.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nSuppose:\n\nLeft: 'a a ?'\n\nRight: 'a ? ?'\n\nSo, lc['a']=2, rc['a']=1, left_q=1, right_q=2.\n\nIf I first assign the 'a's: 1 pair.\n\nThen, the remaining left 'a' can't pair with any 'a's on the right (only 0 left), so it can pair with right '?': so 1 pair.\n\nThen, the remaining left '?' can pair with one of the right '?'s: 1 pair.\n\nTotal pairs: 3.\n\nAlternatively, if I first pair the left '?' with right 'a's.\n\nWait, but the right 'a' can't pair with the left '?', but the left 'a's can.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is better.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother example:\n\nLeft: 'a ?'\n\nRight: 'a ?'\n\nIn this case, the specific 'a's can form 1 pair. The left '?' can pair with the remaining right '?': 1 pair. Total 2.\n\nAlternatively, if I pair the left '?' with the right 'a's, but that's invalid because 'a' and 'a' are compatible, but the left '?' can pair with any right, including 'a's.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in this case, the left '?' can pair with the right 'a' because '? is compatible with a.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to pair the left '?' with the right 'a's first, leaving the left 'a's to pair with the right '?'.\n\nBut then, the total is also 2.\n\nSo, whether you handle specific colors first or not, the total is the same.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the order doesn't matter in this case.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal approach is to:\n\n1. For each specific color c, assign as many pairs as possible, i.e., min(lc[c], rc[c]).\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right '?', assign pairs.\n\nBut this may miss some opportunities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '?' should be handled first.\n\nWait, perhaps the '?' can be used to cover the maximum possible, regardless of specific colors.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs can be determined by the sum of:\n\nsum over c (min(lc[c], rc[c])) + (left_q * right_q) ?\n\nNo, that can't be right because some pairs are overlapping.\n\nWait, no. Because a right c can be used either for a left c or for a left '?', but not both.\n\nSo, the sum of min(lc[c], rc[c]) for all c, plus the number of pairs from left q and right q, but considering that some rights may have been used in step 1.\n\nHmm, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Assign all possible pairs for specific colors. For each c, take min(lc[c], rc[c]). Sum these as S.\n\n2. Then, the remaining left and right boots are:\n\nleft_remaining = sum lc[c] - sum min(lc[c], rc[c])\n\nright_remaining = sum rc[c] - sum min(lc[c], rc[c])\n\nWait, no. Because for each c, min(lc[c], rc[c]) is taken, so the remaining left and right for c are (lc[c] - min) and (rc[c] - min). But the remaining left and right may have some specific colors, but also the '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute for each specific color c, the number of pairs is the minimum of lc[c] and rc[c]. Then, subtract these from lc and rc.\n\nWait, but perhaps the '?' is a separate category.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nCompute for each color c (including '?'):\n\npairs_c = min(lc[c], rc[c])\n\nsum all pairs_c → S.\n\nThen, the remaining left is sum (lc[c] - pairs_c) for all c except '?', plus left_q_remaining = lc['?'] - (pairs_?).\n\nSimilarly, right_remaining is sum (rc[c] - pairs_c) for all c except '?', plus right_q_remaining = rc['?'] - (pairs_?).\n\nWait, but pairs_? is min(lc['?'], rc['?']) → but if we subtract that, the remaining left and right for '?' are zero.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is not capturing the interdependencies correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of the specific color pairs plus the number of pairs formed by the remaining left and right '?', but this may not capture all possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\nCompute the number of pairs for specific colors as the sum of min(lc[c], rc[c]).\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right (both including '?'), see how many can be paired.\n\nThe remaining left is (sum lc[c] - sum min(lc[c], rc[c])) + left_q_remaining.\n\nWait, no. Because for '?', we have lc['?'] and rc['?'].\n\nBut after step 1, the number of pairs for '?' is min(lc['?'], rc['?']). So, the remaining left for '?' is max(lc['?'] - rc['?'], 0), and similarly for right.\n\nBut then, the remaining left and right (including specific colors) can be paired as follows:\n\nThe remaining left includes:\n\nfor each c, lc[c] - pairs_c → but these are specific colors.\n\nPlus, left_q_remaining = lc['?'] - pairs_? \n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nNow, the remaining left is R = sum (lc[c] - pairs_c for c in all colors except '?') + (lc['?'] - pairs_?)\n\nThe remaining right is similar.\n\nWait, but the remaining left and right can be paired if a left is compatible with a right. But the way to pair them is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the remaining left and right can be paired as follows:\n\nThe remaining left includes some specific colors and possibly some '?'. Similarly for right.\n\nThe maximum possible pairs from the remaining is the minimum of the total remaining left and right.\n\nBut that's not necessarily correct, because a left of color c can only pair with right of color c or '?'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the remaining left and right can be considered as a single group, but this depends on the structure.\n\nHmm, perhaps this problem is more complicated than I initially thought.\n\nLet me look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, the problem resembles the bipartite maximum matching where edges exist between left and right if compatible. But given the size, it's impossible to process each node individually.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: the '?' can pair with anything, including specific colors and other '?'. So, perhaps the optimal approach is to:\n\n1. Assign as many specific color pairs as possible.\n\n2. Then, use the '?' to cover any remaining left or right, or even cover the remaining specific colors.\n\nWait, but perhaps the '? can be used to cover any remaining left or right.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(lc[c], rc[c]) for all c, plus the number of '?' in left and right, but considering that some can be used to cover the remaining specific color.\n\nNo, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of min(lc[c], rc[c]) for all c plus the number of '?' in left and right, but this can't exceed the sum of (lq + rq) where lq is the number of left '?', and rq is the number of right '?'.\n\nWait, no. Because the sum of min(lc[c], rc[c]) for all c can include some of the '?', which would reduce the available '?' for other pairs.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about how to model the problem.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes that are compatible.\n\nThe maximum matching in this graph is the required answer.\n\nBut with n=15e4, the standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms (like the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm) would be too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a way to model this graph in a way that allows for a greedy solution.\n\nWait, perhaps for each right node, the compatible left nodes are a certain set. Then, we can arrange the right nodes in an order that allows for efficient processing.\n\nWait, another idea: since each left node can be connected to a subset of right nodes, perhaps the graph is a bipartite graph where the right nodes are ordered in a way that for each left node, the compatible right nodes are contiguous.\n\nIf that's the case, perhaps the problem can be solved using a greedy approach similar to the one used in interval scheduling.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a bipartite graph where the right nodes are sorted, and for each left node, the compatible right nodes are a prefix or suffix of the sorted list.\n\nBut again, this is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the following plan:\n\n1. Preprocess the left and right arrays to count the frequency of each color, including '?'.\n\n   For each color c, left_counts[c] = number of times c appears in l.\n\n   Similarly for right_counts[c].\n\n2. For each color c, the maximum possible pairs between left c and right c is min(left_counts[c], right_counts[c]).\n\n   Sum these to get the base_pairs.\n\n3. Subtract these pairs from left_counts and right_counts.\n\n   So, for each c, left_counts[c] -= base_pairs[c]\n\n   right_counts[c] -= base_pairs[c]\n\n4. Now, handle the remaining '?'.\n\n   The remaining left '?' is left_counts['?']\n\n   The remaining right '?' is right_counts['?']\n\n   The maximum additional pairs from these is min(left_counts['?'], right_counts['?'])\n\n   Add this to the total.\n\n5. Now, for the remaining left and right (excluding '?'), check if any can form pairs.\n\n   For each color c, the remaining left and right are left_counts[c] and right_counts[c].\n\n   They can form pairs if left_counts[c] <= right_counts[c].\n\n   The sum of these is the additional_pairs.\n\n6. The total pairs is base_pairs + additional_pairs.\n\nWait, but this approach may not be optimal because the '?' can be used to pair with any remaining specific colors.\n\nBut according to step 4, after using the '?' for specific color pairs, the remaining '?' can be used for each other.\n\nWait, perhaps the steps are:\n\nAfter step 3, the remaining left and right (including '?') can be paired as follows.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\n- Handle the specific color pairs first.\n\n- Then, handle the '?' pairs among themselves.\n\n- Then, handle the left '?' pairing with the remaining right specific colors.\n\nWait, but this is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to model this as a bipartite graph, but find a way to compute the maximum matching efficiently.\n\nBut given the problem constraints, I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of pairs (i,j) where i is a left boot, j is a right boot, and l[i] is compatible with r[j]. No two pairs share the same i or j.\n\nThis is exactly the maximum bipartite matching problem.\n\nBut with n=15e4, the standard approaches are too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps the graph has a particular structure that allows for a greedy solution.\n\nEach left node can be connected to a subset of right nodes (those with same color or '?'). So, for each left node, the compatible right nodes form a certain subset.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nAnother thought: the problem can be considered as a bipartite graph where the right nodes are grouped by their color, and for each left node, the compatible right groups are known.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be reduced to a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to a set of right nodes, and the maximum matching can be found by a greedy approach that pairs each left with the earliest possible right.\n\nBut again, for 15e4 nodes, this would be too slow.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering the following:\n\n- Each right node can be assigned to a left node if they are compatible.\n\n- The maximum number of pairs is the sum of the frequencies of each color, considering that '?' can pair with anything.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a bipartite graph where each left node is connected to all right nodes that are compatible, and then the maximum matching can be found using the Hungarian algorithm. However, the Hungarian algorithm is O(n^3), which is definitely not feasible for n=15e4.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum matching is simply the sum of the minimum of left_counts and right_counts for each color, plus the minimum of left_q and right_q, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's test this with some examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nn=3\n\nl = \"a?a\"\n\nr = \"a?b\"\n\nSo, l has a:2, ?:1.\n\nr has a:1, ?:1, b:1.\n\nBase_pairs:\n\na: min(2,1)=1.\n\n?: min(1,1)=1.\n\nSum is 2.\n\nRemaining left: a:1, ?:0.\n\nRemaining right: a:0, b:1.\n\nNow, the remaining left is a:1, which can pair with right b:1? Because a and b are not compatible.\n\nNo, because a and b are not compatible. So, the a cannot pair with any right except a or '?'.\n\nSo, the base_pairs is 2, and the remaining left a cannot pair with any right except a or '?'. But all a's are used, and the right has b and ?.\n\nWait, no, in the example above, the left a has 2, and right a is 1, so base_pairs is 1. Then, the left a has 1 remaining. The right has 1 b and 1 ?, but the a can only pair with a or ?.\n\nSo, the a can pair with the right ?.\n\nSo, in this case, the total pairs would be 1 (from a) + 1 (from ?) + 1 (from a pairing with ?) → but wait, the ? is already used.\n\nHmm, perhaps my approach isn't capturing this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to:\n\nCompute base_pairs as sum of min(lc[c], rc[c]).\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right, including '?', compute the maximum number of pairs where a left can pair with a right that is compatible.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps the remaining left and right can be considered as a bipartite graph where the left nodes are the remaining specific colors and '?', and the right nodes are the same.\n\nBut again, for n=15e4, this is not feasible.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is similar to the maximum bipartite matching where the right nodes are arranged in a certain way, allowing for a greedy approach.\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAnother Idea: Since each right can be paired with left of same color or '?', perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of the minimum of left and right counts for each color, plus the number of '?' in left multiplied by '?' in right, but this may overcount.\n\nBut this isn't correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum for each color c of min(lc[c], rc[c]), plus the number of '?' in left and right, but considering that some can be used to cover the deficit in specific colors.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me think of the sample input provided.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=7\n\nl = abaca?b\n\nr = zabbbcc\n\nSo, l is a b a c a ? b.\n\nSo, l counts: a:3, b:2, c:1, ?:1.\n\nr is z a b b b c c.\n\nr counts: z:1, a:1, b:4, c:2.\n\nSo, base_pairs:\n\na: min(3,1) → 1.\n\nb: min(2,4) → 2.\n\nc: min(1,2) →1.\n\nSo, base_pairs sum is 4.\n\nRemaining left: a:2, b:0, c:0, ?:1.\n\nRemaining right: a:0, b:0, c:1, z:1.\n\nNow, the remaining left has a:2 and ?:1.\n\nThe remaining right has c:1, z:1.\n\nSo, the a:2 can pair with c:1 (no, a and c are not compatible), but can pair with z:1? No, a and z are not compatible.\n\nWait, no, a can only pair with a or '?'. So, a:2 can't pair with any right, as the right has c and z, which are not a or '?'.\n\nSo, the a:2 can't be paired.\n\nThe ?:1 can pair with c:1 or z:1.\n\nSo, one pair.\n\nSo, total pairs 4+1=5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo, in this case, the approach worked.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSample Output:\n\nThe output shows 5 pairs.\n\nSo, the approach seems to work.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\nn=2\n\nl = \"??\"\n\nr = \"??\"\n\nThen, base_pairs: min(2,2)=2.\n\nRemaining left: 0, right:0.\n\nSo, total 2 pairs.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2\n\nl = \"ab\"\n\nr = \"cd\".\n\nbase_pairs: 0 for all.\n\nremaining left: a and b.\n\nremaining right: c and d.\n\nNo compatible pairs.\n\nSo, total 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2\n\nl = \"a?\"\n\nr = \"?c\"\n\nbase_pairs: a and a: min(1,0)=0.\n\nbase_pairs: ? and ?: min(1,1)=1.\n\nSo, base_pairs=1.\n\nRemaining left: a:1, ?:0.\n\nRemaining right: c:1, ?:0.\n\na can only pair with a or ?, but none left.\n\nSo, total 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the frequency counts for each color (including '?') in l and r.\n\n2. For each color c, compute the number of pairs as min(lc[c], rc[c]).\n\n3. Sum these to get the base_pairs.\n\n4. Subtract these pairs from lc and rc.\n\n5. For the remaining '?', compute the minimum of the remaining lc['?'] and rc['?'].\n\n6. Add this to the total.\n\nBut wait, in the sample I tried earlier:\n\nl = \"a?a\", r = \"a?b\".\n\nAfter step 2:\n\nlc['a']=2, lc['?']=1.\n\nrc['a']=1, rc['?']=1, rc['b']=1.\n\nstep 3: base_pairs is 1 (a) + 1 (?) → 2.\n\nSubtract: lc['a']=1, lc['?']=0.\n\nrc['a']=0, rc['?']=0, rc['b']=1.\n\nstep 5: remaining lc['?']=0, rc['?']=0 → 0.\n\nSo, total is 2.\n\nBut in reality, the left a:1 can pair with the right ?:1.\n\nSo, the approach undercounts.\n\nAh, so the approach is missing this case.\n\nSo, the issue is that after step 4, there are remaining left a and right b.\n\nBut a and b are not compatible, so they can't pair.\n\nBut the right b is not compatible with any left except b or '?'. So, the a can't pair with it.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nWait, but in the example where:\n\nl = \"a?\", r = \"?b\".\n\nThen, base_pairs: a and a is 0, ? and ?: min(1,1)=1.\n\nSo, total 1 pair.\n\nRemaining left: a:1, ?:0.\n\nRemaining right: b:1, ?:0.\n\na can't pair with b, so no more pairs.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nl = \"a?\"\n\nr = \"a?\"\n\nbase_pairs: a:1, ?:1 → sum 2.\n\nremaining left: 0, 0.\n\nSo, correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nl = \"a?\"\n\nr = \"?a\".\n\nbase_pairs: a: min(1,1) →1, ?: min(1,1) →1.\n\nsum 2.\n\nremaining left:0,0.\n\ncorrect.\n\nBut wait, in another scenario:\n\nl = \"a?b\"\n\nr = \"abc\"\n\nlc: a:1, ?:1, b:1.\n\nrc: a:1, b:1, c:1.\n\nbase_pairs: a:1, b:1, others 0.\n\nsum 2.\n\nremaining left: ?:1, b:0.\n\nremaining right: c:1, a:0.\n\nthe ?:1 can pair with c:1 →1 pair.\n\nso, total 3.\n\nSo, in this case, the approach works.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCompute the base_pairs, then compute the additional pairs between remaining '? ' and other colors.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute for each color c, base_pairs += min(lc[c], rc[c]).\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right (including '?'), the additional pairs are the minimum of the total remaining left and right, considering that a left can only pair with right of same color or '?'.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, the remaining left is sum of (lc[c] - base_pairs[c]) for all c except '?', plus lc['?'].\n\nSimilarly for the right.\n\nBut the remaining left and right can be paired as follows:\n\nEach left can pair with any right that is compatible.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional pairs is the maximum bipartite matching in the remaining graph.\n\nBut how to compute this without iterating all nodes.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative approach:\n\nThe maximum number of additional pairs is the sum of min(remaining_left, remaining_right) for each color, plus the remaining '?' pairs.\n\nWait, no.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe additional pairs can be computed by:\n\n- For each color c, the remaining left and right can form min(lc[c], rc[c]) pairs.\n\nBut wait, since after base_pairs, lc[c] and rc[c] have been reduced.\n\nSo, for each color c, compute min(lc[c], rc[c]) → add to the additional pairs.\n\nThen, for the remaining '?', compute min(lc['?'], rc['?']).\n\nAdd that.\n\nSo, the total is base_pairs + sum_over_c min(lc[c], rc[c]) + min(lc['?'], rc['?']).\n\nBut this can't be correct because when we process the '? ' after the base_pairs, we might have some right nodes that can be covered by the left '? '.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the additional pairs can be computed as follows:\n\nThe remaining left is R = sum (lc[c] for c in all colors except '?') + lc['?'].\n\nThe remaining right is R = sum (rc[c] for c in all colors except '?') + rc['?'].\n\nThe additional pairs is min(R, R), but considering that each left must be compatible with the right.\n\nBut this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nWait, but perhaps the additional pairs can be computed as the minimum of the total remaining left and right.\n\nBecause each left can pair with any right that is compatible, but the maximum possible is the smaller of the two totals.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute base_pairs.\n\n2. Compute remaining left and right.\n\n3. additional_pairs = min(remaining_left_total, remaining_right_total).\n\n4. total = base_pairs + additional_pairs.\n\nBut this approach may not be correct, because the additional_pairs may not be possible.\n\nBut in the previous example where l = \"a?a\" and r = \"a?b\", after base_pairs=2, the remaining_left is 1 a and 0 ?, remaining_right is 1 b and 0 ?.\n\nThe additional_pairs is min(1,1) =1, but a and b are not compatible.\n\nSo, this approach overcounts.\n\nThus, the approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so the problem is more complex than I thought.\n\nAt this point, perhaps it's better to look for a solution that uses the fact that each left can be connected to a certain subset of right, and model this as a bipartite graph, but find a way to compute the maximum matching efficiently.\n\nBut with n=15e4, it's impossible to use standard algorithms.\n\nThus, perhaps the problem requires an approach that uses the structure of the graph to find the maximum matching quickly.\n\nAnother Idea: Since each left can be connected to a subset of right nodes, perhaps the graph is a bipartite graph where the right nodes are grouped by their color, and each group can be processed in a certain way.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a flow problem, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it as a bipartite graph where the right nodes are ordered, and for each left, the compatible right nodes form a contiguous block.\n\nIf that's the case, then the problem can be solved using a greedy approach.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the initial plan, and then see if it passes the sample cases and other test cases.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Count the frequency of each color in l and r.\n\n2. For each color c, add min(lc[c], rc[c]) to base_pairs.\n\n3. Subtract these from lc and rc.\n\n4. Compute the additional pairs as min(lc['?'], rc['?']).\n\n5. The total is base_pairs + additional_pairs.\n\n6. Then, for the remaining left and right (non-? colors), compute min(lc[c], rc[c]) for each c and add to the total.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example, the a and b weren't compatible.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nCompute base_pairs as the sum of min(lc[c], rc[c]).\n\nThen, compute the additional pairs from the",
