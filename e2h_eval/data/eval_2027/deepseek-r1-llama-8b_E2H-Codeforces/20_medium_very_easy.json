For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about binary strings and choosing certain values for each string such that a multiset of these strings is 'beautiful'. And we need to count the number of ways to choose these c_s values so that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nWe are given n, k, f. We consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to n. For each such string s, we choose c_s from 0 to k. Then, the multiset is beautiful if for every string s (of any length), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. \n\nWait, but the multiset itself is of strings of length exactly n. So when considering s of length less than n, their prefixes would be longer strings. Wait no—no, wait, the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So for example, if s is \"0\", then any string in the multiset that starts with \"0\" will contribute to s's count. Because for s being a prefix, the strings in the multiset must have s as a prefix. So if the multiset contains \"00\", \"01\", etc., they all start with \"0\".\n\nSo for each string s (from length 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix cannot exceed c_s.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of ways to assign c_s for all s (length 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nWait, but how is the maximum size determined based on the c_s choices? Because for each s, the count is limited by c_s, which in turn affects how many longer strings can be included.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is determined by considering all possible s, and for each s, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is constrained by c_s. So the total number of strings that can be added without violating any constraints is the minimum over all s of (c_s + something?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum over s of the number of strings that have s as a prefix but nothing longer. Or maybe it's more complex.\n\nWait, maybe the way to model this is through a tree structure. Each binary string can be seen as a node in a trie. The root is the empty string, but since we're only considering strings of length >=1, the root isn't part of our consideration. But for our problem, each node represents a string s. The children of s are the strings formed by appending 0 or 1 to s.\n\nIn this trie, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at s. For example, for s = \"00\", its subtree includes \"00\", \"01\", \"00...\" etc., depending on the depth.\n\nBut wait, the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So for a string t of length n, the number of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix is the number of strings in the multiset that start with t. So for t of length m, the number of strings in the multiset that start with t is equal to the number of its descendants in the trie, including itself, but considering only those of length n.\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Because the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. So for any t of length m, the number of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix is equal to the number of strings of length n that start with t. So for t of length m < n, this is the number of possible extensions beyond t to length n. For example, if t is \"0\" (length 1), then the number of strings of length 2 that start with \"0\" is 2 (since they can be \"00\" or \"01\"). Similarly, for t of length n, it's 1 (only itself).\n\nSo for each s, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix, which is the number of extensions of s to length n. But wait, no: because the multiset can contain multiple copies of the same string. For example, if the multiset has two copies of \"00\", then for s = \"0\", both \"00\" strings are counted towards the count for s.\n\nAh right, because each occurrence of a string in the multiset that starts with s contributes 1 to the count. So for each s, the count is the sum over all t in the multiset where s is a prefix of t.\n\nSo for the multiset to be beautiful, for every s, the number of such t's in the multiset must be ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum possible size of the multiset is f. So we need to find the number of assignments of c_s's such that when we compute the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset, it's exactly f.\n\nWait, but how do the c_s's affect the maximum size?\n\nI think the maximum size is determined by the sum over all s of the maximum possible number of times s can appear in the multiset, given the constraints on the counts. Hmm, maybe not. Or perhaps, the maximum size is the minimum over all s of (c_s + 1). Because for each s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix can't exceed c_s. So, for example, the root s = \"\" (but not considered here) would have all strings in the multiset as its descendants. But since we don't include s of length 0, perhaps the longest string is s of length n, whose count is 1.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's model the problem using the trie structure again.\n\nEach node s (string of length m) has a certain capacity c_s, which is the maximum number of descendants (including itself) that can be present in the multiset. Because any string in the multiset that is a descendant of s will contribute to s's count. So for s, the number of such strings can't exceed c_s.\n\nWait, but each string in the multiset is of length n. So for a node s of length m, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of children of s (including s itself if m = n) that are of length n.\n\nWait, no. Because for s of length m, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. So for example, if s is \"0\", then the strings in the multiset that start with \"0\" are \"00\", \"01\", ..., up to \"0 followed by (n-m) bits\". Each of these has s as a prefix.\n\nSo the count for s is the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. For s of length m, this is equal to the number of possible completions of s to length n. So for m < n, it's 2^{n - m}, assuming that all possible completions are allowed. But in the multiset, each string is unique only up to multiplicity. Wait, no, the multiset allows multiple instances of the same string. So for s of length m, the count is the number of times s appears in the multiset, plus the number of times each of its proper superstrings appear.\n\nWait, no. No, for each occurrence of a string t in the multiset, if t starts with s, then it contributes 1 to s's count. So the count is the sum over all t in the multiset where s is a prefix of t.\n\nFor example, if the multiset contains two copies of \"00\", then for s = \"0\", the count is 2. For s = \"00\", the count is 2.\n\nSo, for each s, the count is the sum of the multiplicities of all strings t in the multiset that start with s.\n\nThus, the condition is that for each s, this sum is ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose c_s's such that the maximum possible size of the multiset is exactly f. And we need to count the number of ways to choose c_s's that satisfy this.\n\nHmm. Now, to model this, perhaps we can represent the problem in terms of a tree where each node s has a capacity c_s. The maximum size is the sum over all possible subsets of the tree nodes, subject to the constraints that for each node s, the number of selected nodes in its subtree (including itself) is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the maximum size of the multiset? Because the multiset is built from the leaves of the tree (strings of length n). Each leaf in the trie corresponds to a string of length n.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is the minimum, over all s, of (c_s + 1). Because for each s, the number of its descendants (including itself) is 2^{n - m}, but that's only when considering all possible completions. But wait, no—because the multiset can have multiple copies of the same string.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the sum of all possible paths from the root to the leaves, but I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the problem using dynamic programming. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet’s consider the trie structure, where each node s has a certain c_s. The maximum number of strings we can choose in the multiset is the sum of the min(c_s, ...) across all paths.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is the product of (c_s + 1) for all nodes along the path from the root to each leaf. But that doesn’t sound right either.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum size is the sum over all possible strings t of length n, of the minimum c_s along the path from the root to t, plus one. Because for each t, the number of times it can appear in the multiset is limited by the minimum c_s along its path, but since the multiset can have multiple copies, perhaps it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible size is the sum over all s of (number of possible extensions from s to n) multiplied by the minimum c_s along the path.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model the problem as a tree where each node s has a constraint c_s. The maximum number of strings that can be chosen is the sum over all nodes s of the number of possible extensions from s to n, but each extension is allowed up to the minimum c_s along the path from the root to that extension.\n\nHmm, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to think in terms of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum size of the multiset is equal to the sum over all s of the minimum between c_s and the number of possible extensions from s to length n. But that doesn't capture the dependencies correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum for each s of the number of possible strings that can be added in the multiset, given that for each s, you can't add more than c_s times the number of possible strings that start with s.\n\nNo, that might not be accurate either.\n\nLet me think about the sample input to get some intuition.\n\nSample Input 1:\n1 42 2\n\nSo n=1, k=42, f=2.\n\nPossible s's are \"0\" and \"1\".\n\nEach c_0 and c_1 can be between 0 and 42.\n\nWe need to assign c_0 and c_1 such that the maximum possible size is exactly 2.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible size? It's the maximum number of strings of length 1 (so \"0\" and \"1\") that can be in the multiset under the constraints.\n\nEach string in the multiset contributes 1 to the count of its own s and all its prefixes.\n\nFor example, if the multiset contains two \"0\"s, then:\n\n- For s=\"0\": count is 2.\n- For s=\"1\": count is 0.\n\nIf c_0 >=2 and c_1 >=0, then it's allowed.\n\nSo in this case, the maximum possible size is the sum of the number of allowed strings in the multiset.\n\nWait, no. The maximum size is the maximum possible number of strings in the multiset, considering all constraints. So for the sample input, what's the maximum size?\n\nIn the sample explanation, there are three possible assignments leading to maximum size 2.\n\nLet me see:\n\nCase 1: c_0=0, c_1=2.\n\nThen, for s=0, the count is the number of strings in the multiset that start with 0. But since c_0=0, the count must be <=0. So the multiset can't contain any string starting with 0. So the only string possible is \"1\".\n\nSo the multiset can have at most 1 string, but the sample says the maximum size is 2. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no. In the sample explanation, the first case is c_0=0, c_1=2. The multiset is {1,1}, which is allowed because for s=0, the count is 0 (since none of the strings start with 0). For s=1, the count is 2 (both \"1\"s are in the multiset), which is ≤ c_1=2.\n\nSo the maximum size is 2.\n\nAh, okay, so the maximum size is indeed 2.\n\nAnother case: c_0=1, c_1=1. Then, the multiset can include \"0\" and \"1\", each once. Because for s=0, the count is 1 (\"0\" is in the multiset), which is ≤ c_0=1. For s=1, the count is 1 (\"1\" is in the multiset), which is ≤ c_1=1.\n\nSo the maximum size is 2.\n\nThird case: c_0=2, c_1=0. Then, the multiset can include \"0\" twice. For s=0, count is 2 ≤2; for s=1, count is 0 ≤0. So the maximum size is 2.\n\nSo in all these cases, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the problem is to choose c_s's such that the maximum possible size is f. So for each possible assignment of c_s's, compute the maximum possible size of the multiset, and count how many assignments have this maximum equal to f.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model this in code efficiently.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 15, and k and f can be up to 2e5, we need an efficient way to compute the required count.\n\nLet me think about the constraints on the c_s's.\n\nEach c_s must be between 0 and k. Additionally, for each s, the maximum possible size is determined by the constraints imposed by the c_s's.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is the sum for each s of the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix, but that's not quite right. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of the minimum c_s along each path from the root to a leaf, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to model the problem in terms of a tree where each node s has a value d(s), which is the maximum number of times the node s and its descendants can appear in the multiset. Then, the maximum size is the sum of d(s) for all s, but each d(s) is the minimum of c_s and the product of (1 + ...) along the path from the root to s.\n\nWait, perhaps that's a way to model it.\n\nEach node s has a certain weight w(s), which is the number of possible strings that can be in the multiset due to s. For s, w(s) is the product of (c_{parent} + 1) for all ancestors of s, up to the root.\n\nWait, no. Maybe each node s contributes to the maximum size as the minimum c_t along the path from the root to s.\n\nBecause for a string t, the number of times it can appear is limited by the minimum c_s along the path from the root to t. Because for each ancestor s of t, the count of t contributes to s's count, which is constrained by c_s.\n\nSo for example, if the path is root -> a -> b -> t, then t can be in the multiset up to min(c_root, c_a, c_b, ...), but no, that's not right because each step adds to the count for all its ancestors.\n\nWait, no. For t, each time it is added to the multiset, it contributes 1 to each of its ancestors' counts. So for s being an ancestor of t, the count for s increases by the number of times t is in the multiset.\n\nTherefore, for s, the count is the number of times all t in its subtree are present in the multiset. So the maximum number of t's that can be added is constrained by all the c_s's along the path from the root to t.\n\nSo the maximum number of t's is the minimum of (c_s) for all s in the path from root to t.\n\nWait, no. Because each s in the path has a c_s, and adding t increases the count for each s. So the total count for s is the sum of all t's in its subtree that are added.\n\nBut the sum for each s must be ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using a tree DP approach, where for each node, we track the minimum possible contribution based on the constraints of its ancestors.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: Think of each node s as having a certain 'limit' which is the minimum of c_s and the limits of all its ancestors.\n\nWait, because when you add a string t, which is a descendant of s, it contributes to s's count. So the maximum number of t's you can add is limited by the minimum c_s along the path from root to t.\n\nSo for each node s, the maximum number of times any string in its subtree can be added is the minimum of c_s and the minimum c_{s'} for all s' on the path from root to s.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of times any string in the subtree of s can be added is the minimum c along the path from the root to s.\n\nBecause for s itself, the count is the number of times all descendants are added, which is constrained by c_s. Also, each ancestor of s has a c_{ancestor}, and adding a string in s's subtree contributes to all ancestors' counts.\n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of times a string t in s's subtree can be added is the minimum of c_s, c_{parent(s)}, ..., c_root.\n\nBecause for t, the count for each ancestor s'' of t is increased by the number of times t is added. So for each s'' in the path from root to t, the sum of t's added can't exceed c_{s''}. Therefore, the maximum number of t's that can be added is the minimum of c_{s''} for all s'' in the path.\n\nSo for each node s, the maximum possible number of times any string in its subtree can be added is min_{s'' in path(root, s)} c_{s''}.\n\nBut wait, that's not exactly correct. Because for s, the maximum number of times its subtree can be added is c_s. But for each ancestor s', the maximum number is also bounded by c_{s'}, which may be smaller than c_s.\n\nSo, for the entire tree, the maximum possible size is the sum of min_{s'' in path(root, s)} c_{s''} for each s.\n\nWait, but that's the sum of the minimum c's along the path for each node s. Because each s contributes min c's along its path, and that's how many times it can be added.\n\nWait, no, perhaps not. Because each addition of a string t (leaf node) contributes 1 to each of its ancestors. So the sum of all min c's along the paths is not the way to model it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum of the min c's along the path for each node s.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's take an example.\n\nIn the sample input, n=1. So the trie has two leaves: \"0\" and \"1\".\n\nFor the first case, c_0=0, c_1=2.\n\nThe maximum size is 2, achieved by adding two \"1\"s.\n\nIn this case, for s=\"0\", the min c along its path (which is just itself) is 0. So it contributes 0 to the sum.\n\nFor s=\"1\", the min c along its path is min(c_1) = 2. So it contributes 2 to the sum.\n\nTotal sum is 0 + 2 = 2, which matches the maximum size.\n\nAnother example: c_0=1, c_1=1.\n\nEach contributes 1, sum is 2.\n\nThird case: c_0=2, c_1=0.\n\ns=\"0\" contributes 2, s=\"1\" contributes 0. Sum is 2+0=2.\n\nSo yes, the maximum size is the sum of the min c's along the path for each node s.\n\nThat seems promising.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of assignments of c_s's (each between 0 and k) such that the sum of min c's along the path for each node s is exactly f.\n\nWait, but wait—what about the root? Because in the problem statement, the root isn't considered as a string of length 1. So the sum is only over the nodes of length 1 to n.\n\nWait, no. The sum is over all nodes s, regardless of their length (as long as they are present in the trie of binary strings of length 1 to n). So for the root, which is the empty string, it's not considered. But for s of length 1, their path includes the root.\n\nWait, no. Because the root is the empty string. So for each s of length m >=1, the path from root to s includes m edges, ending at s.\n\nSo the sum is over all s in the trie (excluding the root) of the min c's along their path.\n\nSo the maximum size is the sum of min c's along the path for each s.\n\nSo, our problem is now to compute the number of assignments of c_s's (for all s of length 1..n) where each c_s is in [0, k], such that the sum of min c's along the path for each s is exactly f.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, when c_0=0, c_1=2, the sum is 0 (from \"0\") + 2 (from \"1\") = 2.\n\nWhich equals f=2.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of c assignments where sum_{s} (min_{t in path(root, s)} c_t) ) = f.\n\nNow, the question is, how to model this sum and count the assignments.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 15, the number of nodes in the trie is 2^15 = 32768, which is manageable.\n\nBut for each node s, we need to calculate the min c_t along the path from root to s.\n\nSo the sum is over all s (nodes of length >=1) of min_c_path(s).\n\nWe need to find the number of assignments of c_s (each from 0 to k) such that this sum is exactly f.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the trie.\n\nEach node s can be represented by its binary string. For each node s, its path is determined by its parent. The min c along the path is the minimum of c_s and all ancestors.\n\nSo, for each node s, let m(s) be the min c along the path from root to s.\n\nSo, the sum is sum_{s} m(s).\n\nWe need to find the number of assignments where this sum equals f.\n\nNow, the key observation is that the m(s) for each node s depends only on the c values along its path.\n\nThus, the problem can be broken down into considering each node's m(s) as the minimum of its path.\n\nBut how can we model the sum of these m(s)'s over all s?\n\nAnother idea: For each node s, the m(s) can be thought of as the minimum c along its path. So, for each node s, m(s) is the smallest c among all the nodes on the path from root to s.\n\nSo, the sum is the sum of the minimal c along each path.\n\nBut the minimal c is determined by the path.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent each node s as having a certain level, and for each level, we can precompute the possible contributions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem with a bitmask representing the path taken.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear way forward.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the sum.\n\nEach node s contributes m(s) to the sum, where m(s) is the minimum c_t along the path from root to s.\n\nSo, for the sum to be f, the sum of all m(s) must equal f.\n\nEach m(s) is the minimum of c_s and all its ancestors.\n\nNow, the c_s's are variables that can be chosen between 0 and k.\n\nThe problem is to count the number of c assignments where the sum of m(s) across all s is exactly f.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother idea: For each node s, the m(s) can be any integer between 0 and the minimum of c_t along the path. But since m(s) is determined by the c's, perhaps we can model the problem as a series of constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node s, the m(s) can be any value between 0 and the c_s, but also must be less than or equal to the c_t of all ancestors.\n\nWait, no. Because m(s) is the minimum of the c's along the path, so for s, m(s) = min(c_root, c_a, ..., c_s), where a is the parent of s.\n\nSo, for s, m(s) is the minimum of the c's along its path.\n\nThus, for the sum to be f, we have sum_{s} m(s) = f.\n\nEach m(s) is a non-negative integer, and for each s, m(s) ≤ c_s.\n\nAlso, for each s, m(s) ≤ m(parent(s)), because the path to s's parent is a subset of the path to s.\n\nWait, no. Because the path to s's parent is shorter than the path to s. So for example, the parent of s is at a higher level than s. So the min c along the parent's path could be larger than the min along s's path.\n\nWait, no. Let's say s is a child of p. Then, the path to s includes p's path plus s itself. So the min c along s's path is the minimum between p's min c and c_s.\n\nSo, m(s) = min(m(p), c_s).\n\nBecause m(p) is the min c along the path to p, and then c_s is the next step.\n\nSo, m(s) = min(m(p), c_s).\n\nAh! That's a crucial observation.\n\nSo, for each node s, m(s) is the minimum between m(p) and c_s, where p is the parent of s.\n\nThis recursive relationship can be used to model the problem.\n\nSo, the sum of m(s) over all s is the sum of these minima.\n\nNow, the problem is to assign c_s's such that sum_{s} m(s) = f, where m(s) is defined as min(m(p), c_s).\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems that the m(s)'s are determined by the c_s's and their parent m's.\n\nThis suggests a dynamic programming approach where we process the trie in a BFS manner, keeping track of the current sum and the constraints on the c_s's.\n\nBut even with n=15, the number of nodes is 32768, which is manageable, but the sum can be up to 2e5 * 32768, which is way too large for standard DP approaches.\n\nSo, perhaps another angle: for each node s, the m(s) can be any integer from 0 up to the minimum of the c's along the path.\n\nBut given that m(s) is determined by the c's, perhaps we can model the problem as a tree where each node s has a certain m(s), and the sum of all m(s) must be f.\n\nMoreover, for each s, m(s) must be ≤ c_s, and m(s) must be ≥ m(p) (since m(s) is the min of m(p) and c_s, which could be m(p) or c_s, but in either case, m(s) is ≤ m(p)).\n\nWait, no. Because m(p) is the min c along the path to p. When you add s, m(s) is min(m(p), c_s). So m(s) could be m(p) or c_s, whichever is smaller.\n\nThus, m(s) ≤ m(p) is possible, but only if c_s ≤ m(p). Otherwise, m(s) = m(p).\n\nSo, the m(s) can be either m(p) or c_s, but it can't be larger than m(p).\n\nSo, for each node s, m(s) can be any integer between 0 and the minimum of c_s and m(p).\n\nBut this is still tricky to model.\n\nPerhaps we can model the problem with a DP that tracks for each node s, the possible m(s) values and the accumulated sum up to that node.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, and the number of nodes is 2^15=32768, this might be manageable.\n\nLet me outline the approach.\n\nWe can perform a BFS traversal of the trie, starting from the root, and for each node, keep track of the possible m(s) and the sum accumulated so far.\n\nFor each node s, during the traversal, we consider all possible m(s) values, which must satisfy m(s) ≤ min(m(parent(s)), c_s).\n\nAdditionally, since the sum of all m(s) must be f, we can accumulate the sum as we traverse.\n\nBut even with this, the state space could be too large because f can be up to 2e5 and the number of nodes is 3e4, leading to a state space of 3e4 * 2e5, which is 6e9, which is way too big.\n\nSo, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Since each node s contributes m(s) to the sum, which is the min of m(parent) and c_s, perhaps we can find for each node s the range of c_s values that, when combined with the constraints from the ancestors, result in a specific m(s) and contribute to the sum.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the problem by considering each node and determining the possible values of m(s) based on the m's of its ancestors and its c_s.\n\nBut again, with the sum needing to be exactly f, it's unclear.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of the root.\n\nThe root has no m() (since it's not a string of length >=1), but all other nodes have m(s) = min(m(parent), c_s).\n\nSo, for the leaves (strings of length n), their m(s) is the minimum of all c_t along their path.\n\nSo, perhaps the sum is dominated by the leaves, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Perhaps the sum can be represented as the sum over all nodes s of m(s), where m(s) is determined by the c's along the path.\n\nSo, for each node s, m(s) can be written as m(s) = min{ c_root, c_a, ..., c_p, c_s }, where p is the parent of s.\n\nWait, no. Because m(s) is the min of the m of the parent and the c_s. So it's a recursive definition.\n\nSo, for example, m(s) = min( m(p), c_s ), where p is the parent of s.\n\nAnd m(p) = min( m(gp), c_p ), and so on, until the root.\n\nSo, the m(s) for a node s is the minimum c along the path from the root to s, but with the twist that it's computed as the minimum of the parent's m and the current c_s.\n\nThis seems similar to a kind of prefix minimum.\n\nThus, the m(s) is the minimum of all c_t along the path from root to s.\n\nWait, no. Because m(p) is the min of the c's along the path to p, and then m(s) is min(m(p), c_s). So overall, m(s) is the minimum of all c_t along the path from root to s.\n\nYes! Because m(s) is the minimum of m(p) (which is the min up to p) and c_s. So for the entire path, it's the minimum of all c_t along the path.\n\nSo, for each node s, m(s) is the minimum c_t along its path.\n\nSo, the sum is sum_{s} min_{t in path(s)} c_t.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to choosing c_s's (each in 0..k) such that the sum of min c_t along each path is exactly f.\n\nThis is a crucial insight.\n\nSo, the problem is now: count the number of assignments of c_s's (each 0 ≤ c_s ≤k) such that the sum over all s (each s is a binary string of length 1..n) of the minimum c_t along the path from root to s is equal to f.\n\nNow, how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the trie as a set of nodes, each with a path from the root. Each node s has a path consisting of a sequence of nodes starting at the root.\n\nFor each node s, the contribution to the sum is the minimum c_t along this path.\n\nSo, for the sum to be f, the sum of these minima across all nodes s must equal f.\n\nBut how can we model this sum?\n\nAn alternative approach is to realize that each node s contributes m(s), which is the minimum of c_t along its path. So, for the entire trie, the sum is the sum of all these minima.\n\nWe can model the problem by considering each node s and determining the possible m(s) values, given the constraints of its ancestors and the c_s.\n\nBut again, with the sum needing to be exactly f, it's challenging.\n\nAnother idea is to note that for a node s, the m(s) can be any integer from 0 to the minimum of the c_t's along its path.\n\nBut how can we model this across the entire trie?\n\nPerhaps we can model this using a generating function approach. For each node s, we can represent the possible contributions to the sum based on the possible m(s) values, considering the constraints from the ancestors.\n\nBut the problem is that the choice of m(s) affects the choices for the descendants.\n\nSo, perhaps we can perform a dynamic programming approach where for each node, we track the possible accumulated sum and the minimum c along the path so far.\n\nBut with n=15, the number of nodes is 32768, and the sum can be up to 2e5*32768, which is way too big.\n\nSo, perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nWait, let's think about the contribution of each node.\n\nEach node s contributes m(s) = min(c_t along path). So, for the sum to be f, the sum of all these minima must equal f.\n\nWe can model this as a problem where each node s has a variable m(s) that is the minimum of the c_t along its path, and we need the sum of m(s) over all s to be f.\n\nBut how to count the number of assignments of c_s's that satisfy this.\n\nAnother angle: For each node s, the m(s) must be ≤ all c_t along its path. So, for the entire path of s, all c_t's must be ≥ m(s).\n\nThus, for the entire tree, the c_t's must be such that for each node s, c_t ≥ m(s) for all t along the path from root to s.\n\nAdditionally, for each s, m(s) is the minimum of the c_t's along its path.\n\nSo, the problem is to choose for each node s a m(s) (a value between 0 and k), such that:\n\n1. For each node s, m(s) is the minimum of the c_t along its path.\n2. For each node s, m(s) ≤ c_s.\n3. For each node s, m(s) ≤ m(p), where p is the parent of s.\n4. sum(m(s) for all s) = f.\n\nWait, but condition 3 comes from the fact that m(p) is the min of c's along p's path, which is a subset of s's path. So, m(s) is min(m(p), c_s) ≤ m(p).\n\nSo, m(s) ≤ m(p) for all s.\n\nSo, the m's form a non-increasing function along the tree.\n\nThus, the m's must satisfy m(s) ≤ m(p) for all s.\n\nSo, the problem can be rephrased as:\n\nFind the number of assignments of c_s's (each 0 ≤ c_s ≤k) such that:\n\n- For each node s, m(s) is the minimum of c_t along the path from root to s.\n- sum(m(s) for all s) = f.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps, for each node s, the m(s) can be any value between 0 and the minimum of the c_t along its path, which is constrained by the m(p) of its parent.\n\nSo, for the root, which has no m, but for each node s, m(s) is determined",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose integers \\( c_s \\) for each binary string \\( s \\) of length from 1 to \\( n \\) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\).

A beautiful multiset is defined such that for each binary string \\( s \\), the number of strings in the multiset that have \\( s \\) as a prefix does not exceed \\( c_s \\).\n   - The goal is to count the number of ways to assign \\( c_s \\) values such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly \\( f \\).\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - Each node \\( s \\) in the trie (binary tree structure) contributes to the sum based on the minimum value of \\( c_t \\) along the path from the root to \\( s \\).\n   - The sum of these minimum values across all nodes must equal \\( f \\).\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:\n   -

Build the trie structure to represent all possible binary strings up to length \\( n \\).\n   - Use memoization to track the number of ways to achieve each possible sum of minimum values as we traverse the trie.\n   -
