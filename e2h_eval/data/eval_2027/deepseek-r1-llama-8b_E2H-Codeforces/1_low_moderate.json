    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side is reduced by 2 (since each ring is 1 cell wide). So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. For each ring, the size decreases by 2 on each side, so total reduction per dimension is 4 (2 on each end). So yes, for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and the height is h -4*(i-1). But this makes sense only if that's possible; otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nNow, each ring contributes some number of cells. How do we calculate the number of cells in each ring?\n\nHmm. For the first ring, the plate is w x h. The perimeter would be the sum of all the outer cells. But wait, for a rectangle, the perimeter in terms of cells is 2*(w + h - 2). Because each row has h cells, but the first and last are counted once each for each row, except the corners which are counted twice. Wait no, perhaps a better way is to calculate the perimeter as 2*(width + height) - 4. Because for a rectangle, the perimeter in cells is the sum of all four sides minus the 4 corners which are counted twice. So 2*(w + h) - 4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. For example, a 3x3 square has a perimeter of 8: 2*(3+3) -4 = 8.\n\nSo for each ring, the perimeter is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4. But wait, that's only true for the first ring. What about the inner rings? Do they follow the same formula?\n\nWait, let's see. Take the second ring. It's the next border inside. Its dimensions are (w-4, h-4). So the perimeter would be 2*(w-4 + h-4) -4. So yes, same formula applies.\n\nSo for each ring i, the current_w is w -4*(i-1), current_h is h-4*(i-1). Then the cells added by this ring are 2*(current_w + current_h) -4. But wait, that can't be right because when the current_w or current_h becomes too small, perhaps less than 3, then the ring isn't possible.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that k is at most floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). So for each ring up to k, the current_w and current_h will be at least 3 -4*(k-1). Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the maximum possible i is determined by how many rings can fit. The condition is that the current_w and current_h must be at least 3. Because each ring requires that there's a valid border.\n\nWait, the first ring is when i=1: current_w = w, current_h=h. So that's fine as long as w and h are >=3.\n\nFor i=2: current_w = w-4, current_h = h-4. So for these to be >=3, we need w >=7 and h >=7. Wait, because 3-4= -1, which is invalid. So for i=2 to exist, w and h must be at least 7.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it doesn't go beyond what's possible. So for the given k, the i-th rings will always have valid current_w and current_h.\n\nSo, back to the problem. For each ring from 1 to k, compute 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) * 1? Wait, no. Wait, for each ring, it's a single layer border. So the perimeter is 2*(w_ring + h_ring) -4, where w_ring and h_ring are the width and height of that ring.\n\nYes, because each ring is one cell thick. So for the i-th ring:\n\ncells_i = 2 * ( (w -4*(i-1) ) + (h -4*(i-1)) ) -4",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one, and each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells (2 cells from each side).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Rings**: Each ring forms a border around a smaller rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on.\n2. **Calculate Cells for Each Ring**: For each ring `i`, the dimensions of the rectangle are `(w - 4*(i-1)) x (h - 4*(i-1))`. The number of cells in each ring is given by the perimeter formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n3. **Sum Cells for All Rings**: Sum the number of cells contributed by each of the `k` rings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers `w`, `h`, and `k`.\n2. **Loop Through Each Ring**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the current width and height of the rectangle.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, compute the perimeter of the current rectangle and add it to the total count of gilded cells.\n4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all `k` rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their contributions, ensuring an optimal solution.",
