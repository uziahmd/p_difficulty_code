He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it's a prefix or suffix of the original string s. Each string is either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S), and I need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's in the order of the input.\n\nHmm, the input has 2n-2 strings, each of which is either a prefix or a suffix of length 1 to n-1. The goal is to assign each one as P or S correctly.\n\nWait, but how? Because some prefixes might overlap with suffixes, right? So I need to find a way to determine which are prefixes and which are suffixes based on their possible positions in the original string.\n\nLet me think about the structure. For each possible candidate string s, all the prefixes and suffixes must fit into it. But since I don't know s, I have to find a way to group the given strings into prefixes and suffixes such that for some s, all the prefixes are the ones marked as P and suffixes as S.\n\nWait, but the problem says that there exists at least one string s that satisfies all the given prefixes and suffixes. So my task is to find any possible assignment of P and S that corresponds to some s.\n\nHow can I approach this?\n\nI remember that in such problems, the key is to build the string step by step. Maybe the idea is to find the longest possible prefix and then see what the suffixes must be.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is to find all possible candidates for the entire string s. But that might be computationally expensive, but since n is up to 100, maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find the correct assignment by considering the structure of the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nLet me think: the prefixes are the strings of lengths 1 to n-1 that are prefixes of s. Similarly, the suffixes are the strings of lengths 1 to n-1 that are suffixes of s.\n\nSo for each possible s_candidate, I can check if all the given prefixes and suffixes match the corresponding lengths.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the given 2n-2 strings include both prefixes and suffixes, but I don't know which is which. So the approach is to assign each string as either prefix or suffix, ensuring that for some s, all the assigned prefixes are indeed prefixes of s, and the assigned suffixes are indeed suffixes.\n\nBut how do I model this? It seems like a graph problem where I need to assign each string to P or S, but I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps for each possible position in the string, I can determine the possible characters, building the string from left to right and right to left.\n\nWait, maybe the following steps:\n\n1. For each possible string s_candidate of length n, check whether all the given strings can be partitioned into prefixes and suffixes that match s_candidate. But this is O(26^100), which is impossible.\n\nNo, that won't work.\n\nAlternative idea: the prefixes must form a chain. For example, the prefix of length k must be a prefix of the prefix of length k+1. Similarly, the suffixes must form a chain where the suffix of length k is a suffix of the suffix of length k+1.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily true. Because the suffixes are of different lengths, but they may not form a chain. Wait, for example, in the string \"ababa\", the suffix of length 1 is 'a', length 2 is 'ba', length 3 is 'aba', etc. Each longer suffix starts with the previous one. So the suffixes form a chain where each longer suffix starts with the shorter one.\n\nSimilarly for the prefixes.\n\nSo, perhaps the prefixes form a chain, and the suffixes form another chain. So for the prefixes, the string of length k is a prefix of the string of length k+1. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, Ivan gives all the prefixes and suffixes, but not in any order. So perhaps the first step is to group the given strings into two groups: those that are prefixes and those that are suffixes.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe for each possible pair of a prefix and suffix of the same length, we can see if they can form a longer string when combined.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to find the correct s by combining the possible maximum-length prefix and the maximum-length suffix.\n\nBecause the maximum-length prefix must be a substring of s, and similarly for the maximum-length suffix. So the correct s would be the concatenation of the maximum prefix and the maximum suffix, but only if the prefix's last character matches the suffix's first character.\n\nYes! That makes sense. So the process is:\n\n1. Find all possible maximum-length prefixes",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether each of the given strings is a prefix or a suffix of the original string. The solution involves identifying the correct structure of the original string by analyzing the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: \n   - The longest prefix (of length n-1) must be a prefix of the original string, and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be a suffix.\n   - These two strings can help us construct the original string by checking if they overlap correctly.\n\n2. **Construct the Original String**:\n   - Using the longest prefix and suffix, we can build the original string by checking if the last character of the prefix matches the first character of the suffix.\n\n3. **Check Validity**:\n   - Once the original string is constructed, verify that all given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of this string.\n\n4. **Assign Prefix/Suffix Tags**:\n   - For each string, determine if it is a prefix or suffix based on the constructed original string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nprefixes = []\nsuffixes = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    # We will assign later, but collect all\n    pass\n\n# Now find the maximum possible prefix and suffix\nmax_prefix_length = n - 1\nmax_suffix_length = n - 1\n\ncandidates = []\n# Find all possible candidates for the maximum prefix\nmax_p = None\nfor s in prefixes:\n    if len(s) == max_prefix_length:\n        max_p = s\nif max_p is None:\n    # This shouldn't happen as per the problem statement\n    pass\n\n# Similarly for suffix\nmax_s = None\nfor s in suffixes:\n    if len(s) == max_suffix_length:\n        max_s = s\nif max_s is None:\n    pass\n\n# Try to build the string\n# The original string should start with max_p and end with max_s\n# Check if the last character of max_p matches the first of max_s\nif max_p[-1] == max_s[0]:\n    s_candidate = max_p + max_s\nelse:\n    # Not possible, but according to problem statement it's guaranteed\n    pass\n\n# Now, check which are prefixes and which are suffixes\nresult = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\nfor i, s in enumerate(prefixes + suffixes):\n    if s in prefixes:\n        result[i] = 'P' if s == max_p else 'P'\n    else:\n        result[i] = 'S' if s == max_s else 'S'\n\n# Wait, no, because some prefixes may not be the maximum one. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the above approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for all possible prefixes and suffixes. It only considers the maximum ones, but other prefixes and suffixes might not fit correctly.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the correct assignment is such that the prefixes form a chain where each prefix of length k is a prefix of the next longer prefix, and similarly for the suffixes. Then, the original string can be built by combining the longest prefix and suffix, ensuring they overlap correctly.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to iterate through each possible pair of maximum-length prefix and suffix, check if they can form the original string, then use that string to mark all other strings as P or S accordingly.\n\nSo let's try this:\n\n1. Identify all possible maximum-length prefixes and suffixes.\n2. For each pair (max_p, max_s), check if the last character of max_p matches the first character of max_s.\n3. If they match, construct the original string as max_p + max_s.\n4. For each string in the input, determine if it is a prefix or suffix of this constructed string.\n5. Assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nThis should give a valid assignment.\n\nNow, let's implement this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, read all the input strings and separate them into a list.\n\nThen, find the maximum-length prefix and suffix from the given strings.\n\nFor each possible combination of max_p and max_s, check if they can form the original string.\n\nOnce the original string is determined, iterate through all the given strings and classify each as 'P' or 'S'.\n\nFinally, output the classification.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\n# Find all possible maximum-length prefix and suffix\nmax_p_candidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\nmax_s_candidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\n# For each possible pair of max_p and max_s, check if they can form the string\nfor max_p in max_p_candidates:\n    for max_s in max_s_candidates:\n        if max_p[-1] != max_s[0]:\n            continue  # No overlap, skip\n        s_candidate = max_p + max_s\n        # Now, check if all other strings are either prefixes or suffixes\n        valid = True\n        for s in strings:\n            if s in max_p_candidates and s != max_p:\n                # Check if s is a prefix of s_candidate\n                if not s_candidate.startswith(s):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            elif s in max_s_candidates and s != max_s:\n                # Check if s is a suffix of s_candidate\n                if not s_candidate.endswith(s):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            else:\n                # Determine if it's a prefix or suffix\n                if s_candidate.startswith(s):\n                    # It's a prefix\n                    # But ensure it's not already accounted for\n                    if s not in max_p_candidates:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                else:\n                    if s not in max_s_candidates:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n        if valid:\n            # Assign the results\n            result = []\n            for s in strings:\n                if s in max_p_candidates:\n                    result.append('P')\n                else:\n                    result.append('S')\n            print(''.join(result))\n            exit()\n\n# If none found (though problem says there is at least one)\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\nWait, but the code above has a flaw. Because when checking if a string is a prefix or suffix, it's not just about being a prefix or suffix of the candidate, but also that all other strings are properly categorized.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the correct s_candidate, then for each string in the input, determine if it is a prefix of s_candidate or a suffix of s_candidate. If it's neither, then it's invalid.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the given strings are guaranteed to be prefixes and suffixes of some string, so we don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible max_p and max_s.\n2. For each pair, construct s_candidate.\n3. Check if all other strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n4. Once a valid s_candidate is found, classify each string as 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nIn code, this would involve nested loops for max_p and max_s, checking each possible pair.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, iterate through all strings and classify them.\n\n### Final Code\nThe final code reads all the input strings, identifies the maximum-length prefix and suffix candidates, constructs possible original strings by combining each pair, and checks if all other strings are either prefixes or suffixes of the constructed string. Once a valid original string is found, it classifies each input string as 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = []\nfor _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n    s = input().strip()\n    strings.append(s)\n\n# Find all possible maximum-length prefix and suffix\nmax_p_candidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\nmax_s_candidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\n# Iterate through all possible pairs of max_p and max_s\nfor max_p in max_p_candidates:\n    for max_s in max_s_candidates:\n        if max_p[-1] != max_s[0]:\n            continue  # No overlap, cannot form s_candidate\n        s_candidate = max_p + max_s\n        # Now, check if all other strings are either prefixes or suffixes\n        valid = True\n        for s in strings:\n            is_prefix = False\n            is_suffix = False\n            # Check if s is a prefix of s_candidate\n            if len(s) <= len(s_candidate) and s_candidate.startswith(s):\n                is_prefix = True\n            # Check if s is a suffix of s_candidate\n            if len(s) <= len(s_candidate) and s_candidate.endswith(s):\n                is_suffix = True\n            if not (is_prefix or is_suffix):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            # Now, assign P or S to each string\n            result = []\n            for s in strings:\n                if len(s) < len(s_candidate) and s_candidate.startswith(s):\n                    result.append('P')\n                else:\n                    result.append('S')\n            print(''.join(result))\n            exit()\n\n# If none found (though problem says it's guaranteed)\nprint(''.join(result))\n```\n\nThis code ensures that for each possible pair of maximum-length prefix and suffix, it constructs the original string and verifies that all given strings fit as either prefixes or suffixes.
