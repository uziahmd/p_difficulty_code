Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing certain adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. So for example, \"01\" can become \"10\", and \"12\" can become \"21\". But you can't swap '0' and '2' directly or via other steps because that would require moving through a '1'.\n\nHmm, the goal is to find the minimum possible string after any number of such swaps. Since the swaps can be done any number of times, I need to figure out how the characters can be rearranged within certain constraints.\n\nLet me think about what these swaps imply. It seems like '0's and '1's can be reordered among themselves as if they were in their own group, but '2's can only move past them via '1's. Wait, no. Because a '2' can swap with a '1', which allows it to move through the string. Similarly, a '0' can't directly swap with a '2', but since '1's can move around, perhaps the '2's can't directly affect the '0's unless there's a '1' in between.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem as having two separate groups: the '0's can only be swapped with '1's, and the '1's can be swapped with both '0's and '2's. So '2's can move through '1's, but '0's can't move past '1's. Or wait, no—because '0's can't swap with '2's directly, but perhaps if there's a '1' next to a '0', the '0' can move past it, right? Like, if we have \"0 1 2\", the '0' can swap with '1' to get \"1 0 2\", then '0' can't do anything else because it's next to '2' which it can't swap with. So '0' is stuck behind '2's.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is that '0's can only appear before '1's and '2's, but once a '0' is followed by a '2', it's stuck. Similarly, '2's can appear anywhere relative to '1's because they can swap with each other through the '1's.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way to think about it is:\n\n- '0's can be moved to the left past '1's, but cannot be moved past '2's.\n- '2's can be moved to the left past '1's, but not '0's.\n- So the order of '0's relative to each other doesn't change because they can't swap with each other. Same for '2's—they can't swap with each other, so their relative order is fixed.\n\nWait, no. Oh wait, no! Because '0's can't swap with each other because the allowed swaps are only between 0 and 1, or 1 and 2. So any '0's in the string cannot be swapped with each other; their relative order must remain as per the original string. Similarly, '2's cannot be swapped with each other either. Only '0's and '1's can be reordered, but not '0's and '2's directly.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, for the entire string, the '0's must appear in the same order as in the original string, but their positions can be adjusted by swapping with '1's. Similarly, '2's must also appear in the same order as the original string, but their positions can be adjusted by swapping with '1's. '1's can be moved around as much as needed.\n\nSo the approach is to find all the '0's, '1's, and '2's in their original order, and arrange them in a way that the overall string is lex smallest possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nI think the way to proceed is as follows:\n\n1. For each character in the string, determine which group it belongs to: 0-group, 1-group, or 2-group. The 0-group consists of '0's in their original order, the 1-group consists of '1's in their original order, and the 2-group consists of '2's in their original order.\n\n2. Then, when building the new string, the idea is to place the 0-group first, followed by the 1-group, followed by the 2-group. Because placing 0s first makes the string lex smaller.\n\nWait, but why can't we interleave the 0-group and 1-group in a way that produces a lex smaller string?\n\nBecause 0 is lex smaller than 1, so having 0s as early as possible is better.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string by performing adjacent swaps between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key insight is that '0's can only be reordered among themselves and with '1's, while '2's can only be reordered among themselves and with '1's. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Groups**: Separate the characters into three groups: '0's, '1's, and '2's, each maintaining their original order.\n2. **Construct Result**: The smallest lexicographical string is formed by concatenating the '0's group, followed by the '1's group, and then the '2's group. This ensures that all '0's come first, followed by '1's, and then '2's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Separate the characters into their respective groups\nzeros = []\nones = []\ntwos = []\n\nfor c in s:\n    if c == '0':\n        zeros.append(c)\n    elif c == '1':\n        ones.append(c)\n    else:\n        twos.append(c)\n\n# Concatenate the groups in the order 0's, 1's, 2's\nresult = ''.join(zeros + ones + twos)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\nThe solution works by first separating the input string into three lists: one for '0's, one for '1's, and one for '2's. Each list maintains the original order of the characters. Then, these lists are concatenated in the order of '0's, followed by '1's, and then '2's. This ensures the resulting string is the smallest possible lexicographically because '0's come before '1's and '2's, and within each group, the order remains unchanged as per the original string.",
