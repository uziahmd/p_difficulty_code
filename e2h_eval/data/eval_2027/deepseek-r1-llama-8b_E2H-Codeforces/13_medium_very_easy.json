For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are given as strings separated by spaces, and they can be in any order. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a major and minor triad. From the description:\n\n- A major triad has a specific order where the first two notes are 4 semitones apart, and the next two (including the first) are 3 semitones apart. So, for example, C E G: C to E is 4, E to G is 3. So the total from C to G is 7 semitones.\n- A minor triad is the opposite: the first two are 3 semitones apart, and the next two are 4. Like, C# B F would be ordered as B C# F. B to C# is 3 semitones, then C# to F is 4.\n\nSo the approach is to take the three notes, generate all possible permutations of them, and check each permutation to see if it fits either the major or minor pattern.\n\nWait, but since the chord is unordered, we need to consider all possible orderings of the three notes. For each permutation, we can compute the distances between consecutive notes and see if they match the major or minor condition.\n\nBut wait, how do we represent the notes numerically? Because the distance calculation depends on their order in the scale.\n\nHmm. Let's think about assigning each note an index in the 12-note scale. That way, we can calculate the semitone distances easily.\n\nThe notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait—wait, the initial list says H instead of B? Or did I misread that?\n\nWait, the problem statement says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right, so after B comes H, not C again? No, wait, no—the problem says it's cyclic. So the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, and then back to C. So H is followed by C.\n\nWait, wait—no, I think I might have made a mistake. Wait, the problem says \"the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again\". So the sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C, etc. So H is before C.\n\nSo the list of notes is in the order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's 12 notes.\n\nSo I'll create a list mapping each note to its position. Like, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, 'D' is 2, ..., 'H' is 11. Then, when given a note, I can look up its index.\n\nOnce I have the indices for the three notes, I can compute all possible orderings and check the distances.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to map each note string to its index. Like {'C':0, 'C#':1, ...}.\n2. Read the input as a list of three strings.\n3. For each permutation of these three notes:\n   a. Convert each note to its index.\n   b. Compute the distances between consecutive notes.\n   c. Check if the distances form a major or minor triad.\n4. If any permutation satisfies the major condition, output 'major'.\n5. If any permutation satisfies the minor condition, output 'minor'.\n6. Else, output 'strange'.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So no need to worry about cases where a chord could be both major and minor, which according to the problem statement won't happen.\n\nSo now, let's think about how to handle the permutation.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z), we calculate the distance between x and y, and between y and z.\n\nBut wait, the distance is measured as the number of semitones from lower to higher. So for any two notes a and b, the distance is (b_index - a_index) mod 12. But wait, no: because the scale is circular, but the distance is calculated in the direction from the lower note to the higher one. So the distance from a to b is (b - a) if b >=a, else (b + 12 - a). Wait, no—because the scale is cyclic, but when measuring distance, you go forward. So for example, from H (11) to C (0), the distance is 1 semitone (since H is followed by C).\n\nWait, wait. The problem statement says: \"the distance between X and Y should be 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones.\" So the distance is always measured forward, meaning that the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but only in the positive direction.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the distance as (y - x) if y >= x, else (y + 12 - x). Because, for example, from C (0) to E (4) is 4 semitones. From E to C: since moving forward, it's 8 semitones (E -> F, F->F#, etc., up to H, then C is 8 steps ahead). Wait, but according to the problem statement, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones because E to C is a lower to higher distance.\n\nWait no, wait the problem says: the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to the upper. So for any two distinct notes, the distance is computed as (Y - X) % 12. Because if Y is higher than X, it's straightforward. If Y is lower, then we add 12 to get the positive distance.\n\nWait, no. For example, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Because E is at index 4, C is at 0. So (0 -4) is -4, but modulo 12 is 8. So yes, the distance is (y - x) mod 12.\n\nSo for any two notes a and b, the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod 12.\n\nSo in code, for a given triplet (x, y, z), their indices are x_idx, y_idx, z_idx.\n\nWe need to check for all possible orderings of the three notes. For each ordering, compute d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) mod 12, d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) mod 12. Then, check if (d1 ==4 and d2 ==3) for major, or (d1 ==3 and d2 ==4) for minor.\n\nSo for all permutations of the three notes, compute these distances and see if any fit.\n\nBut wait, since the chord is unordered, any permutation could potentially be the correct ordering. So for each permutation, regardless of how the notes are arranged, we need to check if the distances meet the criteria.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\n2. Read the input as a list of three strings.\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes.\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nperms = permutations(input_notes)\n\n4. For each permutation in perms:\n\nfor perm in perms:\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n   y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n   z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n   d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       print(\"major\")\n\n       exit()\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print(\"minor\")\n\n       exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none satisfy, print 'strange'.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\n- Import necessary modules (permutations, sys for input).\n\nWait, but for the problem statement, the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. So in code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\nif len(input_notes) !=3:\n    # According to problem statement, this won't happen\n    pass\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but wait—what about the same note appearing multiple times? According to the problem statement, the chord is a set of exactly three notes. So presumably, duplicates are allowed? Or does the problem consider them as a single note?\n\nWait, the problem says, \"unordered set of no less than three notes.\" Wait, no, the problem says \"no less than three\", but the examples have exactly three. So the input will always be exactly three notes, possibly with duplicates.\n\nWait, but if two notes are the same, then the distance between them is zero. So in that case, for a permutation where x and y are the same note, d1 would be zero, which can't be 3 or 4. So such chords would fall into the 'strange' category.\n\nSo our code handles that automatically.\n\nSo, testing with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is three space-separated notes. So in the sample input, it's three separate strings, like 'C', 'E', 'G' in the first case.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut wait, no. Looking back, the problem says the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. So the actual input is three note names, like 'C', 'E', 'G' as individual elements.\n\nSo in code, the input is read as split(), so each element is a single note.\n\nSo the sample input is:\n\nLine 1: 'C E G'\n\nWhich becomes input_notes = ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSimilarly, the second test case is 'C# B F' → ['C#', 'B', 'F'], etc.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nNotes C, E, G.\n\nCheck all permutations:\n\nOne of the permutations is (C, E, G).\n\nCompute d1: E - C =4 →4 mod12=4.\n\nd2: G - E=3 →3 mod12=3.\n\nSo d1=4, d2=3 → major. So the code prints 'major' and exits.\n\nSecond test case: C#, B, F.\n\nLooking for a permutation where d1=3, d2=4.\n\nLooking at permutation (B, C#, F):\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\nd1 = (1-10) mod12 → ( -9 ) mod12 = 3.\n\nd2 = (5-1) mod12 =4.\n\nYes, so d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nThird test case: A, B, H.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nWhat is the note order?\n\nA is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nIn some permutation, like A, B, H:\n\nd1 =1, d2=1. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B.\n\nH is 11, A is 9. (9-11) mod12 is 10? Wait, wait, no: (A - H) mod12 is (9 -11) = -2 mod12 is 10. But for d1, it's (y-x) mod12, which is (A - H) mod12 is (9-11) mod12 is 10.\n\nWhich is not 3 or4.\n\nWait, what about permutation B, H, A.\n\nB is 10, H is11, A is9.\n\nd1: (11-10)=1.\n\nd2: (9-11) mod12 is 10.\n\nNot matching.\n\nWait, another permutation: H, B, A.\n\nH is11, B is10, A is9.\n\nd1: (10-11) mod12 = 11.\n\nd2: (9-10) mod12 = 11.\n\nNope.\n\nWait, another permutation: A, H, B.\n\nA is9, H is11, B is10.\n\nd1: (11-9)=2.\n\nd2: (10-11) mod12=11.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H.\n\nB is10, A is9, H is11.\n\nd1: (9-10)= -1 mod12=11.\n\nd2: (11-9)=2.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the chord is A, B, H.\n\nIs there any permutation where the distances are 4 and 3, or 3 and4?\n\nWait, let's see all possible permutations.\n\nThere are 6 permutations.\n\nLet me list all six:\n\n1. A, B, H → d1=1, d2= (H - B) = (11-10)=1. So 1,1.\n\n2. A, H, B → d1= (11-9)=2, d2= (10-11)= -1 mod12=11.\n\n3. B, A, H → d1= (9-10)= -1 mod12=11, d2=(11-9)=2.\n\n4. B, H, A → d1=(11-10)=1, d2=(9-11) mod12=10.\n\n5. H, A, B → d1= (9-11) mod12=10, d2=(10-9)=1.\n\n6. H, B, A → d1= (10-11)= -1 mod12=11, d2=(9-10)= -1 mod12=11.\n\nNone of these have d1=4 and d2=3, or d1=3 and d2=4. So the output is 'strange', which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to correctly handle the sample inputs.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nWhat if all three notes are the same? Like C C C.\n\nThen, in any permutation, d1 and d2 are zero. So it's 'strange'.\n\nWhat about a triplet like C, C#, D.\n\nPermutation: C, C#, D.\n\nd1=1, d2=2. No.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, D, C.\n\nd1= (3-1)=2, d2= (0-3) mod12=9. No.\n\nAnother permutation: D, C, C#.\n\nd1=(0-2) mod12=10, d2=(1-0)=1. No.\n\nSo it's 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: E, G, C.\n\nE is 4, G is 6, C is0.\n\nIn permutation E, G, C.\n\nd1=2, d2= (0-6) mod12=6.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother permutation: G, C, E.\n\nd1= (0-6) mod12=6, d2= (4-0)=4.\n\nSo d1=6, d2=4.\n\nDoesn't match.\n\nWait, another permutation: E, C, G.\n\nE (4), C (0), G (6).\n\nd1= (0-4) mod12=8, which is 8 mod12=8. No.\n\nHmm, not matching.\n\nWait, what about C, E, G. That's the major.\n\nAnother test case: D, F, A.\n\nD is2, F is5, A is9.\n\nd1=3, d2=4. So yes, minor.\n\nWait, 5-2=3, 9-5=4. So d1=3, d2=4 → minor.\n\nSo the code should output 'minor' for D F A.\n\nWait, but wait, what about other permutations? For example, F, A, D.\n\nd1= (9-5)=4, d2= (2-9) mod12= (2+12-9)=5 →4,5. Doesn't fit.\n\nBut since any permutation is considered, the code will find the correct one.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nAnother edge case: notes wrap around. Like H, C, E.\n\nH is11, C is0, E is4.\n\nIn permutation H, C, E:\n\nd1= (0-11) mod12=1.\n\nd2= (4-0)=4.\n\nSo d1=1, d2=4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAnother permutation: C, H, E.\n\nd1= (11-0)=11 mod12=11 → no.\n\nWait, wait, no: (H - C) is 11-0=11, which is 11 semitones. So d1=11, which isn't 3 or4.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct permutation is E, C, H.\n\nE (4), C (0), H (11).\n\nd1= (0-4) mod12=8, d2= (11-0)=11.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, maybe this isn't a valid minor or major chord.\n\nSo the code will output 'strange' for H C E.\n\nWait, wait, but what about permutation E, C, H?\n\nd1= (0-4) mod12=8, d2= (11-0)=11.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that for a major triad, the distances are 4 and 3. So for the permutation to form a major, the first two must be 4 semitones apart, and the next two (after the first two) must be 3.\n\nSo, for E, C, H: E to C is 8, C to H is 11. So 8 and 11. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo H C E is a strange chord.\n\nAnother test case: G#, C, E.\n\nG# is 8, C is0, E is4.\n\nIn permutation G#, C, E:\n\nd1= (0-8) mod12=4.\n\nd2= (4-0)=4.\n\nSo d1=4, d2=4. Not fitting either.\n\nAnother permutation: C, E, G#.\n\nd1=4, d2= (8-4)=4. So 4 and4 → doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but what about E, G#, C.\n\nE is4, G# is8, C is0.\n\nd1=4, d2= (0-8)=4 mod12=4. So same as above.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the code should read the three notes, generate all permutations, compute the distances, and check for the conditions.\n\nI think this should solve the problem correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or neither. The notes are provided in any order, and the solution must efficiently classify the chord based on the defined criteria for major and minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Notes and Distances**: The notes are cyclically ordered as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Each note can be represented by its position in this sequence. The distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher note, considering the cyclic nature of the scale.\n\n2. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Create a mapping from each note to its respective index in the sequence. This allows us to convert note names into numerical values for easy distance calculation.\n\n3. **Check All Permutations**: Since the chord is unordered, we need to check all permutations of the given notes. For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes and check if they match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n4. **Determine Triad Type**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between the first and second notes, and between the second and third notes. If the distances are 4 and 3 semitones respectively, the triad is major. If the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively, the triad is minor.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Mapping each note to its index\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    \n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    \n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The notes are mapped to their respective indices using a dictionary. This helps in converting note names to numerical values for distance calculations.\n\n2. **Permutations**: Using permutations from the itertools module, we generate all possible orderings of the three notes. This ensures that we check every possible arrangement to find the correct triad type.\n\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n\n4. **Triad Check**: The distances are checked against the criteria for major and minor triads. If a permutation matches either criteria, the corresponding result is printed and the program exits. If no permutation matches, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the notes to accurately classify the chord, ensuring correctness and handling all edge cases.",
