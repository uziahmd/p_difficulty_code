    "thought": "Okay, so I've got this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting certain edge-weighted trees and calculating the sum of a specific value across all such trees. Hmm, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the definition of a \"good\" tree: It's an edge-weighted tree where each edge has weight 1 or -1. Additionally, for every vertex i, the product of the weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. So, each node has exactly an odd number of -1 edges attached to it.\n\nWait, because the product is -1. If a node has k edges, then the product is (-1)^k. So for the product to be -1, k must be odd. So each node must have an odd degree in terms of the count of -1 edges connected to it.\n\nBut wait, in a tree, each node's degree (number of edges) is at least 1 except for leaves. Wait, but that's the structure of the tree, not the weights. The weights are what determine the product.\n\nHmm, so for each node, the number of edges with weight -1 must be odd. So for any node, if we look at its adjacent edges, the count of -1s is odd.\n\nNow, the task is to find the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees. d(u,v) is the sum of the weights along the unique path from u to v. Since it's a tree, there's exactly one path between any two nodes.\n\nSo for each tree that is 'good', compute the sum of the path from node 1 to node n, considering all possible such trees, and add all these values together.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, perhaps it's easier to model the problem using some algebraic structure or combinatorial arguments.\n\nLet me consider the properties of a good tree. Each node has an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nWait, but in a tree, the number of edges is n-1. So for the entire tree, the sum over all nodes' counts of -1 edges would be equal to twice the number of -1 edges (since each edge contributes to two nodes). But since each node has an odd count, the sum would be the sum of n numbers, each odd. So the total sum is n mod 2.\n\nWait, because each node contributes an odd number of -1 edges. Summing n odd numbers: if n is even, the sum is even; if n is odd, the sum is odd.\n\nBut the total number of -1 edges is S. Then 2S = sum of degrees (each edge contributes 2 to S, once for each endpoint). So 2S must be equal to the sum of all degrees, which is n * (sum of (degrees of each node)/n). Wait, no, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, since each edge is either 1 or -1, each contributes 0 or 2 to the sum of the degrees (counting -1 as 1, 1 as 0). Wait, no. Because each node's count is the number of -1 edges incident to it. So each such edge contributes 1 to two nodes. So the sum of all node's counts is 2S, where S is the number of -1 edges.\n\nEach node's count is odd, so sum is n times (some number), but each node contributes 1 mod 2. So the total sum is n mod 2. So 2S ≡ n mod 2 → 2S is congruent to n mod 2. But 2S is always even, so n must also be even. Wait, that's a contradiction unless n is even.\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Because if n is odd, then 2S ≡ 1 mod 2, which is impossible since 2S is even. So for a tree to be good, n must be even.\n\nBecause if n is odd, the sum of all node's counts (which is 2S) would be odd, which is impossible because 2S is even.\n\nSo the conclusion is: a good tree exists only when n is even. Otherwise, there are zero good trees.\n\nWait, but the sample input includes n=2, which is even, and n=4, which is even, but the second sample is n=1, which is odd. And for n=1, the answer is zero, which aligns with this conclusion.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is check if n is even. If it's odd, output zero.\n\nWait, no. Wait, n=1 is a single node. There are no edges. For n=1, the condition is trivially satisfied because each node (only one) has zero edges, so product is 1. But the required product is -1. So for n=1, it's not a good tree. Hence, the sum is zero.\n\nSo for n=1, output is zero.\n\nSimilarly, for any other odd n, the sum is zero.\n\nSo for the rest, let's assume n is even.\n\nNow, the next step is to model the problem for even n.\n\nEach node has an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree.\n\nPerhaps, the parity of the edges along the path from 1 to n plays a role.\n\nWait, d(1,n) is the sum of the weights along the unique path from 1 to n. Since each edge is either 1 or -1, this sum can vary.\n\nBut how does the structure of the tree affect the possible sums?\n\nI think we can model this problem using linear algebra over GF(2). Because each condition on the nodes imposes a constraint on the edges.\n\nEach node's condition is that the sum of the edges incident to it is 1 mod 2 (since the product is -1, which is equivalent to the sum being 1 mod 2: because each -1 contributes 1 mod 2, and the product is 1 if even number, -1 if odd).\n\nWait, yes! Because for each node, the product of the edge weights is -1. Since each edge is ±1, the product is (-1)^{k}, where k is the number of -1 edges. So for the product to be -1, k must be odd, which implies that the sum of the edge weights (mod 2) is 1.\n\nSo each node contributes a constraint that the sum of the edges incident to it is 1 mod 2.\n\nThis is a system of linear equations over GF(2), where each equation is sum_{edges incident to i} x_e = 1 mod 2.\n\nIn a tree, there are n-1 edges. So the variables are the edges, each variable x_e is either 0 (for weight 1) or 1 (for weight -1).\n\nWe have n equations, each corresponding to a node, stating that the sum of its incident edges is 1.\n\nBut wait, in a tree, each edge connects two nodes. So each equation is linked to the variables of the edges connected to that node.\n\nSo the system is:\n\nFor each node i: sum_{e incident to i} x_e = 1 mod 2.\n\nWe need to find the number of solutions to this system, and for each solution, compute d(1,n) which is the sum of the edges along the path from 1 to n.\n\nWait, but the sum d(1,n) is the actual sum of the edge weights, not their binary representation. So each x_e is 1 for -1, 0 for 1. So the sum is (number of -1 edges along the path) multiplied by 1 plus (number of 1 edges) multiplied by 1, but that's just the count of edges on the path. Wait, no, the sum is the sum of each edge's weight, which is either 1 or -1. So for each edge on the path, the contribution is 1 or -1. So the sum is the count of -1 edges on the path minus the count of 1 edges. Because each -1 contributes -1, each 1 contributes +1.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nd(1,n) = sum_{e in path} w_e.\n\nEach w_e is either 1 or -1. So the sum is equal to (number of 1's) * 1 + (number of -1's) * (-1) = (count_1 - count_-1).\n\nBut count_1 + count_-1 = length of path.\n\nSo d(1,n) = (count_1 - count_-1) = (length - 2*count_-1).\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think of each x_e as 1 if the edge is -1, 0 otherwise.\n\nThen, the sum d(1,n) is equal to (number of edges on the path with x_e=1) * (-1) + (number of edges with x_e=0) * 1.\n\nWhich is equal to (number of 1's - number of 0's) on the path.\n\nWhich is equal to (number of 1's) - (path_length - number of 1's) ) = 2*(number of 1's) - path_length.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of the variables and the constraints, then find the expected value of d(1,n) across all valid trees, multiplied by the number of valid trees.\n\nBut given the large constraints (n up to 5e5), we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nWait, maybe we can model the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees as a function that can be computed via some formula.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree.\n\nSince each node has an odd number of -1 edges, perhaps the tree must have certain properties.\n\nAnother observation: the sum of all the equations (node constraints) is equal to the sum of 1's for each node. So sum_{i=1 to n} (sum_{e incident to i} x_e) = sum_{i=1 to n} 1 → 2S = n, where S is the number of edges with x_e=1 (since each edge is counted twice, once for each endpoint). So 2S = n mod 2.\n\nBut wait, for the sum of all equations, each edge x_e is added twice (once for each end). So sum_{all equations} equals 2S = sum_{i=1 to n} 1 → 2S = n.\n\nBut 2S is even, so n must be even for this to hold. Which aligns with our earlier conclusion that a good tree exists only when n is even.\n\nSo, when n is even, 2S = n → S = n/2.\n\nSo the total number of edges with x_e=1 is n/2. So in any good tree, exactly n/2 edges are -1, and the rest are 1.\n\nThat's a crucial point.\n\nSo, for a good tree, exactly half of the edges are -1, and the other half are 1.\n\nTherefore, the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees can be approached by considering all possible trees with exactly n/2 edges set to -1, and satisfying the node constraints.\n\nBut wait, no—because the node constraints may restrict which edges can be -1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of valid assignments of -1 edges (exactly n/2 of them) that satisfy the node constraints, and then summing the d(1,n) for each such assignment.\n\nBut given the constraints, perhaps we can model this as a system of linear equations modulo 2, and find the rank and nullspace.\n\nEach edge variable x_e is a binary variable (0 or 1), and each node i gives an equation:\n\nsum_{e incident to i} x_e ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nThe number of variables is n-1 (edges), and the number of equations is n.\n\nBut the sum of all equations is 2S = n. For n even, that's okay.\n\nBut since each equation corresponds to a node, perhaps the equations are dependent.\n\nWait, let's see: the sum of all equations is sum_{i=1 to n} (sum x_e for e incident to i) = sum x_e * (degree(i)) ≡ n mod 2.\n\nWait, but in our case, for each equation, the sum is 1 mod 2. So the sum of all equations is n mod 2.\n\nWhich for even n is 0 mod 2. So the sum is 0 mod 2, which is consistent because 2S = n, and S is n/2, so 2S = n, which is even.\n\nSo, the system has a solution only if the sum of the equations is compatible, which it is when n is even.\n\nBut now, how many solutions are there? And how can we model the sum of d(1,n) across all solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to realize that the system has a certain number of free variables, and the sum can be computed based on the dependencies.\n\nLet me think about the rank of the system.\n\nEach equation is a row in a matrix, where the columns correspond to edges.\n\nEach equation has 1s in the columns corresponding to edges incident to the node.\n\nSo, the matrix is the incidence matrix of the tree, but since the tree is variable, this complicates things.\n\nWait, but the tree is a spanning tree, which varies. So perhaps for a fixed tree, the system can be analyzed, but since the tree can vary, this seems difficult.\n\nWait, but perhaps the system is independent of the tree's structure, as long as it's a tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any tree, the system of equations has a certain property, like the rank being n-1.\n\nWait, for a tree, the incidence matrix has rank n-1. So perhaps the system of n equations has a rank of n-1, meaning that the solution space is one-dimensional, assuming the system is consistent.\n\nWait, but the system is for a general tree, and the variables are the edges, but each tree is a different structure.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is getting too tangled. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nSince each good tree has exactly n/2 edges assigned -1, and the sum of all node constraints is satisfied, perhaps the sum can be expressed as a linear function over the edges.\n\nLet me think about d(1,n) as a function of the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\nEach edge on this path contributes either 1 or -1 to d(1,n). So d(1,n) = (number of -1 edges on the path) × (-1) + (number of 1 edges) × 1.\n\nBut that's equivalent to (count_1_path - count_minus1_path), where count_1_path is the number of 1 edges on the path, and count_minus1_path is the number of -1 edges.\n\nAlternatively, since each edge on the path is either 1 or -1, the sum is (number of 1's) + (number of -1's)*(-1) = (count_1 - count_-1).\n\nBut count_1 + count_-1 is the length of the path, say L. So d(1,n) = (count_1 - count_-1) = (L - 2*count_-1).\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps the sum over all good trees can be expressed as the sum over all possible subsets S of edges (with |S|=n/2) that satisfy the node constraints, of (sum of x_e for e in path(1,n) × (-1)).\n\nBut that's the same as sum_S [ sum_{e in path(1,n)} x_e * (-1) ].\n\nWhich can be written as - sum_{e in path(1,n)} x_e × (number of subsets S containing e and satisfying the constraints).\n\nWait, but each subset S is a selection of n/2 edges, including some of the edges on the path.\n\nHmm, maybe not directly helpful.\n\nAnother angle: since each good tree has exactly n/2 edges as -1, perhaps the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees is equal to (sum over all good trees) [d(1,n)].\n\nBut d(1,n) is the sum of the edges on the path, which is a linear function of the edges on the path.\n\nSo perhaps, the sum can be expressed as the sum over all good trees of (sum_{e in path} x_e * (-1)).\n\nWhich is equal to -sum_{e in path} (sum over all good trees that include e as -1).\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is assigned -1, and then multiply each by (-1) and sum them up.\n\nBut how do we find the number of good trees where e is -1.\n\nWait, but for each edge e, whether it's included in the set S (edges assigned -1) depends on the rest of the assignment.\n\nHmm, perhaps inclusion-exclusion or combinatorial methods can be applied here.\n\nWait, but the constraints are that exactly n/2 edges are -1, and for each node, the number of edges incident to it that are -1 is odd.\n\nSo, for edge e, which connects nodes u and v, the inclusion of e in S affects the constraints of u and v.\n\nSo, perhaps, for each edge e, we can compute the probability that e is in S, given that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut since we need the exact count, perhaps we can model it as follows.\n\nLet’s denote by C the number of good trees. Then, the sum over d(1,n) is equal to -sum_{e in E} (number of good trees where e is -1) * 1.\n\nSo, we can compute this sum as -sum_e (count_e), where count_e is the number of good trees where edge e is assigned -1.\n\nBut how to compute count_e.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to (total number of good trees) multiplied by the probability that e is -1.\n\nBut in the uniform distribution over all possible good trees, what is the probability that e is -1?\n\nWait, but the number of good trees is C = total number of good trees.\n\nHmm, but for each edge e, the choice to assign it to -1 or 1 is constrained by the overall parity conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each edge e has an equal chance of being in S or not, but subject to the constraints.\n\nWait, but since exactly n/2 edges must be -1, the choices are constrained. So perhaps the probability that e is in S is 1/2, but that's only if the constraints allow it.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the system of equations allows for each edge to be in S or not independently, except for the global constraint of exactly n/2 edges being in S.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system of equations has a solution space of dimension 1, meaning that the choices are determined by one degree of freedom.\n\nWait, perhaps the system has a kernel of size 1, leading to a unique solution modulo the constraints.\n\nBut I'm not confident.\n\nWait, for a tree with n nodes, the incidence matrix has rank n-1. So the system of equations (n equations) has rank n-1, provided that the sum of the equations is zero (which it is for even n). So the system is underdetermined by 1 equation.\n\nThus, the solution space has dimension 1.\n\nSo, for a fixed tree, the number of good trees is 2^(n-1 - (n-1 - rank)) )= 2^1=2. So for each tree, there are exactly two ways to assign the edges to satisfy the constraints.\n\nWait, that's an important insight.\n\nSo, for a fixed tree, the number of good assignments is 2, regardless of the tree's structure.\n\nBecause the system has rank n-1, and the solution space is 2^{1}.\n\nSo, for each tree, there are exactly two valid assignments of the edges.\n\nBut wait, earlier we said that exactly n/2 edges are assigned -1. So each assignment must have exactly n/2 edges as -1.\n\nSo, for each tree, there are exactly two ways to assign the edges, each way having exactly n/2 edges as -1, and satisfying the node constraints.\n\nSo, the total number of good trees is (number of trees) * 2.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}. So for each tree, there are 2^{n-1} possible edge assignments. But for each tree, only two of these assignments are good.\n\nSo the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 2.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, for n=2, the output is 1. According to this formula, 2^{2-2}=1, multiplied by 2, gives 2 good trees. But the sample says 1.\n\nHmm, that's a discrepancy. So my reasoning must be wrong.\n\nWait, wait for n=2, the tree has one edge. For a tree to be good, the product for each node must be -1. So node 1 has one edge, product is x_1. So x_1 must be -1. Similarly for node 2. So the only valid assignment is x_1=-1. So there's only 1 good tree.\n\nBut according to the formula n^{n-2} * 2, it's 2^{2-1}=2, multiplied by 2, giving 2. Which is incorrect.\n\nSo my previous conclusion is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the number of good trees per tree structure is not always two.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the number of good assignments depends on the tree's structure.\n\nThat complicates things.\n\nSo, back to the drawing board.\n\nAlternative approach: since the system of equations is such that each node has an odd number of -1 edges, and the sum of all such counts is n (even), perhaps the system can be solved by noting that each edge is involved in two equations.\n\nLet me think about the solution space.\n\nThe system has n equations, and the rank is n-1, because the sum of the equations is zero mod 2.\n\nSo, the system has one solution up to a scalar multiple.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is unique, except for the fact that the sum of all equations is zero.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution space has a basis of one vector, meaning that all solutions differ by a particular vector.\n\nWait, but for the system Ax = b, where A is an n x (n-1) matrix, the solution space is either empty or affine of dimension 1.\n\nIn our case, the system is consistent because 2S = n, which is even.\n\nSo, the solution space is a coset of the kernel of A.\n\nThe kernel has dimension equal to the number of variables minus the rank of A.\n\nSince rank(A) is n-1, the kernel has dimension 1.\n\nSo, the solution space is a subspace of dimension 1, but shifted by a particular vector.\n\nThus, the number of solutions is 2^{1} = 2.\n\nWait, but that would mean that for each tree, there are exactly two possible assignments of the edges that satisfy the constraints.\n\nBut in the n=2 case, this isn't true.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that for a tree with n=2, the incidence matrix has rank 1. So the solution space is of dimension 1, hence two solutions.\n\nBut in reality, for n=2, the only valid assignment is x_1 = 1. So the solution space is not two, but one.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my reasoning is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution space is different for trees with certain structures.\n\nWait, perhaps the rank of the incidence matrix for a tree is n-1, regardless of the tree's structure.\n\nYes, that's correct. The rank of the incidence matrix of a tree is n-1.\n\nSo, for a tree, the system has n equations, rank n-1, so the solution space is of dimension 1.\n\nThus, for each tree, there are exactly two possible assignments of the edges that satisfy the constraints.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the system is:\n\nx_1 = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo, x_1 can be 1 only. So the solution is unique. So why does the system suggest two solutions?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the system has two solutions. Maybe for n=2, the system has only one solution, contradicting the earlier assertion.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial reasoning is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the system has a solution space that is a coset of the kernel.\n\nBut for the case n=2, the system is x_1 = 1 mod 2.\n\nThe solution is x_1=1. So the solution space is a single point.\n\nSo, the kernel of the system is {0}, and the solution is the unique solution.\n\nWait, but the system is Ax = b, where A has rank n-1=1.\n\nSo, the solution is x = x0 + t * v, where v is in the kernel of A, and t is a scalar.\n\nIn the n=2 case, A is [[1]], b is [1].\n\nThe kernel of A is the vectors orthogonal to [1], which in GF(2) is all vectors x with x_1 = 0. So the solution is x = [1] + t*[something]. But wait, in this case, the solution is x = [1], because any other solution would require adding something orthogonal to A, but since the system is x_1=1, adding a vector orthogonal to A (which would have x_1=0) doesn't change the solution.\n\nWait, perhaps the system's solution is x = x0 + k*v, where v is in the kernel, and k is a scalar.\n\nBut in the case n=2, the kernel is the set of vectors orthogonal to A, which is any vector where x_1=0.\n\nSo, the solution is x = [1] + k*[v], where v is any vector in the kernel.\n\nWait, but [1] is already in the solution space. So, for any k, x is a solution.\n\nWait, but for n=2, the system x_1 = 1 mod 2. So the solution is x_1=1, regardless of k.\n\nSo, how come the kernel is non-trivial?\n\nAh, I think I'm mixing up concepts. The system is:\n\nA x = b\n\nWhere A is the incidence matrix of the tree.\n\nThe solution space is the set of x that satisfy this equation.\n\nThe kernel is the set of x such that A x = 0.\n\nThe solution space is the set x0 + kernel.\n\nSo, for n=2, the kernel is the set of vectors x where A x = 0, which is x_1=0.\n\nThe solution is x0 + kernel, where x0 is a particular solution.\n\nSo, for n=2, a particular solution is x0 = [1].\n\nThe kernel is { [0] }, since x_1=0.\n\nThus, the solution space is { [1] }.\n\nSo, for n=2, the solution is unique.\n\nHmm, but earlier I thought that for a tree, the solution space is 2^1=2. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the system's solution space depends on the tree's structure.\n\nWait, no. The rank of the incidence matrix is always n-1 for a tree.\n\nSo for any tree, the system has rank n-1, and thus the solution space is of dimension 1.\n\nSo, for n=2, the system's solution space is a one-dimensional vector space. But in practice, it's a single vector.\n\nSo perhaps the system's solution space is not always a two-element set.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the way I model the system.\n\nEach equation is sum_{e incident to i} x_e = 1 mod 2.\n\nThe system is homogeneous except for the right-hand side.\n\nBut in GF(2), the solution space is a coset of the kernel.\n\nWait, perhaps the system has a solution only if the sum of the equations is zero, which it is for even n.\n\nSo, for even n, the solution space is a coset of the kernel, which has dimension 1.\n\nThus, the number of solutions is 2^1 = 2.\n\nBut for n=2, that's not the case.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions depends on the tree's structure.\n\nWait, perhaps for some trees, the solution space is one-dimensional, but for others, it's zero-dimensional.\n\nNo, that can't be. Because for any tree, the incidence matrix has rank n-1, so the solution space is always one-dimensional.\n\nSo, for any tree, the system has exactly two solutions.\n\nBut for n=2, this is not the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the system.\n\nWait, the system is:\n\nFor each node i, sum_{e in edges of i} x_e = 1 mod 2.\n\nIn n=2, node 1 and 2 each have one edge, x_1.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\nx_1 ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nx_1 ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nSo, the system is consistent and has exactly one solution: x_1=1.\n\nThus, the solution space is one-dimensional, but in this case, the kernel is zero-dimensional.\n\nWait, this suggests that the system's solution space is not always two solutions.\n\nSo, perhaps the earlier assumption that the solution space is two solutions for any tree is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should think differently.\n\nLet's think about the sum of d(1,n) across all good trees.\n\nEach good tree has exactly n/2 edges as -1.\n\nNow, the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees is equal to the sum over all good trees of the sum of x_e for e on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by (-1).\n\nWhich is equal to - sum_{e on path(1,n)} (number of good trees where e is -1).\n\nSo, for each edge e on the path(1,n), I need to compute the number of good trees where e is -1, and then multiply by -1, and sum all those contributions.\n\nBut how to compute this for each edge e.\n\nWait, but for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 depends on whether flipping e from 1 to -1 still satisfies the constraints.\n\nHmm, perhaps the number of such trees is equal to the number of good trees multiplied by 1/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, suppose that for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to C/2, where C is the total number of good trees.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause, for each tree, the choice of whether e is -1 or 1 is equally likely among the valid assignments.\n\nBut that's assuming that the system's solution space allows for a uniform distribution.\n\nBut this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to the number of good trees multiplied by (n/2)/(n-1), but that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to C / 2, where C is the total number of good trees.\n\nBecause, for each tree, exactly half of the possible assignments have e as -1, but I'm not sure if the constraints allow for that.\n\nWait, for a fixed tree, the number of good assignments is 2.\n\nIf for each such assignment, exactly half of them have e as -1, then for each tree, the number of good trees where e is -1 is 1.\n\nThus, for each tree, the number of good trees where e is -1 is 1, and where it's 1 is 1.\n\nSo, the total number of good trees where e is -1 is (number of trees) × 1.\n\nBut that would imply that for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to the number of trees, which is not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to the total number of good trees divided by (n-1), multiplied by 1.\n\nBecause each edge is part of exactly (n-1 choose ... ) possibilities.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum over all edges e of the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to C × n/2.\n\nBecause each good tree has n/2 edges as -1, so the sum is C × (n/2).\n\nSo, sum_e count_e = C × (n/2).\n\nBut then, if for each edge e, count_e is the same, then count_e = C × (n/(2(n-1))) ).\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps each edge e appears in the same number of good trees where e is -1.\n\nBut that depends on the structure of the tree.\n\nWait, but the tree is variable, so perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is the same across all edges.\n\nBut I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of count_e for all edges e is equal to C × (n/2), as each tree contributes n/2 edges.\n\nSo, sum_e count_e = C × (n/2).\n\nBut to find the individual count_e for each edge, perhaps it's equal to C × (n/2) / (n-1), assuming each edge is treated equally.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure.\n\nHmm.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the sum as follows.\n\nThe sum of d(1,n) over all good trees is equal to the sum over all good trees of the sum of x_e for e in path(1,n) multiplied by (-1).\n\nWhich is equal to - sum_e (x_e on path(1,n)) × (number of good trees where e is in the path and x_e = 1).\n\nWait, no, perhaps more accurately, it's the sum of x_e for e in path(1,n) multiplied by (-1), summed over all good trees.\n\nWhich is equal to - sum_{e in path(1,n)} (number of good trees where e is -1).\n\nSo, for each edge e in the path, we need to compute the number of good trees where e is -1.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to (C × (n/2)) / (n-1).\n\nBecause each good tree has n/2 edges as -1, and each edge is part of (n-1) possible paths.\n\nWait, no, that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for any edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to C × (1/2).\n\nBecause, for each good tree, exactly half of the edges are -1, so for any particular edge e, the probability that it's -1 is 1/2.\n\nBut is that true?\n\nIn the case of n=2, C=1.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is 1/2 × 1 = 0.5, which isn't an integer.\n\nSo that can't be.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to C × (1/2), but that would require C to be even, which isn't necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to C × (n/2) / (n-1).\n\nBut for n=2, that would be C × 1 / 1 = C.\n\nWhich for n=2, C=1, so 1, which is correct.\n\nIn the sample input for n=2, the sum is -1, which comes from the single tree where e is -1. So the count_e for e is 1.\n\nSo, for n=2, the formula gives 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nIn the third sample, n=4, C=16.\n\nSo for each edge e, the count_e is 16 × (4/2) / (4-1) )= 16 × 2 /3 = 32/3, which is not an integer. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to (number of good trees) × (probability that e is -1 given the constraints).\n\nBut what is that probability?\n\nIf the constraints are such that each edge has an equal chance of being in S, then the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut is that the case?\n\nWait, for each tree, the number of good assignments is two. So for each tree, exactly one of the two assignments has e as -1.\n\nSo, for each tree, e is -1 in exactly half of the good assignments.\n\nSo, for each tree, the number of good trees where e is -1 is 1.\n\nBut then, the total number of good trees is (number of trees) × 2.\n\nWait, because for each tree, there are two good assignments.\n\nSo, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is -1 is equal to (number of trees) × 1.\n\nBut that would imply that for each edge e, count_e is (number of trees) × 1.\n\nBut the total number of good trees is (number of trees) × 2.\n\nSo",
