Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about moving from home to university in Crazy Town, which is divided into blocks by roads. Each road is an infinite line. The key point is that you can move between two adjacent blocks in one step if they share a common border of non-zero length. So, the goal is to find the minimal number of steps needed to get from the home block to the university block.\n\nHmm. The first thing I notice is that each road is a straight line, and these lines divide the plane into regions. The home and university are in some regions, and we need to find how many such regions (blocks) separate them, but only via the roads.\n\nWait, but how do the roads affect the blocks? Each new road can potentially split existing regions into more regions. But for this problem, maybe the approach isn't to model the entire structure, because with n up to 300, that's way too much for any brute-force method.\n\nAnother thought: the minimal steps required would be equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university regions. Because each such road might require crossing once, but perhaps not always. Or wait, maybe it's the number of roads that the home and university lie on opposite sides of. Because each such road would create a boundary that you have to cross.\n\nLet me think about the example provided. The sample input:\n\nHome is at (1,1), university at (-1,-1). There are two roads in the first case.\n\nFirst road is 0x +1y -1 =0 → y=1. Home is (1,1) which is on this line? Wait, plugging in: 0*1 +1*1 -1 = 0 → 0=0. Oh right, but the problem states that neither home nor university is on any road. So maybe the sample has different lines.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nIn the first case, the two roads are 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=-1? Or wait, no: 0x +1y +0 =0 is y=0. Wait, no, let's compute:\n\nFor the first line in the first sample: 0 1 0 → 0x +1y +0=0 → y = -0 → y=0. So the home (1,1) is above this line, and the university (-1,-1) is below. So this road separates them. Then, the second line is 1x +0y +0=0 → x=0. The home is on the positive side (x>0), university on negative (x<0). So another separating line.\n\nSo the minimal steps are 2. Which matches the output.\n\nIn the second sample, the third line is 1 1 -3 → x + y -3=0. So the home (1,1) is plugged into equation: 1+1-3= -1 <0. University (-1,-1): -1-1-3= -5 <0. So both are on same side of this line, meaning it doesn't contribute to separation.\n\nSo the minimal steps are 2 again.\n\nSo the key idea is: for each road, determine whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the minimal number of steps required.\n\nBecause each such road requires crossing, which takes one step. Because when you cross a road, you move from one block to another, and each such crossing is a step.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each road, check whether home and university are on different sides.\n- The total number of such roads is the answer.\n\nHow to determine if two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nGiven a line ax + by + c =0, compute the value of ax1 + by1 +c and ax2 + by2 +c. If their signs are different, then the points are on opposite sides.\n\nBut wait, what if the value is zero? Well, the problem states that neither home nor university lies on any road, so ax1 + by1 +c and ax2 + by2 +c can't be zero for any road.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\n1. Read home and university coordinates.\n2. Read each of the n roads.\n3. For each road, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n   Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n4. If s1 and s2 have opposite signs (s1 * s2 < 0), increment the count.\n5. The count is the minimal number of steps.\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe need to read the inputs. The first two lines are home and university. Then n, then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nThen, for each of the n lines, compute s1 and s2, and check if s1*s2 <0.\n\nCount the number of such lines.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead x1, y1 from first line.\n\nRead x2, y2 from second line.\n\nRead n.\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nLoop n times:\n\n   Read a, b, c.\n\n   Compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n   Compute s2 = a*x2 + b*x2 + c\n\n   if s1 * s2 <0: count +=1\n\nPrint count as the result.\n\nYes, that's simple.\n\nTesting with the sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=2.\n\nFirst road: 0 1 0 → s1 = 0*1+1*1+0=1; s2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 =-1. So 1 * (-1) <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → s1=1*1+0*1+0=1; s2=1*(-1)+0*(-1)+0= -1 → product <0 → count +=1. Total 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → s1=1*1 +1*1 -3 = -1; s2=1*(-1)+1*(-1)-3= -5 → product is positive. So no count.\n\nOther two roads:\n\nRoad 1: 0 1 0 → same as before: s1=1, s2=-1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2:1 0 0 → same: s1=1, s2=-1 → count +=1.\n\nTotal 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all roads don't separate: count is 0.\n\nOr all roads do: count is n.\n\nAnother case: home and university are on the same side for all roads except one.\n\nThus, the code handles all.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nThe code needs to read from standard input.\n\nIn Python, reading multiple lines can be done via sys.stdin.\n\nBut sometimes, when using online judges, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but in this case, the problem says each line has exactly the required numbers.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ncount =0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSample Output: 2.\n\nWhich the code correctly returns.\n\nSimilarly for the second sample.\n\nI think this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from the block containing your home to the block containing your university in Crazy Town, where each step involves crossing a road that separates two blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The town is divided into blocks by roads, each defined by a line equation. You can move between blocks if they share a common border of non-zero length. The key insight is that each road that separates the home block from the university block will require a step to cross.\n2. **Intuition**: For each road, determine if the home and university are on opposite sides. If they are, crossing this road will be necessary, incrementing the step count.\n3. **Algorithm**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, the points are on opposite sides of the road, meaning a step is required. Count such roads to get the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    count = 0\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Checking Each Road**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs, it indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Steps**: Increment the step count for each such road.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total count of roads that need to be crossed, which gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimal steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
