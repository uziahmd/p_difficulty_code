Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting souvenirs such that their total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is maximized. Petya has n souvenirs, each with a weight between 1 and 3, and a cost. We need to choose a subset where the sum of weights is ≤m, and the sum of costs is as large as possible.\n\nHmm, the constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So we need an efficient solution, probably O(n*m) is too slow. Wait, but n is 1e5 and m is 3e5, which gives 3e10 operations—way too much. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches. Since the weights are small (only 1,2,3), maybe we can group them by weight and handle each group separately.\n\nYes, for each weight class (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each possible count of taking items from each weight, we can compute the maximum cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nWait, but how do we combine the counts from each weight? Because the sum of 1*count1 + 2*count2 +3*count3 must be ≤m.\n\nThis sounds like a variation of the knapsack problem, but since the weights are limited, perhaps we can find a way to model it efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible number of items taken from weight 3, we can precompute the maximum cost. Similarly for weight 2 and 1, then iterate through all possible combinations.\n\nBut even that might not be feasible because the number of possibilities could be too high.\n\nWait, but considering that the maximum number of items from each weight group can be up to m // weight, which for 3 is up to 1e5, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about dynamic programming. Since the weight is up to 3e5, the DP state can track the maximum cost for each possible weight.\n\nSo, let's create a DP array where dp[j] represents the maximum cost achievable with a total weight of j.\n\nWe can initialize dp[0] = 0. For each souvenir, depending on its weight w and cost c, we can update the dp array for j from m down to w, setting dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - w] + c).\n\nBut wait, n is 1e5, and m is 3e5. So if we process each item one by one, each step would take O(m) time, leading to 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nThat's definitely not going to work. So we need a better approach.\n\nGiven that the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, perhaps we can optimize the DP by processing each weight group separately.\n\nLet me consider the following steps:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weight: group1 (weight 1), group2 (weight 2), group3 (weight 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost. This way, when selecting items from a group, we want the most valuable ones first.\n\n3. For each group, compute a prefix sum array of the costs. So, for group1, the prefix sum array will tell us the total cost when taking the first k items (k can be up to the size of the group). Similarly for group2 and group3.\n\n4. Now, the problem reduces to selecting a number of items from each group such that the sum of (number of items in group1)*1 + (number from group2)*2 + (number from group3)*3 ≤ m, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nSo, the key is to find all possible combinations of x, y, z (number of items taken from each group) such that x + 2y + 3z ≤ m, and maximize the sum of their prefix sums.\n\nBut trying all possible x, y, z is computationally expensive. So we need a way to efficiently iterate through possible values.\n\nAn alternative approach is to fix the number of items taken from group3, and then for each possible z, determine the maximum possible x and y given the remaining weight budget.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor group3, the maximum possible z is min(k, m//3), where k is the size of group3.\n\nFor each z, the remaining weight is m_remaining = m - 3*z. Then, we need to select some x and y such that x + 2y ≤ m_remaining.\n\nBut group1 and group2 are already sorted, so for each possible z, we can compute the maximum possible x and y.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe, for each z, we can iterate over possible y values and compute the maximum x.\n\nBut again, with m up to 3e5, this might not be efficient.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can precompute for group1 and group2 the maximum possible x and y for any given budget, and then use these to quickly compute the best combination for each z.\n\nWait, here's another idea: for group1 and group2, compute a combined DP that, for a given weight limit, tells us the maximum cost obtainable.\n\nLet's say, we create a combined DP for group1 and group2, called combined_dp, where combined_dp[j] is the maximum cost when using exactly j weight from group1 and group2.\n\nHow to compute combined_dp?\n\nWe can compute it by initializing combined_dp as the maximum of group1 and group2 for each possible weight.\n\nWait, perhaps we can build combined_dp incrementally:\n\n- Initialize combined_dp as the prefix sums of group1, but also considering group2.\n\nNo, perhaps it's better to process group1 and group2 together in the DP.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\n- For group1 and group2, process them into a combined DP, where for each possible weight j, we track the maximum cost.\n\nThe way to do this is similar to the standard knapsack problem:\n\nInitialize combined_dp as a list where combined_dp[j] is the maximum cost for a total weight of j.\n\nInitially, combined_dp[0] = 0.\n\nFor each item in group1 (sorted in descending order), we process it by adding to the DP. Similarly for group2.\n\nBut wait, group1 and group2 are separate. So for group1, each item has weight 1 and cost c. For group2, each item has weight 2 and cost d.\n\nProcessing group1 first, then group2:\n\nFor group1:\n\nfor each i from 1 to len(group1):\n    for j from current_max_weight down to 1:\n        if combined_dp[j] < combined_dp[j-1] + group1[i].c:\n            combined_dp[j] = combined_dp[j-1] + group1[i].c\n\nSimilarly for group2, but each item contributes 2 to the weight.\n\nWait, but processing group1 and group2 in this way would result in O(n * m) operations, which is 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: for group1 and group2, compute their own prefix sums, and then for any given remaining weight after choosing z items from group3, find the maximum possible cost from group1 and group2 within the remaining weight.\n\nSince group1 and group2 are sorted, perhaps we can precompute their prefix sums and then, for a given weight limit, find the maximum sum of group1 and group2 that doesn't exceed that weight.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 can have overlapping weights. How can we combine them optimally?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for group1 and group2, we can precompute the maximum cost for every possible weight up to m.\n\nBut again, that would require O(m) time for each group, which is manageable.\n\nWait, maybe for group1 and group2, we can compute two separate prefix sums, and then for each possible z, calculate the maximum possible cost from group1 and group2 within the remaining weight (m - 3*z).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: suppose for group1, the prefix sum is s1, where s1[k] is the sum of the top k items (each contributing 1 to the weight). Similarly, for group2, the prefix sum is s2[k], sum of top k items (each contributing 2 to the weight).\n\nThen, for a given z, the remaining weight is rem = m - 3*z. We need to find the maximum x and y such that x + 2*y ≤ rem.\n\nAnd the total cost is s1[x] + s2[y].\n\nBut x and y can vary, so we need to find the pair (x, y) that maximizes s1[x] + s2[y] under the constraint x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently for each rem.\n\nHmm, perhaps for each z, we can compute the maximum possible x and y.\n\nBut rem can be up to m, which is 3e5. So for each z, we need a way to find the optimal x and y quickly.\n\nWait, but rem varies per z, so perhaps we can precompute for all possible rem, what is the maximum s1[x] + s2[y] for x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nBut that seems complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: for each possible rem, the maximum cost is the maximum of s1[x] + s2[y], where x can be up to rem, and y can be up to rem//2.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly for each rem.\n\nWait, maybe we can precompute for each possible rem, the maximum s1[x] + s2[y] for x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nThis would allow us to quickly look up the maximum cost for a given rem.\n\nBut how to precompute this?\n\nPerhaps, for all possible rem from 0 to m, we can compute the maximum cost by checking all possible y up to rem//2, and for each y, take x = rem - 2y (but x can't be more than the size of group1, and y can't be more than the size of group2).\n\nWait, but that would be O(m * (rem//2)) which is 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations—again, too slow.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For group1 and group2, precompute a combined DP that, for each possible weight j, holds the maximum cost possible using any combination of group1 and group2 items with total weight up to j.\n\nThis way, for any given rem, the maximum cost from group1 and group2 is simply the value at rem.\n\nBut how to compute this combined DP efficiently.\n\nWait, the combined DP can be built as follows:\n\nInitialize combined_dp[0] = 0.\n\nFor each item in group1, which has weight 1 and cost c:\n\n   for j from current_max_weight down to 1:\n       if combined_dp[j] < combined_dp[j-1] + c:\n           combined_dp[j] = combined_dp[j-1] + c\n\nThen, for each item in group2, which has weight 2 and cost d:\n\n   for j from current_max_weight down to 2:\n       if combined_dp[j] < combined_dp[j-2] + d:\n           combined_dp[j] = combined_dp[j-2] + d\n\nBut wait, group1 and group2 are processed in any order. But each item is considered once.\n\nBut wait, group1 and group2 are processed in their own order. So for group1, we process each item, updating the combined_dp. Then for group2, same thing.\n\nBut the problem is that the group1 and group2 are processed as individual items, but perhaps this is manageable.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 can have up to 1e5 items each, so the combined processing would lead to 2e5 steps, each requiring O(m) time. So 2e5 * 3e5 = 6e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible. So this approach won't work.\n\nHmm, so I'm stuck on finding an efficient way to compute the combined group1 and group2 DP.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way. Since group1 and group2 are both sorted in descending order of cost, perhaps we can find the optimal x and y for a given rem by considering all possible y and then computing the maximum x for the remaining weight.\n\nBut even that, for each z, would take O(rem//2) time, which is 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10 operations—still too slow.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 are sorted, so perhaps for each possible y, the maximum x is determined by rem - 2y, but only if x <= len(group1), and the cost is s1[x] + s2[y].\n\nWait, but that's for each y, which is O(1e5) steps per z. And z can be up to 1e5, so overall it's 1e10 steps—too slow.\n\nSo what else can I do?\n\nWait, perhaps we can precompute the maximum possible cost for all possible rem up to m, using group1 and group2.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, group1 is sorted, so s1 is a non-decreasing array.\n\nSimilarly, group2 is sorted, so s2 is non-decreasing.\n\nFor a given rem, the maximum x is the maximum number of group1 items we can take, given that x ≤ rem and x ≤ len(group1). Similarly for y.\n\nBut since x + 2y ≤ rem, perhaps the optimal y is as large as possible, but not so much that x becomes too small.\n\nBut this is still unclear.\n\nAlternative idea: for group1 and group2, precompute the maximum cost for every possible weight up to m.\n\nWe can compute this as follows:\n\n- Create a combined DP array of size m+1, initialized to 0.\n- For group1, process each item in order, adding 1 to the weight and c to the cost.\n- For group2, process each item in order, adding 2 to the weight and d to the cost.\n\nWait, but processing each item in group1 and group2 in this way would take O(n * m) time, which is 2e5 * 3e5 = 6e10 operations. That's way beyond what can be handled in Python.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAnother idea: Since the weights are small, perhaps we can find a way to represent the problem in terms of the number of items taken from each group, but in a way that allows for efficient computation.\n\nWait, for group3, we can take up to z items, where 3z ≤ m. For each z, the remaining weight is m_rem = m - 3z. We need to select x and y such that x + 2y ≤ m_rem, and maximize s1[x] + s2[y].\n\nSo, for each z, the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum s1[x] + s2[y] with x + 2y ≤ m_rem.\n\nNow, group1 is sorted, so s1 is non-decreasing. Similarly, s2 is non-decreasing.\n\nSo, for a fixed m_rem, the maximum s1[x] + s2[y] is achieved by choosing the largest possible y such that 2y ≤ m_rem, and then choosing the largest x possible with x ≤ m_rem - 2y.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case because maybe a smaller y allows for a larger x, which could give a higher total cost.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal y is somewhere between 0 and min(len(group2), m_rem//2).\n\nBut how to find the optimal y quickly.\n\nWait, since s2 is non-decreasing, for a fixed m_rem, the optimal y is either the maximum possible y (given m_rem), or perhaps a lower y that allows for more x.\n\nBut this is tricky.\n\nWait, but s2[y] increases as y increases, but the amount of weight used increases as well. So for a given m_rem, perhaps the optimal y is as large as possible, but subject to the condition that x can be as large as possible.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible y (up to min(len(group2), m_rem//2)), we can compute the maximum x as min(m_rem - 2y, len(group1)), and then compute the sum s1[x] + s2[y], and take the maximum over all y.\n\nBut again, for each z, this would take O(y_max) time, which is up to 1e5 per z, and with z up to 1e5, it's 1e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Precompute for group1 and group2, the maximum possible sum for all possible weight capacities up to m. Then, for each z, the remaining weight is rem = m - 3z, and the maximum sum is the value at rem in the combined DP.\n\nBut how to compute this combined DP efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps for group1 and group2, the combined DP can be computed using a method that's more efficient than the standard knapsack approach.\n\nWait, considering that group1 and group2 have items with small weights, perhaps we can use a sliding window technique or other optimizations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that the group1 and group2 can be processed in a way that leverages their small weight contributions.\n\nWait, here's a different angle: for group1, since all items have weight 1, the optimal way is to take the top x items, regardless of how they are combined with group2.\n\nSimilarly, for group2, the optimal is to take the top y items, regardless of how they are combined with group1.\n\nBut combining the two is tricky.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each possible y (number of group2 items taken), the optimal x is as large as possible, given that x ≤ rem - 2y.\n\nSo for each y, x_max = min(rem - 2y, len(group1)).\n\nThe total cost is s1[x_max] + s2[y].\n\nWe can loop through all possible y (from 0 to min(len(group2), rem//2)), compute x_max, and track the maximum.\n\nBut again, for each z, this is O(1e5) operations, which is too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can precompute for group2 the s2 and the prefix sums, and for group1, precompute s1 and the prefix sums. Then, for any rem, we can compute the maximum s1[x] + s2[y] where x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nBut the question is, how to compute this quickly for any rem.\n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum occurs when y is as large as possible, but perhaps not. So for a given rem, the optimal y can be found by binary search.\n\nWait, here's a thought: for a given rem, the maximum y can be up to rem//2. For each possible y, the maximum x is rem - 2y, but x can't exceed the size of group1.\n\nSo, the maximum possible y is min(rem//2, len(group2)).\n\nBut how to find the y that maximizes s1[x] + s2[y], where x = min(rem - 2y, len(group1)).\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible y, the function f(y) = s1[min(rem - 2y, len(g1))] + s2[y]. We need to find the y that maximizes f(y).\n\nBut f(y) is not necessarily unimodal, so binary search might not work directly.\n\nHmm, but perhaps we can find the y that gives the highest f(y) by iterating y from 0 to y_max, but with a clever way to limit the number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given rem, the optimal y is such that increasing y further reduces x, but s2 increases enough to compensate.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: For group1 and group2, precompute for all possible rem the maximum s1[x] + s2[y] where x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nThis can be done with a 2D DP, but that's not feasible for rem up to 3e5.\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, we can find the best y that maximizes the sum.\n\nWait, perhaps for each rem, we can compute the maximum possible y as the minimum between the maximum y allowed (rem//2) and the length of group2.\n\nThen, for that y, compute x = rem - 2y, and see if x is within group1's length.\n\nIf yes, add s1[x] and s2[y]. If not, decrease y until x is within group1's length.\n\nBut this might not always give the correct maximum, but perhaps it's a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each rem, the optimal y is around rem//2, but that's just a guess.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress here.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the problem differently. Since the weights are small, perhaps the combined group1 and group2 can be represented as a list of items with varying weights and costs. But I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps for group1 and group2, we can precompute the prefix sums and for each possible rem, compute the maximum possible s1[x] + s2[y] where x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nThis can be done by iterating y from 0 to min(rem//2, len(group2)), and for each y, compute x_max = min(rem - 2y, len(group1)). The sum is s1[x_max] + s2[y].\n\nWe can keep track of the maximum sum found.\n\nBut again, for each rem, this is O(1e5) operations, which is too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps the rem can be up to 3e5, which is manageable if for each rem we can compute the maximum in O(1) time.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each possible rem the maximum possible s1[x] + s2[y] where x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nThis is similar to the knapsack problem, but with two types of items.\n\nBut again, the standard knapsack approach is too slow.\n\nWait, but group1 has items with weight 1, and group2 has items with weight 2.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a knapsack where we can take any number of group1 and group2 items, but the group1 items are unlimited except by their count.\n\nWait, no, because the group1 items are finite.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, here's a different approach inspired by the fact that group1 and group2 can be processed in a certain way.\n\nSuppose we precompute the prefix sums for group1 and group2.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\ns1[k] = sum of the first k items in group1.\n\ns2[l] = sum of the first l items in group2.\n\nWe need to find the maximum s1[k] + s2[l], where k + 2*l ≤ rem.\n\nWe can precompute s1 and s2.\n\nNow, for a given rem, the problem is to find the maximum s1[k] + s2[l], with k + 2*l ≤ rem.\n\nWe can rephrase this as k ≤ rem - 2*l.\n\nSo for each possible l (from 0 to min(rem//2, len(group2))), we can compute k_max = min(rem - 2*l, len(group1)).\n\nThen, the sum is s1[k_max] + s2[l].\n\nWe need to find the l that maximizes this sum.\n\nBut checking all possible l for each rem is too slow.\n\nAlternative Idea: For each l, the maximum k is rem - 2*l, which decreases as l increases.\n\nSo, for group1 and group2, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved when l is as large as possible, but k is as large as possible.\n\nBut this is not necessarily the case because s2[l] may not increase enough to compensate for the decrease in k.\n\nSo, perhaps we can perform a binary search for l.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible l, the sum is s1[rem - 2*l] + s2[l], provided rem - 2*l >=0.\n\nWait, but rem is fixed for a given z.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another Idea: For each possible l, the corresponding k is rem - 2*l, but it's bounded by the length of group1.\n\nSo, for a given rem, the maximum l can be up to min(rem//2, len(group2)).\n\nSo, perhaps for each rem, we can compute the maximum l such that rem - 2*l >=0 and rem - 2*l >=0, and then compute s1[rem - 2*l] + s2[l].\n\nBut this is only considering one possible l, not all possible l.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the l that maximizes s2[l] while allowing the maximum possible k.\n\nBut again, this isn't straightforward.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, perhaps I can look for solutions to the 0-1 knapsack problem where items have small weights. Oh right! In some cases, when the weights are small, you can split the problem into handling each weight class separately.\n\nWait, considering that group1 has weight 1, group2 has weight 2, and group3 has weight 3.\n\nLet me try to model the problem as follows:\n\nFor group3, the maximum possible items is z_max = min(len(group3), m //3).\n\nWe can loop z from 0 to z_max.\n\nFor each z, the remaining weight is rem = m - 3*z.\n\nWe need to find the maximum sum of s1[x] + s2[y], where x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nNow, to compute this sum for each rem, perhaps we can precompute a 2D array for group1 and group2, but that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: For group1 and group2, precompute for all possible weights up to m, the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut again, this requires O(m) time, which is manageable.\n\nWait, perhaps for group1 and group2, the combined maximum can be precomputed as a single DP.\n\nLet me think: the combined DP can be built by processing group1 and group2 items.\n\nBut the issue is that group1 and group2 are processed in a way that allows for all possible combinations of x and y.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\n1. Sort group1 and group2 in descending order of cost.\n\n2. Compute prefix sums s1 and s2 for group1 and group2.\n\n3. For each possible rem (from 0 to m), precompute the maximum sum s1[x] + s2[y], where x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\n   To compute this for all rem, we can use a dynamic programming approach:\n\n   - Initialize a DP array where dp[j] is the maximum sum for weight j.\n\n   - For each possible weight j from 0 to m:\n\n      dp[j] = max over all possible y (where 2y ≤ j):\n\n          s2[y] + s1[j - 2y]\n\n   But computing this for each j is O(j/2) operations, which is O(m^2/2) in total—way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Maybe for each j, the maximum y is min(j//2, len(group2)), and then compute x = j-2y, which is up to len(group1).\n\nBut even that is O(m * (j//2)) time, which is 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Since group1 and group2 are sorted, perhaps for each possible j, the optimal y is the maximum possible such that 2y ≤ j, and then check if x = j - 2y is feasible.\n\nBut again, this doesn't guarantee the maximum sum.\n\nWait, but perhaps for each j, the optimal y is the one that maximizes s2[y] + s1[j - 2y].\n\nBut how to find this quickly.\n\nWait, perhaps for each j, the optimal y is the maximum possible y where 2y ≤ j, and then x is as large as possible.\n\nBut again, this is just a heuristic and doesn't ensure the maximum sum.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum for j is achieved when y is as large as possible, but not so large that x becomes zero. Or perhaps when x is as large as possible, but y is as large as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck on finding an efficient way to compute the combined group1 and group2's maximum cost for any given rem.\n\nMaybe I should consider looking for alternative approaches or simplifying the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial idea is correct, but I'm missing a way to compute the combined DP efficiently.\n\nHere's a Plan:\n\n1. Group the items into three groups based on their weight.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost and compute their prefix sums.\n\n3. For group1 and group2, compute a combined DP where for each possible weight j, dp[j] is the maximum cost obtainable from group1 and group2 with total weight j.\n\n   But group1 and group2 are processed in a way that allows for O(m) time.\n\nWait, perhaps for group1, since all items have weight 1, the maximum number of items we can take is min(len(group1), j).\n\nSo for group1, the maximum cost for j is the prefix sum of the top min(j, len(group1)) items.\n\nSimilarly for group2, the maximum cost for j is the prefix sum of the top min(j//2, len(group2)) items multiplied by 2, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, group2's prefix sum is based on the number of items taken, not their weight.\n\nSo for group2, the prefix sum s2[y] is the sum of the top y items, each contributing 2 to the weight.\n\nSo for a given j, the maximum number of group2 items we can take is y_max = min(j // 2, len(group2)).\n\nBut group2's items are taken in a way that their sum is maximized.\n\nSo for group2, the maximum sum for weight 2*y is s2[y_max].\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum sum for group2 in a weight of j is the maximum s2[y] where 2y ≤ j.\n\nSo for each j, the maximum group2 sum is the maximum s2[y] for y up to j//2.\n\nSimilarly for group1, the sum is s1[x], where x is up to j.\n\nSo, for each j, the combined maximum sum is s1[x] + s2[y], where x + 2y ≤ j.\n\nBut to find this, perhaps we can precompute for each j the maximum s1[x] + s2[y], where x + 2y ≤ j.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally heavy.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to precompute for each j the maximum possible s1[x] + s2[y], where x is the maximum possible given that y is chosen.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress.\n\nAnother Idea: Since group1 and group2 are sorted, perhaps for each possible y, the maximum x is min(rem - 2y, len(group1)). So for a given rem, the maximum possible sum is s1[x] + s2[y].\n\nWe can precompute s1 and s2, and for each rem, loop through possible y values to find the maximum.\n\nBut again, this is O(1e5) per rem, which is too slow.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be approached greedily.\n\nBut I don't think that's possible because the optimal selection isn't necessarily greedy.\n\nFor example, sometimes taking a slightly less valuable item could allow for more valuable items elsewhere.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps a greedy approach is the only way forward.\n\nWait, but group1 and group2 are sorted, so perhaps the best way is to take as many as possible from group3, then group2, then group1.\n\nBut that's not necessarily correct.\n\nWait, for group3, taking more items may leave less room for group2 and group1, which could have higher value per weight.\n\nBut since the groups are independent, perhaps it's better to take as much as possible from the highest value-per-weight group.\n\nWait, but the value per weight isn't necessarily consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible z (number of group3 items), we can compute the maximum possible sum from group1 and group2, given the rem = m -3z.\n\nBut to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nWait, perhaps for group1 and group2, we can precompute the maximum possible sum for all possible rem values.\n\nBut how.\n\nWait, perhaps for group1 and group2, the maximum sum for rem is the maximum of s1[x] + s2[y], where x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nBut to find this, perhaps we can use a sliding window approach.\n\nWait, here's a new Idea: for group1 and group2, since their prefix sums are non-decreasing, perhaps for a given rem, the optimal y is the maximum possible such that 2y ≤ rem, and x is as large as possible given that.\n\nBut again, this is just a heuristic.\n\nAlternatively, for a given rem, the optimal y can be found by binary searching for the best y.\n\nWait, perhaps for each possible y, the sum is s1[x] + s2[y], where x = min(rem - 2y, len(group1)).\n\nWe can compute this for various y and track the maximum.\n\nBut again, for each rem, this is O(1e5) operations, which is too slow.\n\nWait, but for group1 and group2, perhaps the sum s1[x] + s2[y] can be expressed in a way that allows for faster computation.\n\nWait, perhaps for group1 and group2, the maximum sum for rem can be found by finding the maximum of s1[x] + s2[y] where x = min(rem - 2y, len(g1)), and y ranges from 0 to min(rem//2, len(g2)).\n\nBut again, this is O(y_max) per rem, which is too slow.\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to precompute for all possible rem the maximum sum, using a clever approach that doesn't require O(m) processing.\n\nWait, here's a Plan:\n\n- For each possible rem, the maximum sum from group1 and group2 is the maximum of s1[x] + s2[y], where x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nWe can compute this for all rem in O(m) time.\n\nHow?\n\nLet me think:\n\nWe can precompute for each possible j (weight), the maximum possible s2[y] where 2y ≤ j, and then for each j, find the maximum s1[x] where x ≤ j - 2y.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can iterate through group2's prefix sum and for each possible y, compute the maximum x for j = 2y + x.\n\nBut this is unclear.\n\nWait, here's another Idea inspired by the fact that group1's items have weight 1:\n\nFor group1, the maximum x for any j is min(j, len(group1)), and the sum is s1[x].\n\nFor group2, for any j, the maximum y is min(j//2, len(group2)), and the sum is s2[y].\n\nBut this approach doesn't consider the possibility that taking fewer y's allows for more x's, leading to a higher total sum.\n\nBut perhaps it's a starting point.\n\nSo, for group1 and group2, the maximum sum for j is s1[min(j, len(g1))] + s2[min(j//2, len(g2))].\n\nBut this isn't correct, as taking fewer y's might allow for more x's, which could give a higher total.\n\nBut perhaps this is a good approximation, and can be computed quickly.\n\nBut again, this isn't the correct approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps this is the way to go. Let's proceed.\n\nCompute for group1 and group2:\n\nFor each j from 0 to m:\n\n   max_group1 = s1[min(j, len(group1))]\n   max_group2 = s2[min(j//2, len(group2))]\n   total = max_group1 + max_group2\n   combined_dp[j] = total\n\nThen, for any rem, the maximum sum from group1 and group2 is combined_dp[rem].\n\nBut is this correct?\n\nNo, because sometimes taking a smaller y allows for a larger x, which may result in a higher total sum.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, this is a good enough approximation.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's see:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=3, m=4\n\nItems:\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\n4 3 → but wait, the third line in the sample input seems to be '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1', but that's unclear. Oh, perhaps the sample input is a bit messy, but according to the output, for m=4, the maximum cost is 3.\n\nWait, perhaps the group1 and group2 approach isn't sufficient.\n\nBut perhaps it's worth trying.\n\nSo, to implement this approach:\n\n- Sort group1 in descending order, compute s1.\n\n- Sort group2 in descending order, compute s2.\n\n- Compute combined_dp[j] = s1[min(j, len(g1))] + s2[min(j//2, len(g2))]\n\nThen, for each z in 0 to z_max, compute rem = m - 3*z. The maximum sum is combined_dp[rem].\n\nThen, the overall maximum is the maximum over all z.\n\nBut does this give the correct answer?\n\nIn the sample input, let's see:\n\nGroup1: items with weight 1.\n\nIn the sample input, the items are:\n\n['1 1', '2 1'] → group",
