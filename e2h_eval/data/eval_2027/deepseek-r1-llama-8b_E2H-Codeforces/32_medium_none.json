    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have an array of integers, and I have to remove exactly one element to minimize the instability of the array. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array after the removal.\n\nHmm, let's think about the approach. So, the goal is to find which element to remove so that the new max and min are as close as possible, thus minimizing their difference.\n\nFirst, I should consider the initial array's max and min. But since we're removing one element, the max or min of the remaining array could change depending on which element is removed.\n\nWait, but for each element, if I remove it, I have to compute the new max and min of the remaining elements. Then calculate the difference and find the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, with n up to 1e5, doing this naively by checking each element and computing max and min each time would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So I need a more efficient way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Maybe I can precompute some information that allows me to quickly determine what happens when any element is removed.\n\nI recall that in such problems, sorting the array can help. Because once the array is sorted, the max and min are at the ends. So perhaps after sorting, I can figure out for each position whether removing that element affects the max or min.\n\nWait, but even after sorting, how do I efficiently find the next max or min when an element is removed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find all possible candidates for the new max and min after removing each element, and see which gives the smallest difference.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the optimal scenario after removing one element is when either the new max is just the second highest, or the new min is just the second lowest. So perhaps the minimal instability comes from either the second max minus the min, or the max minus the second min, whichever is smaller.\n\nWait, but no, because when you remove an element, you might not know whether it's the max or the min that's being removed. For example, if the array has multiple max elements, then removing one doesn't change the max.\n\nSo perhaps the first step is to sort the array. Let's denote the sorted array as s.\n\nThe initial max is s[-1], min is s[0]. The initial instability is s[-1] - s[0].\n\nNow, when we remove an element, the new instability depends on the new max and min.\n\nIf I remove an element that is not the current max or min, then the max remains s[-1], and the min remains s[0]. So the instability remains the same as before. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, no. If the array has other elements, but the max and min are still present. So removing an element that is not the max or min won't change the max or min.\n\nSo in that case, the instability after removal is the same as the original. But if we remove the max, then the new max is the second last element. Similarly, if we remove the min, the new min is the second element.\n\nSo the minimal instability will be the minimum of:\n\n- The original instability (if we remove a non-extremal element)\n- The new instability after removing the max (which is s[-2] - s[0])\n- The new instability after removing the min (which is s[-1] - s[1])\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let's take an example.\n\nSuppose the sorted array is [1,3,3,7]. Original max is 7, min is 1. Instability is 6.\n\nIf we remove 7, the new array is [1,3,3], max is 3, min is 1. Instability is 2.\n\nIf we remove 1, the new array is [3,3,7], max is 7, min is 3. Instability is 4.\n\nIf we remove one of the middle elements, say 3, the array becomes [1,3,7], so instability remains 6.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal instability is achieved by removing the max, giving 2.\n\nAnother example: input is [1, 100000]. The sorted array is [1, 100000]. The original instability is 99999.\n\nIf we remove 1, the new array is [100000], which has no elements? Wait, no, because n is at least 2. Oh, wait, n starts from 2, so when you remove an element, the array has n-1 elements, which is at least 1. So in this case, the new array after removing 1 is [100000], so max and min are the same, instability is 0.\n\nSimilarly, removing 100000 leaves [1], same result.\n\nSo the minimal instability is 0.\n\nSo, in general, the minimal instability is the minimum of:\n\n1. The original instability (only applicable if neither the max nor min are removed)\n2. The instability when the max is removed (s[-2] - s[0])\n3. The instability when the min is removed (s[-1] - s[1])\n\nWait, but wait. What if the array has multiple instances of the max or min?\n\nFor example, consider the array [2,2,3]. Sorted, it's [2,2,3]. Original max is 3, min is 2. Instability is 1.\n\nIf we remove a 2 (the min), the new array is [2,3]. Max is 3, min is 2, instability is 1.\n\nIf we remove 3, the new array is [2,2], instability is 0.\n\nAh, right! So in this case, the minimal instability is 0, achieved by removing the max.\n\nBut according to the earlier logic, when the max is removed, the new max is 2 (the previous second max). So the new instability is 2 - 2 = 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the original instability, then also consider the cases where either the max is removed or the min is removed. Then pick the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nWait, but why not also consider the case where both the max and min are removed? Like in the case of [1,3,3,7], removing the max and the min is not possible because they are different elements. Wait, no, because in the array, there's only one instance of the min and one of the max.\n\nWait, but in the case of [2,2,3], removing the max (3) reduces the array to [2,2], which has min 2, max 2. So the new instability is 0.\n\nSo, the key is that for each possible candidate of the new max and min, we can compute the instability.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the new max and min when any element is removed?\n\nI think that the minimal instability can only be achieved in the following scenarios:\n\n- We remove an element that is not the max or min, leaving the max and min unchanged. So the instability remains the same as the original.\n- We remove the max element, which makes the new max the second largest. So the new instability is (second_max - min).\n- We remove the min element, making the new min the second smallest. So the new instability is (max - second_min).\n\nTherefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between the original instability and the two cases above.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Sort the array.\n2. Compute the original max (s[-1]) and min (s[0]), and their difference (current instability).\n3. Compute the second_max as s[-2].\n4. Compute the second_min as s[1].\n5. The possible candidates for minimal instability are:\n   a. current_instability (if neither max nor min is removed)\n   b. (second_max - s[0])\n   c. (s[-1] - second_min)\n6. The answer is the minimum of these three.\n\nWait, but wait. Suppose that after removing the max, the second_max is s[-2], but the min remains s[0]. So the new instability is s[-2] - s[0].\n\nSimilarly, after removing the min, the new min is s[1], and the max is s[-1], so the new instability is s[-1] - s[1].\n\nBut what if the array has multiple max or min elements? For example, [1,1,2,3]. When we remove a 1 (the min), the new min is still 1 (since there are others). So the new instability is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nBut according to our approach, the second_min is s[1] which is 1, so the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, in the sorted array [1,1,2,3], s[1] is 1, so s[-1] - s[1] is 2, which is correct.\n\nYes, that seems to handle that case.\n\nAnother test case: [5,5,5,5]. The current instability is 0. Removing any element leaves the array with all 5s, so the instability is still 0. So the minimal is 0.\n\nAnother example: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]. After sorting: [1,1,3,4,5,9]. Current instability is 8.\n\nIf we remove the max (9), the new instability is 5-1=4.\n\nIf we remove the min (1), the new min is 1 (since there are duplicates), so instability is 9-1=8.\n\nSo the minimal is 4.\n\nSo according to our approach, we compare 8 (original), 5-1=4, and 9-1=8. So the minimal is 4.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n- Compute current instability.\n- Compute the possible instabilities when removing the max (s[-2] - s[0]).\n- Compute when removing the min (s[-1] - s[1]).\n- The minimal instability is the minimum among current_instability, max_removal, min_removal.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one element in the array after removal? No, because n is at least 2, so after removing one element, n-1 is at least 1.\n\nWait, but in the second example given, when n=2, removing one element leaves one element, so the instability is 0.\n\nIn that case, when we compute s[-2], for n=2, s[-2] is s[0], because s[-1] is the last element. So for the case where we remove the max, the new instability is s[-2] - s[0], which is same as s[0]-s[0]=0. Similarly for the min removal.\n\nSo the approach correctly handles that.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute current instability as s[-1] - s[0].\n\nCompute option1: when removing the max, instability is s[-2] - s[0].\n\nCompute option2: when removing the min, instability is s[-1] - s[1].\n\nThen, the minimal instability is the minimum of current_instability, option1, option2.\n\nWait, but why don't we have to consider other possibilities, like removing other elements that are not max or min? Because those removals don't change the max or min, so the instability remains the same as the current.\n\nThus, the minimal instability is the minimum between the current instability, option1, and option2.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nSort the array.\n\nmin_instability = infinity.\n\ncurrent_max = s[-1]\ncurrent_min = s[0]\ncurrent_diff = current_max - current_min\n\noption1 = s[-2] - s[0]\noption2 = s[-1] - s[1]\n\nmin_instability = min(current_diff, option1, option2)\n\nWait, but what if the array has only two elements? Then s has length 2.\n\nIn that case, s[-2] is s[0], s[-1] is s[1].\n\noption1 is s[0] - s[0] = 0.\n\noption2 is s[1] - s[1] = 0.\n\nSo min_instability is min(current_diff, 0, 0) → 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4]. Current_diff is 3.\n\noption1: 3-1=2.\n\noption2: 4-2=2.\n\nSo the minimal is 2.\n\nWhich is correct because, for example, removing 4 gives [1,2,3], instability 2.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nSo, now, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array, sort it.\n\nIf n is 1, but wait n is at least 2, so no.\n\nCompute current_diff.\n\nCompute option1 = s[-2] - s[0] if n >=2 else ... but n is at least 2.\n\nCompute option2 = s[-1] - s[1] if n >=2.\n\nWait, but what if n is 2? Then s[1] is the last element, and s[-1] is same as s[1]. So option2 is s[-1] - s[1] = 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\ncurrent_max = a[-1]\ncurrent_min = a[0]\ncurrent_diff = current_max - current_min\n\noption1 = a[-2] - a[0]\noption2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\nmin_diff = min(current_diff, option1, option2)\n\nprint(min_diff)\n\nWait, but wait. What if n is larger than 2, but there are multiple elements between min and max? For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 10]. The current_diff is 9.\n\nIf we remove 10, the new max is 4, min is 1, so option1 is 4-1=3.\n\nIf we remove 1, the new min is 2, max is 10, so option2 is 10-2=8.\n\nSo the minimal is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: [5, 5, 5, 5]. All elements are 5.\n\ncurrent_diff is 0.\n\noption1: 5-5=0.\n\noption2:5-5=0.\n\nSo the minimal is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nWait, but what about when the array has multiple minima or maxima beyond the first two?\n\nLike [1,1,2,2,3]. Sorted.\n\ncurrent_diff is 2.\n\noption1: 2-1=1.\n\noption2:3-1=2.\n\nSo the minimal is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBecause if you remove the max (3), the new max is 2, min is 1. So instability is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the plan is to read the array, sort it, compute the current difference, then compute the options of removing the max or min, and choose the minimal among all.\n\nSo, the Python code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list, convert to integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute current_diff = a[-1] - a[0].\n\nCompute option1 = a[-2] - a[0].\n\nCompute option2 = a[-1] - a[1].\n\nThe minimal is the minimum of current_diff, option1, option2.\n\nPrint that minimal value.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, testing the examples.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted [1,3,3,7]\n\ncurrent_diff is 6.\n\noption1 is 3-1=2.\n\noption2 is 7-3=4.\n\nMinimum is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]\n\ncurrent_diff is 99999.\n\noption1: 1-1=0.\n\noption2: 100000 -1=99999.\n\nSo minimal is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nThus, the solution is to implement this logic.\n",
