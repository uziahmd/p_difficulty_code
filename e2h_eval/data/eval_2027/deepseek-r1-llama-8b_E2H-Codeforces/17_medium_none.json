He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether it's a prefix or suffix of the original string s. Each string is either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S), and I need to output a string of 'P's and 'S's in the order of the input.\n\nHmm, the input has 2n-2 strings, each of which is either a prefix or a suffix of length 1 to n-1. The goal is to assign each one as P or S correctly.\n\nWait, but how? Because some prefixes might overlap with suffixes, right? So I need to find a way to determine which are prefixes and which are suffixes based on the possible string s.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Maybe the key is to figure out the possible candidates for the original string s, then check for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut since the number of possible s is potentially huge, that's not feasible directly. So I need another way.\n\nWait, the problem says that there exists at least one possible string s that fits all the given prefixes and suffixes. So perhaps I can find s by considering the constraints provided by the input.\n\nEach string in the input must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. But the tricky part is that for each length l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings: one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo for each length l, we have two options: one is a prefix candidate and the other is a suffix candidate.\n\nBut wait, no. Because for a given l, say l=2, there are two strings: one could be a prefix and the other a suffix. But that's only if l < n, because for l = n, it's the full string.\n\nWait, the problem states that for each l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. These are the improper prefixes and suffixes. So for each l, two strings: one is a prefix, the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, for each length l, let's say the two strings are A and B. One of them is a prefix of s, and the other is a suffix. But how do I know which is which?\n\nWait, no. For each l, one is a prefix, the other is a suffix. So for each l, exactly two possibilities. But when building s, the prefixes must form a chain where each longer prefix starts with the previous. Similarly for the suffixes.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to model this is to construct s step by step, ensuring that for each position, the current character is consistent with the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAnother idea: the original string s must have the property that for every proper prefix p of s, the next character after p is the same as the last character of p. Similarly, for every proper suffix q, the previous character before q is the same as the first character of q.\n\nWait, maybe not exactly. Let me think differently.\n\nThe prefixes form a chain. So, for example, the prefix of length l must be equal to the prefix of length l-1 followed by a new character. So the entire prefix is built by adding one character at a time.\n\nSimilarly, the suffixes form a chain. So, the suffix of length l must be equal to the suffix of length l+1 without the last character. Wait, no. Wait, the suffix of length l is a substring of s ending at position l. So for l+1, it's the next suffix. So for example, if s is 'abcde', the suffixes are 'e', 'de', 'cde', 'bcde', 'abcde'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, for l=1, the suffix is 'e'; for l=2, it's 'de'; l=3, 'cde'; etc. So each suffix of length l is obtained by taking the suffix of length l+1 and removing the first character.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the suffix of length l is the last l characters of s. So the suffix of length l is the same as the suffix of length l+1, but shifted left by one character. So for example, if s is 'abcd', then the suffixes are:\n\nl=1: d\n\nl=2: cd\n\nl=3: bcd\n\nl=4: abcd (but that's the full string, which isn't considered here).\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1, except for the first character. So the suffix of l is equal to the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nWait, that suggests that the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1, but starting from the second character of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for example, if the suffix of l+1 is 'xyz', then the suffix of l is 'yz'.\n\nSo, the suffixes form a chain where each suffix of length l is a suffix of length l+1, but with the first character removed.\n\nWait, but this is only true for the proper suffixes, not including the full string.\n\nSo, the approach is to find s such that:\n\n- All the input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\n- For each length l, exactly one of the two input strings for that l is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n1. Group the input strings by their lengths. For each l, collect the two strings.\n\n2. For each l, decide which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n3. Once the prefixes and suffixes are determined for each l, try to reconstruct s.\n\nBut the challenge is to find the correct assignment of P and S for each string such that the constructed s is consistent.\n\nHmm. Another thought: the correct s can be uniquely determined by the way the prefixes and suffixes overlap.\n\nFor example, for the smallest l, like l=1, the prefix is the first character, and the suffix is the last character.\n\nWait, but the two strings for l=1 could be any two characters. How do we know which is the first and which is the last?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can build s incrementally.\n\nLet me outline an algorithm:\n\nWe can start by determining the first character and the last character of s.\n\nFor l=1, the two strings are A and B. One of them is the first character (prefix), the other is the last character (suffix). So, for example, if A is the first character, then the suffix is B, which is a single character.\n\nWait, but how do I know which one is the first and which is the suffix?\n\nHmm, maybe I can look for the next l to see how the prefixes and suffixes connect.\n\nFor l=2, the two strings are C and D. One is the prefix of length 2, which is the first two characters of s. The other is the suffix of length 2, which is the last two characters.\n\nSo, the prefix of length 2 should start with the prefix of length 1. Similarly, the suffix of length 2 ends with the suffix of length 1.\n\nSo, for each l, the prefix of l is the prefix of l-1 plus a new character. The suffix of l is the suffix of l-1, but shifted by one character (wait, no— the suffix of l is the last l characters of s. So the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1, but with the first character removed.)\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nThe prefixes form a sequence where each is an extension of the previous. So, the prefix of length 2 is the prefix of length 1 followed by a character.\n\nSimilarly, the suffixes form a sequence where each is an extension of the next longer suffix. So, the suffix of length l is the last l characters of s, which is the suffix of l+1 minus the first character.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of l is the last l characters, and the suffix of l+1 is the last l+1. So, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 minus the first character of the suffix of l+1.\n\nWait, yes. So for example, if the suffix of l+1 is \"xyz\", then the suffix of l is \"yz\".\n\nSo, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1, but without the first character.\n\nSo, the suffixes form a chain where each is shorter than the next by one character.\n\nSo, the suffixes are ordered in reverse: the longer ones come first.\n\nNow, for the prefixes, they form a chain where each is longer than the previous by one character. So the prefix of length 1 is the first character, prefix of 2 is prefix of 1 followed by another character, etc.\n\nSo, the key idea is that the correct s can be built by combining the prefixes and suffixes in such a way that for each l, the prefix of l is the prefix of l-1 plus a new character, and the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 minus the first character.\n\nSo, perhaps the process is:\n\n- For each l from 1 to n-1, determine which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce that is done, the full string can be reconstructed.\n\nBut how to determine which is which for each l?\n\nHmm. Let's consider that for l=1, the two strings are A and B. One is the first character, the other is the last.\n\nSuppose we choose A as the prefix, then the suffix is B. Then, for l=2, the two strings are C and D. One of them must be the prefix (first two chars), which starts with A. The other is the suffix (last two chars), which ends with B.\n\nSo, for l=2, the prefix must be A followed by some char c. So, among C and D, one must be equal to A + c. The other must be the suffix, which is the last two chars, ending with B.\n\nWait, but how do I know which is the suffix? Because the suffix of l=2 is the last two chars, which is the same as the suffix of l=3 minus the first char. But since I don't know l=3, this seems circular.\n\nAlternative approach: Try to find a possible s by building it from the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nStart with the first character, which is the prefix of length 1. Then, for each l, the prefix of l is the previous prefix plus a new character. So, s[0..l-1] is the prefix of l.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l is s[l..n-1], which is the last l characters.\n\nNow, the suffix of l is also equal to the suffix of l+1, but with the first character removed.\n\nSo, s[l..n-1] = suffix_l\n\ns[l+1..n-1] = suffix_{l+1}\n\nThus, suffix_l = s[l] + suffix_{l+1}\n\nSo, for example, suffix_3 = s[3] + suffix_4.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, for any l, the suffix of l can be obtained by taking the suffix of l+1 and removing its first character.\n\nThis gives us a way to reconstruct s.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each l, determine which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\n2. Use the suffix chain to build s.\n\n3. Once s is built, verify that all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut how to assign P/S for each string?\n\nHmm, perhaps the way is to:\n\n- For each l, the two strings for that l are the prefix and the suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, pick which string is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nOnce that's done, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 minus the first character.\n\nWait, but how do I know which string is which for each l.\n\nAnother thought: For each l, the suffix of l is a superstring of the suffix of l+1, but missing the first character.\n\nSo, if I have the suffix of l+1, then the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 minus the first character.\n\nSo, the suffix strings must form a chain where each is the previous one with the first character added.\n\nWait, no. Because for l+1, the suffix is longer than l's. So, for example, if suffix_3 is 'xyz', then suffix_2 is 'yz'.\n\nSo, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\nSo, for l=1, the suffix is the last character.\n\nFor l=2, the suffix is the last two, which is the last three minus the first.\n\nSo, the suffix of l is s[l] followed by the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, to find s, we can start from the largest l (n-1) and work backwards.\n\nWait, but I don't know which is the suffix and which is the prefix for each l.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can build s from the prefixes and suffixes.\n\nLet me think about building s step by step.\n\nSuppose I have the prefix of length l, which is p_l, and the suffix of length l is s_l.\n\nFor l=1, p_1 is the first character, s_1 is the last character.\n\nFor l=2, p_2 = p_1 + c, where c is the next character.\n\nSimilarly, s_2 is the last two characters, which is the last character of s_1 followed by the next one.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, s can be built using the suffix chain.\n\nFor example, suppose we have the suffix of l=2 as 'ab', then the suffix of l=3 is 'cab' (if s is 'xabz', then suffix_3 is 'bz')— no, wait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the suffix of l is the last l characters of s. So, for l=2, the suffix is s[-2:].\n\nFor l=3, it's s[-3:].\n\nSo, the suffix of l is equal to the suffix of l+1, but with the first character removed.\n\nSo, s[-l:] = s[-(l+1):][1:]\n\nSo, for example, s[-3:] = s[-4:][1:].\n\nWait, no. Because s[-3:] is the last three characters. s[-4:] is the last four, which includes s[-3:]. So s[-4:][1:] would be s[-4], s[-3], s[-2], etc., but that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the indices wrong.\n\nLet me think: for a string s of length n.\n\nThe suffix of length l is s[n-l : n].\n\nThe suffix of length l+1 is s[n-(l+1) : n].\n\nSo, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1, but with the first (n - (l+1) + 1) = n - l characters. Wait, no.\n\nWait, the suffix of l+1 is s[-(l+1):], which is s[n - (l+1):n].\n\nThe suffix of l is s[-l:], which is s[n - l :n].\n\nSo, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1, but with the first (n - (l+1)) characters removed? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the suffix of l is equal to the suffix of l+1, but without the first character of the suffix of l+1.\n\nBecause:\n\nsuff_l = suff_{l+1}[1:]\n\nYes, because:\n\nsuff_{l+1} = s[- (l+1):]\n\nsuff_l = s[- l: ] = suff_{l+1}[1: ]\n\nYes! That's correct.\n\nSo, for example, if suff_3 is \"xyz\", then suff_2 is \"yz\", and suff_1 is \"z\".\n\nSo, the suffixes form a chain where each is the next one without the first character.\n\nSo, the suffixes can be used to build the string s from the end towards the beginning.\n\nSo, if I can determine the suffix for each l, I can build s.\n\nBut how to determine which of the two strings for each l is the suffix.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to:\n\n- For each l, the two strings are the prefix and the suffix.\n\n- So, for each l, one is the prefix, the other is the suffix.\n\nOnce that's determined, the suffix can be used to build s.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each l, from 1 to n-1, we have two strings: A and B.\n\n2. We need to decide whether A is the prefix and B is the suffix, or vice versa.\n\n3. Once assigned, the suffix of l is known.\n\n4. Using the suffix chain, we can reconstruct s.\n\nBut how to decide which is which for each l.\n\nPerhaps the way is to find a s that satisfies all the constraints.\n\nAn alternative idea: For each possible assignment of P/S for the first few l's, try to build s and see if it works.\n\nBut since n can be up to 100, this approach may not be efficient enough.\n\nWait, but n is up to 100, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the assignment can be made based on overlapping between the strings.\n\nSo, for l=1, the two strings are a and b. One is the first character (prefix) and the other is the last (suffix).\n\nThen, for l=2, the two strings are c and d. One must be the prefix (p_2) which is p_1 followed by a character, and the other is the suffix (s_2) which is the last two characters, which is s_1 followed by another character.\n\nWait, but how to determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix for l=2.\n\nAnother approach is to note that the suffix of l must be a superstring of the suffix of l+1, but missing the first character.\n\nSo, for example, if the suffix of l+1 is 'xyz', then the suffix of l is 'yz'.\n\nSo, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix is the next longer suffix without the first character.\n\nThis suggests that the suffixes form a chain where each is shorter by one character, and the next longer suffix is the previous suffix with a character added at the beginning.\n\nSo, for example, if the suffix of l=3 is 'abc', then the suffix of l=4 would be 'xabc' (since the suffix of l=4 is the last four characters, which is x followed by 'abc').\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of l=4 is the last four characters. If the suffix of l=3 is 'abc', then the suffix of l=4 is 'dabc' (assuming s is 'abcd...'), but that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose s is 'abcde'.\n\nThen, the suffixes are:\n\nl=1: 'e'\n\nl=2: 'de'\n\nl=3: 'cde'\n\nl=4: 'bcde'\n\nl=5: 'abcde' (but that's the full string, which is not considered here)\n\nSo, for l=2, the suffix is 'de', which is the suffix of l=1 (e) with 'd' added before it.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of l=2 is the last two characters, which is 'de'. The suffix of l=3 is 'cde', which is 'd' followed by 'e' and adding 'c' at the front? No, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm thinking in the wrong direction. Let's think about the suffix chain.\n\nIn the example, the suffixes are:\n\nl=1: e\n\nl=2: de\n\nl=3: cde\n\nl=4: bcde\n\nSo, the suffix of l=1 is e.\n\nThe suffix of l=2 is de, which is the suffix of l=1 with 'd' prepended.\n\nSimilarly, the suffix of l=3 is cde, which is the suffix of l=2 with 'c' prepended.\n\nThe suffix of l=4 is bcde, which is the suffix of l=3 with 'b' prepended.\n\nSo, in general, the suffix of l is the suffix of l-1 with a character added at the beginning.\n\nSo, for l=2: suffix is 'd' + suffix of l=1.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l is the suffix of l-1 with a new character added at the beginning.\n\nTherefore, the suffixes form a chain where each is the previous one with a new character added at the start.\n\nSo, if I have the suffix of l=1, I can build the suffixes for higher l by adding characters at the front.\n\nSimilarly, the prefixes are built by adding characters at the end.\n\nSo, knowing the suffix of l=1 allows me to build the suffixes for larger l.\n\nBut how does this help me in reconstructing s?\n\nWell, once I have all the suffixes, I can reconstruct s.\n\nFor example, if the suffix of l=n-1 is 'bcde', then the suffix of l=n is 'abcde'.\n\nSo, s is 'abcde'.\n\nWait, but in our case, n is the length of s, and the suffixes are up to l=n-1.\n\nSo, the suffix of l=n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s.\n\nSo, if I can find the suffix of l=n-1, I can get the last n-1 characters, and then the first character is the prefix of l=1.\n\nWait, no. Because the prefix of l=1 is the first character, which is the first character of s.\n\nSo, putting it all together, s is the prefix of l=1 followed by the suffix of l=n-1.\n\nWait, no. Because the suffix of l=n-1 is the last n-1 characters, and the prefix of l=1 is the first character.\n\nSo, s is the prefix of l=1 followed by the suffix of l=n-1.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the entire s is p_1 + s_{n-1}.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nYes, because p_1 is s[0], and s_{n-1} is s[1..n-1].\n\nSo, s = p_1 + s_{n-1}.\n\nSo, for example, in the earlier example where s is 'abcde':\n\np_1 is 'a'.\n\ns_{n-1} is 'bcde'.\n\nSo, s = 'a' + 'bcde' = 'abcde'.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Determine for each l, which string is the suffix and which is the prefix.\n\n2. Once the suffixes are determined for all l, the suffix of l=1 is the last character of s.\n\n3. The suffix of l=2 is the last two characters, which is the suffix of l=1 with a character added at the beginning.\n\n4. Continue building the suffix chain until l = n-1.\n\n5. The suffix of l=1 is the last character of s, and the prefix of l=1 is the first character.\n\n6. So, s can be constructed as prefix_1 + suffix_{n-1}.\n\nOnce s is built, we can assign each input string as P or S.\n\nBut the main issue is step 1: determining for each l, which string is the suffix and which is the prefix.\n\nHow to do that.\n\nLet me think about how the suffixes and prefixes relate.\n\nFor each l, the suffix of l is the last l characters of s, which is equal to the suffix of l+1 minus the first character.\n\nWait, no, as previously discussed, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\nWait, no, because the suffix of l is the last l characters, which is the suffix of l+1, but without the first character.\n\nSo, for example, if the suffix of l+1 is 'abcde', then the suffix of l is 'bcde'.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the suffix of l+1 is the last l+1 characters, which is 'abcde' (assuming l+1=5). The suffix of l is the last l=4 characters, which is 'bcde'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1, but without the first character.\n\nSo, the suffix of l can be obtained by taking the suffix of l+1 and removing the first character.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nSo, for the input, for each l, the two strings are the two possible candidates for prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, for each l, among the two strings, one is the prefix (p_l) and the other is the suffix (s_l).\n\nNow, the suffix of l is equal to s_l.\n\nAnd the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nBut we don't know s_{l+1}, because it's another string in the input.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find the s_{l+1} by looking at the possible candidates.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n- Start from l = n-1.\n\n- The suffix of l = n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s.\n\n- So, for l = n-1, the two strings are A and B. One is the suffix of l = n-1, which is s_{n-1}.\n\n- Then, the suffix of l = n-2 is obtained by taking s_{n-1} and removing the first character.\n\nSo, s_{n-2} = s_{n-1}[1:].\n\nBut in the input, for l = n-2, the two strings are C and D. One of them must be s_{n-2}, and the other must be s_{n-1}.\n\nWait, no. Because for l = n-2, the suffix is s_{n-2}, and the other string is the prefix.\n\nWait, no. Because for each l, the two strings are the prefix and the suffix. So for l = n-2, the two strings are the prefix of l = n-2 (p_{n-2}) and the suffix of l = n-2 (s_{n-2}).\n\nBut s_{n-2} is the last n-2 characters of s, which is equal to s_{n-1}[1:].\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the two strings are p_{n-2} and s_{n-2}.\n\nBut how to find which is which.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can build the suffix chain starting from the longest l (l = n-1) and moving backwards.\n\nSo, for l = n-1:\n\nThe two strings are A and B. One is s_{n-1}, the other is p_{n-1}.\n\nBut how to know which is which.\n\nWait, the suffix of l = n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s. The prefix of l = n-1 is the first n-1 characters of s.\n\nSo, the prefix of l = n-1 is the first n-1 characters, and the suffix of l = n-1 is the last n-1.\n\nThese two may be the same or different.\n\nWait, for example, if s is 'aaaaa', then the prefix of l=4 is 'aaaa', and the suffix is also 'aaaa'.\n\nSo, for that l, the two strings are the same, but one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's stated that for each l, there are exactly two strings. So, in cases where the prefix and suffix are the same, but in the input, two identical strings exist for that l.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input contains exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1.\n\nSo, for each l, the two strings may be the same or different.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the two strings are s_{n-1} and p_{n-1}.\n\nBut how to determine which is which.\n\nWait, perhaps for l = n-1, the suffix is s_{n-1}, and the prefix is p_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the two strings for l = n-1 are s_{n-1} and p_{n-1}.\n\nBut without knowing s, it's impossible to tell.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to try all possible combinations for the first l, and then see if the rest can be built consistently.\n\nBut for n up to 100, trying all possibilities for each l is computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps for each l, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 with the first character removed.\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the suffix of l is s_{n-2} = s_{n-1}[1:].\n\nSo, for l = n-2, among the two strings, one must be s_{n-2}, which is s_{n-1}[1:].\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the two strings are A and B. One of them is s_{n-2}, which is s_{n-1}[1:].\n\nBut s_{n-1} is one of the two strings for l = n-1.\n\nSo, for l = n-2, let's say the two strings are X and Y.\n\nWe can check if X[1:] == Y, or Y[1:] == X.\n\nWait, no, because s_{n-2} = s_{n-1}[1:].\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the two strings must include s_{n-2} and s_{n-1}.\n\nBecause for l = n-2, the two strings are the prefix and suffix. So, one is p_{n-2}, the other is s_{n-2}.\n\nBut s_{n-2} is s_{n-1}[1:].\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the two strings are X and Y. One is s_{n-2}, the other is p_{n-2}.\n\nBut s_{n-2} is s_{n-1}[1:], which is the other string for l = n-1.\n\nSo, if for l = n-1, the two strings are A and B, then for l = n-2, one of the strings must be A[1:] or B[1:].\n\nSo, the process can be:\n\n- For l = n-1, choose which string is s_{n-1}.\n\n- Then, for l = n-2, choose which string is s_{n-2} = s_{n-1}[1:], and the other is p_{n-2}.\n\nBut how to choose which is s_{n-1} for l = n-1.\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the first character, the suffix of l is a substring of the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l is a substring of the suffix of l+1, specifically, it's the suffix of l+1 without the first character.\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the suffix is s_{n-2} = s_{n-1}[1:].\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix is a suffix of the suffix for l+1.\n\nThus, for each l, the suffix string must be a substring of the suffix of l+1, starting from index 1.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix string can be derived from the suffix of l+1.\n\nSo, for l = n-1, the suffix is s_{n-1}.\n\nFor l = n-2, the suffix is s_{n-1}[1:].\n\nFor l = n-3, the suffix is s_{n-2}[1:] = s_{n-1}[2:].\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThus, for each l, the suffix of l is s_{l} = s_{l+1}[1:].\n\nSo, the suffixes form a chain where each is the next one without the first character.\n\nSo, to find the suffixes, we can start from l = n-1, and then build back to l=1.\n\nBut the problem is that for each l, we have two possible candidates for the suffix and prefix.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to:\n\n1. For each l from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   a. For the current l, the suffix is the next suffix (for l+1) with the first character removed.\n\n   b. Among the two strings for l, one must be the suffix (s_l), and the other is the prefix (p_l).\n\n   c. So, for each l, check if one of the two strings is the suffix of the next l.\n\n   d. If so, assign that string as s_l, and the other as p_l.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's take an example.\n\nConsider the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nba\na\nabab\na\naba\nbaba\nab\naba\n\nWait, the actual input is more complicated. But in the sample explanation, the string is 'ababa'.\n\nLet me see.\n\nFor l=4 (n-1=5-1=4), the two strings are 'abab' and 'aba'.\n\nWait, no, wait the input lines are:\n\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba']\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to parse the input correctly.\n\nBut in any case, for l=4, the two strings are 'abab' and 'aba'.\n\nWhich one is the suffix and which is the prefix.\n\nIn the sample, the correct string is 'ababa'.\n\nSo, for l=4, the suffix is 'abab' (last four characters of 'ababa').\n\nThe prefix of l=4 is 'abab' (the first four characters of 'ababa').\n\nWait, no. 'ababa' has first four 'abab' and last four 'baba'? Or wait, the last four is 'baba'?\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, 'ababa' is 5 letters: positions 0-4.\n\nThe last four letters are positions 1-4: 'baba'.\n\nAh, so for l=4, the suffix is 'baba'.\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, for l=4, the two strings are 'abab' and 'aba'.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nIn any case, perhaps the way is to:\n\n- For each l, the two strings are the prefix and the suffix.\n\n- For l= n-1, the two strings are the prefix (first n-1) and suffix (last n-1).\n\nSo, for l = n-1, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nBut how to determine which is which.\n\nWait, perhaps the suffix of l = n-1 is the same as the prefix of l = n-1 if s is a palindrome.\n\nBut that's not necessarily the case.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 without the first character, the suffix of l is a substring of the suffix of l+1, starting at position 1.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l is a suffix of the suffix of l+1, starting at position 1.\n\nSo, for l = n-2, the suffix of l is the suffix of l+1 (which is n-1) starting at position 1.\n\nSo, for each l, the suffix of l can be found by taking the suffix of l+1 and slicing off the first character.\n\nThus, the suffix of l is s_{l+1}[1:].\n\nSo, for the input strings, for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, for l, the suffix string must be equal to s_{l+1}[1:].\n\nThus, for each l, among the two strings, one must be equal to s_{l+1}[1:], which is the suffix of l.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Assign s_{n-1} as one of the two strings for l = n-1.\n\n2. For l = n-2, check if one of the two strings is equal to s_{n-1}[1:].\n\n3. Assign s_{n-2} as that string, and the other string as p_{n-2}.\n\n4. Repeat this process for l = n-3, n-4, ..., down to 1.\n\nBut how to choose which string is s_{n-1}.\n\nSo, the problem is that for l = n-1, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of s of length n-1.\n\nSo, one is p_{n-1}, the other is s_{n-1}.\n\nBut without knowing s, it's hard to tell which is which.\n\nSo, perhaps we can try both possibilities and see which leads to a valid s.\n\nBut for n=100, trying all possibilities for each l could be computationally expensive.\n\nBut given that n is up to 100, and for each l, there are two possibilities, the total number of possibilities is 2^{n-1}, which is 2^99, which is way too big.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Find the correct s by using the fact that the prefix and suffix chains must be compatible.\n\nFor example:\n\n- The prefix of l must be equal to the prefix of l-1 plus a new character.\n\nSo, for each l",

By iterating from the longest suffix down to the shortest, we ensure that each suffix is correctly derived from the next longer suffix. Similarly, prefixes are built by extending the previous prefix with new characters. Once `s` is reconstructed, each input string is classified as either a prefix or suffix based on its presence in `s`. This approach efficiently determines the correct classification for each string, ensuring the solution is both accurate and optimal.",
