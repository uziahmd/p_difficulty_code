Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x, and they don't overlap in time. Also, among all possible pairs, I need to find the one with the minimal total cost. If there are no such pairs, I should return -1.\n\nHmm. So each voucher has a start day li, end day ri, and cost costi. The duration is ri - li + 1.\n\nI need to select two vouchers, say i and j (i != j), where either ri < lj or rj < li. So they can't overlap at all. Also, the sum of their durations must be exactly x.\n\nSo the plan is: for all possible pairs of vouchers, check if their durations sum to x, and they don't overlap. Among those pairs, find the one with the smallest total cost.\n\nBut wait, n can be up to 2e5, so checking all O(n^2) pairs is impossible because that would be 4e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the constraints:\n\nEach voucher's duration is d1 = r1 - l1 + 1, d2 = r2 - l2 + 1. We need d1 + d2 = x.\n\nAlso, the vouchers must not overlap. So the end of one is before the start of the other.\n\nSo for each voucher, I can precompute its duration and see what kind of other voucher would complement it to sum x.\n\nFor example, if a voucher has duration d, then the other must have duration x - d. So for each voucher, I can look for another voucher with duration x - d and non-overlapping.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find such vouchers?\n\nAn alternative approach is to group the vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we can keep track of all vouchers with that duration.\n\nThen, for each voucher i with duration d, we can look into the group for duration x - d and find all vouchers j that don't overlap with i and have the minimal cost.\n\nWait, but even within a group, finding non-overlapping vouchers could take some time. But perhaps we can structure the data in a way that allows efficient queries.\n\nAnother idea: for each voucher, find all possible vouchers that have duration x - d and whose time ranges do not overlap with it. Then, among these, find the one with the minimal cost and add it to the current cost.\n\nBut again, doing this for every voucher could be expensive unless optimized.\n\nWait, perhaps we can represent the vouchers in a sorted order, allowing us to quickly find compatible vouchers.\n\nLet me consider the following steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers, compute their durations, and group them by duration.\n\n2. For each voucher i with duration d_i, the required duration for the other voucher is x - d_i. We need to find a voucher j with duration (x - d_i) that doesn't overlap with i.\n\n3. For each i, we can query the group of x - d_i vouchers, and among those that don't overlap, find the one with the minimal cost.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each i, find the minimal cost j in the group x - d_i where j starts after i ends, or ends before i starts.\n\nNow, the question is, how to efficiently find such j's.\n\nOne approach is to, for each duration group, sort the vouchers in a certain way to allow quick querying.\n\nWait, let's think about the time intervals. For a voucher j to be non-overlapping with i, either j's end <= i's start, or j's start >= i's end.\n\nSo for each voucher i, we can have two cases:\n\n- Find vouchers j where j.end <= i.start: these are vouchers that end before i starts.\n\n- Find vouchers j where j.start >= i.end: these are vouchers that start after i ends.\n\nSo for each i, I need to look into the group for x - d_i and find the minimal cost voucher in either of these two groups.\n\nBut how do I represent these groups so that I can query them quickly?\n\nPerhaps, for each duration group, we can keep two sorted lists: one sorted by end time, and another sorted by start time.\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, for each duration d, we can have a list of vouchers, and for each voucher in this list, we can have their end times and start times stored in a way that allows us to perform binary searches.\n\nFor example, for the group of vouchers with duration x - d_i, we can create a list of their end times, sorted. Then, for a given i, the condition j.end <= i.start can be checked via binary search.\n\nSimilarly, for the condition j.start >= i.end, perhaps we can have a list of j's start times sorted, and find the first j.start that is >= i.end. But wait, that's not sufficient because there might be multiple j's that satisfy this, and we need the one with the minimal cost.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to pre-sort the vouchers in each group by their end times, and for each, keep track of the minimal cost up to that end time.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nFor each group d, we can pre-process the vouchers in a way that for any query, we can quickly find the minimal cost voucher that ends before a certain time, or starts after a certain time.\n\nSo, for each group d, let's have two separate sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time: for each voucher in this group, when we process a voucher i, we can find all vouchers j in this group where j.end <= i.start. Among these, we want the one with the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers j where j.start >= i.end, we can find all vouchers in this group and find the minimal cost.\n\nTo handle this efficiently, perhaps for each group, we can maintain a prefix structure where for each end time, we know the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nWait, for the first case, j.end <= i.start:\n\nIf the group's vouchers are sorted by their end time, then for i's start time s_i, all j's with end <= s_i are a prefix of this sorted list. So, for the group, if we also keep track of the minimal cost in the prefix, then for a given s_i, we can binary search the maximum end time <= s_i, and then get the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case, j.start >= i.end: we can have the group's vouchers sorted by their start time, and for a given e_i, find the first j.start >= e_i, and then among all such j's, find the one with minimal cost.\n\nWait, but for the second case, the j's that start after e_i may not be contiguous. So perhaps, for each group, we can have the vouchers sorted by start time, and for each position, we can have the minimal cost from that position onwards.\n\nWait, perhaps for the second case, after sorting the vouchers by start time, we can compute a suffix minimum array. So for each voucher j in the group, the suffix_min[j] will store the minimal cost from j to the end of the list. Then, when processing a voucher i, we can find the first voucher j in the group where j.start >= i.end, and then look up the suffix_min array starting from that index to find the minimal cost.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each voucher, compute its duration d.\n\n- Group the vouchers into a dictionary, where the key is d, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\n- For each group, pre-process two structures:\n\n   a. Sorted by end time, and for each position, the minimal cost up to that point (prefix min).\n\n   b. Sorted by start time, and for each position, the minimal cost from that position onwards (suffix min).\n\nWait, but for each group, we can pre-sort the vouchers in both ways, and precompute the prefix and suffix minima.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher i:\n\n- Compute required duration d_j = x - d_i.\n\n- Check if d_j exists in the group map.\n\n   - If not, continue.\n\n- Else, for the group d_j, we need to find vouchers j that are compatible with i.\n\n   So, first, for j.end <= i.start: use the end-sorted list of d_j group.\n\n      - Binary search to find the largest end <= i.start.\n\n      - Then, in the prefix min array, get the minimal cost up to that index.\n\n   Second, for j.start >= i.end: use the start-sorted list of d_j group.\n\n      - Binary search to find the first start >= i.end.\n\n      - Then, in the suffix min array, get the minimal cost from that index onwards.\n\n   Take the minimal between these two options (if any exist) and add to i's cost, keeping track of the global minimum.\n\nSo, to implement this, I'll need to:\n\n1. Read all the vouchers, compute their durations.\n\n2. Group them into a dictionary, where each key is a duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\n3. For each group, process the vouchers as follows:\n\n   a. Sort the group by end time. Then compute a prefix_min array, where prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost from 0 to k.\n\n   b. Sort the group by start time. Then compute a suffix_min array, where suffix_min[k] is the minimal cost from k to the end.\n\n4. Initialize the answer as infinity.\n\n5. For each voucher i in the original list:\n\n   a. Compute d_j = x - d_i.\n\n   b. If d_j is not present in the group map, skip.\n\n   c. Else, for the group d_j:\n\n      i. Use the end-sorted list and prefix_min to find the minimal cost j where j.end <= i.start.\n\n         - Binary search in the end_sorted list to find the largest end <= i.start.\n\n         - If found, get the minimal cost up to that index using prefix_min.\n\n      ii. Use the start-sorted list and suffix_min to find the minimal cost j where j.start >= i.end.\n\n         - Binary search in the start_sorted list to find the first start >= i.end.\n\n         - If found, get the minimal cost from that index onwards using suffix_min.\n\n      iii. Take the minimal of the two found values, if any.\n\n   d. Update the global answer if the sum is smaller than the current minimum.\n\n6. After processing all vouchers, if the global answer is still infinity, output -1. Otherwise, output the minimum.\n\nWait, but how do I handle the binary searches correctly?\n\nFor example, for the end-sorted list, for a given s_i, I need to find the rightmost j where j.end <= s_i. That can be found using bisect_right.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can help with this.\n\nSimilarly, for the start-sorted list, I need to find the leftmost j where j.start >= e_i. Using bisect_left.\n\nSo, for each group, the end_sorted list is a list of tuples (end, cost). Wait, no, because when sorted by end, we can just extract the end times for binary searching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to have for each group d:\n\n- end_list: a list of end times, sorted.\n\n- end_prefix_min: a list where end_prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost among the first i+1 elements (from 0 to i).\n\n- start_list: a list of start times, sorted.\n\n- start_suffix_min: a list where start_suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost from i to the end.\n\nSo for the end case:\n\nWhen we have i.start, we can binary search in end_list to find the index where end <= s_i.\n\nSuppose the index is pos, meaning all elements up to pos have end <= s_i.\n\nIf pos is -1, then no j satisfies j.end <= s_i.\n\nOtherwise, the minimal cost is end_prefix_min[pos].\n\nFor the start case:\n\nWe need j.start >= e_i.\n\nWe can binary search in start_list for the first element >= e_i. Suppose the index is pos.\n\nIf pos is len(start_list), then no j satisfies.\n\nElse, the minimal cost is start_suffix_min[pos].\n\nSo, for each group, during preprocessing:\n\nSort the group by end, and for each index, keep track of the minimal cost up to that index.\n\nSort the group by start, and for each index, keep track of the minimal cost from that index to the end.\n\nSo, for the end_sorted list:\n\nAfter sorting, for each i from 0 to len(end_list)-1:\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_list[i][1])\n\nwhere end_list[i] is (end_time, cost).\n\nSimilarly, for the start_sorted list:\n\nstart_list[i] is (start_time, cost)\n\nfor i from len(start_list)-1 down to 0:\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], start_list[i][1])\n\nNow, implementing this in code:\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is l, r, c. Compute duration d = r - l + 1.\n\nStore all vouchers in a list.\n\nCreate a groups dictionary, where keys are durations, and values are lists of (l, r, c).\n\nFor each group in groups.values():\n\n   Create end_list: sorted by end time.\n\n   Create end_prefix_min: for each position, the min cost up to that point.\n\n   Create start_list: sorted by start time.\n\n   Create start_suffix_min: for each position, the min cost from that position onwards.\n\nOnce all groups are processed, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d_i = r_i - l_i + 1\n\n   required_d = x - d_i\n\n   if required_d not in groups: continue.\n\n   group = groups[required_d]\n\n   end_list = group's end_list\n\n   end_prefix_min = group's end_prefix_min\n\n   # Find minimal j where j.end <= s_i\n\n   s_i = l_i\n\n   # Binary search in end_list for the largest end <= s_i.\n\n   pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_list, s_i) - 1\n\n   if pos >= 0:\n\n       min_cost_end = end_prefix_min[pos]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_cost_end = None\n\n   # Now, for the start case.\n\n   e_i = r_i\n\n   # In start_list, find the first start >= e_i.\n\n   pos_start = bisect.bisect_left(start_list, e_i, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n   if pos_start < len(start_list):\n\n       min_cost_start = start_suffix_min[pos_start]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_cost_start = None\n\n   # Now, collect the possible costs.\n\n   candidates = []\n\n   if min_cost_end is not None:\n\n       candidates.append(min_cost_end)\n\n   if min_cost_start is not None:\n\n       candidates.append(min_cost_start)\n\n   if candidates:\n\n       total_cost = current_voucher.cost + min(candidates)\n\n       if total_cost < global_min:\n\n           global_min = total_cost\n\nSo, after processing all vouchers, if global_min is still infinity, output -1 else output global_min.\n\nWait, but in the code outline above, for the start_list, how are we handling the binary search? Because in Python, the bisect module works on lists that are in order. So, for the start_list, which is a list of tuples (start_time, cost), when performing bisect_left, it compares based on the first element of the tuple.\n\nWait, yes. Because in the start_list, the elements are sorted by their start_time.\n\nSo, when we do bisect.bisect_left(start_list, e_i), it finds the first index where start_time >= e_i.\n\nBut wait, in the start_list, each element is a tuple (start_time, cost). So, when we pass e_i to bisect, it compares the first element of each tuple.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, for the start_list, the elements are sorted by start_time. So bisect_left will correctly find the first element with start_time >= e_i.\n\nSo that part is okay.\n\nNow, the next thing is to precompute the end_list, end_prefix_min, start_list, and start_suffix_min for each group.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nFor a group:\n\ngroup_vouchers = [(l, r, c) for ... ]\n\nend_list = sorted(group_vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])  # since end is r.\n\nBut wait, wait, the end is r, yes.\n\nWait, for each voucher in the group, the end is r, so when we sort by end, it's the r value.\n\nSo, end_list is a list of (r, c), sorted by r.\n\nThen, the end_prefix_min is built as follows:\n\nprefix_min = []\ncurrent_min = infinity\nfor voucher in end_list:\n    current_min = min(current_min, voucher[1])\n    prefix_min.append(current_min)\n\nSimilarly, for start_list:\n\nstart_list is sorted by l (the start time), so each voucher in start_list is (l, r, c), sorted by l.\n\nstart_suffix_min is computed by iterating from the end to the beginning.\n\nsuffix_min = [infinity]*len(start_list)\ncurrent_min = infinity\nfor i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n    current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i][2])\n    suffix_min[i] = current_min\n\nWait, but in the start_list, each element is a tuple (l, r, c), so to get the cost, it's the third element.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, putting this all together.\n\nBut wait, what about the group's vouchers? For each group, when we sort them for end_list and start_list, we need to make sure that these are separate from the original group.\n\nSo, for group in groups.values():\n\n   group.sort by end, then build end_list.\n\n   group.sort by start, then build start_list.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when we process a group, we can have multiple vouchers, and for each group, we need to precompute the end_list and start_list.\n\nSo, for each group, we need to make a copy of the group's vouchers, sort them for end_list, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group, the end_list is a new list, created by sorting the group's vouchers by end.\n\nSimilarly for start_list.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n    l, r, c = voucher\n    d = r - l + 1\n    groups[d].append( (l, r, c) )\n\npreprocessed_groups = {}\nfor d in groups:\n    # process end_list\n    end_list = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[1])\n    end_list = [ (x[1], x[2]) for x in end_list ]  # extract end and cost\n    # compute prefix_min\n    prefix_min = []\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for (end, cost) in end_list:\n        current_min = min(current_min, cost)\n        prefix_min.append(current_min)\n    \n    # process start_list\n    start_list = sorted(groups[d], key=lambda x: x[0])\n    start_list = [ (x[0], x[2]) for x in start_list ]  # extract start and cost\n    # compute suffix_min\n    suffix_min = [float('inf')] * len(start_list)\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n        current_min = min(current_min, start_list[i][1])\n        suffix_min[i] = current_min\n    \n    preprocessed_groups[d] = {\n        'end_list': end_list,\n        'end_prefix_min': prefix_min,\n        'start_list': start_list,\n        'start_suffix_min': suffix_min\n    }\n\nWait, but in the end_list and start_list, the elements are tuples of (end, cost) and (start, cost), respectively.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, now, for each voucher in the original list, we can look up the required duration, and then query the preprocessed group.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nCase 1: Two vouchers have durations that add to x, but they overlap.\n\nSo, they shouldn't be considered.\n\nCase 2: Two vouchers have the same duration, but their time ranges overlap.\n\nAgain, they shouldn't be considered.\n\nCase 3: A voucher's duration is larger than x. So, required duration would be negative, which is invalid. So, such vouchers can be ignored.\n\nWait, because x is the total duration needed. So, if a voucher's duration is d_i > x, then required_d is x - d_i < 0, which is not present in the group. So, such vouchers are automatically skipped.\n\nThus, during the processing, for each voucher, we first compute d_i. If d_i > x, then required_d is x -d_i <0, so no group exists, so we skip.\n\nSo, this is handled.\n\nAnother edge case: vouchers have the same duration but their time ranges are such that one starts when the other ends. For example, voucher A ends at 5, voucher B starts at 5. Are they considered non-overlapping? Yes, because j.start >= i.end is true.\n\nWait, the problem says that two vouchers don't intersect if either ri < lj OR rj < li.\n\nSo, if i ends at 5 and j starts at 5, then r_i=5, l_j=5. So, 5 >= 5 is true, so they don't overlap.\n\nSo, this case is allowed.\n\nSo, our condition is correct.\n\nNow, what about when a voucher is entirely contained within another's time range?\n\nLike voucher A: 1-3, voucher B: 2-4.\n\nThey do overlap, so cannot be chosen.\n\nSo, in code, when voucher B is in the required group, and we check whether B's end <= A's start (which is 1) — no, because 4>1. Or whether B's start >= A's end (3): 2 <3, so no. So, B is not considered.\n\nThus, the code handles this.\n\nAnother edge case: vouchers that are completely non-overlapping but their durations sum to x.\n\nLike voucher 1: 1-1, duration 1. Voucher 2: 3-4, duration 2. x=3.\n\nSo, durations sum to 3, and they don't overlap.\n\nThe code should find them.\n\nNow, regarding the initial setup, for each voucher, we process it as follows:\n\nFor voucher i:\n\nd_i = r_i - l_i + 1\n\nrequired_d = x - d_i\n\nIf required_d is not in the groups, continue.\n\nElse, process as described.\n\nSo, for each voucher, the required_d is computed.\n\nNow, what about when x is zero? Well, the problem states x >= 2, so no.\n\nWait, looking back at the input constraints:\n\nn and x are at least 2.\n\nNo, the problem statement says 2<=n,x<=2e5.\n\nSo, x is at least 2.\n\nSo, no issues there.\n\nNow, considering the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3.\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2.\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2.\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nSo, group 3 has one voucher, group 2 has three.\n\nFor each voucher:\n\nVoucher 1: d=3. required_d=2. So, group 2.\n\nCheck group 2 for vouchers j that don't overlap with voucher 1.\n\nVoucher 1's l=1, r=3. So, j must have end <=1 or start >=3.\n\nLooking for group 2 vouchers.\n\nGroup 2 has vouchers:\n\n(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1).\n\nSo, for group 2's end_list:\n\nsorted by end, which is 2 for all three.\n\nSo end_list is [(2,5), (2,4), (6,1)]? No, wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, group 2's vouchers are (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1).\n\nWhen sorted by end (r), the end is 2,2,6.\n\nSo end_list is sorted as [(2,5), (2,4), (6,1)].\n\nWait, no, wait: when you sort the group by end, which is r, the end_list becomes:\n\n[(1,2,5) → end=2; (1,2,4) → end=2; (5,6,1) → end=6.]\n\nSo, end_list is sorted as 2,2,6.\n\nSo end_list is a list of (end, cost) tuples:\n\n[ (2,5), (2,4), (6,1) ]\n\nThen, for the end_prefix_min:\n\nAt index 0: min is 5.\n\nindex 1: min(5,4) →4.\n\nindex 2: min(4,1) →1.\n\nSo end_prefix_min is [5,4,1].\n\nNow, for voucher 1, s_i=1.\n\nWe search for j.end <=1.\n\nLooking into end_list, the end is 2, which is >1.\n\nSo, pos is -1, no j in end case.\n\nThen, for start case: e_i=3.\n\nIn group 2's start_list:\n\ngroup 2's vouchers are sorted by l:\n\ntheir l are 1,1,5.\n\nSo, start_list is [ (1,5), (1,4), (5,1) ].\n\nWe need to find j.start >=3.\n\nIn the start_list, the first start >=3 is 5, which is at index 2.\n\nSo, the suffix_min at index 2 is 1.\n\nSo, the minimal cost is 1.\n\nThus, the total cost is 4 (voucher 1's cost) +1=5.\n\nWhich is the sample's answer.\n\nSo, the code should capture this.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3 2\n\nVouchers:\n\neach has duration 3. So, x=2, required_d= -1 for each voucher. So, no possible pair.\n\nThus, output is -1.\n\nSo, the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, thinking about the data structures and time complexity.\n\nEach group is processed once, and for each group, sorting takes O(m log m) time, where m is the size of the group.\n\nSince the total number of vouchers is 2e5, the total time for all groups is O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nThen, for each voucher, the processing is O(1) per group, plus the binary search operations, which are O(log m) per group.\n\nSo, overall, the time is O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the space.\n\nEach group stores end_list and start_list, which are O(m) each. So, for n vouchers, the total space is O(n).\n\nWhich is manageable.\n\nNow, coding in Python:\n\nImplement the steps as discussed.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can read the input, then for each voucher, compute d, add to groups.\n\nThen, preprocess each group into end_list, end_prefix_min, start_list, start_suffix_min.\n\nThen, for each voucher, process as described.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe'll need to read from stdin.\n\nBut, in Python, reading from stdin can be a bit tricky for large inputs, so perhaps it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, assuming that the input is manageable.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n, x.\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    l, r, c = map(int, line.split())\n\n    d = r -

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration equals exactly `x` days and whose total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: We need to select two vouchers such that their durations sum up to `x` and they do not overlap in time. The key challenge is to efficiently find such pairs given the constraints.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each voucher, calculate its duration and determine what other voucher's duration would be needed to sum up to `x`. Group vouchers by their duration and preprocess these groups to allow efficient querying for non-overlapping vouchers.\n\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each group of vouchers with the same duration:\n   - Sort vouchers by their end times and compute prefix minimum costs.\n   - Sort vouchers by their start times and compute suffix minimum costs.\n\n4. **Efficient Querying**: For each voucher, use binary search on the preprocessed groups to quickly find the minimal cost voucher that either ends before the current voucher starts or starts after the current voucher ends.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        r = int(input[ptr+1])\n        c = int(input[ptr+2])\n        ptr +=3\n        d = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append( (l, r, c, d) )\n    \n    # Group vouchers by their duration\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, c, d in vouchers:\n        groups[d].append( (l, r, c) )\n    \n    # Preprocess each group\n    preprocessed_groups = {}\n    for d in groups:\n        group = groups[d]\n        \n        # Process end_list: sorted by end time (r)\n        end_list = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [x[1] for x in end_list]\n        end_costs = [x[2] for x in end_list]\n        # Compute prefix min\n        prefix_min = []\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for cost in end_costs:\n            current_min = min(current_min, cost)\n            prefix_min.append(current_min)\n        \n        # Process start_list: sorted by start time (l)\n        start_list = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [x[0] for x in start_list]\n        start_costs = [x[2] for x in start_list]\n        # Compute suffix min\n        suffix_min = [float('inf')] * len(start_list)\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(start_list)-1, -1, -1):\n            current_min = min(current_min, start_costs[i])\n            suffix_min[i] = current_min\n        \n        preprocessed_groups[d] = {\n            'end_times': end_times,\n            'end_costs': end_costs,\n            'end_prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'start_times': start_times,\n            'start_costs': start_costs,\n            'start_suffix_min': suffix_min\n        }\n    \n    global_min = float('inf')\n    \n    for l, r, c, d_i in vouchers:\n        required_d = x - d_i\n        if required_d not in preprocessed_groups:\n            continue\n        \n        group_info = preprocessed_groups[required_d]\n        \n        # Case 1: j ends before i starts\n        s_i = l\n        end_times = group_info['end_times']\n        end_costs = group_info['end_costs']\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, s_i) - 1\n        if pos >= 0:\n            min_cost_end = group_info['end_prefix_min'][pos]\n        else:\n            min_cost_end = None\n        \n        # Case 2: j starts after i ends\n        e_i = r\n        start_times = group_info['start_times']\n        start_costs = group_info['start_costs']\n        pos_start = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, e_i)\n        if pos_start < len(start_times):\n            min_cost_start = group_info['start_suffix_min'][pos_start]\n        else:\n            min_cost_start = None\n        \n        # Find minimal cost from both cases\n        candidates = []\n        if min_cost_end is not None:\n            candidates.append(min_cost_end)\n        if min_cost_start is not None:\n            candidates.append(min_cost_start)\n        if candidates:\n            total = c + min(candidates)\n            if total < global_min:\n                global_min = total\n    \n    if global_min == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(global_min)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into vouchers, each characterized by its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping Vouchers**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate efficient querying.\n3. **Preprocessing Groups**: Each group is sorted by end and start times, and prefix and suffix minimum costs are computed to enable quick lookups.\n4. **Querying for Non-Overlapping Pairs**: For each voucher, binary search is used to find the minimal cost non-overlapping voucher in the required group, ensuring the solution is efficient even for large inputs.",
