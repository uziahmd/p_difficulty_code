You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about Vitaly and cycles in graphs. The task is to find two things: t, the minimum number of edges needed to add to form a simple cycle of odd length (more than one vertex), and w, the number of ways to do that with exactly t edges.\n\nHmm. So, what's a simple cycle here? It's a cycle where each vertex appears at most once. So, it's a cycle without any repeated nodes.\n\nThe input gives an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges. No loops or parallel edges. The graph might not be connected.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I think about what conditions allow a cycle to exist. For a cycle, each node in the cycle must have degree at least 2. Wait, no, because if you have a triangle (3-node cycle), each node has degree 2. So, in general, any cycle requires that all nodes in the cycle have degree at least 2.\n\nWait, but for the graph as a whole, perhaps some nodes are part of multiple components. So, I need to consider each connected component separately.\n\nLet me think: For each connected component, what's the possibility of forming such a cycle?\n\nIf a component already has a cycle, then maybe adding zero edges could form a cycle. But wait, the problem says the cycle must consist of more than one vertex, which it already does.\n\nWait, no. Because the existing cycles might not be of odd length. So, even if the component has a cycle, we might need to add edges to make it into an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo, for each connected component, I need to determine whether it can contribute to forming an odd-length cycle, and what's the minimal edges required.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model this by considering each connected component's properties.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Find all connected components in the graph.\n2. For each component, determine if it's possible to form an odd-length cycle within it, either by itself or by adding edges to it.\n3. Among all possible ways, find the minimum t across all components, and the sum of w's from those components that contribute to this t.\n\nWait, no. Because adding edges can connect different components. So, perhaps combining two components can form a larger cycle.\n\nBut adding edges between components can create a new cycle that spans multiple components. So, the minimal t could come from either a single component or from combining two components.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. So, perhaps I should first analyze each component on its own, and then see if connecting two components can lead to a better (smaller t) solution.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- For each connected component, find the minimal number of edges needed to form an odd-length cycle within it. If it's possible, note t1 and w1 for that component.\n\n- Then, for each pair of components, compute the minimal number of edges needed to connect them such that the combined structure has an odd-length cycle. The minimal number of edges would be 1 (since we can connect two nodes, one from each component). Then, check if the combined component can form an odd cycle. The t for this case would be 1 + existing edges needed in each component to form a cycle.\n\nWait, no. Because if I connect two components with one edge, the total structure may not have a cycle yet. So, perhaps the minimal t for the combined case is 1 plus the minimal edges needed in each component to form their own cycles.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the two components might not individually have cycles, but when connected, they can form a cycle together.\n\nThis seems complicated. So, perhaps the minimal t is either:\n\n- The minimal t from any single component (if it can form an odd cycle on its own).\nOR\n- 1 plus the minimal edges needed by two components to form a cycle when connected.\n\nWait, but when you connect two components with one edge, that doesn't necessarily form a cycle. You'd need to have a path that connects back to form a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when you connect two components, you can create a cycle that uses parts from both.\n\nBut this requires that each component can form a path that, when connected via an edge, forms a cycle.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me try to outline the approach:\n\n1. For each connected component, determine if it's possible to form an odd-length cycle. If yes, record the minimal edges required (t_c) and the number of ways (w_c) for that component.\n\n   - To form an odd-length cycle, the component must have an odd-length cycle already, or can be turned into one by adding edges.\n\n   Wait, no. The component may not have any cycles (like trees) but adding edges can form a cycle. But the cycle needs to be of odd length.\n\n   So, for each component, we need to find the minimal edges required to form an odd-length cycle in that component, considering all possibilities.\n\n   For example, if the component is a tree, adding edges to form a cycle. But the cycle must be of odd length.\n\n   So, perhaps for each component, we can compute the minimal t_c and w_c.\n\n2. Additionally, consider pairs of components. For each pair (A, B), compute the minimal number of edges needed to connect them such that the union can form an odd-length cycle.\n\n   The minimal edges to connect two components is 1 (add an edge between a node in A and a node in B).\n\n   Now, after connecting, can the combined component form an odd-length cycle?\n\n   For this to happen, the combined structure must have a cycle that uses nodes from both A and B, and the cycle's length is odd.\n\n   But what conditions must A and B satisfy for this to be possible?\n\n   Hmm.\n\n   Let me think of the cases:\n\n   - If component A has an odd cycle and component B has an even cycle: connecting them might form a longer cycle.\n\n   Or perhaps not, because the parity depends on how they're connected.\n\n   Wait, no. Because the overall cycle's parity is determined by the sum of the parities of the cycles in each component.\n\n   Not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps when you connect two components, the minimal way to form a cycle is to have a path in A, a path in B, and an edge between the two components that connects the ends, forming a cycle.\n\n   But whether the total number of nodes in this cycle is odd depends on the paths taken in each component.\n\n   This seems tricky.\n\n   Maybe it's better to model this as follows:\n\n   The minimal t for the entire graph is the minimum between:\n\n   a) the minimal t_c across all components (for forming an odd cycle in that component alone)\n\n   b) 1 + (the minimal t_a for component A to form a path, plus the minimal t_b for component B to form a path)\n\n   Wait, perhaps not. Because when you connect two components, you can form a cycle that uses a path from A and a path from B.\n\n   For example, suppose component A is a tree with three nodes (like 1-2-3). Component B is a tree with three nodes (4-5-6). If I add an edge between 3 and 4, then the combined structure has a cycle 3-4-5-6-4? No, wait, that's a cycle of length 4 (even). Hmm.\n\n   Wait, but perhaps if I arrange the paths differently. Like, in component A, I can create a path of length 2 (adding one edge) and in component B, create a path of length 2 (adding one edge), and connect them with an edge. Then the total cycle would be 1-2-3-4-5-6-4: no, that's a cycle of length 6, which is even.\n\n   Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.\n\n   Another idea: When you connect two components, the minimal way to form a cycle is to have a path in each component that starts and ends at certain points, and the connecting edge forms a cycle.\n\n   For the cycle to be odd, the sum of the lengths of the paths in each component plus 1 (the connecting edge) must be odd.\n\n   Wait, but the path in each component contributes to the total length.\n\n   Alternatively, maybe each component can contribute a path that, when connected, forms a cycle of odd length.\n\n   For example:\n\n   Suppose component A has a path of even length and component B has a path of odd length. Then, connecting them would give a total cycle length of even + odd + 1 (the connecting edge) = even, which is even. Not good.\n\n   Or, if component A has a path of odd length and component B has a path of even length: same thing.\n\n   Only when both components have paths of odd length, adding 1 (the connecting edge) would make the total even. Again, not good.\n\n   Hmm, maybe this approach isn't sufficient.\n\n   Perhaps it's easier to consider that when you connect two components, you can form a cycle only if both have cycles themselves. Because otherwise, you can't form a cycle when connected.\n\n   Wait, no. For example, two trees can be connected with one edge, but that won't form a cycle. You need more edges.\n\n   So, perhaps the minimal way to connect two components to form a cycle is to have each component contribute a path that can be connected via a single edge to form a cycle.\n\n   But how?\n\n   Maybe the minimal way is to have each component have at least a path of length 1 (so that the connecting edge forms a cycle of length 3, which is odd).\n\n   Wait, let's say component A is a single node (degree 0). Component B is a single node (degree 0). Connecting them with an edge creates a cycle of length 2 (even), which doesn't fit. But that's a trivial case.\n\n   Alternatively, if component A has two nodes connected by an edge (a cycle of length 2, which is even), and component B has two nodes connected by an edge. Connecting them with an edge would create a cycle of length 4 (even). So that's not helpful.\n\n   Hmm, maybe when you connect two components, the minimal t is 1 (the connecting edge) plus the minimal edges needed in each component to form a cycle.\n\n   Wait, no. Because if component A is a tree, adding edges to it to form a cycle. For example, a tree with three nodes (like 1-2-3) is a chain. Adding an edge between 1 and 3 makes it a cycle of length 3 (odd). So, component A requires 1 edge to form a cycle.\n\n   Similarly, component B is a tree with four nodes (like 4-5-6-7). To form a cycle, you need to add two edges (like 4-5-6-7 and 4-7 and 5-6; no, wait, that's more than needed). Or perhaps another configuration.\n\n   Wait, for a tree with four nodes, the minimal number of edges to add to form a cycle is 1, because any additional edge will create a cycle. For example, a tree with four nodes arranged as a straight line: 1-2-3-4. Adding an edge between 1 and 3 creates a cycle of length 3 (nodes 1,2,3), which is odd.\n\n   So, component B requires 1 edge to form a cycle.\n\n   So, when we connect A and B with one edge, the total t is 1 (connecting) + 1 (A's cycle) + 1 (B's cycle)? No, that's 3, but maybe there's a better way.\n\n   Wait, maybe not. Because when you connect A and B, you can form a cycle that uses the existing edges in A and B plus the connecting edge. So, for component A, you added 1 edge to form a cycle, component B added 1, and the connecting edge is 1. So, t is 3. But perhaps there's a way to get a lower t.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps not. Because each component needs to have a cycle, so each requires their own edges.\n\n   Wait, but maybe when you connect A and B, the cycle can use the existing edges in both components, without needing to add edges to form cycles in each.\n\n   For example, suppose component A is a single edge (length 2, even). Component B is a single edge (length 2, even). Connecting them with an edge forms a path of length 3, which is a cycle? No, because that's a path from A to B to A, which is a cycle of length 3 (edges A-B-C-B-A?), wait no, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\n   Wait, no. If A is 1-2 and B is 3-4, connecting 2 and 3 creates a path 1-2-3-4-3, which is a cycle of length 4, which is even.\n\n   So that's not helpful.\n\n   Alternatively, if component A is a triangle (cycle of length 3, odd), and component B is a single node. Then, connecting that node to any node in A creates a cycle of length 3+1=4, which is even. So that's also not helpful.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps the only way to form an odd-length cycle when connecting two components is if each component has a cycle of odd length. Then, the connecting edge can form a larger cycle that combines both.\n\n   But I'm not sure. Let's think of an example.\n\n   Suppose component A is a triangle (nodes 1-2-3), and component B is a triangle (nodes 4-5-6). Connecting node 3 to node 4 forms a cycle that goes 1-2-3-4-5-6-4, which is a cycle of length 6 (even). So that's not helpful.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps if component A is a triangle and component B is a single edge (1-2). Connecting 2 to 1 creates a cycle of length 3 (1-2-1), which is a triangle again (but that's the same as component A's cycle). So that's not useful.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Maybe the minimal t comes from either a single component or from combining two components that can form a cycle of odd length together.\n\n   So, perhaps the plan is:\n\n   - For each connected component, compute the minimal number of edges needed to form an odd-length cycle in that component. If possible, record t_c and w_c.\n\n   - Then, for each pair of components, compute the minimal number of edges needed to connect them in such a way that the combined component has an odd-length cycle.\n\n   - The minimal t is the smallest among all t_c and the minimal t for the pairs.\n\n   But this seems computationally intensive, especially since n can be up to 1e5 or something. But in the problem statement, it's not specified, so perhaps the constraints are manageable.\n\n   Wait, but for a competitive programming problem, the code needs to handle large inputs efficiently. So, perhaps the solution can't involve checking all pairs of components, which would be O(k^2) where k is the number of components.\n\n   Hmm, but for the given problem, perhaps the number of components is small enough that this approach is feasible.\n\n   So, let's outline the steps again:\n\n   1. Find all connected components.\n\n   2. For each component, determine:\n\n      a) Can this component form an odd-length cycle on its own?\n\n         i) If yes, compute the minimal t_c and the number of ways w_c.\n\n         ii) If not, perhaps it can contribute to forming a cycle when combined with other components.\n\n   3. For all pairs of components (A, B), compute the minimal number of edges needed to connect them so that the combined structure can form an odd-length cycle.\n\n   4. Among all possible options (from components and pairs), find the minimal t.\n\n   5. Sum the number of ways for all components and pairs that contribute to this minimal t.\n\n   But how to compute this for each component and pair?\n\n   Let's think about step 2a for a component.\n\n   For a component, how can it form an odd-length cycle?\n\n   Well, the component must have at least a cycle. Because without a cycle, adding edges won't form a cycle. Wait, no. Because a tree has no cycles. So, if a component is a tree, adding edges can form a cycle.\n\n   So, for each component, regardless of whether it has a cycle, we can compute the minimal edges needed to add to form an odd-length cycle.\n\n   So, for a component, the minimal t_c is the minimal number of edges to add so that there exists a simple cycle of odd length.\n\n   How to compute t_c for a component?\n\n   Let me think: For a component, the minimal t_c is the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd-length cycle. If the component already has an odd-length cycle, then t_c is 0, and w_c is the number of such cycles.\n\n   Else, if the component can be turned into an odd-length cycle by adding edges, then t_c is the minimal number of edges needed.\n\n   For example, a tree with an even number of nodes. Adding edges to form a cycle. But whether the cycle is odd depends on the structure.\n\n   Hmm, perhaps the key is to look for the existence of certain structures that can be turned into odd cycles with minimal edges.\n\n   But this seems complex.\n\n   Another approach: For each component, find the minimal t_c and w_c based on certain properties like the number of leaves, degrees of nodes, etc.\n\n   But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the following observations can be made:\n\n   - A component can form an odd-length cycle if and only if it has at least one node of degree ≥2, and the component is not a tree with exactly two nodes.\n\n   Wait, no. For example, a tree with three nodes in a line (each node has degree 1 except the middle node). Adding an edge between the two end nodes forms a cycle of length 3 (which is odd). So, yes.\n\n   So, for a component, if it's a tree and has more than two nodes, adding one edge can form a cycle. Whether the cycle is odd depends on the structure.\n\n   Wait, but the cycle's length is the number of nodes in the cycle. For a tree with three nodes, adding one edge forms a cycle of three nodes (odd). For a tree with four nodes in a line, adding an edge between the two ends forms a cycle of four nodes (even). So, in that case, the cycle is even.\n\n   So, in such a case, the component cannot form an odd-length cycle by adding just one edge.\n\n   Hmm, so the minimal t_c depends on whether the component can be modified to have an odd-length cycle.\n\n   So, perhaps for a component, the minimal t_c is 0 if it already contains an odd-length cycle.\n\n   Otherwise, if it's possible to form an odd-length cycle by adding edges, then the minimal t_c is the minimal number of edges required.\n\n   So, the steps for each component are:\n\n   1. Check if it has any odd-length cycle. If yes, t_c is 0, w_c is the number of such cycles.\n\n   2. Else, determine if it's possible to form an odd-length cycle by adding edges.\n\n      a) If yes, compute t_c as the minimal edges needed.\n\n      b) Else, ignore this component for forming an odd cycle.\n\n   So, for each component, the first thing is to determine if it already has an odd-length cycle.\n\n   How to check that? We can perform a DFS or BFS to detect cycles, and track their lengths. If any cycle has odd length, then t_c is 0.\n\n   But for large graphs, this can be time-consuming.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps we can find whether the component has an Eulerian trail, but I'm not sure.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the parity of the component's cyclomatic number (m - n + p, where p is the number of connected components in the component's graph). But I'm not sure.\n\n   Wait, the cyclomatic number is the minimal number of edges to remove to make the graph acyclic. It's also equal to the number of independent cycles in the graph.\n\n   Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps.\n\n   So, perhaps for each component, we can run a BFS-based approach to find cycles and check their lengths.\n\n   But for a programming competition problem, this needs to be efficient.\n\n   Wait, but the problem allows us to process each component independently. So, perhaps for each component, we can:\n\n   - Check if it has an odd-length cycle.\n\n   - If not, check if it's possible to form an odd-length cycle by adding edges.\n\n   So, let's think about the second part.\n\n   For a component without any cycles (i.e., it's a tree), can we add edges to form an odd-length cycle?\n\n   Yes, but the number of edges required depends on the structure.\n\n   For example:\n\n   - A tree with three nodes: adding one edge forms a cycle of length 3 (odd).\n\n   - A tree with four nodes in a line: adding an edge between the first and third node forms a cycle of length 3 (odd). So, t_c is 1.\n\n   - A tree with five nodes in a line: adding an edge between the first and third node forms a cycle of length 3 (odd). So, t_c is 1.\n\n   Wait, but wait. For a tree with four nodes in a line (1-2-3-4), adding an edge between 1 and 3 forms a cycle that includes nodes 1,2,3, which is a cycle of length 3, which is odd. So yes, t_c is 1.\n\n   So, for any tree with at least three nodes, it's possible to form a cycle of length 3 by adding one edge.\n\n   So, for a tree, t_c is 1 if it has at least three nodes. But wait, if the tree has two nodes, it's a single edge. Adding another edge would create a cycle of length 2 (even), which is not allowed. So, for a tree with two nodes, it's impossible to form an odd-length cycle.\n\n   So, for a component:\n\n   - If it's a tree with two nodes: cannot form any cycle, so skip.\n\n   - If it's a tree with more than two nodes: can form a cycle of length 3 by adding one edge.\n\n   So, in this case, t_c is 1.\n\n   Now, what about a component that is not a tree but has no odd-length cycles?\n\n   For example, a graph consisting of a square (4-node cycle, even length). Any cycle in this component is even. So, to form an odd-length cycle, we need to add edges.\n\n   How?\n\n   For a 4-node cycle, adding one edge will create multiple cycles. But all existing cycles are of even length.\n\n   For example, adding an edge between two non-adjacent nodes can create a triangle (odd length 3) if possible.\n\n   Wait, for a square (nodes 1-2-3-4-1), adding an edge between 1 and 3 creates a triangle (nodes 1-2-3-1), which is length 3 (odd). So, t_c is 1.\n\n   So, for a component with even-length cycles, it's possible to form an odd-length cycle by adding one edge.\n\n   So, for such a component, t_c is 1.\n\n   So, in summary:\n\n   For any component that is not a tree with two nodes, it's possible to form an odd-length cycle by adding edges. The minimal t_c is 1.\n\n   Wait, but what about a component that is a triangle (3-node cycle, odd). Then, t_c is 0.\n\n   So, the overall logic is:\n\n   For each component:\n\n   - If the component has an odd-length cycle, then t_c is 0, and w_c is the number of such cycles.\n\n   - Else, if the component is a tree with two nodes, then it's impossible to form a cycle (as adding an edge would create a cycle of length 2, which is even). So, this component can't contribute.\n\n   - Else, the component can form an odd-length cycle by adding one edge. So, t_c is 1, and w_c is the number of ways to add such an edge.\n\n   So, the problem reduces to:\n\n   For each component, determine if it has an odd-length cycle. If yes, record t_c=0 and w_c as the count of such cycles.\n\n   Else, if it's a tree with two nodes, it can't contribute.\n\n   Else, it can contribute with t_c=1 and w_c equal to the number of possible edges that can form an odd cycle.\n\n   Now, the question is: How to compute w_c for components that require t_c=1.\n\n   For a component that can form an odd cycle by adding one edge, w_c is the number of possible edges that, when added, create an odd-length cycle.\n\n   So, for a tree with more than two nodes, adding an edge between any two nodes that are not adjacent in the tree and don't form an even-length path will create an odd-length cycle.\n\n   Wait, perhaps not. Because in a tree, any two nodes have exactly one path between them. So, the length of the path is the distance between them.\n\n   So, adding an edge between u and v will create a cycle whose length is the distance between u and v in the tree.\n\n   So, to have an odd-length cycle, the distance between u and v must be even.\n\n   Because the cycle length is the path length plus 1 (the new edge).\n\n   Wait, no. Because the existing path is of length d, and adding the edge creates a cycle of length d+1.\n\n   So, for the cycle length to be odd, d+1 must be odd → d must be even.\n\n   So, in a tree, the number of ways to choose an edge (u, v) such that the distance between u and v is even.\n\n   So, for each tree with more than two nodes, the number of such edges is equal to the number of pairs of nodes at even distance.\n\n   So, how to compute that.\n\n   But computing this for each component could be time-consuming for large n.\n\n   Hmm, but for a tree, the number of pairs at even distance can be computed using BFS.\n\n   Wait, perhaps for each node, we can compute the number of nodes at even and odd distances.\n\n   Then, for each node u, the number of nodes at even distance is even_count[u], and the number at odd distance is odd_count[u].\n\n   Then, the number of possible edges is the sum for all u of even_count[u] / 2, because each edge is counted twice (u to v and v to u).\n\n   Wait, no. Because in a tree, for any two nodes u and v, the distance is unique.\n\n   So, for each node u, the number of nodes v where distance(u, v) is even is even_count[u]. Then, the number of edges that can be added is (sum over all u of even_count[u]) / 2.\n\n   Because each edge is considered twice (once from u to v, once from v to u).\n\n   So, for a tree component with more than two nodes, the number of possible edges is (sum of even_count[u] for all u) // 2.\n\n   So, for each component that is a tree with more than two nodes, compute the number of such edges.\n\n   So, putting it all together:\n\n   For each component:\n\n   - If it has an odd-length cycle: t_c = 0, w_c is the number of such cycles.\n\n   - Else if it's a tree with exactly two nodes: can't contribute.\n\n   - Else: t_c = 1, w_c = (sum of even distances from each node) // 2.\n\n   So, the steps for the algorithm are:\n\n   1. Read the graph, find all connected components.\n\n   2. For each component:\n\n      a. Check if it has an odd-length cycle.\n\n         i. If yes: add t=0, w=number of such cycles.\n\n      b. Else:\n\n         i. Check if the component is a tree with exactly two nodes: if yes, skip.\n\n         ii. Else: add t=1, w=the number of possible edges to add (computed as sum of even distances from each node divided by 2).\n\n   3. Also, consider the possibility of combining two components to form an odd-length cycle.\n\n      For this, the minimal t would be 1 (connecting the two components) plus the minimal t_c for each component.\n\n      Wait, no. Because when you connect two components, you can form a cycle that uses nodes from both, but the minimal t could be 1.\n\n      Wait, perhaps the minimal t for combining two components is 1.\n\n      Because you can connect them with one edge, and then have a path in each component that forms a cycle when combined.\n\n      But earlier examples show that this may not always result in an odd-length cycle.\n\n      Hmm, perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\n      Alternatively, perhaps the minimal t when combining two components is 1 (connecting edge) plus the minimal t_c for each component.\n\n      But I'm not sure.\n\n      So, perhaps for the overall solution, the minimal t is the minimum between:\n\n      - All t_c from individual components.\n\n      - 1 + (t_a + t_b) for all pairs of components (a, b).\n\n      But that seems unlikely because adding 1 edge to connect two components and then adding t_a and t_b edges to form cycles in each component would require more edges than just taking a single component's t_c.\n\n      So, perhaps the minimal t is either the minimal t_c of any component or 1 plus the minimal t_c_a + t_c_b for any two components.\n\n      Wait, no. Because adding an edge between two components can create a cycle that doesn't require adding edges to each component.\n\n      For example, if component A is a tree with three nodes (t_c=1) and component B is a tree with three nodes (t_c=1), connecting them with one edge would create a cycle that uses nodes from both components. So, the total t is 1 (connecting edge) + 1 (A's cycle) + 1 (B's cycle) = 3, which is higher than taking either component's t_c=1.\n\n      So, perhaps combining two components is worse than using a single component.\n\n      So, perhaps the minimal t is the minimal among all individual components' t_c.\n\n      But wait, perhaps combining two components can achieve t=1, which is better than any individual component's t_c.\n\n      For example, component A is a single edge (t_c=0 for even cycle, but no way to form an odd cycle because it's a single edge). Component B is a single node. Then, connecting them with an edge forms a cycle of length 2 (even), which is invalid. So, can't form an odd cycle.\n\n      Another example: component A is a triangle (t_c=0), component B is a single node. Connecting them with an edge forms a cycle of length 4 (even). So, can't form an odd cycle.\n\n      So, perhaps combining components can't form a better t than the individual components' t_c.\n\n      So, perhaps the minimal t is simply the minimal t_c across all components.\n\n      So, the steps are:\n\n      - For each component, compute t_c and w_c as above.\n\n      - Find the minimal t among all t_c.\n\n      - Sum the w_c for all components whose t_c equals the minimal t.\n\n      But wait, in the sample input, let's see.\n\n      Sample Input:\n\n      First test case:\n\n      4 4\n\n      Edges: 1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3.\n\n      So, the graph is two triangles (1-2-4 and 1-3-4) but wait, no. Let's see: nodes 1 is connected to 2 and 3, 2 is connected to 4, 3 is connected to 4. So, the component is a complete graph minus some edges. Or perhaps it's a 4-node graph where each node has degree 2 except 1, which has degree 2 as well.\n\n      Wait, 1 is connected to 2 and 3 → degree 2.\n\n      2 is connected to 1 and 4 → degree 2.\n\n      3 is connected to 1 and 4 → degree 2.\n\n      4 is connected to 2 and 3 → degree 2.\n\n      So, it's a 4-node cycle? No, because 1 is connected to 2 and 3, but 2 and 3 are connected to 4. So, the structure is a diamond shape.\n\n      So, the component is connected, and it's a 4-node graph with each node having degree 2. So, it's a cycle of length 4 (even) plus a cross edge.\n\n      Wait, perhaps not. Let's see: 1-2-4-3-1 is a cycle of length 4 (even). So, the component already has an even-length cycle.\n\n      So, for this component, since it has an even-length cycle, but not any odd-length cycle, we need to see if it can form an odd-length cycle by adding edges.\n\n      So, according to our earlier analysis, since it's not a tree, and it's not a tree with two nodes, t_c is 1.\n\n      But wait, in this component, can we add one edge to form an odd-length cycle?\n\n      Let's see: the component already has a 4-length cycle (even). Adding an edge between 1 and 3 would create a triangle (1-2-4-3-1 is the original cycle, adding 1-3 creates a triangle 1-2-4-3-1-3, but wait no. Wait, adding 1-3 would create a new cycle 1-2-4-3-1, which is the same as before, but also 1-3-1, which is a cycle of length 2, which is even. So, that doesn't help.\n\n      Alternatively, adding an edge between 2 and 3: then, the cycle 2-3-4-2 is a cycle of length 3 (odd). So, yes, adding one edge can create an odd-length cycle.\n\n      So, in this case, t_c is 1, and the number of ways is 2.\n\n      Wait, how many edges can be added to form an odd-length cycle?\n\n      Let's see:\n\n      The component has nodes 1,2,3,4.\n\n      The current edges are:\n\n      1-2, 1-3, 4-2, 4-3.\n\n      To form an odd cycle, we can add an edge between 2 and 3, creating a 3-node cycle 2-3-4-2, which is a triangle (length 3). Or add an edge between 1 and 4, but that would create a 4-node cycle.\n\n      Wait, adding 2-3: forms a cycle of length 3.\n\n      Adding 3-4: no change.\n\n      So, how many possible edges can be added to form an odd cycle.\n\n      In the component, the existing edges are 1-2, 1-3, 2-4, 3-4.\n\n      So, the possible edges that can be added are:\n\n      2-3, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, etc.\n\n      Wait, but the component is 4 nodes, so the possible edges are 6 in total.\n\n      Wait, the component is 4 nodes, so the possible edges are 6.\n\n      Existing edges: 4.\n\n      So, 2 edges are missing.\n\n      Which edges can be added to form an odd cycle.\n\n      Let's see:\n\n      Adding 2-3: forms a triangle (2-3-4-2? No, that's a 3-length cycle (nodes 2,3,4). Wait, 2 is connected to 3, 3 is connected to 4, 4 is connected to 2. So, that's a cycle of length 3 (nodes 2,3,4). So yes.\n\n      Adding 1-4: forms a cycle 1-4-2-1, which is a 3-length cycle (nodes 1,4,2). So that's also a triangle.\n\n      So, adding either 2-3 or 1-4 would create an odd-length cycle.\n\n      So, the number of ways is 2.\n\n      So, in this component, t_c is 1, w_c is 2.\n\n      So, the minimal t across all components is 0 (if any component has a cycle of odd length). But in the sample input, the output is t=1 and w=2 for the first case.\n\n      Wait, looking back, the sample input has:\n\n      The first test case's output is '1 2'.\n\n      So, perhaps in that case, no component has an odd-length cycle, so the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is 2.\n\n      So, how to implement this.\n\n      Now, the next step is to write code that:\n\n      - For each component, determines if it has any odd-length cycle.\n\n      - If yes, then t_c is 0, and w_c is the number of such cycles.\n\n      - Else, if the component is a tree with exactly two nodes: can't contribute.\n\n      - Else: t_c is 1, and w_c is the number of possible edges to add that would form an odd-length cycle.\n\n      So, the main challenge is to:\n\n      a) For each component, determine if it has any odd-length cycle.\n\n      b) For components that are trees with more than two nodes, compute the number of possible edges to add",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to form a simple cycle of odd length and the number of ways to achieve this in an undirected graph. The solution involves analyzing each connected component of the graph and considering both individual components and pairs of components.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Connected Components**: First, we identify all connected components in the graph using BFS.\n2. **Check for Odd-Length Cycles**: For each component, we check if it already contains any odd-length cycles. If it does, the minimum number of edges needed (t) is 0, and the number of ways (w) is the count of such cycles.\n3. **Handle Trees with More Than Two Nodes**: If a component is a tree with more than two nodes, it can form an odd-length cycle by adding one edge. We compute the number of such possible edges.\n4. **Consider Pairs of Components**: We also consider combining two components to form an odd-length cycle by connecting them with one edge, but this approach is generally not better than using individual components.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n
