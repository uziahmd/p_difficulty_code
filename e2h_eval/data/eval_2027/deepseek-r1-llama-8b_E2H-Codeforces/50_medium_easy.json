    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's try to understand it step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting something over a certain set of trees. The trees are edge-weighted with each edge being either 1 or -1. We need to find the sum of d(1,n) for all \"good\" trees.\n\nWait, what's a good tree? Oh right, a good tree is one where for every vertex i, the product of the edge weights adjacent to it is -1. So for each node, the number of -1 edges connected to it must be odd because the product is -1. Because each edge contributes a factor of either 1 or -1. If the product is -1, that means there's an odd number of -1s around the node.\n\nHmm, okay. So each node must have an odd number of -1 edges attached to it.\n\nI remember that in graph theory, trees are connected and have exactly n-1 edges. So for each node in the tree, its degree is at least 1, but the condition here is about the parity of the edges' weights.\n\nWait, but wait. The condition is on the product of the edge weights. So for a leaf node (degree 1), the single edge must be -1 because the product has to be -1. So all leaves must have their only edge as -1.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. For a leaf node, it has only one edge connected to it. So the product is just the weight of that edge. So for it to be -1, that edge must be -1.\n\nSo all leaves in the tree must have their connecting edge as -1. That's an important point.\n\nWhat about internal nodes (nodes with degree >=2)? Each must have an odd number of -1 edges connected to it. So for each internal node, the number of -1 edges attached is 1, 3, 5, etc.\n\nSo how can we model this?\n\nMaybe we can model the problem using some kind of dynamic programming approach, considering the structure of the tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a combinatorial way to count the number of such trees and compute the sum of d(1,n).\n\nWait, but n can be up to 5e5, so any O(n) solution is acceptable, but anything higher might not be.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree.\n\nSince all leaves have their edges as -1, maybe the tree has a particular structure. Like, perhaps the tree is a star shape, where the center node is connected to all leaves, and all edges from the center are -1.\n\nWait, no. Because the center node would then have degree (n-1). The product of its edges is (-1)^(n-1). For this to be -1, n-1 must be odd. So when n is even, the center node's product would be 1, which is invalid. Hmm, so perhaps the tree must have a root (like node 1) connected to other nodes, each with certain constraints.\n\nWait, maybe the entire tree is a chain. Let's see for small n.\n\nWhen n=2: the tree is just two nodes connected by an edge. The condition is that both nodes must have a product of -1. So each node must have an odd number of -1 edges. Node 1 has one edge, so it's -1. Node 2 also has one edge, so it's -1. So the sum d(1,2) is -1, which matches the first test case.\n\nFor n=3: the tree has two edges. Let's see. Suppose the tree is a chain 1-2-3. Then node 1 has one edge (so -1), node 3 has one edge (so -1). Node 2 has two edges. The product of those two edges must be -1. So the two edges must have a product of -1. So one is 1, the other is -1. Or vice versa. Wait, but in this case, the path from 1 to 3 is through 2, so d(1,3) is the sum of the two edges along the path.\n\nWait, but for the tree to be good, each node must satisfy the condition. So in the chain 1-2-3:\n\n- Node 1 has one edge (must be -1)\n- Node 3 has one edge (must be -1)\n- Node 2 has two edges: their product must be -1. So one is 1, the other is -1.\n\nSo the possible assignments:\n\nCase 1:\nEdge 1-2 is -1, edge 2-3 is 1. Then node 2's product is (-1)*1 = -1, which satisfies the condition. d(1,3) is (-1)+(1) = 0.\n\nCase 2:\nEdge 1-2 is 1, edge 2-3 is -1. Then node 2's product is (1)*(-1) = -1. d(1,3) is 1 + (-1) = 0.\n\nSo for n=3, the sum is 0+0=0.\n\nWait, but according to the second test case, when n=2, the answer was 0. No, wait, the sample input was for n=2, the output was -1 mod 998244353, which is 998244352.\n\nWait, no, the sample input for n=2 gives output 998244352, which is -1 mod 998244353. So for n=3, perhaps the sum is 0.\n\nHmm, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe I should think about the general case.\n\nLet me consider the structure of the tree. Since all leaves must have their edges as -1, the tree must have a specific structure. Let's think recursively.\n\nSuppose the tree is rooted at node 1. All leaves are connected via edges of weight -1. The internal nodes (non-leaves) must have an odd number of -1 edges. But how does this propagate?\n\nWait, another thought: since the product for each node is -1, each node must have an odd number of edges with -1. But the total number of edges in the tree is n-1. So the sum over all nodes of the number of -1 edges must be equal to the sum of degrees (each edge is counted twice, once for each endpoint). But since each edge is either 1 or -1, the number of -1 edges is k, and each contributes 1 to the sum of the products.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this as a system of equations. Each node i has the product of its edges equal to -1. So for each node i, the product of the edges incident to it is -1.\n\nBut each edge connects two nodes, so each edge's weight is included in the product of two nodes. Letâ€™s denote the edges as e_1, e_2, ..., e_{n-1}, each e_j is either 1 or -1.\n\nFor each node i, the product of its incident edges is -1.\n\nSo for the entire tree, the product of all edges (since each edge is used in two nodes' product) will be ... Hmm, each edge is included twice in the product of all nodes' products. Because each edge is part of two nodes.\n\nSo the product over all nodes' products is equal to (product of all edges)^2, since each edge appears twice.\n\nBut each node's product is -1, so the product of all nodes' products is (-1)^n.\n\nThus, (product of all edges)^2 = (-1)^n.\n\nBut (product of all edges)^2 is 1, regardless of whether the product is 1 or -1. So 1 = (-1)^n.\n\nWhich implies that n must be even. Otherwise, the equation is impossible.\n\nWait, that's a big point! So for the tree to be good, n must be even. Because if n is odd, (-1)^n is -1, and 1 cannot equal -1. So the condition is only possible when n is even.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, n=2 is even, and the answer is non-zero. For n=3, which is odd, perhaps there are no good trees, hence the sum is zero.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the first thing to check is whether n is even. If it's odd, the answer is zero.\n\nWait, but wait. Let's see for n=1. There are no edges. So the condition is trivially satisfied because there are no edges. So the sum is zero, as d(1,1) is zero.\n\nSo for n=1, the answer is zero. For n=2, it's non-zero. For n>2, if n is even, proceed; else, zero.\n\nSo that's a key insight.\n\nNow, assuming n is even, we can proceed.\n\nSo, for even n, the sum is non-zero, else zero.\n\nSo the first step is to check if n is even. If not, output zero.\n\nNow, for even n, how do we compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the structure of the tree.\n\nEach leaf must have its edge as -1. So, the tree must have all leaves connected via edges of -1.\n\nMoreover, each internal node (non-leaf) must have an odd number of edges with -1. So their degrees (in terms of edges) must be such that the number of -1 edges is odd.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree is a chain with specific properties. Or perhaps it's a star-shaped tree, but that may not always be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree is a caterpillar tree, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the problem by considering the tree as a collection of edges, each contributing to the sum d(1,n) as they lie on the unique path from 1 to n.\n\nSo, for each edge in the tree, if it's on the path from 1 to n, its weight contributes to the sum. So d(1,n) is the sum of the weights of the edges along the path from 1 to n.\n\nOur goal is to sum this value across all good trees.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the sum over all good trees of the sum of the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\nSo, for each good tree, we look at the path from 1 to n, add up the weights, and sum all these values over all good trees.\n\nHmm. So, perhaps we can model this as, for each edge e in the tree, determine how many times e is present on the path from 1 to n across all good trees, multiplied by its weight.\n\nWait, but each edge e can be either 1 or -1. So for each edge, we can compute the expected value of its contribution (i.e., whether it's on the path from 1 to n in a randomly selected good tree), multiplied by the number of good trees.\n\nWait, but perhaps more precisely, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the weight of e (which is either 1 or -1).\n\nSo, the sum S can be written as the sum over all edges e of (number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n) * (weight of e).\n\nBut the weight of e is determined by the tree, so for each edge, we can model whether it's on the path from 1 to n in a good tree and what its weight is.\n\nWait, but perhaps the weight is fixed as 1 or -1, depending on the tree.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Let's think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed as the sum over all possible paths P from 1 to n, of the sum of the weights of edges in P, multiplied by the number of good trees that have exactly this path P, and the rest of the tree satisfies the conditions.\n\nBut that might not be feasible due to the exponential possibilities.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps we can model the problem as a linear algebra problem. For each edge, determine the probability that it's on the path from 1 to n in a good tree, and then multiply by 2^{something} and the sum of the probabilities.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find, for each edge, the number of good trees where that edge is present on the path from 1 to n, and then sum (count_e * w_e), where w_e is the weight of edge e.\n\nBut since the weight can be 1 or -1, we need to account for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the weight is determined by the structure of the tree. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem for each possible tree, and for each edge in the tree, see whether it's on the path from 1 to n.\n\nBut considering the size of n, this is impractical.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be decomposed into independent contributions from each edge.\n\nWait, for any edge e, whether it's on the path from 1 to n depends on the structure of the tree. So for each edge e, we can calculate the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, and the weight of e is w_e (either 1 or -1).\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the expected value of the contribution of e is (prob_e) * (sum of possible w_e contributions) over all possible w_e.\n\nWait, but perhaps the weight of e is determined by the constraints of the good tree.\n\nWait, but for each edge e, in a good tree, the constraints impose that certain edges must be -1. So, the weight of e may be determined by the structure of the tree.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let's think about the problem differently.\n\nLet me consider that the tree is a rooted tree, with root at 1. Then, the path from 1 to n is the unique path in the tree.\n\nIn such a tree, each edge can be considered as part of the path or not.\n\nBut given the constraints that all leaves (except possibly node n) have their edges as -1, perhaps the structure is forced into a certain form.\n\nWait, for example, in a tree rooted at 1, any node that is a leaf (other than n) must have its edge as -1. Also, the root is 1, and if n is a leaf, then the edge between 1 and n must be -1.\n\nSo, perhaps the tree is structured such that the path from 1 to n includes all edges that are on the path, and each of those edges must be assigned a value of -1. Or maybe not, because internal nodes can have more edges.\n\nWait, maybe the root (node 1) must have an odd number of -1 edges. Since node 1 is connected to several children, each of which could be a subtree.\n\nWait, this seems complex. Perhaps it's better to model the problem by thinking about each edge's contribution.\n\nAnother idea: since each node except the leaves must have an odd number of -1 edges, and each leaf must have exactly one -1 edge, perhaps the tree must have a structure where the path from 1 to n is entirely composed of edges with -1, and all other edges are 1.\n\nWait, that's an interesting thought. Let me think about it.\n\nIf the path from 1 to n consists of k edges, all with weight -1, and all other edges have weight 1, then for each node on the path, the number of -1 edges connected to them is 1 (if they're on the path but not leaves) or 1 (if they're leaves). Wait, no: a node on the path (like the root) could have multiple edges.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think again.\n\nEach node must have an odd number of -1 edges. So, for the root, if it's connected to m children, each child contributes an edge. The root's edge to each child is either 1 or -1.\n\nBut the root's product is the product of all edges connected to it. So, if the root has degree m, the product is (-1)^t, where t is the number of -1 edges connected to the root. This must be equal to -1, so t must be odd.\n\nSimilarly, for each internal node (not a leaf), the number of -1 edges connected must be odd.\n\nSo, perhaps the tree is a chain where each node has exactly one child, except the last node. But this is a specific case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tree is a star with the root connected to all other nodes. Then, the root has n-1 edges. To have an odd product, n-1 must be odd, so n must be even, which aligns with our earlier conclusion.\n\nIn this case, all edges are between the root and leaves. Each leaf has one edge, which is -1. The root has n-1 edges, all of which are -1. So the product is (-1)^(n-1). For this to be -1, n-1 must be odd, so n is even, which fits.\n\nIn this scenario, the path from 1 to n is the direct edge between them. So d(1,n) is the weight of that edge, which is -1. So for each such tree, the contribution is -1.\n\nHow many such trees are there? Well, in this case, the tree is a star centered at 1, with n-1 leaves. Each edge is -1. So the number of such trees is 1 (since all edges are fixed as -1, and the tree structure is fixed as a star). So for n=2, this is the case, giving a sum of -1.\n\nWait, but in the first test case, n=2, the output is -1, which matches. So for n=4, if the tree is a star, then the sum is -1 multiplied by the number of such trees. But wait, the number of such trees is 1, but wait, in a star, the root is 1, and all other nodes are directly connected to it. So the number of such trees is 1, as the edges are fixed.\n\nBut earlier in the third test case, n=4, the output was -10. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the tree isn't just a star, but has more possibilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the structure is such that the tree is a chain. Let's see for n=4.\n\nIn a chain 1-2-3-4, each node's condition must be met.\n\nLeaves are 1 and 4. Both must have their single edge as -1.\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1 and 3. Node 3 is connected to 2 and 4.\n\nSo node 2 has edges e1 (1-2) and e2 (2-3). Both are -1. So the product is 1. Which doesn't satisfy the condition. So this is invalid.\n\nWait, no. Because node 2's product is e1 * e2. Both are -1, so product is 1. Which is not -1. So this tree is not good.\n\nWait, so in a chain, the product for internal nodes may not be satisfied.\n\nHmm, perhaps the tree must have a certain parity structure.\n\nWait, perhaps each edge on the path from 1 to n must be -1, and all other edges must be 1. Because that way, each node on the path has exactly one -1 edge, satisfying the product condition. And for other nodes, if they have an odd number of -1 edges, perhaps their product is -1.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nSuppose the tree is such that the path from 1 to n is made up of all -1 edges, and all other edges are 1. Then, for each node on the path (excluding n), they have one -1 edge (from the path). Their other edges, if any, are 1. So the product is -1, which is correct.\n\nFor node n, it has one -1 edge (from the path) and any other edges (if any) are 1. So the product is -1 if it's a leaf, which it is.\n\nOther nodes (non-path, non-leaves) must have an odd number of -1 edges. But in this setup, their edges are 1, except for the path edges which are -1. So the number of -1 edges connected to them is the number of path edges they're on.\n\nWait, for example, suppose node 2 is on the path from 1 to n=4. It has edge 1-2 as -1, and edge 2-3 as 1. So node 2 has one -1 edge. So product is -1, correct.\n\nBut if node 2 is also connected to another node, say 5, then that edge would be 1. So node 2's edges are -1, 1, and 1. So the product is (-1)*1*1 = -1, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in this case, node 2 is not a leaf, but it's on the path. So perhaps the tree can have branches beyond the path, but those branches must have all their edges as 1.\n\nHmm, that's a possibility. So the tree can have a central path from 1 to n, where all edges are -1, and all other edges are 1.\n\nIn this case, the path from 1 to n is unique, and it's made up of all -1 edges. So for each such tree, the sum d(1,n) is the sum of the -1 edges on the path, which is (length of path) * (-1).\n\nThe number of such trees would be the number of trees that have a path from 1 to n where all edges are -1, and any additional edges are 1, forming subtrees that branch off the main path.\n\nWait, but how many such trees are there? It depends on how many ways we can attach subtrees to the nodes on the path.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node on the path (except n), we can attach any number of subtrees, each consisting of edges with weight 1.\n\nSo for each node on the path, the number of possible ways to attach subtrees is 2^{k}, where k is the number of possible positions to attach subtrees.\n\nWait, but this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of such trees is equal to 2^{n-2}. Because for each of the n-2 nodes on the path (excluding 1 and n), each can have any number of children connected via edges of 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can be expressed as the sum over all possible paths P from 1 to n, where each edge on P is -1, and all other edges are 1.\n\nFor each such path, the number of trees that have exactly this path as their unique path from 1 to n, and all other edges are 1.\n\nThen, for each such tree, d(1,n) is the sum of the edges on P, which is (number of edges on P) * (-1).\n\nSo the total contribution for each such tree is -m, where m is the number of edges on P.\n\nThe number of such trees for a given P is equal to the product over each node on P (excluding 1 and n) of the number of ways to attach subtrees, which is 2^{d}, where d is the number of possible children for each node.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node on P (excluding 1 and n), the number of possible ways to attach subtrees is 2^{c}, where c is the number of available positions to attach subtrees. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each node on the path can have any number of children, but those children are connected via edges of 1, and their subtrees can be any valid trees.\n\nWait, but this feels similar to Cayley's formula for counting trees. So perhaps the number of such trees for a given path P is equal to the product of 2^{k_i} for each node i on P, where k_i is the number of possible ways to attach subtrees.\n\nWait, perhaps each node on P can have any number of children connected via edges of 1. So for each such node, the number of ways to attach subtrees is 2^{m}, where m is the number of possible positions.\n\nWait, but I'm not making progress here. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose that the tree must have a path from 1 to n where each edge is -1. All other edges are 1. So the sum over all such trees is the sum of the lengths of the path multiplied by -1, for each tree in this category.\n\nThe number of such trees would be equal to the number of possible trees that can be formed by adding any number of edges (with weight 1) to the path.\n\nEach node on the path can have any number of children connected via edges of 1.\n\nSo for each node on the path (excluding 1 and n), the number of possible ways to attach subtrees is 2^{s}, where s is the number of possible edges that can be added.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node on the path, the number of possible children is arbitrary, but each child is connected via an edge of 1, and their subtrees are also valid trees.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of such trees is 2^{n-2}.\n\nBecause for each of the n-2 nodes on the path (excluding 1 and n), each can have any number of children, each connected via an edge of 1. So for each such node, there are 2^k possibilities, where k is the number of children. But this doesn't immediately help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node on the path (excluding 1 and n), the number of possible ways to attach children is 2^m, where m is the number of possible edges that can be added.\n\nWait, but perhaps each node can choose to have any number of children, each connected via an edge of 1. So for a node with degree d on the path, the number of ways to attach subtrees is 2^{d-1}, since each existing edge can have a subtree attached.\n\nWait, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of such trees is 2^{n-2}.\n\nBecause each node on the path can have any number of children, each connected via an edge of 1. So the total number of such trees is the same as the number of trees on n labeled vertices, which is n^{n-2}, but in this case, constrained to have a specific path.\n\nBut that's probably not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of such trees is 2^{n-2}.\n\nBecause for each node on the path (excluding 1 and n), you can choose to have any number of children, each connected via an edge of 1. So each such choice is a binary decision for each possible edge.\n\nWait, but that's not precise. Each node can have any number of children, which is a combinatorial choice, not a binary one.\n\nHmm, this is getting stuck. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAssume that the sum S can be computed as follows:\n\nS = sum_{all good trees} d(1,n)\n\nEach edge e on the path from 1 to n contributes its weight to d(1,n). So for each edge e on this path, we can compute the expected number of times it's on the path in a good tree, multiplied by its weight, and then sum over all edges.\n\nWait, but each edge's weight is either 1 or -1, depending on the tree. So perhaps for each edge e, we can compute the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n in a good tree, and then multiply by the expected value of its weight given that it's on the path.\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the weight of e in those trees.\n\nBut the weight is determined by the constraints of the tree being good. So, for a tree to be good, all leaves must have their edges as -1, and all internal nodes must have an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nSo, for edge e to be on the path from 1 to n, it must be part of the path. Moreover, the constraints on the tree require that e's weight is -1 if it's on the path, and 1 otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps that's not necessarily true. Because in a good tree, the edges not on the path can have any weight, but they must satisfy the condition for their respective nodes.\n\nWait, no. Because if an edge is not on the path, it's connected to a node that's not on the path. That node must still have an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nSo, for example, if a node u is not on the path, but is connected via an edge e to v, which is on the path. If e is 1, then u's other edges must include an even number of -1 edges to make the product -1.\n\nBut this complicates things.\n\nPerhaps another approach: for the tree to be good, each node must have an odd number of -1 edges. So the overall product of all edges is 1, because each edge is included in two nodes' products, and each node's product is -1. So the product of all edges squared is (-1)^n. Hence, product of all edges is 1 if n is even, and -1 if n is odd. But since n is even, product of all edges is 1.\n\nWait, but earlier reasoning suggested that for n even, the product of all edges is 1. So each edge can be either 1 or -1, but the product of all edges is 1.\n\nSo, the product of all edges in a good tree is 1.\n\nNow, the sum S is the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees. d(1,n) is the sum of the edges on the path from 1 to n.\n\nSo, S = sum_{T is good} (sum_{e on path(1,n)} w_e)\n\nWe can swap the sums: S = sum_{e} (sum_{T is good, e on path(1,n)} w_e)\n\nSo, S is the sum over all edges e of (the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n) multiplied by w_e.\n\nBut since the product of all edges is 1, perhaps we can express the expectation of w_e as 1, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, but for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n can be found, and the sum over those trees of w_e is the term to add to S.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of good trees where e is on the path multiplied by 1, because the edge e's weight can vary.\n\nWait, but no, because the weight is part of the tree, so in the count, we have to consider all possible assignments of weights that satisfy the constraints.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem can be broken down into independent contributions for each edge e.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor each edge e, define X_e as the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, and w_e is -1.\n\nY_e is the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, and w_e is 1.\n\nThen, the contribution of e to S is (-1)*X_e + 1*Y_e.\n\nBut since the product of all edges is 1, perhaps for each tree, the product of all edges is 1, so the sum of (-1) for edges on the path and 1 for others must be 1.\n\nWait, perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, since the product of all edges is 1, the sum of the edges' contributions is 1, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the expectation.\n\nThe expected value of w_e in a randomly chosen good tree is equal to the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by (-1) plus the probability that e is not on the path from 1 to n multiplied by 1.\n\nWait, no. Because if e is on the path, then w_e must be -1 to satisfy the product constraints. Or wait, no. Because the constraints are about the product of each node's edges, not directly about the edges on the path.\n\nWait, perhaps not. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each edge e, the number of good trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees where e is on the path, and the product of all edges is 1.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's think about the structure of the tree. Since all leaves must have their edges as -1, perhaps the tree must have a path from 1 to n where all edges are -1, and all other edges are 1. Because this ensures that each node on the path has exactly one -1 edge, and any other edges (if present) must be 1 to maintain the product condition.\n\nIf this is the case, then the sum S would be equal to the number of such trees multiplied by the sum of d(1,n) for each tree.\n\nIn this case, each such tree has a path from 1 to n consisting of all -1 edges. All other edges are 1.\n\nSo, for each such tree, d(1,n) is equal to the number of edges on the path, multiplied by (-1).\n\nThe number of such trees is equal to the number of possible ways to attach subtrees to the nodes on the path.\n\nSo, for the path with k edges, each node on the path (excluding 1 and n) can have any number of subtrees attached via edges of 1.\n\nSo, the number of such trees is equal to the product over each node on the path (excluding 1 and n) of 2^{m_i}, where m_i is the number of possible edges that can be added to node i.\n\nBut how many edges can be added? For each node, the number of possible edges that can be added is (degree on the path) minus 1, because each node can have any number of children connected via edges of 1.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node on the path (excluding 1 and n), the number of possible ways to attach subtrees is 2^{d}, where d is the number of children they have. But since each child can be added or not, perhaps it's 2^{d} possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node on the path, the number of possible ways is 2^{(number of available edges)}, which could be 2^{(some function of the tree structure)}.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Let's think for small n.\n\nTake n=4. The path from 1 to 4 has 3 edges. Each edge is -1.\n\nNow, the nodes on the path are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nEach of 2 and 3 can have any number of children connected via edges of 1.\n\nSo for node 2, it can have any number of children, each connected via 1. Similarly for node 3.\n\nSo the number of such trees is the product of (number of ways for each node on the path to have children) which is 2^{(degree of 2 - 1)} * 2^{(degree of 3 -1)}. Wait, but the degrees on the path are 1 for 2 and 3, so perhaps each can have any number of children, but the exact number depends on the tree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node on the path (excluding 1 and n), the number of ways is 2^{(number of possible edges that can be added)}.\n\nWait, perhaps for each node on the path, the number of possible edges that can be added is unbounded, but each such edge adds a new subtree. So for node i, the number of ways to attach any number of subtrees is 2^{k}, where k is the number of possible edges that can be added.\n\nWait, but this seems similar to generating functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of such trees is 2^{n-2}.\n\nBecause for each of the n-2 nodes on the path (excluding 1 and n), each can choose to have 0 or more children, each connected via an edge of 1. So for each node, there are 2 choices for each possible edge.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, for n=4, if the number of such trees is 2^{4-2} = 4. But the sample input says that for n=4, there are 16 good trees, and the sum is -10.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the initial assumption that all such trees have the path edges as -1 and others as 1 is incorrect.\n\nBecause in the third test case, n=4, the output is -10, which is derived from 16 trees. So 16 is 2^4, which suggests that for n=4, the number of good trees is 16.\n\nBut according to the initial assumption, the number of such trees would be 2^{4-2}=4, which is less than 16. So the initial assumption is wrong.\n\nThus, the structure of the good trees is more varied than just having a path of all -1 edges and other edges as 1.\n\nHmm, this complicates things.\n\nPerhaps it's better to think in terms of the following: each good tree corresponds to a rooted tree where the root is 1, and each node has an odd number of -1 edges.\n\nMoreover, the product of all edges is 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's model the problem using linear algebra. Each node's condition is a product constraint",
