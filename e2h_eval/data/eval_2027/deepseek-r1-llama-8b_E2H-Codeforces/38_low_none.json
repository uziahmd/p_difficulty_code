    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read it carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about finding the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph. Then, among all such graphs with that minimum number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, what's a p-reachable graph? Oh right, it's a directed graph where exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) satisfy u < v, they are reachable from each other, and there's no path back from v to u.\n\nHmm, so for each such pair (u, v), u can reach v, but v cannot reach u, and u != v. And also, u must be less than v.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, find the smallest n (number of nodes) such that the graph is p-reachable. Second, find the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs in any such graph with that minimal n.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the minimal n.\n\nWhat's the structure of a p-reachable graph that uses the fewest nodes?\n\nI remember that in a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), the number of edges is related to the number of reachable pairs. Wait, but here the graph isn't necessarily a DAG. Because in a cycle, if u can reach v and v can reach u, then (u, v) wouldn't be considered as a unidirectional pair because the reverse path exists.\n\nWait, no. The definition says that for an ordered pair (u, v) to be unidirectional, there's a path from u to v, no path from v to u, and u != v. So in a strongly connected component, none of the ordered pairs (u, v) in the component would be unidirectional.\n\nTherefore, the graph should consist of several strongly connected components, each contributing some pairs, but perhaps arranged in a way that their reachability is limited.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal graph is a collection of chains or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is achieved when the graph is a DAG, with certain properties.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input, p=3. The output is 3 nodes. So what's the structure there?\n\nIn that case, the graph has 3 nodes, and the p=3 means there are 3 ordered pairs where u < v and they are mutually reachable. So perhaps the graph is a chain: A → B → C. Then the ordered pairs are (A,B), (B,C), (A,C). So three pairs. And since all edges go forward, none of these are unidirectional except maybe (A,B) and (B,C) as well. Wait no, unidirectional pairs are those where u can reach v but not vice versa.\n\nWait wait, in the sample, the output says the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is zero. So in that case, the graph is a DAG where all pairs (u, v) have a path from u to v and no path back. So for the graph A→B→C, the pairs (A,B), (B,C), (A,C) are all unidirectional, but in the sample, the maximum is zero. Hmm, that seems conflicting.\n\nWait no, in the sample, the output is '3 0'. So the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is zero. So how?\n\nWait perhaps the graph is structured differently. Maybe the nodes form a cycle, but then in a cycle, the reachability is bidirectional, so the ordered pairs wouldn't count as unidirectional.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the graph is designed in such a way that the number of unidirectional pairs is minimized.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal structure is a single strongly connected component. But then, in a strongly connected component, every node can reach every other node. So for n nodes, the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and they are reachable is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2. So for p=3, n would have to be 3 because 3*2/2=3.\n\nBut then, in that case, the number of unidirectional pairs is zero because all pairs are bidirectional.\n\nSo the sample makes sense: when p=3, the minimal n is 3, and the maximum unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nWait, but why is the maximum zero? Because in that structure, the graph is a cycle, which means all pairs are bidirectional, thus no unidirectional pairs. So that's why the maximum is zero.\n\nSo for the general case, perhaps the minimal n is the smallest integer such that the maximum possible number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u can reach v is at least p.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is determined by the largest m such that m choose 2 is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graph**: A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v`, they are reachable from each other, and there is no path from `v` back to `u`.\n\n2. **Minimal Number of Nodes**: The minimal number of nodes `n` is determined by finding the smallest `n` such that the number of reachable pairs (considering all possible edges) is at least `p`. This can be computed using the formula for combinations, specifically `C(n, 2) >= p`, where `C(n, 2)` is the number of ways to choose 2 nodes out of `n`.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: To maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, the graph should be structured as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In a DAG, edges are directed such that there are no cycles, allowing us to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\np = int(input())\nif p == 0:\n    print(\"0 0\")\nelse:\n    n = 0\n    while True:\n        if (n * (n - 1)) // 2 >= p:\n            break\n        n += 1\n    max_uni = 0\n    # For the minimal n, the maximum unidirectional pairs is achieved when the graph is a DAG with edges arranged to have as many unidirectional pairs as possible.\n    # The maximum number is C(n,2), but since in a DAG, each edge contributes to unidirectional pairs.\n    # Wait, no.
