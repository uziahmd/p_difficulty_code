He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the process is as follows:\n\n1. A creates a string of some 'a's.\n2. B appends some 'b's to the end. So after this step, there's at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. C then appends some 'c's. The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's (or both). \n\nOur task is to determine whether a given string S could have been formed through this process.\n\nHmm, so the string must follow the order: all 'a's first, then all 'b's, then all 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So any string that doesn't have this order is automatically invalid.\n\nSo first, I should check the structure of the string. It should consist of a bunch of 'a's, followed by 'b's, followed by 'c's, with no other characters in between. For example, 'aabbcc' is okay, but 'abac' is not because there's an 'a' after a 'b'.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, I need to check the counts.\n\nLet me outline the steps I need to perform:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form aaa...bbb...ccc..., i.e., all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's, and all parts are non-empty except maybe some? Wait, no: the problem says that after A and B, the string has at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C adds some 'c's, which could be zero? No, wait: the note says that C appends some number of 'c's. So the count must be at least 1?\n\nWait, let me read the problem statement again. \n\nProblem statement says: B appends some number of letters 'b', making sure that at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist. So the initial string from A has at least one 'a'. B adds at least one 'b' because it's \"some number\", which implies at least one. So after B's step, the string has >=1 a's and >=1 b's.\n\nThen C appends some number of 'c's, which is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. So the count of 'c's must be equal to count_a or count_b. So c_count must be either equal to a_count or b_count. Also, since C appends some, it's at least 1.\n\nSo for the string to be valid:\n\n- Structure: a's followed by b's followed by c's, all contiguous and non-overlapping.\n- All three parts must be present, except perhaps c's? Wait no. Because after B appends, the string has at least one a and one b. Then C appends c's. But the problem says that \"the number of c's he appends is equal to the number of a or to the number of b\". So the number of c's can be 0 only if a_count or b_count is zero, but that's impossible because after B's step, both a and b counts are at least 1. So c_count must be at least 1.\n\nSo the structure must be a's, then b's, then c's, each part non-empty. And the count of c's must be equal to a_count or b_count.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Split the string into runs of 'a's, 'b's, 'c's. If any other order exists, return NO.\n\nFor example, 'aaabbbccc' is okay. 'aabba' is not, because the 'b's come before 'a's again.\n\nWait, another example: 'aaaabbbccc' is fine.\n\nOnce the structure is correct, we need to check:\n\n- Does the string start with one or more a's, followed by one or more b's, then one or more c's?\n\nYes. So any string that doesn't follow this sequence is invalid.\n\nSo first, I can split the string into three parts: a_part, b_part, c_part.\n\nHow to do that? Well, iterate through the string, group consecutive same characters.\n\nFor example, for 'aaabccc', the groups would be [ ('a',3), ('b',2), ('c',3) ].\n\nIf the groups are not exactly three, or the first is not 'a', the second is not 'b', or the third is not 'c', it's invalid.\n\nWait, wait. Suppose the string is 'aabc'. Groups are a:2, b:1, c:1. So groups are a, b, c. That's okay.\n\nBut what about '",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific process involving appending characters in a particular order. The string must be formed by first appending 'a's, then 'b's, and finally 'c's, with the count of 'c's being equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Structure**: The string must consist of contiguous blocks of 'a's followed by contiguous blocks of 'b's, and ending with contiguous blocks of 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n2. **Check Counts**: After confirming the structure, we need to check if the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's. Additionally, each block (a's, b's, c's) must be non-empty.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid(s):\n    groups = []\n    current_char = s[0]\n    count = 1\n    for char in s[1:]:\n        if char == current_char:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            groups.append((current_char, count))\n            current_char = char\n            count = 1\n    groups.append((current_char, count))\n    \n    if len(groups) != 3:\n        return False\n    \n    a_count, b_count, c_count = groups[0][1], groups[1][1], groups[2][1]\n    if groups[0][0] != 'a' or groups[1][0] != 'b' or groups[2][0] != 'c':\n        return False\n    \n    if c_count != a_count and c_count != b_count:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\ns = input().strip()\nif is_valid(s):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The code first splits the string into contiguous blocks of characters. If there are not exactly three blocks, or if the blocks do not follow the order 'a's, 'b's, 'c's, the string is invalid.\n2. **Count Check**: After verifying the structure, the counts of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's are compared. The count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's for the string to be valid.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both the structural integrity and the required character counts to determine the validity of the string.",
