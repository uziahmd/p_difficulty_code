    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns of cells. We have to add k gilded rings. Each ring is like a border around a smaller rectangle inside the previous one.\n\nLet me understand what each ring looks like. The first ring is along the edge of the plate. The second ring is two cells away from the edge, so it forms a smaller rectangle by leaving a 1-cell border all around. Each subsequent ring reduces both the width and height by 4 cells because each side is reduced by 2 (since each ring is 1 cell wide). So for the i-th ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) x (h -4*(i-1)). \n\nWait, wait. Let me think again. For each ring, the size decreases by 2 on each side, so total reduction per dimension is 4 (2 on each end). So yes, for the i-th ring, the width is w - 4*(i-1), and the height is h -4*(i-1). But this makes sense only if that's possible; otherwise, the ring can't be formed.\n\nNow, each ring contributes some number of cells. How?\n\nFor each ring, the perimeter is calculated. But since the plate is a grid, the number of cells in a ring is the perimeter minus the corners, but wait, no. Wait, for a rectangle of a certain width and height, the perimeter in terms of cells is (2*(width + height) - 4). Because each corner is counted once.\n\nWait, let's see: for a rectangle with width w and height h, the perimeter (number of cells) is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because each row contributes w cells, but the top and bottom are fully covered. For the sides, each column contributes h-2 cells (excluding the top and bottom already counted). So total is 2*w + 2*(h-2) = 2w + 2h -4, which is the same as 2*(w + h) -4.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for each ring i, we calculate the current width and height as:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nThen, the number of cells in that ring is 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, but only if current_w >=3 and current_h >=3. Otherwise, perhaps the ring can't be formed? Or wait, according to the input constraints, k is such that it's possible to have k rings.\n\nBecause the input constraints say that k is at most floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). So for example, if w and h are both 3, min is 3, (3+1)/4=1, so k can be 1. Then for the second ring, the current_w would be 3-4= -1, which isn't possible. So the problem must stop adding rings once either current_w or current_h drops below 3.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the i-th ring is based on an inner rectangle of (w-4(i-1)) x (h-4(i-1)). So for i starting at 1, 2, ..., k.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to k, we compute the current_w and current_h, then compute the perimeter, but only if current_w and current_h are >=3. Otherwise, perhaps the ring is not added? No, because the input ensures that k is valid.\n\nSo in our code, for each i in 1..k, we compute the current dimensions, then compute 2*(current_w + current_h) -4, and sum all these values.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Read w, h, k.\n\n2. Initialize total_gilded =0.\n\n3. For each i in 1 to k:\n\n   a. current_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\n   b. current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   c. Compute perimeter: 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n   d. Add perimeter to total_gilded.\n\n4. Output total_gilded.\n\nBut wait, let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w =3, current_h=3.\n\nPerimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1.\n\ncurrent_w=7, current_h=9.\n\nPerimeter: 2*(7+9)-4=32-4=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7x9 → 2*(16)-4=32-4=28.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. 2*(3+5)-4=16-4=12.\n\nTotal 28+12=40. Which matches.\n\nAnother test case: let's think of a case where after a few rings, current_w or current_h becomes less than 3.\n\nSuppose w=5, h=5, k=2.\n\nRing 1: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\nRing 2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. Wait, 1x1, but then the perimeter would be 2*(1+1)-4=4-4=0. So adding 0.\n\nIs that correct? Or is the ring only added if the current_w and current_h are at least 3?\n\nHmm, the problem says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w-4(i-1)) x (h-4(i-1)). So if after subtracting, the rectangle is 1x1, then the perimeter is 0, but the ring is still considered.\n\nWait, but how can a 1x1 rectangle have a perimeter? It's just one cell, but the perimeter formula gives zero. So in that case, the ring contributes zero cells.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. So for a 5x5 plate, what is the maximum k allowed?\n\nmin(5,5)=5. (5+1)/4=1.5, so floor is 1. So k can't be more than 1. So the second example wouldn't happen.\n\nWait, but wait. The input constraints say that k is ≤ floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ).\n\nSo for w=5, h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4=6/4=1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2.\n\nSo in our code, we don't have to handle cases where current_w or current_h drop below 3 because the input ensures that for all i up to k, current_w and current_h are ≥3.\n\nWait, no. Suppose w=7, h=9, k=2.\n\nAs in the third example, when i=2, current_w=3, current_h=5. Both are ≥3, so the ring is added.\n\nAnother example: suppose w=3, h=3, k=1. That's okay, as above.\n\nWhat about w=5, h=7. min is 5. (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor is 1. So k can be 1.\n\nSo for any i up to k, current_w and current_h are ≥3.\n\nWait, let's think: for k=1, current_w =w-0=5, current_h=h-0=7.\n\nFor k=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=7-4=3.\n\nWait, but 1 <3, which is invalid. But according to the input constraints, k is limited such that it's possible. So in that case, when w=5, h=7, the maximum k is (5+1)/4=1.5→1, so k=2 is not allowed.\n\nSo in our code, for each i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h will always be ≥3.\n\nSo the code can safely proceed to compute each perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h) -4.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nWe need to read three integers from the input line. So, the code would be something like:\n\nRead the line, split into w, h, k.\n\nConvert them to integers.\n\nCompute the sum for i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w -4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nsum += perimeter\n\nThen print the sum.\n\nTesting this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 3 3 1\n\ni=1: 3,3 → perimeter 8. Sum=8.\n\nSample 2:\n\n7 9 1 → 28.\n\nSample 3:\n\n7 9 2 → 28+12=40.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=7, h=9, k=3.\n\ni=1: 7,9 → 28.\n\ni=2: 3,5 → 2*(3+5)-4= 16-4=12.\n\ni=3: 7-8= -1? Wait, no. Wait, for i=3, current_w =7-4*(3-1) =7-8= -1. Which is impossible.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So in this case, the maximum k for w=7, h=9 is floor( (7+1)/4 )= 2. So k cannot be 3.\n\nThus, the code doesn't have to handle such cases.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nRead the input line as a string, split into parts.\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    cw = w -4*(i-1)\n\n    ch = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(cw + ch) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → 8.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 →28.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 →28+12=40.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=1 → 2*(5+5)-4=20-4=16.\n\nAnother test: w=9, h=5, k=1. Same as 5x9, 2*(9+5)-4= 28.\n\nWait, no: 9 is w, 5 is h. So 2*(9+5) =28, minus 4 is 24.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, 9x5 → perimeter is 2*(9+5) -4= 28-4=24.\n\nWait, 9 columns and 5 rows.\n\nThe perimeter is 2*9 + 2*(5-2) =18 +6=24. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nI think that's correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate after adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle, which gets progressively smaller as we add more rings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Each ring is a border around a shrinking rectangle. The width and height of each subsequent ring decrease by 4 units (2 units on each side), leaving a 1-cell wide border. The number of cells in each ring can be calculated using the perimeter formula for a rectangle.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For a given rectangle of width `w` and height `h`, the number of cells in its perimeter is given by `2 * (w + h) - 4`. This accounts for all the cells along the edges without double-counting the corners.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from the outermost ring, each subsequent ring's dimensions are reduced by 4 units from the previous ring. We sum the perimeters of these rings up to the specified number of rings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the current width and height of the rectangle.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: Use the perimeter formula to determine the number of gilded cells for the current ring.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the total number of gilded cells across all rings.\n5. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
