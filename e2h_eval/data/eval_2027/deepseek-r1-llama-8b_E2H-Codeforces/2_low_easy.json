Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given square grid of letters forms an 'X'. The conditions for an 'X' are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All the other squares (the ones not on the diagonals) must be the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nHmm, right. So first, I need to check the diagonals. Then, check the rest.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, for each test case (each grid), I'll need to process it. So, for each grid:\n\n- Check the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal to see if all their characters are the same.\n- Once I confirm that, collect the character used in the diagonals.\n- Then, check all the non-diagonal cells to see if they all have the same character, which should be different from the diagonal's character.\n\nWait, but what if the diagonal isn't uniform? Like, if the main diagonal has some different letters. Then it can't form an X, so we output NO.\n\nSimilarly, if the anti-diagonal is not uniform, then also no.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each grid:\n\n1. Read the n x n grid. Since n is odd, the center is at (n//2, n//2).\n\n2. Extract the main diagonal: cells where row == column.\n\n3. Extract the anti-diagonal: cells where row + column = n-1.\n\n4. Check if all elements in the main diagonal are the same. Let's call this c1.\n\n5. Check if all elements in the anti-diagonal are the same. Call this c2.\n\n6. Now, for the grid to form an X:\n   - c1 must equal c2. Because both diagonals are supposed to have the same letter.\n   - All other cells (not on either diagonal) must be the same, let's call this c3.\n   - Also, c3 must be different from c1 (and hence c2).\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n- Check if main diagonal is all same. If not, return NO.\n- Check if anti-diagonal is all same. If not, return NO.\n- Check if main and anti-diagonals have the same character. If not, return NO.\n- Now, collect all the non-diagonal cells. Check if they are all the same. Also, ensure that this character is different from the diagonal's.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nFirst, read n. Then read n lines, each line being a string of length n. So, for each test case, the grid is a list of strings.\n\nThen, for the grid:\n\nCheck main diagonal: for i in 0..n-1, grid[i][i] must be same as others.\n\nSimilarly for anti-diagonal: for i in 0..n-1, grid[i][n-1 -i] must be same.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, n is the size. For a grid with indices from 0 to n-1, the anti-diagonal would be positions where row + column = n-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nSo, function to check if all in a diagonal are same:\n\ndef check_diagonal(grid, direction):\n    # direction is 'main' or 'anti'\n    diag = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if direction == 'main':\n            diag.append(grid[i][i])\n        else:\n            diag.append(grid[i][n-1 - i])\n    first = diag[0]\n    for c in diag[1:]:\n        if c != first:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nWait, but for anti-diagonal, it's from top-right to bottom-left.\n\nAlternatively, another way: for each cell, check whether it's on either diagonal.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to precompute the diagonals.\n\nOnce I have c1 and c2, if they are not equal, then it's not an X.\n\nThen, collect all the cells that are not on either diagonal. For each such cell, check if they are all same as each other.\n\nAlso, the non-diagonal character should be different from c1.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nc1 = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    if grid[i][i] != c1:\n        c1 = grid[i][i]  # or set c1 once and check\n\nWait, no. To check if all main diagonal are same:\n\nc1 = grid[0][0]\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    if grid[i][i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of letters forms the letter \"X\". The conditions for an \"X\" are that both diagonals must have the same letter, and all other cells must be the same letter, different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** Read the integer `n` which is the size of the grid, followed by reading the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals:** \n   - Extract the main diagonal (cells where row index equals column index).\n   - Extract the anti-diagonal (cells where row index plus column index equals `n-1`).\n3. **Validate Diagonals:** Ensure both diagonals consist of the same character.\n4. **Check Other Cells:** Ensure all cells not on either diagonal contain the same character, which is different from the diagonal character.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\nmain_diag = [grid[i][i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(main_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\nanti_diag = [grid[i][n-1 - i] for i in range(n)]\nif len(set(anti_diag)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check if both diagonals have the same character\nc1 = main_diag[0]\nif c1 != anti_diag[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Now check all non-diagonal cells\nc3 = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue  # Skip diagonal cells\n        current_char = grid[i][j]\n        if c3 is None:\n            c3 = current_char\n        else:\n            if current_char != c3:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n\n# Also ensure that c3 is different from c1\nif c3 == c1:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The grid is read as a list of strings.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check:** We extract each element of the main diagonal and check if they are all the same.\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check:** Similarly, we check if all elements of the anti-diagonal are the same.\n4. **Diagonal Character Check:** Ensure both diagonals have the same character.\n5. **Non-Diagonal Check:** Collect all non-diagonal characters and ensure they are the same and different from the diagonal character.\n6. **Output Result:** If all conditions are met, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all necessary conditions are efficiently checked, making the solution both correct and optimal.",
