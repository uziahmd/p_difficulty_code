There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's read through it carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a tennis tournament where n players participate in a knockout style. The key rule here is that two players can play against each other only if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. The goal is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in.\n\nHmm, so for example, when n=2, there's only one game, so the output is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games: first against someone, then against another. But wait, how does that work exactly?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. Each game eliminates one player, so the total number of games is always n-1. But the question isn't about the total games but the maximum any single player participates in.\n\nThe rule about the difference in games is crucial. So, for each match a player plays, the opponent must have played either the same number or one less than them. Because after each game, the winner's game count increases by one.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of games the winner plays, we need to arrange their matches in such a way that each subsequent opponent has either the same or just one less game played before facing the winner.\n\nWait, maybe it's similar to building a binary heap? Or perhaps it's like finding the longest possible path in a certain tree structure.\n\nAnother approach: model the problem as building a Fibonacci sequence. Because each step depends on the previous two steps.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose the maximum number of games for a winner in a tournament of size k is f(k). How can we express f(k) in terms of smaller subproblems?\n\nFor example, when you have k players, the winner must have played some number of games, say m. Then, each opponent he faced must have played either m-1 or m-2 games (since the difference can't be more than 1). Wait, no, the opponents could have played the same number or one less than the current player's number. So, when the winner has played m games, each of his opponents could have played either m-1 or m-2 games.\n\nWait, perhaps f(k) is the largest m such that the sum of the required games for each round adds up to k-1 (since each game eliminates one person). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering the structure, the winner starts with zero games. Each time he wins, he increases his game count by one. So, for each new game, he needs an opponent who has either the same number of games or one less.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using dynamic programming. Let's define f(m) as the minimum number of players needed for the winner to have m games.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for each m, we can determine the minimal n required so that the winner can have m games.\n\nSo, for m=0, f(0)=1 (no games played).\n\nFor m=1: the winner plays one game, so we need at least two players. So f(1)=2.\n\nFor m=2: the winner has played two games. Let's see:\n\n- In the first game, he plays someone with 0 or 1 game. Suppose he plays someone with 0 games (since the opponent hasn't played yet). After winning, he has one game.\n\n- In the second game, he needs an opponent who has played either 1 or 0 games. But since all other players except him are eliminated, maybe the opponent comes from a subtree where he had to have played once.\n\nWait, perhaps for m=2, the minimal number of players is 3.\n\nBecause the winner plays two games. The first game is against someone with 0 games. The second game is against someone else who has also played once (so their game count is 1). So, how many players do we need?\n\nWe have the winner, and two others. The first opponent plays once, then loses. The second opponent must have played once before facing the winner.\n\nBut how? Because the second opponent's first game would have to be against someone else. So, perhaps the structure is:\n\nWinner (0) plays someone (A), then A is out. Then, Winner (1) plays B, who has played once (so B must have beaten someone else, say C). So in this case, we have four players: winner, A, B, C. But wait, n would be 4, and the maximum games would be 2. So f(2)=3? Or is it 4?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to model it.\n\nFor m=2, the winner has two games. Each game requires that the opponent has played either m-1=1 or m-2=0 games.\n\nSo, the first game: winner has 0, opponent has 0. After the game, winner has 1.\n\nSecond game: winner has 1. Opponent must have 0 or 1.\n\nIf the opponent has 0, then that's easy. But then, that opponent didn't play any other games, which might not be possible because he would have to come from a different branch.\n\nAlternatively, the opponent could have 1 game. So, the second opponent's path is to have played once, meaning that before the final game, he had to have won one game.\n\nSo, for the second game, the opponent is someone who has played once. That means that opponent had to have a game before, which implies that there was another player that he defeated. So, that's three players in total: the opponent, the third player, and the winner.\n\nWait, so for m=2, the minimal number of players is 3.\n\nWait, but when n=3, the sample input says the output is 2. So yes, for n=3, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo, the function f(m) is the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have m games.\n\nThen, our problem reduces to finding the largest m such that f(m) <=n.\n\nSo, how do we compute f(m)?\n\nLet's think recursively. For a given m, what is f(m)?\n\nIn order for the winner to have m games, each of those games must have been against players who have either m-1 or m-2 games.\n\nSo, for each game i (1<=i<=m), the opponent in that game must have played either i-1 or i-2 games.\n\nWait, maybe not. Because the opponent's previous games could have been part of a different subtree.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of players for m games is the sum of the minimal players required for each level.\n\nWait, perhaps it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet me think about it step by step.\n\nFor m=1: minimal players is 2.\n\nFor m=2: minimal players is 3.\n\nFor m=3: what's the minimal n?\n\nTo have three games, each opponent must have played either 2 or 1 games.\n\nThe first game: winner has 0, opponent 0 → after, winner has 1.\n\nSecond game: opponent has 0 or 1. Let's say it's 1. So, opponent has played once, which means he had to beat someone else (who has 0 games). So, for the second game, the opponent is someone who has 1 game, which requires a third player.\n\nThird game: now, the winner has 2. He needs an opponent with 1 or 2.\n\nIf the opponent has 2, then he must have played two games. How did he get there? He would have beaten two players, each with 0 or 1 games. But that's getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal n is the sum of the previous terms.\n\nWait, let's try to model f(m):\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 2\n\nf(2) = 3\n\nf(3): To have three games, the winner has to face three opponents. Each of these opponents must have played 2, 1, or 0 games.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2).\n\nWait, let's test this.\n\nf(3) = f(2)+f(1) =3+2=5.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWith 5 players, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nYes:\n\nThe structure would be:\n\nWinner plays 3 games.\n\nEach game's opponent:\n\nGame 1: opponent has 0 games.\n\nGame 2: opponent has 1 game. So, this opponent must have played one game before, which requires another opponent (total 3 players so far).\n\nGame 3: opponent has 2 games. So, this opponent must have played two games, which implies he has beaten two players. Those two players have 0 games each.\n\nSo, the total players would be 1 (winner) + 1 (game 1) + 1 (game 2) + 2 (game 3) = 5.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\n- Game 1: winner (0) vs A (0). A is eliminated.\n\n- Now, winner has 1.\n\n- Game 2: winner (1) vs B (0). B is eliminated. But wait, B can't have 0 because in the next game, the winner needs to play someone with 1 or 0. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n for m=3 is 5.\n\nSo, f(3)=5.\n\nThen, f(4)=f(3)+f(2)=5+3=8.\n\nf(5)=f(4)+f(3)=8+5=13.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, this seems to form a Fibonacci-like sequence starting from f(1)=2, f(2)=3.\n\nSo, the general formula is f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2), with f(0)=1, f(1)=2, f(2)=3.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nf(0)=1\n\nf(1)=2\n\nf(2)=3\n\nf(3)=5\n\nf(4)=8\n\nf(5)=13\n\nYes, that's the Fibonacci sequence starting from 1, 2, 3,...\n\nSo, the problem is to find the maximum m where f(m) <= n.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Precompute the f(m) values until f(m) exceeds n.\n\n- The maximum m is the largest value where f(m) <=n.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute f(m) for m up to a point where f(m) <=1018 (the maximum n is 1018). Let's see what the maximum m could be.\n\nCompute the sequence until it passes 1018.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nm : f(m)\n\n0 :1\n\n1 :2\n\n2 :3\n\n3 :5\n\n4 :8\n\n5:13\n\n6:21\n\n7:34\n\n8:55\n\n9:89\n\n10:144\n\n11:233\n\n12:377\n\n13:610\n\n14:987\n\n15:1597\n\nSo, for n=1018, the maximum m is 14, since f(14)=987 <1018, but f(15)=1597>1018.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nCompute f(14) as per the Fibonacci:\n\nf(14) = f(13)+f(12) =610 +377=987.\n\nf(15)=987+610=1597.\n\nSo, for n=1018, the maximum m is 14.\n\nSo, for each n, find the largest m where f(m)<=n.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute the Fibonacci-like sequence f(m) as described, starting from f(0)=1, f(1)=2, etc., until f(m) exceeds n.\n\n- The maximum m is the largest m where f(m) <=n.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, we can precompute the f(m) values up to, say, m=60, which will cover all possible n up to 1e18.\n\nOnce we have this list, for a given n, we can perform a binary search to find the largest m where f(m) <=n.\n\nSo, the steps for the code are:\n\n1. Read n from input.\n\n2. Generate the f(m) list up to the point where f(m) >n.\n\n3. Find the maximum m where f(m) <=n.\n\n4. Output m.\n\nSo, let's write this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a string in the sample, but looking back, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer n.\n\nWait, no, the input is a line containing a single integer n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead the input as n = int(input().strip())\n\nThen, generate the f(m) list.\n\nWe can generate it iteratively.\n\nInitialize a list, fib = [1, 2], since f(0)=1, f(1)=2.\n\nThen, while the last element is <=n, keep adding the next term as sum of previous two.\n\nWait, but for each m, we compute f(m) as the sum of f(m-1) and f(m-2).\n\nWait, no, initial terms are:\n\nf(0) =1\n\nf(1) =2\n\nf(2) =3\n\nf(3) =5\n\nf(4)=8\n\netc.\n\nSo, the initial list is [1,2], and for each step, append the sum of the last two elements.\n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nAfter f(1)=2, f(2)=f(1)+f(0)=2+1=3.\n\nf(3)=f(2)+f(1)=3+2=5.\n\nf(4)=f(3)+f(2)=5+3=8.\n\nYes, so the sequence is generated by adding the last two elements.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfib = [1, 2]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_val > n:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_val)\n\nBut wait, initially, the list contains f(0)=1, f(1)=2.\n\nSo, for m=0, f=1; m=1, f=2; m=2, f=3, etc.\n\nWait, but for the problem, m starts from 0, but the maximum games is m, but in the problem statement, the output is the maximum number of games, which is the number of games the winner plays, which is m.\n\nSo, for n=2, the maximum is 1.\n\nWhich is m=1.\n\nSo, the list should include m=0, but the maximum m is determined based on the fib list.\n\nWait, perhaps the list should start with m=0,1,2,... and their corresponding f(m).\n\nSo, the code can proceed as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n ==1:\n\n    print(0) # but according to the problem statement, n>=2.\n\nWait, no, the problem says n >=2.\n\nSo, for n=2:\n\nfib = [1,2]\n\nCheck next_val: 3. Is 3>2? Yes. So, the list is [1,2].\n\nWe need to find the maximum m where f(m) <=n.\n\nLooking into the fib list, the elements are for m=0:1, m=1:2.\n\nn=2: the maximum m is 1, since f(1)=2<=2.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3:\n\nfib is [1,2,3]. Next_val is 5>3. So, the list is [1,2,3].\n\nThe maximum m is 2, since f(2)=3<=3.\n\nSo, the code should process the list correctly.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\n- Initialize fib as [1, 2].\n\n- While the next value is <=n, append to fib.\n\n- Then, the list contains f(m) for m=0,1,... up to the last m.\n\n- Now, find the largest m such that f(m) <=n.\n\nBut wait, the list is built as [f(0), f(1), f(2), ... f(k)].\n\nEach step adds f(k) where f(k) = f(k-1)+f(k-2).\n\nSo, for each m, f(m) is stored in the list.\n\nBut to find the maximum m where f(m) <=n, we can loop through the list and track the maximum m.\n\nAlternatively, since the list is sorted, we can find the largest index where the value is <=n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor m in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[m] >n:\n\n        break\n\n    max_games = m\n\nSo, for n=3, len(fib) is 3, with m=0,1,2.\n\nfib[0]=1 <=3: yes.\n\nfib[1]=2 <=3: yes.\n\nfib[2]=3 <=3: yes.\n\nSo, m=2.\n\nSo, the code would return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nSample Input 1: 2.\n\nfib is [1,2]. Since next_val is 3>2, the loop stops.\n\nLoop through fib:\n\nm=0:1<=2 → yes, max_games=0.\n\nm=1:2<=2 → yes, max_games=1.\n\nm=2:3>2 → break.\n\nSo, output is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=3.\n\nfib is [1,2,3]. Next_val is 5>3.\n\nLoop:\n\nm=0:1<=3 → max=0.\n\nm=1:2<=3 → max=1.\n\nm=2:3<=3 → max=2.\n\nSo, output is 2.\n\nAnother sample: n=10.\n\nfib is built as:\n\nStart with [1,2].\n\nnext_val=3: add.\n\nfib becomes [1,2,3].\n\nnext_val=5: add.\n\nfib becomes [1,2,3,5].\n\nnext_val=8: add.\n\nfib becomes [1,2,3,5,8].\n\nnext_val=13>10? No, 13>10 is yes. So, stop.\n\nWait, wait, 8 is added, next_val is 3+5=8? No, wait, let's re-calculate.\n\nWait, initial fib is [1,2].\n\nnext_val = 2+1=3 → add, fib becomes [1,2,3].\n\nnext_val =3+2=5 → add, fib becomes [1,2,3,5].\n\nnext_val=5+3=8 → add, fib becomes [1,2,3,5,8].\n\nnext_val=8+5=13>10 → break.\n\nSo, fib is [1,2,3,5,8].\n\nNow, for n=10.\n\nWe look for the largest m where f(m) <=10.\n\nCheck each m:\n\nm=0:1 → yes.\n\nm=1:2 → yes.\n\nm=2:3 → yes.\n\nm=3:5 → yes.\n\nm=4:8 → yes.\n\nm=5:13 → no.\n\nSo, the maximum m is 4, since f(4)=8 <=10.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 4.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the plan is solid.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nEdge cases:\n\n- n=2 → output 1.\n\n- n=3 → output 2.\n\n- n=1: according to the problem statement, n>=2, so no need to handle.\n\nTesting n=4:\n\nfib is [1,2,3,5,8]. Wait, wait, for n=4, the fib is built as:\n\nstart with [1,2].\n\nnext_val=3 → add.\n\nfib becomes [1,2,3].\n\nnext_val=5>4 → stop.\n\nSo, fib is [1,2,3].\n\nLooking for the largest m where f(m)<=4.\n\nf(2)=3 <=4.\n\nIs there a higher m? Next m is 3, f(3)=5>4.\n\nSo, maximum is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.\n\nfib is [1,2,3,5].\n\nSo, for m=3, f(3)=5<=5 → maximum is 3.\n\nSo, the output is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=6.\n\nfib is [1,2,3,5,8]. Because 5<=6, next_val is 13>6.\n\nSo, the maximum m is 3, since f(3)=5<=6.\n\nWait, no, because f(3)=5 is less than 6, and f(4)=8>6.\n\nSo, maximum m is 3.\n\nWait, but wait, can the winner play more than 3 games?\n\nWait, for n=6, perhaps the structure is such that the winner plays 3 games.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nGame 1: 0 vs 0.\n\nGame 2: 1 vs 0.\n\nGame 3: 2 vs 1.\n\nYes, because the third opponent has played once.\n\nSo, the maximum is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test: n=7.\n\nfib is [1,2,3,5,8].\n\nf(3)=5 <=7.\n\nf(4)=8>7.\n\nSo, maximum m is 3.\n\nWait, but wait:\n\nWait, 7 players.\n\nCan the winner play 3 games.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about 4?\n\nNo, because f(4)=8>7.\n\nSo, the maximum is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=8.\n\nfib is [1,2,3,5,8].\n\nSo, m=4 is possible.\n\nThus, the output is 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, the Python code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `m` games forms a sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms. This sequence helps us determine the maximum number of games the winner can play for any given number of participants.\n\n1. **Fibonacci-like Sequence**: We generate a sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play a certain number of games. The sequence starts with 1 and 2, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two.\n2. **Binary Search**: For a given number of players `n`, we find the largest value in the sequence that is less than or equal to `n`. This value gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nif n < 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    fib = [1, 2]\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_val)\n    \n    max_games = 0\n    for m in range(len(fib)):\n        if fib[m] > n:\n            break\n        max_games = m\n    \n    print(max_games)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n`, representing the number of players.\n2. **Generating Sequence**: We initialize a list `fib` with the first two values of the sequence (1 and 2). We then iteratively compute each subsequent value as the sum of the last two values until the next value exceeds `n`.\n3. **Finding Maximum Games**: We iterate through the generated sequence to find the largest index `m` such that the value at that index is less than or equal to `n`. This index corresponds to the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution using dynamic programming and binary search concepts, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of `n`.",
