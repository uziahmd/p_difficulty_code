A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about calculating how many toasts each friend can make given certain constraints. Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe problem states that there are n friends. They have bought k bottles of a soft drink, each with l milliliters. So the total drink available is k * l milliliters.\n\nThey also have c limes, each cut into d slices. So the total lime slices are c * d.\n\nAdditionally, they have p grams of salt.\n\nEach toast requires some resources per person: nl milliliters of drink, one lime slice, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, wait. Each friend makes a toast, so for each toast, each friend needs nl drink, a slice, and np salt. So for t toasts per person, the group would collectively need n * t * nl drink, t * (since each toast uses one slice per person) slices, and n * t * np salt.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, each toast is per person. So for each toast, each friend needs their own set. So for t toasts, each friend drinks t times, so the group as a whole uses n * t * nl drink in total. Similarly for the salt: each toast per friend uses np salt, so for t toasts, each of the n friends uses np salt, so total salt used is n * t * np.\n\nWait, but the way the problem is worded: each friend needs nl milliliters of drink, a slice, and np grams of salt per toast. So for each toast, each friend requires those. So yes, for t toasts, each friend has t toasts, so per group:\n\nTotal drink needed: n * t * nl\nTotal slices needed: n * t (each toast per friend)\nTotal salt needed: n * t * np\n\nNow, the available resources are:\n\nDrink: k * l\nSlices: c * d\nSalt: p\n\nSo, for each resource, we can compute the maximum number of toasts possible based on that resource, then take the minimum of those three.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate max_drink = (k * l) / (n * nl). But since each toast per person takes nl, the total per group is n * nl per toast. So the maximum toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl), but only if (k*l) >= n*nl * t.\n\n2. Similarly, max_lime = (c * d) / n. Because each toast per person needs one slice, so for t toasts, n slices are needed. So total slices needed is n*t. So maximum t from lime is (c*d) // n.\n\n3. Max_salt = p // (n * np). Because each toast per friend uses np salt, so total salt per t toasts is n * np * t. So maximum t is p divided by (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but all three must be considered because each is a limiting factor.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Compute t_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n- Compute t_lime = (c * d) // n\n- Compute t_salt = p // (n * np)\n- The result is the minimum of t_drink, t_lime, t_salt.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the example.\n\nIn the first sample input:\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nLet's compute each value.\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → drink is 20ml.\nEach toast per person needs 3ml. So for t toasts per person, total drink needed is 3*3*t =9t. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so t_drink is 2.\n\nc=10 limes, each into 8 slices → 80 slices.\nEach toast per person needs 1 slice → total slices needed is 3*t. So t_lime is 80 /3 → 26.666, so 26? But wait, wait, wait—no, because 80 slices can support up to 80/3 toasts (since each toast requires 3 slices, one per friend). So 80 /3 is 26.666, which is 26 when integer division is applied.\n\nWait, but in the note, the first sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the lime part.\n\nWait, the note says:\n\nIn the first sample, the limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts. Wait, why 80? Because each lime is cut into d slices, so c*d is the total slices. Each toast per",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per person, and we need to ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Resources**: We have three main resources: drink, lime slices, and salt.\n2. **Calculate Maximum Toasts for Each Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `nl` milliliters per person, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters. The maximum number of toasts from the drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices is `c * d`. Each toast requires one slice per person, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n` slices. The maximum number of toasts from lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n   - **Salt**: The total amount of salt is `p` grams. Each toast requires `np` grams per person, so for `n` friends, each toast requires `n * np` grams. The maximum number of toasts from salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the smallest of the maximum toasts calculated from each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate the maximum possible toasts based on each resource\ntoasts_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\ntoasts_lime = (c * d) // n\ntoasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\n# The result is the minimum of these values\nresult = min(toasts_drink, toasts_lime, toasts_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Drink Calculation**: The total drink available is `k * l`. Each toast round for `n` friends requires `n * nl` milliliters. Thus, the maximum number of toasts possible based on drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: Each lime provides `d` slices, and with `c` limes, the total slices are `c * d`. Each toast round for `n` friends requires `n` slices, so the maximum toasts based on lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt is `p` grams. Each toast round for `n` friends requires `n * np` grams, so the maximum toasts based on salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n- The final result is the minimum of these three values, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limits.",
