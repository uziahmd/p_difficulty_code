Your task is to calculate the minimum possible instability.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^5$$$) — elements of the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the minimum possible instability of the array if you have to remove exactly one element from the array $$$a$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000']\n\n### Output\n['2', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example you can remove $$$7$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$3 - 1 = 2$$$.In the second example you can remove either $$$1$$$ or $$$100000$$$ then instability of the remaining array will be $$$100000 - 100000 = 0$$$ and $$$1 - 1 = 0$$$ correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

It then sorts the array in ascending order.\n\nIt initializes `max_diff` with the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum element in the array.\n\nThe script then creates two lists, `left_max` and `right_min`, to store the maximum element seen so far from the left and the minimum element seen so far from the right respectively.\n\nFor each element in the array, it updates `left_max` and `right_min` with the maximum of the current element and the previous maximum, and the minimum of the current element and the previous minimum respectively.\n\nAfter that, it reverses `right_min` to prepare it for use from the right.\n\nThe script then iterates over the array and calculates the difference between the maximum element seen from the left and the minimum element seen from the right. If this difference is less than the current minimum difference, it updates the minimum difference.\n\nFinally, it prints the minimum difference, which represents the minimum possible instability of the array after removing one element.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of elements in the array. The subsequent operations have a time complexity of O(n), but they do not affect the overall time complexity because they are dominated by the sorting operation.",
