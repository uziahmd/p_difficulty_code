    "thought": "Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. The task is to find the length of the longest substring in a given string that appears at least twice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. So, given a string like 'ababa', the output is 3 because the substring 'aba' appears twice—once starting at index 0 and again at index 2. Oh right, and the occurrences can overlap. So, for example, in 'zzz', the substrings 'zz' appear twice: once starting at 0 and another at 1. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo, what's the plan here? Well, one way is to check all possible substrings of the string and see which is the longest that appears more than once.\n\nBut wait, how do I efficiently generate all possible substrings and track their occurrences? Since the maximum string length is 100, even a brute-force approach might be manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. For each possible substring length, starting from the largest possible down to 1.\n2. For each length l, check all possible substrings of that length.\n3. For each substring, see if it appears again somewhere else in the string (could be overlapping).\n4. If such a substring exists, return l as the answer.\n5. If no such substring is found for any length, return 0.\n\nThat makes sense. So, first, we'll loop l from the maximum possible (length of the string minus 1) down to 1. For each l, we look at every possible substring of that length and see if it appears more than once.\n\nWait, but how do I check if a substring appears more than once? One approach is to create a dictionary where the key is the substring and the value is a list of starting indices. Then, for each substring, if the list has more than one index, we've found our match.\n\nAlternatively, since the string isn't too long, I could just compare each substring with all others of the same length. But using a dictionary might be more efficient.\n\nSo, for each possible l starting from the largest:\n- Iterate through the string, extracting all substrings of length l.\n- For each substring, keep track of the positions where they occur.\n- After collecting all substrings for this l, check if any substring has been seen more than once.\n- If yes, then return l as the answer.\n\nIf no such l is found after checking all possible lengths, return 0.\n\nLet me think about the example 'ababa'. The length is 5. Let's see for l=3:\nSubstrings are 'aba' (0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). So the first and third substrings are both 'aba', so we return 3.\n\nAnother example, 'abcd' has all unique characters. So for l=3, each substring is unique. Similarly for l=2, l=1. So the answer is 0.\n\nThird example, 'zzz': for l=2, substrings are 'zz' (0-1) and 'zz' (1-2). So two occurrences, hence return 2.\n\nSo, the algorithm should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nLet's outline the code structure:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nFor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    create a set to track substrings.\n    for i in range(0, len(s)-l +1):\n        substring = s[i:i+l]\n        if substring is already in the set, return l.\n        else, add it to the set.\n    continue to next l.\n\nWait, no. Because for each l, we have to process all substrings. Wait, perhaps for each l, we collect all substrings, and for each substring, track where it occurs. If any substring appears more than once, then return l.\n\nSo, for each l, create a dictionary where keys are substrings and values are lists of indices. Then, for each entry in the dictionary, if the list has length >=2, then return l.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    substr_dict = {}\n    for i in range(len(s) - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in substr_dict:\n            # Check if any previous occurrence exists\n            # Once found, return l\n            max_len = l\n            print(max_len)\n            exit()\n        else:\n            substr_dict[substr] = [i]\n    # After processing all substr of length l, if any duplicates, return l\n    # Else proceed to smaller l\n\nWait, but this approach may miss some cases because when you find a duplicate during the iteration, you can immediately return. But wait, in the code above, for each substr, check if it's in substr_dict. If yes, then return. But wait, the substr_dict is being built as we go. So for each i, when you extract substr, if it's already present, you return l.\n\nBut wait, that's not sufficient. Because for example, in 'ababa', when l=3, the substrings are 'aba' at i=0, then 'bab' at i=1, then 'aba' at i=2. So when i=2, substr is 'aba', which is already in substr_dict. So the code would catch that and return 3.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the moment a duplicate is found, it returns. So that's efficient because once the first duplicate is found for the current l, we can return immediately, without checking further.\n\nBut what about cases where the same l has multiple duplicates but the first one is found later? No, because for each i, we process them in order, so the earliest possible duplicate is found quickly.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for the same l, there are multiple duplicates, but the code will process i=0, add substr to dict, then i=1, add another, etc., until i=2, where the substr is already present, so return.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the code will loop from the largest possible l down to 1. For each l, it builds a dictionary of substrings and their indices. As soon as any substring is found to have been seen before, it returns l.\n\nIf after all l's are checked, nothing is found, return 0.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → length 4.\n\nCheck l=3:\n\ni=0: substr 'abc' → added.\ni=1: substr 'bcd' → added.\nNo duplicates, so proceed.\n\nl=2:\n\nsubstrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'.\nAll unique, proceed.\n\nl=1:\n\neach character is unique. So return 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → length 5.\n\nCheck l=4:\n\nsubstrings are 'abab', 'baba'. All unique.\n\nl=3:\n\ni=0: 'aba' → added.\ni=1: 'bab' → added.\ni=2: 'aba' → found in dict. So return 3.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → length 3.\n\nCheck l=2:\n\ni=0: 'zz' → added.\ni=1: 'zz' → found, return 2.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa'.\n\nWhat's the expected output? The maximum substring is 'aaaa' which occurs at positions 0 and 1 (overlap). So the answer is 4.\n\nWait, let's see: the string is 'aaaaa' of length 5.\n\nFor l=4: substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So during i=1, substr is 'aaaa' which is already in the dict. So return 4.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabb' → the entire string is 'aabb aabb' which is 8 characters.\n\nThe maximum substring is 4, as 'aabb' appears twice.\n\nSo, the code would process l=7,6,5,4.\n\nAt l=4, i=0: 'aabb' added.\ni=4: 'aabb' again. So returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where the string is length 1: 'a' → the output is 0, because no substring can appear twice.\n\nAnother case: 'aa' → l=1, but the substring 'a' appears twice. So the code would process l=1 and find the duplicate. So the output is 1.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the substring must appear at least twice. So for 'aa', the answer is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: 'ababab' → the maximum is 4, since 'abab' appears at 0 and 2.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string is 'ababab' → length 6.\n\nChecking l=5: substrings are 'ababa' and 'babab' → no duplicates.\n\nl=4: substrings are 'abab' (i=0), 'baba' (i=1), 'abab' (i=2). So when i=2, the substring is 'abab' which is already in the dict. So return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabcab' → the maximum is 5, as 'abcab' appears at i=0 and i=3.\n\nWait, the string is 'abcabcab' → length 8.\n\nFor l=5: substrings are 'abcab' (i=0), 'bcabc' (i=1), 'cabc a' (i=2), 'abcab' (i=3). So during i=3, the substring is 'abcab' which is already present. So return 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nIn Python, the code would read the string, then for each l from len(s)-1 down to 1, inclusive.\n\nWait, len(s)-1? Because the maximum possible substring length that can appear at least twice is len(s)-1. For example, in a string of length n, a substring of length n-1 can appear twice only if the string starts and ends with the same character, and the middle is the same. Like 'ababa' has length 5, and the substring of length 4 is 'abab' which appears only once. So perhaps my initial thought was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible l is len(s)-1, but sometimes that's not possible. So the code correctly loops from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, for a string of length 2, like 'aa', the maximum l is 1.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = {}\n    found = False\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        else:\n            seen[substr] = True\n    # After checking all substrings of length l, if none found, continue.\n\nWait, wait a minute. In the code above, once a substring is found in 'seen', it returns. So for each l, it stops as soon as a duplicate is found. That's efficient.\n\nWait, but what if for a certain l, multiple substrings have duplicates, but the first one is found early, but another one is found later. It doesn't matter; as soon as the first duplicate is found, we return.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nWait, but in the earlier example where the code checks for l=3 in 'ababa', it finds 'aba' at i=2, which is a duplicate. So it returns 3.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, 'seen' is a dictionary that maps substrings to True, not to a list of indices. So for each substring, it's just tracking whether it has been seen before.\n\nThat's sufficient because, as soon as a substring is found in 'seen', it means it has occurred before, so the condition is met.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead the string.\n\nLoop l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   Create an empty set called seen.\n\n   For each i from 0 to (n-l):\n\n      substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n      if substr in seen:\n\n          print(l) and exit.\n\n      else:\n\n          add substr to seen.\n\nIf no l found, print 0.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code:\n\nTest case 1: 'abcd'\n\nl starts at 3.\n\ni=0: 'abc' → not in seen. Add.\n\ni=1: 'bcd' → not in seen. Add.\n\nNo duplicates. Move to l=2.\n\ni=0: 'ab' → add.\n\ni=1: 'bc' → add.\n\ni=2: 'cd' → add.\n\nNo duplicates. Move to l=1.\n\ni=0: 'a' → add.\n\ni=1: 'b' → add.\n\ni=2: 'c' → add.\n\ni=3: 'd' → add.\n\nNo duplicates. So output 0.\n\nTest case 2: 'ababa'\n\nl=4.\n\ni=0: 'abab' → add.\n\ni=1: 'baba' → add.\n\nNo duplicates. Move to l=3.\n\ni=0: 'aba' → add.\n\ni=1: 'bab' → add.\n\ni=2: 'aba' → found in seen. So output 3.\n\nTest case 3: 'zzz'\n\nl=2.\n\ni=0: 'zz' → add.\n\ni=1: 'zz' → found. Output 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaa'.\n\nl=2.\n\ni=0: 'aa' → add.\n\ni=1: 'aa' → found. Output 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaabb' → 'aabb' appears twice.\n\nl=4.\n\ni=0: 'aabb' → add.\n\ni=1: 'abba' → add.\n\ni=2: 'bbaa' → add.\n\ni=3: 'baab' → add.\n\ni=4: 'aabb' → found. Output 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababab' → the code should return 4.\n\nBecause for l=4, the substrings are 'abab' (i=0), 'baba' (i=1), 'abab' (i=2). So during i=2, 'abab' is found in seen, so return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo, the final code is:\n\nRead the string.\n\nLoop l from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nFor each l, iterate over all possible substrings of that length.\n\nIf any substring is found in 'seen', print l and exit.\n\nIf no such l is found, print 0.\n\nSo, now, writing the code.\n\nWait, but in Python, the input is read as a single line. So, perhaps:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nif n <=1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - l +1):\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(l)\n                exit()\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but for n=1, the code will enter the else clause, but the loop runs from 0 down to 1, which is not possible. So perhaps the code should handle n=1 separately.\n\nWait, in the code above, for n=1, the else clause is entered. Then the loop is for l in range(0, 0, -1), which is an empty loop. So, the code proceeds to print 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting it on the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWhen run, the code should output these.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should be:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nAnother test case: 'a' → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: 'aa' → output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring in a given string that appears at least twice. These occurrences can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The task is to find the longest substring that appears at least twice. Given the constraints (string length up to 100), a brute-force approach is feasible.\n2. **Intuition**: We can check all possible substrings starting from the longest possible length down to the shortest. For each length, we track substrings using a set to quickly check for duplicates.\n3. **Algorithm**:\n   - Iterate over possible substring lengths from the maximum possible (length of the string minus one) down to 1.\n   - For each length, generate all substrings and use a set to track seen substrings.\n   - If a duplicate substring is found, immediately return the current length as the result.\n   - If no duplicates are found for any length, return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - l + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+l]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(l)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and its length is determined.\n- **Loop Over Lengths**: Starting from the longest possible substring length down to 1.\n- **Track Substrings**: For each length, generate all substrings and store them in a set to track duplicates.\n- **Check for Duplicates**: If a substring is found in the set, it means it has appeared before, so the current length is printed and the program exits.\n- **No Duplicates Found**: If no duplicates are found for any length, the result is 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging a set for quick lookups, making the solution both effective and efficient for the given constraints.",
