Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "**Parsing input for substrings**\n\nI’m working on a problem that involves parsing potentially multiple lines of input. For the longest repeated substring length, I see that there could be several test cases, so I need to gather input for each string separately. I'll process each non-empty line and implement a brute-force approach for each string. The algorithm will check for any repeating substrings using a set to track seen substrings. If found, I’ll return the length; otherwise, I'll print 0. Edge cases with overlaps should be accounted for as well.",
