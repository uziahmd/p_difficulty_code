Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing Python task**\n\nI need to write a Python script that reads from stdin and produces outputs based on a problem from CSES called \"Longest Repeating Substring.\" The input appears as a list of strings with potentially multiple test cases. Sample input includes strings like ['abcd','ababa','zzz'] with corresponding outputs of ['0','3','2']. I should consider each line of stdin as a separate string, stripping whitespace and ignoring empty lines. For each string, I’ll compute the length of the longest repeating substring, possibly using a suffix array or rolling hash since n ≤ 100 is manageable.",
