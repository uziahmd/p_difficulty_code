Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing substring problem**\n\nI need to parse the input for the \"Longest Repeated Substring\" problem, which looks like multiple test lines might be provided. While the prompt shows example input as `['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']`, it implies each string on a new line. I should read each line, strip any extra spaces, and skip empty entries. For each string, I’ll compute the longest repeated substring length. Since n is small (<=100), either O(n^2 log n) or O(n^2) should work fine. A brute force method could check each length, but I could also speed that up with sets or rolling hashes.",
