Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Evaluating test cases for substrings**\n\nIt seems like I need to read possibly multiple test cases where each line represents a different test case. The problem might originate from the CSES \"Longest Repeated Substring,\" focusing on finding the longest substring that appears at least twice. For each input line, I'll compute the maximum length for substrings. I can manage an O(n^3) approach since n is at most 100, and I’ll check from n-1 down to 1 for duplicates using a set. I wonder if I need to handle empty lines, but the input should consist of non-empty strings.",
