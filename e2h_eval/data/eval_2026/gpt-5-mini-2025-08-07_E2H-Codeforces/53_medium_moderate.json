Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Exploring Python string processing**\n\nI need to write a Python script that reads input from stdin. The examples mention multiple test cases, and it seems to show a list of strings with corresponding output as numbers.\n\nThe original problem likely involves finding the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice. But the input shows multiple lines, which suggests processing each separately until EOF. I'll handle each non-empty line and for strings up to length 100, use a brute-force method to check for repeated substrings. I'll check from longer lengths down to shorter ones to find the first match.",
