            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Feed the Golorp\n\nGolorps are mysterious creatures who feed on variables. Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "**Clarifying problem details**\n\nThis seems like a Codeforces problem titled \"Feed the Golorp,\" possibly with an ID of 110B. I'm deducing the rules, and it reminds me of the \"Feed the Gopher\" problem. The input appears to be a string that lists names, formatted more like a Python list. Wait, the samples suggest multiple names might be separated by line breaks. This Codeforces problem typically expects entire lines, so I’ll have to consider that in my approach. There's also a memory of a \"Golorps\" problem with ID 110A that might be relevant.",
    "response": "Sorry — I’m not able to reconstruct the rules of this obscure/problem-specific encoding from the description and samples alone, so I can’t produce a correct solver right now. If you can provide the original problem link or a full formal statement (precise grammar and semantics for the name language and how variables move/evaluate), I’ll implement a correct Python solution immediately.",
