In order to make Chaneka happy, you must find the number of different arrays containing $$$N$$$ sets $$$[S_1, S_2, S_3, \\ldots, S_N]$$$ such that: - Each set can only contain zero or more different integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$K$$$. - There exists a way to rearrange the order of the array of sets into $$$[S'_1, S'_2, S'_3, \\ldots, S'_N]$$$ such that $$$S'_i$$$ is a child of $$$S'_{i+1}$$$ for each $$$1\\leq i\\leq N-1$$$.Print the answer modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.Two sets are considered different if and only if there is at least one value that only occurs in one of the two sets.Two arrays of sets are considered different if and only if there is at least one index $$$i$$$ such that the sets at index $$$i$$$ in the two arrays are different.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$N$$$ and $$$K$$$ ($$$1 \\leq N,K \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$$$) — the number of sets in the array and the maximum limit for the values in the sets.\n\n## Output\nAn integer representing the number of different arrays of sets that satisfy the problem condition, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2 2', '1 3', '3 1']\n\n### Output\n['11', '8', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$11$$$ different arrays of sets possible, which are:   $$$[\\{\\}, \\{\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{\\}, \\{1\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{\\}, \\{1, 2\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{\\}, \\{2\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{1\\}, \\{\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{1\\}, \\{1, 2\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{1\\}, \\{2\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{1, 2\\}, \\{\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{1, 2\\}, \\{1\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{2\\}, \\{\\}]$$$  $$$[\\{2\\}, \\{1\\}]$$$ \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing counts sequence**\n\nI’m thinking about sequences being nondecreasing and how each distinct count value comes into play. For counts denoted as c1 ≤ c2 ≤ ... ≤ cK, I’m considering how to form subsets. The number of sequences corresponds to the number of ways to choose elements for these distinct counts, calculated through combinations. I think I have to consider if my counting matches examples. It seems like there might be some discrepancies, and I need to clarify this further.",
    "response": "I'm sorry — I don't have a correct and efficient solution ready for this problem within the time available. This problem requires a nontrivial combinatorial observation to reduce the sum over nondecreasing sequences of counts into a computable closed form or an algorithm that runs in O((N+K) log MOD) (or similar). I attempted to derive the needed identity but did not arrive at a correct formula before the deadline.\n\nIf you'd like, I can:\n- Continue working on deriving the correct identity and produce a full Python solution (this will take more time), or\n- Provide a brute-force/DP implementation (O(N*K)) which is easy to write but will not pass the largest constraints, useful for testing and validation on small inputs, or\n- Walk through steps to derive the required combinatorial transform together interactively.\n\nWhich would you prefer?",
