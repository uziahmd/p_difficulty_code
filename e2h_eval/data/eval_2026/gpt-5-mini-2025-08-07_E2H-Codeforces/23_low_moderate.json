            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "**Analyzing Mahjong tiles**\n\nI'm working through the CF problem \"Tokitsukaze and Mahjong.\" For three tiles, the output is 0 if they already form a \"mentsu,\" 1 if I can make one by adding a tile, and 2 if neither condition is met. I need to parse each tile as tokens like '1s'. Checking for identical tiles helps me determine if I can get a triplet. Then I'll look at sequences based on suit and number order after sorting. For closeness, if I have two tiles with a difference of 1, one more tile can complete the sequence.",
