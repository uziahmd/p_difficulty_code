On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."
