Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending 0s and 1s. After each append, we need to calculate the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. But there are some forbidden Morse codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring that matches one of these four is invalid and shouldn't be counted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The key here is that each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4, not in the forbidden list) corresponds to a unique letter. So any substring of S that is a valid Morse code string contributes to the count. However, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". Wait, but sequences of letters. For example, if a substring is \"11\", which is a valid code (say for 'M'), then that's one letter. But if there's another substring that is \"1\" (say 'T'), then combining them as \"T\" followed by \"M\" would be a sequence of two letters. But how does that translate into the count?\n\nWait, the problem says \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the note in the first example.\n\nIn the first sample, S is \"111\". The possible substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (positions 1, 2, 3)\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2, 2-3)\n- \"111\" (positions 1-3)\n\nEach of these is a valid Morse code (since none of them are in the forbidden list). Now, the count is the number of sequences. The note lists several possibilities, like \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", etc. So each occurrence of a valid Morse code substring counts as a single letter, and sequences are formed by concatenating these letters. However, the way the problem counts seems to be that each valid substring (which represents a letter) is considered as a separate sequence. But also, multiple substrings can form longer sequences.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps the wording is that each such sequence is a concatenation of letters, each of which is represented by some substring. But that's not correct. Because the problem says that the entire sequence is represented by a substring. For example, if a substring is \"11\", which represents a single letter. Then the sequence is one letter. If there is a substring \"1\" followed by another \"1\", then the sequence could be two letters. But how do these sequences get counted?\n\nWait, the problem says that the answer is the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S. So, each such sequence corresponds to a substring of S that is a concatenation of valid Morse code strings. For example, if S is \"11\", then the substrings are \"1\" (valid), \"1\" (another instance), and \"11\" (valid). So the sequences are:\n\n- \"T\" (from first \"1\")\n- \"T\" (from second \"1\")\n- \"M\" (from \"11\")\n- \"TT\" (from the two \"1\"s in sequence, which is a sequence of two letters, each represented by their own Morse code)\nBut wait, how is \"TT\" represented? The entire string \"11\" is a single Morse code for 'M', but the sequence \"TT\" would correspond to two separate Morse codes. However, the problem says that the sequences are represented by some substring. Wait, no. The wording is confusing here.\n\nLet me check the note again. The first example's explanation says that after S is \"111\", the answer includes \"TT\" (translates into \"11\"). Wait, but \"TT\" would be two letters, each represented by \"1\", so the Morse code would be \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\". Which is exactly the same as the Morse code for 'M'. So how does that count as a separate sequence?\n\nAh, this suggests that the problem is counting all possible ways to split a substring into valid Morse code letters. Each such split corresponds to a different sequence of letters. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split as one letter (M) or two letters (T and T). Both are valid sequences, and both are counted. Therefore, the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each step, considering all possible substrings of the current S, and for each such substring, compute the number of ways to split it into valid Morse code letters (each part being a valid code, i.e., not forbidden and of length 1-4), and sum all those numbers across all substrings.\n\nThis seems computationally heavy, but given that m is up to 3000, and the length of S can be up to 3000, we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's denote dp[i] as the number of valid sequences for the first i characters of S. Then, when we add a new character (say, the i-th character), we can look back and see how many ways there are to split the new suffix.\n\nWait, but how to compute the total number of sequences for all substrings. Alternatively, for each position j in S, we can consider all possible substrings ending at j. For example, for each j, we can look back k steps (k from 1 to 4, as the maximum length of a Morse code is 4), and check if the substring of length k ending at j is valid. If it is, then the number of ways to split the substring ending at j is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at j - k, plus 1 (the case where we take this substring as a single letter). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the standard problem of counting the number of ways to split a string into valid words. Suppose we have a string, and for each position i, dp[i] is the number of ways to split the first i characters. Then, for each i, we check for all possible k (1 to 4) such that the substring s[i-k+1..i] is valid. Then, dp[i] += dp[i -k] for each such k. And dp[0] = 1 (empty string has one way to split).\n\nBut in our problem, we need to consider all substrings of S. So for every possible substring, the number of ways to split it into valid Morse codes. So for each possible substring s, we need to compute the number of splits for that s, and sum all those numbers.\n\nBut how can we compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me consider that for each position i (the end of the current string), we can compute for all possible starting positions j (from 1 to i) the number of ways to split the substring s[j..i]. Then, the total sum for all substrings up to i is the sum of all these numbers for all j from 1 to i.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of using dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the total number of valid sequences for all substrings ending at position i. Then, for each i, we can look back up to 4 positions. For each possible k (1 to 4), if the substring s[i -k + 1 ... i] is valid, then we can add dp[i -k] + 1 (since the substring can be taken as a single letter, adding 1, and also any splits that were possible before i -k, combined with this new part). Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again.\n\nActually, the standard approach for counting the number of ways to split a string into valid words is the dp approach where dp[i] is the number of ways to split the first i characters. So, for the entire string, the answer would be dp[n], where n is the length of the string.\n\nBut in our case, the problem is different. We need to consider all possible substrings of S, and for each of them, compute the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse codes, and sum all these numbers.\n\nSo for example, for the string \"111\", the substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (positions 1)\n- \"1\" (positions 2)\n- \"1\" (positions 3)\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2)\n- \"11\" (positions 2-3)\n- \"111\" (positions 1-3)\n\nEach of these substrings contributes their own number of splits. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split as one way (as \"11\") or two ways (as \"1\"+\"1\"), so total 2 splits. So for each substring, we need to calculate the number of splits and sum all of them.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to: for the current S, sum over all possible substrings s of S, the number of ways to split s into valid Morse code letters.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently for each step.\n\nLet me think of how to model this. Let's denote that for the current string S of length n, we can compute for each position i (from 1 to n) the number of ways to split all substrings ending at i.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's imagine that for each position i, we can compute the number of valid splits for all substrings ending at i. Let's call this value f[i]. Then, the total sum after each step is the sum of f[1] + f[2] + ... + f[n].\n\nSo how to compute f[i]?\n\nFor each i, f[i] is the sum over all possible k (1 to 4) such that the substring ending at i with length k is valid. For each such k, the number of splits for the substring ending at i is equal to the number of splits for the substring ending at i -k (if any) plus 1 (the case where this substring is considered as a single letter). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the substring ending at i is of length k. Let's say that this substring is valid. Then, the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the part before it (if any) plus 1 (the case where the entire substring is considered as a single letter). But this is similar to the standard problem.\n\nWait, for example, if we have a substring that ends at i and has length k. The number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i -k (if any) multiplied by 1 (since each way to split the previous part can be extended by this new part). Plus 1 (if the entire substring is considered as a single valid code).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me take an example. Suppose the substring is of length k. Then, the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the first i -k characters (if any) plus 1? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think of the standard problem again.\n\nIn the standard problem, for the entire string, dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the first i characters. So dp[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (dp[i -k] if the substring s[i -k + 1 ... i] is valid).\n\nBut in our case, for each substring ending at i, we need to compute the number of splits for that substring. Let's imagine that for the substring s[j..i], the number of splits is equal to the number of splits for the substring s[j..i -k] (for k steps back) plus ... Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: For each position i, and for each possible length l (1 to 4), if the substring ending at i with length l is valid, then the number of splits for that substring is equal to 1 (if l is 1, and the substring is valid) plus the sum of splits for the substrings that end at i - l and are shorter. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, we can compute the number of ways to split all substrings that end at i. Let's call this total as F[i]. Then, for each i, F[i] is the sum over all possible k (lengths of the last part of the split) of the number of ways to split the substring ending at i with length k. For example, if the substring of length k ending at i is valid, then the number of ways for that substring is 1 (taking it as a single letter) plus the number of ways to split the part before it (if any). Wait, that's similar to the standard DP approach.\n\nWait, suppose that the substring ending at i is of length k. Then, the number of splits for this substring is equal to the number of splits for the substring ending at i -k (if there is any) plus 1. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, if the substring is length k, then the number of splits for that substring is the same as the number of splits for the string s[1..i -k] (if any) multiplied by 1 (since we can take the current substring as a single letter). But that's not accurate. Because the splits for the substring s[j..i] would be the number of ways to split s[j..i], which depends on how you split it. For example, if the substring is \"11\", then the splits are either as one letter (\"11\") or two letters (\"1\"+\"1\"). So the number of splits is 2.\n\nSo for each substring s[j..i], the number of splits is the same as the standard problem's dp[i - j + 1], assuming that the standard problem's dp is computed for the substring s[j..i]. But since the substrings vary, this seems difficult to track.\n\nBut here's an idea: Let's precompute for each position i, the number of ways to split the substring s[1..i], which is the standard DP approach. Let's call this dp[i]. Then, for any substring s[j..i], the number of ways to split it is equal to the number of ways to split the substring s[j..i], which can be found using a similar DP approach. However, since the substrings are arbitrary, it's unclear how to compute this quickly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each i, the sum over all possible j (from 1 to i) of the number of ways to split s[j..i]. Let's call this total_sum[i]. Then, the answer after each step is total_sum[i].\n\nSo how can we compute total_sum[i]?\n\nLet me think of how to compute total_sum[i]. For each i, total_sum[i] = total_sum[i-1] + (number of ways to split the substring s[1..i]) + ... ? No, that's not right. Because total_sum[i] is the sum for all substrings ending at i. For example, for i=3, the substrings ending at i are [s[1..3], s[2..3], s[3..3]]. The sum for total_sum[i] is the sum of the number of splits for each of these substrings.\n\nSo for each i, total_sum[i] is equal to the sum for each possible start position j (from 1 to i) of the number of splits for the substring s[j..i]. \n\nTo compute this, perhaps we can use dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to split the entire string s[1..i]. Then, for the substring s[j..i], the number of ways to split it is equal to dp_substring[j][i], which is the same as the standard DP for the substring s[j..i].\n\nBut computing dp_substring[j][i] for all j and i would be O(n^2) time, which for n=3000 would be 9 million operations. Considering that m is 3000, this would be O(m * n^2) which would be 9e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each i, we can compute the total_sum[i] based on previous values. Let me think again about the standard DP approach. Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to split the first i characters of S. Then, dp[i] = sum_{k=1 to 4} (if the substring s[i -k +1 ... i] is valid, then dp[i -k] else 0). And dp[0] = 1 (base case).\n\nBut how does this help us compute the sum over all substrings?\n\nLet me think: For each i, the total_sum[i] is the sum over all substrings ending at i. Let's denote that for each i, we can compute the number of splits for each substring ending at i. Let's call this value f[i]. Then, total_sum[i] = total_sum[i-1] + f[i]. Wait, no. Because total_sum[i] is the sum of all substrings ending at i (which is f[i]) plus the sum of all substrings ending at i-1 (which is total_sum[i-1] minus ... no, that's not helpful. Maybe not.)\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the substrings ending at i are of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4. For each possible length l (1 to 4), if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of splits for that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring up to i-l (if any) plus 1. Wait, no. For example, the substring of length l ending at i can be split in dp[i-l] ways (if we consider that the first i-l characters can be split in dp[i-l] ways, and then we add the current l-length substring as a new part). But that's only for the case where the entire substring is considered as part of a larger split. However, in our problem, we need to count all possible splits for the substring itself, not as part of a larger split. So this approach might not work.\n\nWait, but the number of splits for the substring s[j..i] is exactly the same as the dp value for the substring s[j..i], where dp_substring[j][i] is the number of ways to split that substring. But how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAnother approach: For each position i, and for each possible l (length of the last part of the split), we can track the number of ways to split the current string up to i. Let's think of the following:\n\nWe can maintain a dp array, where dp[i] is the number of ways to split the first i characters. Then, for the entire string, the number of ways to split it is dp[n].\n\nBut how to relate this to the total number of splits for all substrings?\n\nLet me think of the following: For each possible substring s[j..i], the number of splits is equal to dp_substring[j][i], which is the same as the number of ways to split that substring. However, we can't compute this for all j and i directly. However, perhaps we can find that the total_sum[i] is the sum over all j from 1 to i of dp_substring[j][i].\n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each i, when we add a new character (say, the i-th character), we can look back up to 4 steps. For each possible l (1 to 4), if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of ways to split the substring s[i-l+1..i] is equal to the number of ways to split s[1..i-l] (if any) plus 1? No, that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, for the substring ending at i with length l, the number of splits is equal to the number of ways to split the first i-l characters (dp[i-l]) plus 1? No, that would be the case if we're considering the entire string up to i. But for the substring s[i-l+1..i], the number of ways is the same as the dp value of that substring. Which is not directly related to dp[i-l].\n\nHmm. This seems stuck. Let's think of small examples.\n\nTake the first sample input where after three steps, S is \"111\".\n\nThe substrings and their splits:\n\n- \"1\": 1 way.\n- \"1\": 1 way.\n- \"1\": 1 way.\n- \"11\": 2 ways (split into two 1's or one 11).\n- \"11\": 2 ways.\n- \"111\": 4 ways (split into 1+1+1, 1+11, 11+1, 111).\n\nTotal sum is 1+1+1+2+2+4 = 11? But according to the sample output, the answer after 3 steps is 7. Wait, this contradicts. Wait, the sample output for the first input is 1, 3, 7. Let me check.\n\nSample input 1 is:\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAfter each step, the output is:\n\n1\n\n3\n\n7\n\nSo after the third step, the answer is 7. But according to my calculation, the sum is 1+1+1+2+2+4=11. So clearly my understanding is wrong. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right! The problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So each valid substring (i.e., the substring is a valid Morse code) contributes exactly 1 to the count. But earlier thinking was that each split of a substring contributes to the count. However, according to the first sample note, when S is \"111\", the answer is 7. Let me recount according to the note.\n\nThe note lists 7 sequences:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\nBut how many substrings are there?\n\nThe substrings of \"111\" are:\n\nLength 1: \"1\" (positions 1, 2, 3) → 3 substrings. Each is valid, contributing 1 each → 3.\n\nLength 2: \"11\" (positions 1-2, 2-3) → 2 substrings. Each is valid, contributing 1 each → 2.\n\nLength 3: \"111\" → 1 substring, contributing 1.\n\nTotal of 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. But the sample says 7. So this suggests that my initial understanding is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's the actual count? According to the note, there are 7 sequences. How does that come?\n\nThe note says that the sequences are:\n\n- \"T\" (from \"1\")\n- \"M\" (from \"11\")\n- \"O\" (from \"111\")\n- \"TT\" (from two \"1\"s)\n- \"TM\" (from \"1\" and \"11\")\n- \"MT\" (from \"11\" and \"1\")\n- \"TTT\" (from three \"1\"s)\n\nBut how are these sequences represented as substrings? For example, \"TT\" is a sequence of two letters, each represented by \"1\". This would require that the substring \"11\" can be split into two parts. But the problem statement says that the sequence is represented by some substring of S. So how can \"TT\" be represented by a substring? It seems that the sequence is represented by the concatenation of Morse codes, not the substring itself. But the problem says that the sequence is represented by a substring. That's confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nAh! Oh! Oh, I think I misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the sequence is represented by the entire substring. For example, the sequence \"TT\" corresponds to the Morse code \"11\", which is a substring of S. However, \"TT\" is two letters, each represented by \"1\", so their combined Morse code is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", which is exactly the same as the Morse code for 'M'. So the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the same substring as the letter 'M'.\n\nBut how is that counted? Does the problem count all possible ways to parse a substring into letters? Or does it count the number of distinct sequences that can be formed by any parsing of any substring?\n\nThe problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nSo, each such sequence is a concatenation of letters, and the entire sequence's Morse code is a substring of S. For example, the sequence \"TT\" has Morse code \"11\", which is a substring of S. Similarly, the sequence \"M\" has Morse code \"11\", which is the same substring. So the question is, how many distinct sequences are there such that their Morse code is a substring of S.\n\nBut that's not possible because different sequences can have the same Morse code. For example, \"T\" and \"M\" are different sequences, but their Morse codes are \"1\" and \"11\", which are different. Wait, but the problem says that each valid Morse code corresponds to exactly one letter. So the Morse code of a sequence is the concatenation of the Morse codes of its letters. Therefore, each sequence corresponds to a unique string of 0s and 1s. And the problem is counting how many distinct sequences exist such that their Morse code is a substring of S.\n\nBut then, the count is equal to the number of distinct Morse code strings (that are valid) that appear as substrings of S. Because each valid Morse code string corresponds to exactly one letter, and the sequences are determined by their Morse code. For example, the sequence \"TT\" has Morse code \"11\", which is the same as the sequence \"M\". So they are considered the same sequence? No, that's not right. Because the sequence \"TT\" is two letters, while \"M\" is one letter. But their Morse codes are the same. However, according to the problem statement, the sequences are different, but their Morse codes are the same. However, the problem says to count the number of sequences, not the number of Morse code substrings. So this would lead to overcounting, but the sample shows that this is not the case.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me re-examine the first sample note.\n\nThe first sample after three steps has S = \"111\". The note says the answer is 7. According to the note, the sequences are:\n\n- \"T\" (1)\n- \"M\" (11)\n- \"O\" (111)\n- \"TT\" (1+1)\n- \"TM\" (1+11)\n- \"MT\" (11+1)\n- \"TTT\" (1+1+1)\n\nSo these are seven different sequences. Each of these sequences has a Morse code that is a substring of S. For example:\n\n- \"T\" → \"1\" → appears as substrings.\n- \"M\" → \"11\" → appears as substrings.\n- \"O\" → \"111\" → appears as a substring.\n- \"TT\" → \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\" → same as \"M\".\n- \"TM\" → \"1\"+\"11\" = \"111\" → same as \"O\".\n- \"MT\" → \"11\"+\"1\" = \"111\" → same as \"O\".\n- \"TTT\" → \"111\" → same as \"O\".\n\nSo the problem counts these sequences even though their Morse code is the same as other sequences. This suggests that the count is based on the number of ways to split the substrings into valid Morse codes, and each split corresponds to a different sequence. Thus, the total count is the sum for all substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse codes.\n\nSo in the first sample, the total is 7. Let's compute it:\n\nFor each substring of S, compute the number of splits and sum them.\n\nLet's go through all substrings of \"111\":\n\nSubstrings:\n\n1. \"1\" (length 1): can be split in 1 way → 1.\n2. \"1\" (positions 2): same → 1.\n3. \"1\" (positions 3): same → 1.\n4. \"11\" (positions 1-2): can be split as \"1\" + \"1\" (2 ways?), or as \"11\" (1 way). So total 2 ways.\n5. \"11\" (positions 2-3): same as above → 2 ways.\n6. \"111\" (positions 1-3): can be split in several ways:\n   - \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" → 1 way.\n   - \"1\" + \"11\" → 1 way.\n   - \"11\" + \"1\" → 1 way.\n   - \"111\" → 1 way.\n   Total 4 ways.\n\nSumming all these: 1+1+1 + 2+2 +4 = 11. But the sample says the answer is 7. So something is wrong with this reasoning.\n\nWait, the sample says the answer is 7, but according to this calculation, it's 11. Clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nThe note explains that in the first sample, the answer is 7. According to the note, the sequences are:\n\n- T (1)\n- M (11)\n- O (111)\n- TT (1+1)\n- TM (1+11)\n- MT (11+1)\n- TTT (1+1+1)\n\nThat's 7 sequences. So how does this relate to the substrings?\n\nEach of these sequences corresponds to a unique way of splitting a substring into valid Morse codes. For example, the sequence \"TT\" corresponds to splitting the substring \"11\" into two parts. The sequence \"M\" corresponds to taking the entire substring \"11\" as one letter. But these are two different sequences, even though their Morse code is the same. However, the problem seems to count them as separate sequences. So the count is the total number of ways to split all substrings into valid Morse codes. Hence, for the first sample, the total is 1+1+1 + 2+2 +4 = 11. But the sample says 7. This discrepancy indicates that my understanding is incorrect.\n\nBut the sample says the answer is 7. So what's the correct way to interpret the problem?\n\nLooking back at the note, it says that the sequences are \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". Let's count how many of these are generated by the substrings.\n\nFor the substrings:\n\n- Each single \"1\" contributes one sequence: T.\n- Each \"11\" contributes two sequences: M and TT.\n- Each \"111\" contributes four sequences: O, TTT, TM, MT.\n\nSo the total is:\n\n3 (single \"1\"s) + 2*2 (two \"11\"s) + 4 (one \"111\") = 3 + 4 +4 = 11. But the sample says 7. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, but in the note, the count is 7. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So the sequences themselves are counted, but if two different ways of splitting the same substring produce the same sequence, they should be counted once. Or are they counted multiple times?\n\nNo, that doesn't make sense. For example, the sequence \"TT\" and \"M\" are different sequences, but their Morse codes are the same. However, the problem says that each sequence is represented by some substring of S. In this case, the same substring can represent multiple sequences. But the problem wants the count of all such sequences, regardless of whether they are generated by different splits.\n\nBut the sample shows that the count is 7, not 11. So this suggests that the problem is not counting the number of splits, but the number of distinct sequences whose Morse code is a substring of S.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, the substring \"11\" can be used to represent the sequence \"M\" and \"TT\". These are two different sequences. So the count should include both. But according to the sample, it's included as two sequences, leading to the total of 7. Let's count:\n\nThe sequences are:\n\n- T (from any single \"1\")\n- M (from \"11\")\n- O (from \"111\")\n- TT (from \"11\")\n- TM (from \"111\")\n- MT (from \"111\")\n- TTT (from \"111\")\n\nSo that's 7 sequences. But why are there not more? Because for example, the sequence \"T\" appears three times, but it's counted once. Similarly, the sequence \"TT\" appears twice (from two different substrings \"11\"), but it's counted once. Wait, but the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So it's the set of all such sequences, not the number of ways they appear. So each distinct sequence is counted once, even if it appears in multiple substrings.\n\nBut this would change everything. For example, the sample answer would be the number of distinct sequences, not the number of splits.\n\nBut the note says that the answer is 7, which matches the count of distinct sequences. So this must be the correct interpretation.\n\nSo the problem is to count the number of distinct sequences of letters whose Morse code is a substring of S. Each such sequence is counted once, regardless of how many times its Morse code appears in S or how many ways it can be split.\n\nBut how does this align with the note? Let's see:\n\nThe sequences listed are:\n\n- T (Morse code \"1\")\n- M (Morse code \"11\")\n- O (Morse code \"111\")\n- TT (Morse code \"11\")\n- TM (Morse code \"111\")\n- MT (Morse code \"111\")\n- TTT (Morse code \"111\")\n\nThese are seven distinct sequences. Even though the Morse code for \"TT\" is \"11\", which is the same as the Morse code for \"M\", they are counted as two distinct sequences. So the problem is asking for the number of distinct sequences, not the number of ways to split substrings.\n\nThis changes everything. Now, the task is to find all possible sequences of letters such that their concatenated Morse code is a substring of S. Each such sequence is counted once, even if it appears in multiple places.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nFor example, for the first sample, the Morse code substrings are:\n\n\"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\".\n\nThese are the substrings. Now, for each of these, we need to find all possible sequences of letters whose concatenated Morse code equals that substring.\n\nFor example, for the substring \"11\", the possible sequences are:\n\n- \"M\" (one letter)\n- \"TT\" (two letters)\n\nSo each of these sequences is added to the set of distinct sequences.\n\nSimilarly, for the substring \"111\", the possible sequences are:\n\n- \"O\" (one letter)\n- \"TTT\" (three letters)\n- \"TM\" (two letters)\n- \"MT\" (two letters)\n\nSo each of these sequences is added to the set.\n\nNow, the total number of distinct sequences is the number of all such sequences generated by all substrings of S.\n\nBut the problem is to find this number, and it needs to be computed after each modification to S.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe key insight is that each distinct sequence corresponds to a unique string of 0s and 1s (the concatenated Morse codes of its letters). So, for example, the sequence \"TT\" has the same Morse code as \"M\", but they are different sequences. However, the problem counts them as separate sequences.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of distinct strings (of 0s and 1s) that are substrings of S and can be parsed into valid Morse code letters (i.e., each part is a valid code, and the entire string is a concatenation of such parts).\n\nWait, no. Because the sequence's Morse code is a substring of S, and the sequence is any possible way to parse that substring into valid Morse codes. So for each substring of S, we generate all possible parses into valid Morse code letters, and collect all these sequences. Finally, count the number of distinct sequences.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, as for each substring, we need to generate all possible parses, and add the resulting sequences to a set. However, given that m is 3000 and the length of S can be up to 3000, this approach would be too slow.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to model this",

So the answer is the sum of dp[1] to dp[i] after each step!\n        \n        # So the approach is:\n        # - Maintain a dp array where dp[i] is the number of ways to split the first i characters.\n        # - After each step, the answer is the sum of dp[1] to dp[i].\n        # - To compute this efficiently, maintain a prefix sum array.\n    \n    # Correcting the code:\n    # Initialize dp[0] = 1\n    # For each i from 1 to m:\n    #   read the new character\n    #   for k in 1 to 4:\n    #       if i-k >= 0:\n    #           sub = last k characters\n    #           if sub is not forbidden:\n    #               dp[i] += dp[i -k]\n    #               dp[i] %= MOD\n    #   prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + dp[i]\n    #   print(prefix_sum[i] % MOD)\n    \n    # Now, let's implement this.\n    \n    # Reset variables\n    S = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    prefix_sum = [0] * (m + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        ch = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(ch)\n        current = ''.join(S)\n        dp_i = 0\n        for k in range(1, 5):\n            if i - k >= 0:\n                sub = current[-k:]\n                if sub not in forbidden:\n                    dp_i += dp[i - k]\n                    dp_i %= MOD\n        dp[i] = dp_i\n        prefix_sum[i] = (prefix_sum[i-1] + dp[i]) % MOD\n        print(prefix_sum[i])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
