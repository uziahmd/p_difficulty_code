For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem seems a bit complex at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo the task is: given n, k, f, compute the number of ways to choose c_s for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to output this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. So each string in the multiset is of length n, and for each shorter prefix, we count how many times that prefix appears as a prefix in the multiset's elements.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, we need to count all possible choices of c_s values (each between 0 and k inclusive) such that when you choose them, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nWait, but how do we determine what the maximum possible size is given the c_s values? That's the key part here. For a given set of c_s values, what's the maximum number of strings that can be in a beautiful multiset?\n\nLet me think about that. Let's consider that each string in the multiset contributes to all its prefixes. For example, if a string is \"01\", then it contributes to the counts of \"0\" (prefix of length 1), \"01\" (prefix of length 2), and also to all longer prefixes if there are any. Wait no, the string is of length exactly n. So for a string s of length n, all its prefixes of length from 1 to n are considered. Each of these prefixes must have their counts (number of times they appear as a prefix in the multiset) ≤ c_s (for that particular s).\n\nBut the problem says that for each s (prefix of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. So the constraints are on all prefixes of all strings in the multiset.\n\nNow, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s values is determined by some constraints. How do we compute that?\n\nThis feels similar to a problem where you have to find the maximum number of elements that can be placed under certain constraints. Maybe it's a tree-like structure where each node (prefix) has a capacity, and each element (string of length n) contributes to all its prefixes.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a trie. Each node represents a binary string (prefix). For example, the root is the empty string, but since our prefixes start from length 1, maybe not. But for the purposes of this problem, each node corresponds to a binary string of some length from 1 to n. The children of a node would be the extensions of that string by adding a 0 or 1. Each string in the multiset is a path from the root (but since the root isn't considered here, perhaps starting from length 1) to a leaf node of depth n.\n\nBut the constraints are that for each node (prefix s), the number of strings in the multiset that pass through s (i.e., have s as a prefix) is ≤ c_s. So the problem reduces to selecting a set of paths (each of length n) such that for every node (prefix) s, the number of paths passing through s is ≤ c_s. And we want the maximum possible number of such paths.\n\nThis sounds like a flow problem, but perhaps there's a way to model it with constraints that can be computed greedily.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is limited by c_s. However, the paths are constrained by their prefixes. For example, if a node s has two children, say s0 and s1, then the number of paths passing through s is equal to the sum of the number of paths passing through s0 and s1. But each of these children has their own capacities.\n\nSo, the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum capacities along the paths. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the problem as building the multiset. For each node (prefix), the number of paths that pass through it can't exceed c_s. However, each path contributes to all its prefixes. Therefore, the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimal constraints along the paths. For example, the root (if we consider all prefixes) would have the maximum possible number of paths, but each path is constrained by the capacities of all its prefixes.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s values?\n\nThis feels like a problem where the maximum number of paths is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s multiplied by something?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a tree structure. Each node s has two children: s0 and s1. The capacity of a node s is c_s. The number of paths that can pass through s is limited by c_s. However, each path that passes through s must go through one of its children. Therefore, the maximum number of paths is the sum of the capacities of the children, but each child's capacity is constrained by their own c values.\n\nWait, but this seems recursive. For example, the maximum number of paths that can be added under the constraints of node s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum number of paths that can be added under the children of s.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me think. Suppose we have a node s. The number of paths that pass through s is equal to the sum of the number of paths that pass through each of its children (s0 and s1). However, the total number of paths passing through s can't exceed c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of paths that can be added under the constraints of s is min(c_s, sum of the maximum paths for the children).\n\nBut this seems to suggest that the maximum number of paths is determined by a bottom-up approach. For example, for leaves (strings of length n), they have no children. So the maximum number of paths for a leaf is c_s. Then, for a node of length m < n, the maximum number of paths is min(c_s, max_children_sum), where max_children_sum is the sum of the maximum paths for each of its two children.\n\nIf that's the case, then the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is exactly the value computed by this recursive formula starting from the root (but wait, the root isn't considered here; the root would be the empty string, which isn't part of the problem's prefixes. However, the problem's prefixes start from length 1. So the root of the trie would be the empty string, but the first level nodes are the single-character strings. So for the entire trie, the maximum number of paths is the maximum number of paths that can be added under the constraints of the root node (which would be the empty string, but since that's not part of the problem's input, perhaps the actual root is the node of length 1? No, perhaps the root is the empty string, but the problem's c_s includes all prefixes of length 1 to n. However, the empty string isn't considered here. So perhaps the maximum number of paths is determined by the root node (the empty string) but since that's not part of the input, how does that work?\n\nWait, the problem says that the multiset is of strings of length exactly n. So each such string has a prefix of length 1 (the first character), length 2 (first two characters), etc., up to length n. Therefore, the root (empty string) would have all the strings in the multiset as its children. However, the empty string isn't part of the problem's c_s values. So maybe the actual root is the empty string, but its capacity isn't considered. Wait, but the problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, the count is constrained by c_s. So the empty string isn't considered here. Therefore, the maximum number of paths is determined by the constraints of the prefixes of length 1 to n.\n\nBut how does that affect the calculation?\n\nLet me think again. The maximum number of paths is determined by the constraints on the prefixes. For example, the root (empty string) is not part of the problem's constraints. So the maximum number of paths is determined by the constraints of the prefixes of length 1, 2, ..., n. However, the constraints for the prefixes of length 1 to n are interdependent.\n\nBut according to the earlier idea, the maximum number of paths is the value computed by a bottom-up approach. Let's take an example.\n\nFor example, take n=1. Then all strings are of length 1. The multiset is just a collection of 0s and 1s. For each of these, the count for the prefix (which is the string itself) must be ≤ c_s. The maximum size of the multiset is the sum of the counts of 0 and 1, but each can't exceed their respective c_0 and c_1. So the maximum is min(c_0 + c_1, ... wait no, because the maximum is the sum of the counts for each string. Wait, but each string in the multiset is of length 1. So for the string '0', the count of how many times it is present in the multiset is <= c_0. Similarly for '1'. So the maximum possible size is c_0 + c_1. Because you can take c_0 copies of 0 and c_1 copies of 1. So for n=1, the maximum size is c_0 + c_1.\n\nBut according to the earlier idea of bottom-up processing, for a node of length 1, it has no children. So the maximum number of paths for that node is c_s. But then, the parent node (the empty string) would have the sum of the two children's maximum values. However, since the empty string's capacity isn't considered, perhaps the maximum is indeed the sum of the maximum of the children. But in this case, the empty string isn't part of the problem's constraints. Therefore, the maximum is the sum of the maximum of the children of the empty string (which are the two nodes of length 1). But since the empty string isn't part of the constraints, there's no upper limit on the sum. Wait, but that's conflicting with the previous conclusion that for n=1, the maximum is c_0 + c_1. Which is correct.\n\nAh, so perhaps the maximum number of paths is determined by the value computed for the root (empty string) in this trie-like structure. However, since the empty string isn't part of the problem's constraints, its capacity is effectively unlimited. Therefore, the maximum number of paths is the value computed for the empty string, which is the sum of the maximum values of its children (the length-1 strings). But since the empty string's capacity is unlimited, the maximum is the sum of the children's maxima. However, the children's maxima are their own c_s values (since they have no children). So for n=1, the maximum is c_0 + c_1. Which matches our earlier analysis.\n\nAnother example: n=2. Let's consider the root (empty string). Its children are the two length-1 strings. Each of those has children (length-2 strings). For each length-1 node, the maximum number of paths is min(c_s, sum of children's maxima). For example, take the node '0' (length 1). Its children are '00' and '01'. The maximum for '00' is c_00, and for '01' is c_01. So the sum is c_00 + c_01. The maximum for node '0' is min(c_0, c_00 + c_01). Similarly for node '1' (min(c_1, c_10 + c_11)). Then, the maximum for the root (empty string) is the sum of the maxima of its two children, which is min(c_0, c_00 + c_01) + min(c_1, c_10 + c_11). Which would be the maximum possible size of the multiset. Because each path (string of length 2) contributes to the counts of its prefixes. So the constraints for each prefix must be respected.\n\nThis seems to make sense. So the general approach is to compute for each node (binary string of length l, 1 ≤ l ≤ n) the value m(s) = min(c_s, sum of m(s0) + m(s1)), where s0 and s1 are the children of s (i.e., s followed by 0 and 1 respectively). For leaves (l = n), they have no children, so m(s) = c_s. Then, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is m(empty string), which is the sum of m(0) and m(1), since the empty string's capacity is unlimited. However, the empty string isn't part of the problem's constraints, so its m value is the sum of its children's m values.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: for a given set of c_s values, compute m(empty) as described. And we need to count the number of c_s assignments (each c_s between 0 and k inclusive) such that m(empty) is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently, given that n can be up to 15, which implies that the number of nodes is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16 - 2 = 65534 nodes. Which is manageable for some dynamic programming approach, but how?\n\nBut the problem is that for each possible assignment of c_s, we need to compute m(empty) and check whether it equals f. However, the number of possible assignments is (k+1)^{number of nodes}, which is way too big for any brute-force approach. So we need a smarter way.\n\nThe key insight here is that for each node, m(s) depends on the c_s and the m values of its children. Since the nodes form a tree structure (each node has two children except leaves), perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, considering the dependencies.\n\nBut how can we model the number of assignments where the final m(empty) is exactly f?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider that for each node, the value of m(s) is determined by c_s and the values of its children. For a node s of depth l (length l), if l = n, then m(s) = c_s. If l < n, then m(s) = min(c_s, m(s0) + m(s1)).\n\nSo the problem becomes counting the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the root (empty string) has m(root) = f.\n\nBut how can we compute this? Let's think of the tree structure. The root has two children (depth 1), each of which has two children (depth 2), etc., until depth n.\n\nWe can model this with a DP approach where for each node, we track the possible values of m(s) and how they can be achieved based on the choices of c_s and the children's possibilities.\n\nBut since the nodes are in a hierarchy, perhaps we can process them in a bottom-up manner. For each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's parameters such that m(s) is some value. Then combine these for higher levels.\n\nLet me think about this. For a leaf node (depth n), m(s) is exactly c_s. So for each leaf node, the number of ways to have m(s) = x is 1 if 0 ≤ x ≤ k, else 0. Wait, no. Because for a leaf node, m(s) is exactly c_s. So for each possible value of x (from 0 to k), there's exactly one choice of c_s (x) that gives m(s) = x. So the count for a leaf node is 1 for each x in [0, k].\n\nBut for non-leaf nodes, m(s) is min(c_s, left + right), where left and right are the m values of the children. So for a non-leaf node, given that the left and right children can contribute various values, and c_s can be chosen between 0 and k, we need to find the number of combinations where min(c_s, left + right) equals a certain value.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's consider that for a non-leaf node s, once we know the possible distributions of m values for the left and right children, we can compute the possible m(s) values and the number of ways to choose c_s and the children's assignments that lead to that.\n\nThis suggests that for each node, we can compute a function dp[s][x], which represents the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's parameters such that m(s) = x.\n\nFor leaves, dp[s][x] = 1 if 0 ≤ x ≤ k, else 0.\n\nFor non-leaves, we need to consider all possible pairs of values (a, b) for the left and right children, and for each possible choice of c_s, compute min(c_s, a + b) and accumulate the counts accordingly.\n\nBut the problem is that for each node, the number of possible x values could be up to something like k * 2^{n - depth} }, but since n is up to 15, and for each node, the depth varies, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nHowever, even for n=15, the total number of nodes is 2^16 - 2 = 65534. For each node, if we can compute a dp table of size up to, say, 2e5 (since f can be up to 2e5), then the total memory might be acceptable. But given that for each node, the possible m(s) can be up to the sum of all possible contributions from the subtree, which for the root could be up to k * 2^{n} (if all c_s are set to k, then the root's m would be min(k, ...) but for deeper nodes, the values can be up to k*...).\n\nBut given that f is up to 2e5, and the problem requires us to count the number of assignments where the root's m is exactly f, perhaps we can model the dp tables for each node with possible values up to f_max (which is up to 2e5). However, for some nodes, the m(s) could be larger than f, but since we need the root's m to be exactly f, perhaps during the DP computation, we can cap the values at f, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the m(s) can be up to the sum of the maximum possible contributions from its children. However, for the root, the maximum possible m is when all c_s are set to k, and each node's m is min(k, ...). But for n=15, the maximum possible m(root) would be k * 2^{n-1}? Not sure. But given that f can be up to 2e5, and n is up to 15, perhaps for each node, the m(s) can be up to 2e5, and we can cap the dp tables at that.\n\nBut this seems a bit vague. Let's think again. For the problem, we need to compute the number of assignments of c_s such that the root's m is exactly f. So during the DP processing, for each node, we can track the possible values of m(s) up to f. But if during processing, the m(s) exceeds f, perhaps we can ignore those cases because they won't contribute to the final count (since the root's m needs to be exactly f). However, this depends on the structure of the tree. For example, if a node's m(s) is larger than f, but in the parent nodes, it's clamped by the c_s value. So we can't just ignore those possibilities.\n\nHmm. This seems complicated. However, given that n is small (up to 15), perhaps we can proceed with a memoization approach where for each node, we compute all possible values of m(s) that can contribute to the root's m being f. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me formalize this. For each node, we can compute a function f(s, x) which is the number of ways to assign the c_s for this subtree such that m(s) = x. Then, for the root node, the answer is f(root, f).\n\nTo compute f(s, x), for a leaf node (depth n), it's 1 if x is between 0 and k, else 0.\n\nFor a non-leaf node, we have:\n\nm(s) = min(c_s, left_val + right_val)\n\nwhere left_val is the m value of the left child, and right_val is the m value of the right child.\n\nSo for a non-leaf node s, we need to consider all possible pairs of left_val and right_val, and for each possible choice of c_s, compute min(c_s, left_val + right_val) and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nFor each node s, the number of ways is the sum over all possible left_val and right_val (from their respective dp tables), multiplied by the number of possible c_s values that would result in min(c_s, left_val + right_val) = x.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For a given pair of left_val and right_val, their sum is S = left_val + right_val. Then, for the current node's m(s) to be x, we have two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: x ≤ S. Then, we can choose c_s ≥ x. However, since m(s) = min(c_s, S), choosing c_s ≥ x will result in m(s) = S. Wait no. Wait, if c_s is chosen to be ≥ S, then min(c_s, S) = S. So in this case, if we want m(s) to be x, then x must be S. But if we want x to be S, then we can choose any c_s ≥ S. However, if we want x to be less than S, then we need to choose c_s = x. Because if we choose c_s = x, then min(x, S) = x. If we choose c_s > x, then min(c_s, S) would be min(c_s, S). But if x < S, then choosing c_s ≥ x would require that x is either S (if c_s >= S) or x (if c_s is between x and S-1). Wait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nFor a given S (sum of children's m values), the value of m(s) is min(c_s, S). So, for a fixed S, the possible m(s) values are:\n\n- All values from 0 up to S, by choosing c_s = x (so that min(x, S) = x) for x ≤ S.\n\n- Or, if c_s is ≥ S, then min(c_s, S) = S.\n\nThus, for a given S, the number of ways to have m(s) = x is:\n\nIf x < S: the number of c_s choices that are exactly x (so 1 if 0 ≤ x ≤k, else 0).\n\nIf x == S: the number of c_s choices that are ≥ S (so (k - S + 1) if S ≤k, else 0).\n\nBut wait, the c_s can be chosen between 0 and k. So:\n\nFor a given S, the number of ways to have m(s) = x is:\n\nif x < S: 1 if 0 ≤ x ≤k, else 0.\n\nif x == S: max(0, k - S + 1) if S ≤k, else 0.\n\nBut this is only if we have S as the sum of the children's m values. However, in this scenario, for the current node's m(s) to be x, the sum of the children's m values must be S, and then we choose c_s accordingly.\n\nSo putting it all together, for a non-leaf node s, the total number of ways to have m(s) = x is the sum over all possible pairs (left_val, right_val) where left_val + right_val = S, multiplied by the number of c_s choices that make min(c_s, S) = x.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For each node s, the number of ways to have m(s) = x is:\n\nsum_{S} [ (number of (left, right) pairs with left + right = S) * (number of c_s choices that make min(c_s, S) = x) ]\n\nBut S can be anything, and for each S, we need to compute the contribution.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of (left, right) pairs that sum to S? Well, for the left and right children of s, their dp tables (for their respective nodes) give the counts of ways they can contribute left_val and right_val. So for the left child, we have a distribution of possible left_vals, and similarly for the right child. The number of pairs (a, b) where a is a left_val and b is a right_val, and a + b = S is the convolution of the left and right distributions.\n\nSo, for each non-leaf node, the process is:\n\n1. Compute the possible distributions of left and right children.\n\n2. Convolve them to get the number of ways to have sum S for the children's m values.\n\n3. For each possible S, compute how many c_s choices would lead to m(s) = x, given that S is the sum.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive. However, given that n is small (up to 15), and for each node, the depth is up to 15, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut for each node, the possible values of S can be up to ... Well, for the root node, the maximum possible S could be up to k * 2^{n-1} (if all c_s are set to k, and the tree is structured such that each node's m is k). However, since f is up to 2e5, and k can be up to 2e5, perhaps we need to process up to f_max = max(f, k * 2^n) ?\n\nBut given that the problem requires the root's m to be exactly f, and during the DP steps, we can cap the values at f, perhaps we can optimize this.\n\nWait, but for the convolution steps, if we process up to a certain maximum value, say up to f, then for nodes higher up in the tree, their possible S may be larger than f, but when combined with c_s choices, they could contribute to the root's m being f.\n\nBut how can we handle that?\n\nAlternatively, during the DP steps, for each node, we can track all possible values of m(s) up to some maximum value. However, given that the maximum possible m(s) for the root is the sum of the maximum possible for its children, which for the root is the sum of the maximum of the two children. But the maximum possible for the children is min(k, sum of their children's m). So this seems recursive and hard to bound.\n\nBut given that the problem requires the root's m to be exactly f, perhaps we can cap the DP tables for each node up to f. Because, for example, if during processing a node, the sum of the children's m values is larger than f, then the current node's m can be either clamped to c_s (which could be up to k) or to the sum. However, if the sum is larger than f, but the c_s is chosen to be f, then the current node's m would be f. So even if the sum is larger than f, there's a possibility that the current node's m is f. Thus, we cannot cap the DP tables below f, but perhaps we can cap them at f plus some maximum value.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the possible values of m(s) can be up to the maximum between f and the maximum possible value of the sum of children's m. But this seems unclear.\n\nBut given that n is small (up to 15), perhaps we can proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each node, during the DP computation, track all possible values of m(s) up to some upper bound. Let's assume that the upper bound is f + k. Because, for example, if a node's sum S is larger than f, but we choose c_s = f, then m(s) = f. So even if S is larger than f, the contribution to the DP for m(s) = f is possible. Thus, for each node, the DP can track up to f + k (but since k can be up to 2e5, and f up to 2e5, this could be 4e5 per node, leading to 65534 * 4e5 = 2.6e10 operations, which is way too big).\n\nThis seems computationally impossible. Therefore, there must be a smarter way.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can note that for the root node, the m(root) is exactly the sum of the m of its two children (since the root's capacity is unlimited). Therefore, the m(root) is the sum of the m of its two children. But for each of those children, their m is min(c_child, sum of their children's m). Therefore, the maximum possible m(root) is when all the c_s are set to their maximum possible values. For example, if all c_s are set to k, then for each node, the m(s) would be min(k, sum of children's m). For a full binary tree of depth n, the m(root) would be k * 2^{n-1} (since each level doubles the count). But if k is up to 2e5 and n is 15, then 2^14 * 2e5 is way larger than 2e5. However, the problem requires that the root's m is exactly f. So if f is larger than this maximum, then the answer is zero. Otherwise, we need to find the number of assignments where the root's m is exactly f.\n\nBut how can we compute this?\n\nAlternative approach: For each node, during the DP processing, track the possible values of m(s) up to f. Because if during processing, the sum of the children's m values exceeds f, then for the current node's m to be x (which is <= f), the c_s must be chosen to be x (so that min(x, sum) = x). Therefore, for any sum S >= x, the contribution to the current node's m=x is the number of ways to have the children's sum be S multiplied by 1 (if x is within [0, k]).\n\nBut this seems possible. Let's formalize this.\n\nFor a non-leaf node s, and a target x (the desired m(s) value):\n\nThe number of ways to achieve m(s) = x is the sum over all possible S (sum of children's m values) of:\n\n(number of ways children can sum to S) * (number of c_s choices that make min(c_s, S) = x)\n\nNow, for the term (number of c_s choices that make min(c_s, S) = x):\n\nCase 1: x < S → then we must have c_s = x. So if x is between 0 and k, then this contributes 1. Otherwise, 0.\n\nCase 2: x = S → then c_s must be >= x. So the number of choices is max(0, k - x + 1) if x <= k, else 0.\n\nCase 3: x > S → this is impossible, since min(c_s, S) can't exceed S. So this contributes 0.\n\nThus, for any S, the contribution is:\n\nif x < S: 1 if x is between 0 and k, else 0.\n\nif x == S: max(0, k - x + 1) if x <=k, else 0.\n\nif x > S: 0.\n\nBut for the sum S, we can have S ranging from 0 to ... whatever. However, since x is fixed (the target for m(s)), we can split into two scenarios:\n\nFor x being the target, the sum S can be:\n\nEither S >= x (and then the contribution comes from case 1 if x < S, or case 2 if S =x), or S <x (but then case 3 applies, which contributes nothing).\n\nWait, no. For S <x, the min(c_s, S) can't be x. Because S <x, and min(c_s, S) can be at most S <x. So for x to be achieved, S must be >=x. So the sum S must be >=x.\n\nBut then, for x to be achieved, the sum S can be >=x. However, for each S >=x, the contribution is:\n\nIf S >x: then we need c_s =x, so contribution is 1 if x is between 0 and k.\n\nIf S =x: then contribution is max(0, k -x +1) if x <=k.\n\nSo for a given x, the total contribution is:\n\n(number of ways to have sum S =x) * (max(0, k -x +1)) if x <=k \n\nplus \n\nsum_{S >x} (number of ways to have sum S) * (1 if x is between 0 and k else 0).\n\nBut this seems manageable. So for a given x, the total is:\n\nterm1 = (ways_S_equals_x) * (if x <=k then (k -x +1) else 0)\n\nterm2 = (ways_S_greater_than_x) * (if x <=k then 1 else 0)\n\nSo total_ways = term1 + term2\n\nBut how do we compute ways_S_equals_x and ways_S_greater_than_x?\n\nThese are derived from the convolution of the left and right children's distributions.\n\nSo, for each node, the DP can be computed as follows:\n\nFor each possible x, compute the sum over all possible S >=x of the number of ways the children's sum is S multiplied by the appropriate factors.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For the children's distributions, we can precompute a prefix sum array. For example, for a given node, after computing the left and right distributions, we can compute for each possible value of S, the number of ways that the children sum to S. Then, for the current node's target x, we can calculate:\n\nways_S_equals_x = left_dp * right_dp (convolution at x)\n\nways_S_greater_than_x = sum_{S=x+1}^{max_S} (convolution at S)\n\nBut to compute this, we can precompute the cumulative sum of the convolution array.\n\nSo for each node, during the DP processing, we can compute the convolution of the left and right distributions, then compute for each x the required terms.\n\nThis seems feasible. Now, the question is, what is the maximum possible value of S that we need to consider for each node?\n\nSince the target for the root is f, and during the processing of nodes lower down, we can cap the S values up to f. Because for any S greater than f, if we are trying to reach a target x that is <=f, then for S >x, we need to multiply by 1 (if x is within 0..k). However, if during the processing of lower nodes, we track up to f, then for S greater than f, we can't capture that. Wait, but if we are trying to compute the number of ways for the root to have m(root) =f, then during the processing of the children, their S can be larger than f. For example, suppose during processing a node, the sum of children's m is S = f + 1. Then, for the current node's target x =f, the contribution would be the number of ways to have S = f +1 multiplied by 1 (since x =f < S). So we need to account for all S >=x, including those larger than f.\n\nBut if we cap the convolution arrays at f, then we would miss those contributions. Therefore, this approach would not work. Hence, we need to track S up to some higher value.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible S that can contribute to the root's m being f?\n\nWell, for the root's m to be f, during the processing of the root's children, their sum S can be any value >=f. However, for each of their children, their sum can be up to ... Well, it's recursive. But given that the root's m is f, and the root's m is the sum of the two children's m values (since the root's capacity is unlimited), then the sum of the two children's m values must be exactly f. Because the root's m is min(c_root, sum_children). Since the root's capacity is unlimited (as per the problem's constraints), c_root can be chosen to be arbitrarily large, so the min is sum_children. Therefore, for the root's m to be f, the sum of the two children's m values must be exactly f. Therefore, the root's children's sum must be exactly f.\n\nThis is a crucial observation! Because the root's m is the sum of its children's m values. Therefore, the root's m is exactly equal to the sum of its children's m values. Hence, for the root's m to be f, the sum of its children's m values",
