Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burnt-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is a. Each burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every b burnt candles, he can make a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn becomes another burnt one. So it's like a process that can loop until he can't make any more new candles.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2: \n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles, so 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burnt ones. He can make 4/2 = 2 new candles. So he uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burnt ones. Again, he can make 2/2 = 1 new. Use that, adding 1 hour. Now he has 1 burnt. Can't make any more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Start with 6, so 6 hours. Burnt:6. Make 6/3=2 new. Use them, 2 hours. Burnt:2. Now, can't make any more (since 2 <3). But wait, the total would be 6+2=8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours, and the number of burnt candles. Then, whenever possible, convert the burnt ones into new candles, add to the total hours, and track the new burnt ones.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think. Let's have variables:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburnt_candles = 0\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Initially, he uses all the a candles. So the initial total hours is a. Then, the burnt_candles is a. Then, while the number of burnt candles is >= b, he can make new candles.\n\nWait, but each time he makes new candles, he uses up some burnt ones. For example, if he has 4 burnt, and b is 2, he can make 2 new. So the number of new candles is (burnt // b). Then, those new candles are used, adding to the total hours. And then those new ones become burnt again.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\ntotal = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nthen:\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burnt // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new_candles \n\nSo this loop continues until burnt is less than b.\n\nYes, that seems right. Let me test with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal starts at 4, burnt is 4.\n\nloop:\n\nburnt >= 2. new_candles is 4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. burnt is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nAgain, loop: 2 >=2. new_candles is 1. total is 6+1=7. burnt is 0 +1 =1. Now, loop ends. So total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3. \n\ntotal starts at 6. burnt=6.\n\nloop: 6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. burnt is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now, 2 <3. So done. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. burnt=5. 5//5=1. total is 6. burnt is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nWhat if a=5, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 5. burnt=5.\n\nFirst loop: 5//3=1. total becomes 6. burnt is 5%3=2 +1=3. Now again, 3//3=1. total 7. burnt is 0 +1=1. So total is 7.\n\nYes. So the algorithm seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read a and b, then compute this.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\ntotal = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nloop while burnt >=b:\n\n    new = burnt //b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burnt = (burnt %b) + new\n\nreturn total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, edge cases. Let's think.\n\nCase where a=1, b=2. Then total is 1. Burnt is 1. No more.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. total is 2. burnt=2. new=1. total 3. burnt is 0 +1=1. done. So total is 3.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. Initial total 3. burnt 3. new 1. total 4. burnt is 1. done.\n\nWhat about a=7, b=3.\n\nInitial total 7. burnt=7.\n\n7//3=2. total 7+2=9. burnt is 7%3=1 +2=3. Now again, 3//3=1. total 10. burnt is 0 +1=1. done. So total 10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems solid.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nThe code should read two integers from input. For example, the input could be given as a single line with two numbers, like '4 2' or '6 3'.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b.\n\nThen compute as per the algorithm.\n\nSo code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n\n    new = burnt // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if a is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, a is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input 1: 4 2 → output 7. Which works.\n\nSample input 2: 6 3 → output 8. Which works.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5 → output 6. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3 → output 7. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n",
