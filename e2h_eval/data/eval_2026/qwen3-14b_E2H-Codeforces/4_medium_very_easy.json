The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of times each player loses in n rounds of rock-paper-scissors, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their own sequences. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the sequences work. For example, Nikephoros's sequence A is repeated cyclically. So for each round i (starting from 0?), he uses A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus's sequence B.\n\nThe main challenge here is handling the large n, up to 2e9. So iterating through each round one by one is impossible. We need an efficient way to calculate the number of losses for each player without simulating all rounds.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The idea is to find out for each possible pair of moves (a, b) in the sequences A and B, how many times they occur in the rounds. Then, for each such pair, determine who wins and accumulate the counts accordingly.\n\nBut since the sequences are cyclic, the total number of rounds can be broken down into full cycles of the combined sequences and a remaining partial cycle. However, since the two sequences have different lengths, the combined cycle would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. But even that might be computationally expensive if m and k are large. Wait, but m and k are up to 1000, so LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6, which is manageable. Because even for 1e6, we can precompute the number of losses for each possible round in that cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles and add the partial cycle.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Find the LCM of the lengths of A and B. Let's call it lcm_length. This is the length of the combined cycle where both sequences repeat their patterns.\n\n2. For each round in the LCM cycle (from 0 to lcm_length - 1), compute the move of Nikephoros and Polycarpus. Then determine who wins and count the number of times each player loses in this cycle.\n\n3. The total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // lcm_length. The remaining rounds are remainder = n % lcm_length.\n\n4. Multiply the counts from one full cycle by total_cycles. Then process the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle to add to the counts.\n\nBut how do I compute the moves for each round in the cycle? For each round i in 0..lcm_length-1:\n\nNikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to lcm_length-1, compute the moves and check who wins.\n\nOnce I have the counts per cycle, multiply by the number of full cycles and then add the counts from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but that returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay. However, note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers, but for zero? Well, since m and k are at least 1, no problem.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute lcm = m * k // gcd(m, k). But wait, what if m or k is zero? No, the constraints say 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000. So that's safe.\n\nNow, for each of the lcm rounds, simulate the moves and compute the number of losses for each player in that cycle. Let's call these per_cycle_nik (number of times Nikephoros loses in a cycle) and per_cycle_poly (same for Polycarpus).\n\nThen, total_cycles = n // lcm. So total_nik = per_cycle_nik * total_cycles, same for poly.\n\nThen, the remaining rounds is rem = n % lcm. For those rem rounds, simulate each round (from 0 to rem-1) and add to the totals.\n\nBut how to simulate the per_cycle counts?\n\nSo for each i in 0 to lcm_length - 1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine the outcome between a_move and b_move.\n\nFor each outcome, increment the per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly accordingly.\n\nSo, for example, if a_move beats b_move, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so poly += 1). If b_move beats a_move, then Nikephoros gets a spot (nik += 1). If draw, nothing.\n\nSo the key part is to compute for each pair of moves (a, b) who wins.\n\nLet me think about how to code that. For a given a and b, determine the result.\n\nWe can have a helper function, or just use conditionals.\n\nFor example:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a is R and b is S) or (a is S and b is P) or (a is P and b is R): then a wins, so b loses (so Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot).\n\nElse, b wins, so Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we can check this.\n\nSo, for each of the lcm rounds, we can compute this.\n\nOnce we have per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly, then multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen for the remaining rem rounds, we need to loop through 0 to rem-1, and compute the same.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, and lcm up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000, LCM could be 1000*1000=1e6), then the per_cycle processing is O(1e6), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the overall time complexity is O(lcm_length) which is acceptable for the constraints.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4). LCM of 3 and 4 is 12. So the cycle is 12 rounds.\n\nLet's compute for each of the 12 rounds:\n\nRound 0: i=0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. No spots.\n\nRound 1: i=1: A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S. P vs S: S beats P. So Nikephoros (P) loses. So nik +=1.\n\nWait, wait: Wait, the move of Nikephoros is a, Polycarpus is b. So when a is P and b is S: S beats P. So Nikephoros (a) loses. So his loss count increases by 1. So in this case, nik +=1.\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, the first round is R vs R (draw). Then the second round is P vs S. According to the sample explanation, Nikephoros loses here. So that's correct.\n\nSo in the first sample, for the first 7 rounds, the code would compute:\n\nLet me see the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4). So the LCM is 12. So total_cycles = 7//12 = 0, rem=7. So we have to process the first 7 rounds of the cycle.\n\nLet me compute for each of the 7 rounds:\n\nRound 0: i=0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. No spots.\n\nRound 1: i=1 → A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S. P vs S: S beats P. So Nikephoros (a) loses. So nik +=1.\n\nRound 2: i=2 → A[2%3] = S, B[2%4] = P. S vs P: S beats P. So Nikephoros (S) wins. So Polycarpus (b) loses. So poly +=1.\n\nRound 3: i=3 → A[3%3=0] = R, B[3%4=3] = P. R vs P: P beats R. Nikephoros (R) loses. nik +=1.\n\nRound 4: i=4 → A[4%3=1] = P, B[4%4=0] = R. P vs R: P beats R. So Nikephoros (P) wins. Poly loses. poly +=1.\n\nRound 5: i=5 → A[5%3=2] = S, B[5%4=1] = S. Draw. No spots.\n\nRound 6: i=6 → A[6%3=0] = R, B[6%4=2] = P. R vs P: P beats R. Nikephoros loses. nik +=1.\n\nSo total in 7 rounds: nik has 3 (rounds 1, 3, 6), poly has 2 (rounds 2,4). Which matches the sample output of 3 2. So the code seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B as strings.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly by looping over 0 to lcm_length-1, and for each i, get a and b, compute the outcome.\n\nThen total_cycles = n // lcm_length.\n\nrem = n % lcm_length.\n\ntotal_nik = per_cycle_nik * total_cycles\n\ntotal_poly = per_cycle_poly * total_cycles\n\nThen process the first rem rounds (i from 0 to rem-1), and add the counts.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\nImplement the helper function to compute LCM.\n\nBut how to compute LCM in Python?\n\nWell, LCM(a,b) = a*b // GCD(a,b)\n\nSo compute GCD using math.gcd, but note that in Python, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's fine.\n\nBut for Python versions, need to import math.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut then, for m and k.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, proceed.\n\nNow, for the per_cycle counts:\n\nInitialize per_cycle_nik = 0, per_cycle_poly = 0.\n\nfor i in range(lcm_length):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    determine outcome.\n\n    if a wins: poly +=1\n\n    elif b wins: nik +=1\n\n    else: pass\n\nThen, after processing all lcm_length rounds, multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen for the rem rounds, same process.\n\nBut for rem rounds, we can loop from 0 to rem-1, and for each i, do the same.\n\nSo code:\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 2e9, but the LCM is up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1e3, LCM is up to 1e3 * 1e3 = 1e6), then the code can handle that.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B)\n\nCompute lcm_length = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\nThen total_cycles = n // lcm_length\n\nrem = n % lcm_length\n\ntotal_nik = 0\n\ntotal_poly = 0\n\ntotal_nik += per_cycle_nik * total_cycles\n\ntotal_poly += per_cycle_poly * total_cycles\n\nThen for the rem rounds:\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    determine outcome and add to total_nik and total_poly.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the rem rounds, we can process them in the same way as the per_cycle processing.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code for determining the outcome between a and b.\n\nLet me write a helper function.\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)  # no loss for either\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so b loses. So Nikephoros (a) is winner, so Polycarpus (b) gets a spot.\n\n        return (0, 1)  # nik's loss count is 0, poly's is +1?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the variables:\n\nNikephoros is the one using A. So when a is Nikephoros's move, and b is Polycarpus's move.\n\nIf a wins, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses. So Polycarpus's red spot count increases by 1. So for the total_poly (which is the count of Polycarpus's losses) increases by 1. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the problem says, the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so his count (the second number in the output) increases by 1. If Polycarpus wins, then Nikephoros is the loser, so his count (the first number) increases by 1.\n\nSo in the helper function, for a and b, returns (nik_loss, poly_loss). For example, if a wins, then nik_loss is 0 (he didn't lose), poly_loss is 1 (Polycarpus lost). If b wins, then nik_loss is 1, poly_loss is 0. If draw, both 0.\n\nSo the helper function can return (nik, poly) increments.\n\nSo:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    # check if a wins\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so Nikephoros wins. Polycarpus loses. So add 1 to poly's count.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, Nikephoros loses. add 1 to nik's count.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, in the code, for each pair (a, b), we get the (nik, poly) increments.\n\nSo, in the per_cycle processing:\n\nper_cycle_nik = 0\n\nper_cycle_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(lcm_length):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    dn, dp = get_result(a, b)\n\n    per_cycle_nik += dn\n\n    per_cycle_poly += dp\n\nThen, total_nik = per_cycle_nik * total_cycles\n\ntotal_poly = per_cycle_poly * total_cycles\n\nThen, for the rem rounds:\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    dn, dp = get_result(a, b)\n\n    total_nik += dn\n\n    total_poly += dp\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4). LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nper_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly for 12 rounds.\n\nBut in the sample, the first 7 rounds give 3 and 2. So for the full cycles, total_cycles is 0, and rem is 7. So the code processes the first 7 rounds.\n\nWhich gives the correct result.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nBecause all rounds are R vs R, so all draws. So no spots.\n\nSo the code would compute LCM(8, 1) = 8. For each of the 8 rounds, all are R vs R. So per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly are 0. Then n=5, total_cycles = 5//8=0, rem=5. Process 5 rounds, all 0. So output is 0 0. Correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that the input is read as follows: the first line is n, then the second line is A, third is B.\n\nBut in the example given in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut perhaps in the actual code, the input is read via input(). But the user may have to read from stdin. So in code, the code should read n as first input line, then A as second line, B as third line.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys, math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    lcm_length = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    # compute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly\n\n    per_cycle_nik = 0\n\n    per_cycle_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm_length):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        # determine result\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            pass\n\n        else:\n\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n                # a wins, so poly gets a spot\n\n                per_cycle_poly +=1\n\n            else:\n\n                # b wins, nik gets a spot\n\n                per_cycle_nik +=1\n\n    total_cycles = n // lcm_length\n\n    rem = n % lcm_length\n\n    total_nik = per_cycle_nik * total_cycles\n\n    total_poly = per_cycle_poly * total_cycles\n\n    # process rem rounds\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            pass\n\n        else:\n\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n                total_poly +=1\n\n            else:\n\n                total_nik +=1\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, the code above uses the same logic as the helper function. However, in the code, for the per_cycle processing, it's checking whether a and b are equal, and then adding to the counts. But perhaps it's better to have a helper function, but for code brevity, it's written inline.\n\nBut this code may have a mistake. Let me check:\n\nIn the per_cycle processing, for each i in range(lcm_length), we compute a and b. Then if a and b are not equal, check if a wins. If so, add 1 to per_cycle_poly. Else, add 1 to per_cycle_nik. That's correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nIn the per_cycle processing for 12 rounds:\n\nBut for the code, the per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly would be calculated for all 12 rounds. Then, for n=7, total_cycles is 0, rem=7. So the code processes the first 7 rounds.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly the lcm_length. Then rem is 0, and the code adds per_cycle counts once.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then Nikephoros's move is R, B is S. So S beats R. So Nikephoros loses. So output is 1 0.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'P'. Then B's move is P, which beats R. So Nikephoros loses. Output 1 0.\n\nAnother case: A is 'R', B is 'R'. Output 0 0.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m or k is 1?\n\nYes, code handles that.\n\nNow, the code may have a problem with reading the input. For example, sometimes, after reading n, the next lines may have leading or trailing spaces. But according to the problem statement, the input is given as the second line is the sequence A, third line is sequence B. So using strip() is correct.\n\nBut in Python, when reading with readline(), sometimes there may be newlines. For example, if the input is given as:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen, the first readline() is '7\\n', then the second is 'RPS\\n', third is 'RSPP\\n'.\n\nUsing .strip() will remove leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines. So A and B are correctly read.\n\nSo code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=7\n\nA is 'RPS'\n\nB is 'RSPP'\n\nSo m=3, k=4.\n\nlcm_length is 12.\n\nper_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly are calculated for 12 rounds.\n\nLet's compute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\nBut for the first 12 rounds, let's see:\n\nRound 0: R vs R → no change.\n\nRound 1: P vs S → a is P, b is S. S beats P. So Nikephoros loses → per_cycle_nik +=1.\n\nRound 2: S vs P → S beats P → Nikephoros wins → poly +=1.\n\nRound 3: R vs P → P beats R → Nikephoros loses → per_cycle_nik +=1.\n\nRound 4: P vs R → P beats R → Nikephoros wins → poly +=1.\n\nRound 5: S vs S → no change.\n\nRound 6: R vs P → P beats R → Nikephoros loses → per_cycle_nik +=1.\n\nRound 7: P vs R → P beats R → Nikephoros wins → poly +=1.\n\nRound 8: S vs S → no change.\n\nRound 9: R vs P → P beats R → Nikephoros loses → per_cycle_nik +=1.\n\nRound 10: P vs R → P beats R → Nikephoros wins → poly +=1.\n\nRound 11: S vs S → no change.\n\nWait, but this is for the first 12 rounds. Let me re-calculate for each i in 0..11:\n\nLet me make a table:\n\ni | i%m (m=3) | A[i%m] | i%k (k=4) | B[i%k] | outcome\n0 | 0 → R | 0 → R → draw. → 0,0\n1 → 1%3=1 → P; 1%4=1 → S. P vs S: S beats P → Nikephoros loses. So per_cycle_nik +=1.\ni=2 → 2%3=2 → S; 2%4=2 → P. S vs P: S beats P → Nikephoros wins → poly +=1.\ni=3 → 3%3=0 → R; 3%4=3 → B[3] is P. R vs P: P beats R → Nikephoros loses → per_cycle_nik +=1.\ni=4 → 4%3=1 → P; 4%4=0 → B[0] is R. P vs R: P beats R → Nikephoros wins → poly +=1.\ni=5 → 5%3=2 → S; 5%4=1 → B[1] is S. S vs S → draw.\ni=6 → 6%3=0 → R; 6%4=2 → B[2] is P. R vs P → P beats R → per_cycle_nik +=1.\ni=7 → 7%3=1 → P; 7%4=3 → B[3] is P. P vs P → draw.\ni=8 → 8%3=2 → S; 8%4=0 → B[0] is R. S vs R: R beats S → Nikephoros loses. per_cycle_nik +=1.\ni=9 → 9%3=0 → R; 9%4=1 → B[1] is S. R vs S → R beats S → Nikephoros wins → poly +=1.\ni=10 → 10%3=1 → P; 10%4=2 → B[2] is P. P vs P → draw.\ni=11 → 11%3=2 → S; 11%4=3 → B[3] is P. S vs P → S beats P → Nikephoros wins → poly +=1.\n\nSo for per_cycle_nik:\n\nLooking at the cases where Nikephoros loses:\n\ni=1 → +1\n\ni=3 → +1\n\ni=6 → +1\n\ni=8 → +1\n\nTotal per_cycle_nik = 4?\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nLooking at each i:\n\ni=0: no.\n\ni=1: yes → +1 → total 1.\n\ni=2: no.\n\ni=3: yes → +1 → total 2.\n\ni=4: no (poly gains).\n\ni=5: no.\n\ni=6: yes → +1 → total 3.\n\ni=7: no.\n\ni=8: yes → +1 → total 4.\n\ni=9: no.\n\ni=10: no.\n\ni=11: no.\n\nSo per_cycle_nik is 4.\n\nper_cycle_poly: when Nikephoros wins.\n\ni=2 → +1\n\ni=4 → +1\n\ni=9 → +1\n\ni=11 → +1 → total 4?\n\nWait, let's count:\n\ni=2 → +1 → 1.\n\ni=4 → +1 → 2.\n\ni=7 → no.\n\ni=9 → +1 → 3.\n\ni=11 → +1 → 4.\n\nYes. So per_cycle_poly is 4.\n\nSo for the first 12 rounds, per_cycle_nik is 4, per_cycle_poly is 4.\n\nThen, when n=7, which is less than 12, total_cycles is 0, and rem is 7.\n\nWhich is the first 7 rounds. Which in the sample gives nik=3, poly=2.\n\nSo in the code, during the rem processing, the code adds 3 and 2.\n\nBut according to the code, for the first 7 rounds, the code would process:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 6 (since rem=7, range(7) is 0..6).\n\nSo for i=0: no change.\n\ni=1: nik +=1 → total_nik is 1.\n\ni=2: poly +=1 → total_poly is 1.\n\ni=3: nik +=1 → total_nik=2.\n\ni=4: poly +=1 → total_poly=2.\n\ni=5: no change.\n\ni=6: nik +=1 → total_nik=3.\n\nThus, total_nik is 3, total_poly is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for that sample.\n\nAnother example: if n=12, then total_cycles is 1. So total_nik is 4, total_poly is 4. So output is 4 4.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling very large n, but since the code uses O(lcm_length) time, which is acceptable.\n\nAnother thing: for the case when the LCM is larger than n, the code correctly processes the rem rounds.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when m or k is 1. For example, m=1, k=1. Then LCM is 1. So per_cycle is processed once. For n=2e9, the code would compute total_cycles = 2e9, and multiply per_cycle counts by that.\n\nNow, code should be correct.\n\nThus, the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their own sequences. The challenge is to efficiently handle up to 2 billion rounds without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Each player uses a sequence of moves that repeats cyclically. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is \"RPS\", his moves will be R, P, S, R, P, S, etc.\n2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The key insight is to recognize that the combined cycle of both players' sequences will repeat every LCM of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute the outcomes for one full cycle of these combined sequences and then scale the results to the total number of rounds.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: Calculate the number of losses for each player within one full cycle of the combined sequences. Use this to determine the total losses for all full cycles and then handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    lcm_length = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    per_cycle_nik = 0\n    per_cycle_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm_length):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            per_cycle_poly += 1\n        else:\n            per_cycle_nik += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm_length\n    rem = n % lcm_length\n    \n    total_nik = per_cycle_nik * total_cycles\n    total_poly = per_cycle_poly * total_cycles\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the length of the combined cycle.\n3. **Cycle Processing**: For each round within the combined cycle, determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) and accumulate the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Scaling Results**: Calculate the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds. Multiply the losses per full cycle by the number of full cycles and add the results from the remaining rounds.\n5. **Output**: Print the total number of losses for each player after processing all rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large numbers of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring that we avoid simulating each round individually.",
