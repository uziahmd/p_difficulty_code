The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, over n rounds. Each player has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each round, we have to determine who wins and count the number of times each gets pinched (i.e., loses a round). The output is the number of red spots on each after n rounds.\n\nConstraints are that n can be up to 2e9, which is a huge number. So simulating each round step by step is impossible because it would take way too long. We need an efficient approach here.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since both players' moves are cyclic, their move sequences repeat after m and k rounds respectively. So the combined cycle length is the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call this LCM value 'cycle_len'. Within each cycle of 'cycle_len' rounds, the same pattern of moves repeats. So if we can compute the number of wins for each player in one full cycle, then we can calculate how many full cycles fit into n rounds, multiply by the per-cycle counts, and then handle the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, let's figure out how to find the moves for each round. For each round i (starting from 0?), we can compute which element of A and B is used. For example, for the i-th round (assuming 0-based), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nThe key idea is to find for each possible pair of moves (a, b) in the sequences A and B, how many times they occur in the entire n rounds, and then compute the total wins for each player based on those counts.\n\nBut since the sequences are cyclic, the pairs (a, b) will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. So the total number of such cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_len, and the remaining_rounds = n % cycle_len.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_len.\n\n2. For each of the first cycle_len rounds, compute which moves each player makes, determine the outcome, and accumulate the number of wins for each player. Let's call these base_nik and base_poly.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_len. Multiply base_nik and base_poly by total_cycles to get the total wins from full cycles.\n\n4. Then, handle the remaining remaining_rounds rounds (from 0 to remaining_rounds - 1) by simulating each round once and adding the wins.\n\nBut wait, for the remaining rounds, we can't simulate each round if cycle_len is large. However, since cycle_len is LCM(m, k), which for m and k up to 1000, the maximum possible LCM is 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000. So even if n is 2e9, the cycle_len is 1e6, and the remaining_rounds is up to 1e6. So for each test case, the total processing time would be O(cycle_len) which is acceptable for 1e6 operations.\n\nSo the steps are feasible.\n\nNow, the first thing is to compute LCM(m, k). How to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python's math.gcd exists, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nWait, but for Python versions, but assuming that the code is written with math.gcd, and for cases where m or k is zero? But according to the input constraints, m and k are at least 1. So no problem.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, then for the first cycle_len rounds, we can compute for each round which move each player makes, compare them, and count the wins.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round in the cycle?\n\nFor each round i in 0..cycle_len-1:\n\nA_move = A[i % m]\n\nB_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen, compare A_move and B_move.\n\nNow, for each such pair, determine who wins. Let's think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beats paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nIf same, it's a draw.\n\nSo, for a given a and b, how to determine the outcome?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b and returns who wins. Let's think about the possible cases.\n\nFor example:\n\nif a == b: no one wins.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a is R and b is S) or (a is S and b is P) or (a is P and b is R): then A wins, so B gets a spot.\n\nElse: B wins, so A gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each pair (a, b), we can check these conditions.\n\nSo, for each of the cycle_len rounds, we can compute how many times A wins and B wins.\n\nOnce we have that, multiply by total_cycles, then add the counts from the remaining rounds.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A as a string, m = len(A)\n\nRead B as a string, k = len(B)\n\nCompute LCM(m, k) as cycle_len.\n\nCompute total_cycles = n // cycle_len\n\nremaining_rounds = n % cycle_len\n\nCompute base_nik and base_poly: the number of times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose in one cycle.\n\nThen, total_nik = base_nik * total_cycles + ... (the remaining rounds)\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nBut how to compute base_nik and base_poly?\n\nFor each i in 0 to cycle_len-1:\n\nget a = A[i % m]\n\nget b = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine if a beats b, or b beats a.\n\nIf a beats b: then Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count increases by 1).\n\nIf b beats a: Nikephoros gets a spot (so Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1).\n\nSo, for each of the cycle_len rounds, we can compute the number of times each player loses.\n\nSo, for the base_nik and base_poly variables, we can accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce that is done, multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remaining_rounds, we need to simulate each of the first 'remaining_rounds' rounds (from 0 to remaining_rounds-1), and add the corresponding counts.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nCompute base_nik and base_poly for the cycle.\n\nThen:\n\ntotal_nik = base_nik * total_cycles\n\ntotal_poly = base_poly * total_cycles\n\nThen, for the remaining_rounds, loop from 0 to remaining_rounds-1:\n\nfor i in 0..remaining_rounds-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\ncheck who wins, add to total_nik and total_poly accordingly.\n\nSo, the code should be manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=7\n\nA is \"RPS\" (m=3)\n\nB is \"RSPP\" (k=4)\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\ncycle_len is 12.\n\nSo for each of the 12 rounds, compute the moves.\n\nBut for n=7, total_cycles = 7//12 = 0, remaining_rounds=7.\n\nSo we need to process the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIn the example explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → S (Nikephoros's move is P, B's move is S. Wait, the example says:\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R - R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P - S (Nikephoros's move is P, Polycarpus's is S. So S beats P? Wait, no. Let me check the rules again.\n\nWait, the rules are:\n\nrock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nscissors beats paper (S beats P)\n\npaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nSo, if Nikephoros plays P (paper) and Polycarpus plays S (scissors), then S beats P. So Polycarpus wins. So Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1. Which is what the example says: in the first sample, Nikephoros has 3 losses.\n\nBut according to the example explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (since S beats P). So Nikephoros's spot count increases by 1.\n\nRound 3: S vs P → S (Nikephoros's move) vs P (Polycarpus's). S beats P. So Polycarpus loses. So Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo in the code, for each pair (a, b), we need to check if a beats b, or vice versa.\n\nSo for a and b:\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a is R and b is S) → A wins → B gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is increased by 1?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the loser is the one who gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot. If Nikephoros loses, he gets a spot.\n\nSo, when a beats b, Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, but Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1? No, no. Wait, the problem says: the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so he gets a spot. So Nikephoros's red spots count is not increased, but Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nIf Nikephoros loses, then he gets a spot. So the variables are:\n\nFor each round, if Nikephoros loses → add 1 to his count. If Polycarpus loses → add 1 to his count.\n\nSo, the code needs to track for each round, whether Nikephoros lost (add to his total) or Polycarpus lost (add to his total).\n\nSo for a given a and b, how to determine:\n\nif a beats b → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus loses → add 1 to Polycarpus's count (so Nikephoros's count remains same).\n\nif b beats a → Nikephoros loses → add 1 to Nikephoros's count.\n\nSo, the code for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: no change.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a, b) is a winning pair for Nikephoros → Polycarpus's count +=1\n\nelse → Nikephoros's count +=1.\n\nSo, how to code this?\n\nWe can have a helper function that returns which player wins, or if it's a draw.\n\nAlternatively, for each a and b, check the conditions.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # Nikephoros loses, so he gets a spot\n\nSo, in this case, for each round, if the result is 1, then Polycarpus's count increases by 1. If -1, Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo during the simulation, for each round, we can check this.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A, m = len(A)\n\nRead B, k = len(B)\n\nCompute LCM(m, k) → cycle_len.\n\nCompute total_cycles = n // cycle_len\n\nremaining_rounds = n % cycle_len\n\nCompute base_nik and base_poly for one cycle.\n\nThen, multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen, simulate the first remaining_rounds rounds and add to the totals.\n\nBut how to compute the base_nik and base_poly?\n\nFor i in 0 to cycle_len - 1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine the result.\n\nif result is 1 → Polycarpus's count +=1 (so base_poly +=1)\n\nif result is -1 → Nikephoros's count +=1 (so base_nik +=1)\n\nSo, in code:\n\nbase_nik = 0\n\nbase_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(cycle_len):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    res = get_result(a, b)\n\n    if res == 1:\n\n        base_poly +=1\n\n    elif res == -1:\n\n        base_nik +=1\n\nThen, total_nik = base_nik * total_cycles\n\ntotal_poly = base_poly * total_cycles\n\nThen, for the remaining_rounds, we do the same for i in 0 to remaining_rounds -1:\n\nfor i in range(remaining_rounds):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    res = get_result(a, b)\n\n    if res == 1:\n\n        total_poly +=1\n\n    elif res == -1:\n\n        total_nik +=1\n\nThen output total_nik and total_poly.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the LCM.\n\nSo, code for LCM:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. However, note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nBut need to import math.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nimport math\n\nThen, compute:\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ng = math.gcd(m, k)\n\ncycle_len = m * k // g\n\nNow, considering that m and k can be up to 1000, their product is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nNow, for the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7\n\nA is RPS (length 3)\n\nB is RSPP (length 4)\n\ncycle_len = LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo for the first 12 rounds, compute base_nik and base_poly.\n\nBut in the example, n is 7, which is less than 12, so total_cycles is 0, and remaining_rounds is 7.\n\nSo the code would simulate 7 rounds.\n\nWhich matches the example's explanation.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is 'RRRRRRRR' (length 8), B is 'R' (length 1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nn=5. So total_cycles = 5//8=0, remaining_rounds=5.\n\nEach round, A's move is R, B's move is R. All draws. So total_nik and total_poly are 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the edge cases.\n\nWhat if n is 0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nAnother case: when m or k is 1.\n\nAnother case: when the cycle_len is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, LCM is at least 1.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for very large n, say 2e9, and cycle_len is 1e6, then the code would compute the base counts once, multiply by total_cycles, which is 2e9//1e6 = 2000, and then process the remaining rounds.\n\nWhich is manageable.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nBut for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nBut the input is given as:\n\nFirst line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nWait, looking back at the example input:\n\nIn the first sample, the input is given as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is read as:\n\nThe first line is n, then the second line is A, third line is B.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as a list of two elements? Or perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A as a string.\n\nThe third line contains sequence B as a string.\n\nSo, in the example input, the first input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nBut in the example input given in the problem, it's written as ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'], which seems to be a mistake. Probably, the actual input is:\n\nFirst line is n, then A, then B.\n\nSo, the code should read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case is:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich gives output 3 2.\n\nSo, the code should read the three lines properly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing all steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n    else:\n        return -1  # Nikephoros loses, Polycarpus wins\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    cycle_len = m * k // g\n    # compute base counts\n    base_nik = 0\n    base_poly = 0\n    for i in range(cycle_len):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a, b)\n        if res == 1:\n            base_poly += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            base_nik += 1\n    total_cycles = n // cycle_len\n    remaining = n % cycle_len\n    total_nik = base_nik * total_cycles\n    total_poly = base_poly * total_cycles\n    # process remaining rounds\n    for i in range(remaining):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a, b)\n        if res == 1:\n            total_poly += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            total_nik += 1\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the code would compute cycle_len = 3*4 / gcd(3,4) = 12/1 = 12.\n\nThen, for the first 12 rounds, base_nik and base_poly are computed.\n\nBut in the example, n is 7, which is less than 12, so total_cycles is 0, and remaining is 7. Then the code processes 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the example, the output is 3 2.\n\nLet's check that.\n\nLet me simulate the code for the first sample:\n\nA is 'RPS' (m=3), B is 'RSPP' (k=4).\n\nFor each i from 0 to 11 (cycle_len=12), compute the moves and results.\n\nBut for the first 7 rounds (i=0 to 6):\n\ni=0:\n\na = A[0%3] = A[0] = 'R'\n\nb = B[0%4] = B[0] = 'R' → draw. res 0 → no change.\n\ni=1:\n\na = A[1%3] = A[1] = 'P'\n\nb = B[1%4] = B[1] = 'S' → P vs S. S beats P → Nikephoros loses. res is -1 → total_nik +=1.\n\ni=2:\n\na = A[2%3] = A[2] = 'S'\n\nb = B[2%4] = B[2] = 'P' → S vs P. S beats P → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus loses → res is 1 → total_poly +=1.\n\ni=3:\n\na = A[3%3=0] = R\n\nb = B[3%4=3] = B[3] = 'P' → R vs P → P beats R → Nikephoros loses → res -1 → total_nik +=1.\n\ni=4:\n\na = A[4%3=1] = P\n\nb = B[4%4=0] = R → P vs R → P beats R → Nikephoros wins → res 1 → total_poly +=1.\n\ni=5:\n\na = A[5%3=2] = S\n\nb = B[5%4=1] = S → S vs S → draw.\n\ni=6:\n\na = A[6%3=0] = R\n\nb = B[6%4=2] = P → R vs P → P beats R → Nikephoros loses → res -1 → total_nik +=1.\n\nSo after 7 rounds:\n\ntotal_nik is 3 (from i=1,3,6).\n\ntotal_poly is 2 (from i=2,4).\n\nWhich matches the sample output. So the code works.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is length 8, B is length 1. LCM(8,1) is 8.\n\nn=5, total_cycles = 5//8=0, remaining=5.\n\nFor each of the 5 rounds:\n\neach i from 0 to 4:\n\na = A[i%8] → R, since all are R.\n\nb = B[i%1] → B[0] = R.\n\nAll draws. So total_nik and total_poly are 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the cycle_len is larger than n? Like n=1, m=2, k=3. Then cycle_len is 6. So total_cycles is 0, remaining is 1. So process one round.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother case: n equals cycle_len. Then total_cycles is 1, remaining is 0. So the code adds base counts once.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. For m and k up to 1000, cycle_len can be up to 1e6. So for each test case, the code runs O(1e6) steps. Which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, but the code is O(1e6) steps, which is manageable.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when the number of rounds is very large.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds. The combined cycle length for both sequences is the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`.\n\n2. **Cycle Analysis**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of both sequences to determine the length of one full cycle of combined moves. This helps in breaking down the problem into manageable segments.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each round within one full cycle, determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) and count the losses for each player. Multiply these counts by the number of full cycles present in the total number of rounds. Handle any remaining rounds after the full cycles separately.\n\n4. **Helper Function**: Use a helper function to determine the result of each round based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n    else:\n        return -1  # Nikephoros loses, Polycarpus wins\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    cycle_len = m * k // g\n    \n    base_nik = 0\n    base_poly = 0\n    \n    # Calculate results for one full cycle\n    for i in range(cycle_len):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a, b)\n        if res == 1:\n            base_poly += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            base_nik += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // cycle_len\n    remaining = n % cycle_len\n    \n    total_nik = base_nik * total_cycles\n    total_poly = base_poly * total_cycles\n    \n    # Process remaining rounds\n    for i in range(remaining):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a, b)\n        if res == 1:\n            total_poly += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the move sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences determines the length of one full cycle of combined moves.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round within one full cycle, determine the outcome and accumulate the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remaining Rounds**: Calculate the number of full cycles and handle the remaining rounds separately to ensure efficiency even for very large values of `n`.\n5. **Result Calculation**: Combine the results from full cycles and remaining rounds to get the final counts of losses for each player.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle up to 2 billion rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the move sequences, reducing the problem complexity significantly.",
