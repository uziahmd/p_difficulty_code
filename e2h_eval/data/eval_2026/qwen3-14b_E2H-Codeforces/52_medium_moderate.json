Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the ones that have gone out. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The conversion rate is 'b' used candles to make one new. And this new one can be used again, so it's a recursive process.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 used candles are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those two, adding 2 hours. Now, those two are used, so he has 2 used ones. Convert them into 2/2=1 new. Use that, adding 1 hour. Now, he has one used candle. Since 1 < 2, he can't make any more. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's check:\n\nStart with 6, 6 hours. Then 6 used candles. 6/3 = 2 new. Use them, +2 hours. Now 2 used. 2/3 is 0, but wait, maybe there's another step? Wait, no. Wait, after using the 2, he has 2 used. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. So total 6+2=8. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nThe idea is that each time you use a candle, it contributes to the total hours, and then you add it to the pile of used ones. Then, whenever you have enough used candles, you can make new ones. But each time you make a new candle, you subtract the required number of used ones and add one new candle. But this new candle will be used again, so it's added to the total hours once, and then again added to the used pile.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this with a loop. Let's think:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nWe start with a candles. So, first, we use all of them. So:\n\ntotal_hours += a\n\nused_candles += a\n\nThen, while used_candles >= b:\n\n   new_candles = used_candles // b\n\n   total_hours += new_candles\n\n   used_candles = (used_candles % b) + new_candles \n\nRepeat until used_candles < b.\n\nWait, that seems like the right approach. Let's test with the first example.\n\nFirst example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 4, used_candles is 4.\n\nLoop:\n\nused_candles >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 = 2. total_hours += 2 → 6. \n\nused_candles = 4%2=0 + 2 → 2.\n\nAgain, loop:\n\nused_candles is 2 >=2. new_candles = 2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7. used_candles = 0 + 1 =1. Now loop ends.\n\nTotal is 7. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours =6, used=6.\n\nLoop: 6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. used is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So done. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. used is 5. Then 5//5=1. total becomes 6. used is 0 +1=1. Then loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 5, used=5.\n\nLoop: 5//2=2. total +=2 →7. used is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nAgain, 3//2=1. total is 8. used is 1 +1=2.\n\nAgain, 2//2=1. total 9. used is 0 +1=1. Now done. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually:\n\nStart with 5: 5 hours. 5 used.\n\nMake 2 new (5//2=2, 2*2=4 used). Now 5-2*2=1 used left. So 1 +2=3 used.\n\nUse the 2 new: 2 hours. Now 3 used.\n\nMake 1 new (3//2=1). 1 used left. Add 1. Now 1 +1=2 used.\n\nUse that 1 new: 1 hour. Now 2 used. Make 1 new. 2//2=1. Now used is 0 +1=1. So total hours is 5+2+1+1=9. Yes. So the code seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Start with total_hours = a, used_candles = a.\n\n- While used_candles >= b:\n\n   new_candles = used_candles // b\n\n   total_hours += new_candles\n\n   used_candles = (used_candles % b) + new_candles \n\n- Return total_hours.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead a and b from input. Then compute as per above.\n\nBut how to handle multiple test cases? The input in the example is given as two lines: ['4 2', '6 3'] and outputs are ['7', '8'].\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is a single line with two integers. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers. Wait, the sample input shows two lines, but maybe that's just for the example? Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, it's given as two lines. Wait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Let me check.\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is described as a single line with two integers. However, the sample input shows two lines. But perhaps that's a formatting error. For example, maybe the sample input is two separate test cases, but the actual code should read one line per test case. But the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\nSo, the code should read one line with two integers. However, in the sample input, it's given as two lines. But perhaps that's a formatting error. For example, maybe the sample input is for two separate test cases. But the user's code must read one line of input, split into a and b.\n\nSo the code would read a line from stdin, split into two integers, process them, and print the result.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines. But perhaps that's because the user provided two test cases. But for the code, the input is a single line. So for example, in the sample input, the first line is '4 2' and the second is '6 3', but the code should process each line as a separate test case. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is written as two lines for the two test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line. So perhaps the code should read one line, split into a and b, and output the answer.\n\nBut the problem says, \"the single line contains two integers\". So the code should read one line. So in the sample input, the two lines are two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to read one line. So perhaps the code should process each line as a separate input. But the problem says that the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines, but the problem says that the input is a single line. Maybe the sample input is presented as two lines for two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line. But in the problem statement, the input is given as a single line. Therefore, the code should read a single line, split into a and b, and output the answer.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead a line from input, split into a and b. Then compute the answer as per the algorithm.\n\nSo, in Python, the code could be:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the total hours.\n\nSo the code:\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    total = a\n    used = a\n    while used >= b:\n        new = used // b\n        total += new\n        used = (used % b) + new\n    print(total)\n\nBut let me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example: 4 and 2. The code gives 7. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 6 and 3. The code gives 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. The code returns 5 + 1 = 6. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\ntotal =5, used=5.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew =5//2=2. total is 5+2=7. used is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nLoop again: 3 >=2. new=3//2=1. total 7+1=8. used is 1 +1=2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total 8+1=9. used is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So returns 9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=2. Then total is 1. Because used is 1 <2. So returns 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Initial total is 2. used is 2. new is 1. total becomes 3. used is 0 +1=1. So returns 3.\n\nYes. So the code seems correct.\n\nSo the Python code is straightforward. Now, write the code accordingly.\n\nNow, the code should read from stdin, process the input, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b, then compute as per the loop.\n\nSo the code is:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = used % b + new\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can illuminate his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out candles to create new ones. The key is to optimally use the available candles and their byproducts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours initially.\n2. **Track Used Candles**: After each hour, the burned-out candles are collected. These used candles can be converted into new ones based on the given ratio `b`.\n3. **Conversion Loop**: Continuously convert the used candles into new ones as long as there are enough used candles to make a new one. Each conversion reduces the number of used candles and increases the total hours by the number of new candles created.\n4. **Termination Condition**: The process stops when there are not enough used candles left to create a new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = used % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the input values `a` (initial number of candles) and `b` (conversion ratio). The initial total hours are set to `a` since each candle burns for an hour.\n2. **Used Candles Tracking**: After burning all initial candles, we track the number of used candles.\n3. **Conversion Process**: In each iteration, we check if we have enough used candles to make a new one. If so, we calculate the number of new candles that can be made, add them to the total hours, and update the count of used candles (which includes both the leftover used candles and the newly made ones).\n4. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until there are not enough used candles to form a new one, at which point we print the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently reuse the burned-out candles, maximizing the total illumination time while adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
