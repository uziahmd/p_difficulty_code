A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So I need to calculate the maximum number of toasts each can make, given the resources they have.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFirst, calculate how much total drink they have. That's k multiplied by l. Then, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, because each of the n friends needs nl per toast. Wait, no. Wait, for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. But if they make t toasts, then total drink needed is t * n * nl. But the total available is k*l. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each toast requires per friend nl ml. So for one toast, total is n * nl. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl. So the total available drink is k*l. So the maximum t based on drink is (k*l) divided by (n * nl), integer division.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Total slices available is c * d. So maximum t based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, total is n * np. So maximum t based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources must be sufficient. So the maximum possible t is the minimum of those three numbers.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo let's compute each part:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml per toast. So 20 / 9 is 2.222... so integer division gives 2. \n\nLimes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (since 3 friends each have one). 80 / 3 is 26.666..., integer division is 26. \n\nSalt: 100 grams. Each toast needs 3 * 1 = 3 grams. 100 /3 is 33.333, integer division 33. \n\nThen the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCalculate the three possible maximums (drink, lime, salt) and take the minimum of them.\n\nSo the steps for code:\n\nRead the input as integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nThen output that result.\n\nBut wait, what if any of the denominators are zero? No, the problem says all inputs are positive integers. So no division by zero.\n\nBut let me check the constraints: the input numbers are positive integers. So n, k, l, etc. are all ≥1. So denominators like n * nl can't be zero. So no problem.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nCalculations:\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. n * nl = 3*3=9. 20//9 = 2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = 10 *8=80. 80//3 = 26.\n\nsalt: 100 // (3*1) = 33. min(2,26,33) is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available from the bottles, the total number of lime slices from the limes, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**: For each resource, determine how many toasts can be made based on the total available resource and the requirement per toast. This involves:\n   - **Drink**: Total drink divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total lime slices divided by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: Total salt divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Find Minimum Constraint**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value among the constraints calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    values = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = values\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Maximum toasts based on drink\n    toast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime = c * d\n    # Maximum toasts based on lime\n    toast_lime = total_lime // n\n    \n    # Calculate maximum toasts based on salt\n    toast_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    print(min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers representing the problem parameters.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: \n  - **Drink**: The total volume of drink is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle.\n  - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices is calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n  - **Salt**: The total amount of salt is directly taken from the input.\n- **Toast Constraints Calculation**: Each resource's constraint on the number of toasts is calculated by dividing the total resource by the required amount per toast for all friends.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value of the constraints derived from each resource, ensuring that all resources are sufficient for the number of toasts calculated. This ensures that no resource limits the number of toasts more than others.",
