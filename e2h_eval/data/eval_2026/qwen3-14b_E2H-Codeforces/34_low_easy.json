And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day period, I need to compute the sum of their sleep times, then take the average of all those sums. Then output that average with enough decimal places.\n\nHmm. So the first thing is to process the input. The input has multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the example input, it shows something like ['3 2\\n3 4 7', ...], which might be a list of test cases. Oh, but the original problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, maybe the user provided examples with multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads from stdin, which for programming competition problems is usually one test case per run. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. First line has n and k, second line has the array. So the code should read one test case. But in the example given, there are three different inputs and outputs. Oh, perhaps the user is showing multiple examples, but the actual code needs to handle one input at a time. So for the code submission, it's just reading from stdin once.\n\nSo the problem is: given n, k, and the array a, compute the average of all the sums of consecutive k-day periods.\n\nNow, the straightforward way is to compute the sum for each window of size k, then take the average of those sums.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, a naive approach would be O(n*k), which would be 4e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need an efficient way to compute the sums of all consecutive k-day periods.\n\nAh right, sliding window technique. Let's think about that. The sum of the first window is sum(a[0..k-1]). Then, each next window is previous sum minus a[i] and add a[i + k]. So we can compute all the sums in O(n) time.\n\nYes. So first compute the initial sum of the first k elements. Then for each next window, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new element. Then keep track of all these sums, then take their average.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is the average of all the sums. So the total number of windows is (n - k + 1). So for example, if n=3 and k=2, there are 2 windows. The sum of each window is 3+4=7 and 4+7=11. The average is (7+11)/2 = 9, which matches the first example.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the first window (sum of first k elements).\n\n2. Then, for each next window, subtract the element that's leaving (the leftmost element of the previous window) and add the new element (the next element in the array).\n\n3. Keep adding each sum to a total sum, then divide by the number of windows (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nBut how do we handle the initial sum? Let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, we can do:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\nThen, the total_sum starts with this initial sum.\n\nThen, for i in range(1, (n - k + 1)):\n\nWait, no. The number of windows is m = n - k + 1. So for each window starting at index 0, 1, ..., m-1.\n\nSo the first window is 0..k-1.\n\nThe next window is 1..k.\n\nSo for each step, the new sum is previous_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1].\n\nWait, for example, the first window is sum from 0 to k-1. The next window is sum from 1 to k. So the new sum is previous sum minus a[0] plus a[k].\n\nSo, for the sliding window approach:\n\nInitialize current_sum as sum(a[0..k-1]).\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum.\n\nThen, for each i in 1 to (m-1) (where m is the number of windows):\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n\nAdd this current_sum to total_sum.\n\nOnce all are processed, the average is total_sum / m.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n, k.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nif k == 0? Well, constraints say 1 <= k <= n, so no.\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k]).\n\ntotal = initial_sum\n\ncurrent_sum =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of `k` days from a given list of `n` days. The solution efficiently computes the sum of each consecutive `k`-day period using a sliding window technique to ensure optimal performance.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first `k` days to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Technique**: Iterate through the list, adjusting the sum of the current window by subtracting the element that is left behind and adding the new element that enters the window. This allows us to compute each subsequent window sum in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum Calculation**: Accumulate the sum of all window sums.\n5. **Average Calculation**: Divide the total sum of all window sums by the number of windows to get the average sleep time, ensuring the result is formatted to at least 6 decimal places.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    m = n - k + 1\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total = current_sum\n    \n    for i in range(1, m):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i - 1] + a[i + k - 1]\n        total += current_sum\n    \n    average = total / m\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first `k` elements is computed once, which forms the initial window sum.\n- **Sliding Window Technique**: By adjusting the sum of the current window iteratively, we avoid recalculating the sum from scratch each time, reducing the complexity from O(n*k) to O(n).\n- **Total Sum Calculation**: Each window's sum is accumulated into a total sum, which is then divided by the number of windows to find the average.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the required precision constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles large inputs within acceptable time limits.",
