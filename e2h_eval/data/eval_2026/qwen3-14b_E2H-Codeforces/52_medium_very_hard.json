Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Vasily and his candles. So he starts with 'a' candles. Each burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The thing is, every 'b' used candles can be turned into a new one. And this new candle can be used again, burning for another hour. The question is to find out how many total hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break that down. Initially, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 used candles are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those two, adding 2 hours. Now, those two are used, so he has 2 used candles. Again, 2 / 2 = 1 new candle. Use that for 1 hour. Now, that one is used. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Oh right, but then after that, he has 1 used candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So that's why it stops there.\n\nSo the process is: each time you use candles, you get some used ones. Then you can convert them into new ones. But each conversion requires a certain number (b) of used candles. And each new candle you make can be used again, leading to more used ones.\n\nSo how do we model this? Well, the approach would be to track the total hours and the number of used candles. Let's think step by step.\n\nInitially, total_hours = a. Because he uses all the initial candles. Then, the number of used candles is a. Then, while the number of used candles is >= b, he can make new candles. Each time, the number of new candles is (used // b). Then, those new candles are added to the total_hours, and the used candles are updated as (used % b) + (new_candles). Because the new candles are used again, so when they burn out, they add to the used pile.\n\nWait, but when you make new candles, you take (used // b) of them. So for example, if you have 4 used candles and b=2, you make 2 new ones. Then, those 2 new ones are burned, adding 2 hours. Then, after burning, they become 2 used candles. Then, you can make 1 new candle, which is burned, adding 1 hour. Then, that becomes 1 used candle, which can't be converted anymore.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nused = a\n\nthen while used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total_hours += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new \n\nSo this loop continues until used < b.\n\nYes, that seems right. Let's test this with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 4. used =4.\n\nLoop:\n\nused >=2: yes.\n\nnew =4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. used is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nLoop again: used=2 >=2. new=2//2=1. total is 6+1=7. used is 0 +1=1. Now, loop ends. So total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example from the input: 6 and 3. Output is 8.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial total is 6. used=6.\n\nLoop: 6//3=2. total becomes 6+2=8. used is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now, 2 <3, so loop ends. So total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. used=5. Then 5//5=1, total becomes 6. used is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 5. used=5.\n\nFirst loop: 5//3=1. total becomes 5+1=6. used is 5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nLoop again: 3//3=1. total is 6+1=7. used is 0 +1=1. Now done. So total is 7.\n\nBut wait, what if a=3 and b=3. Then initial total is 3. used is 3. Then 3//3=1. total is 4. used is 0 +1=1. So total is 4. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=3. Then initial total is 2. used is 2. Since 2 <3, no more. So total is 2.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read a and b.\n\n- Initialize total = a.\n\n- used = a.\n\n- While used >= b:\n\n   new_candles = used // b\n\n   total += new_candles\n\n   used = (used % b) + new_candles\n\n- Return total.\n\nYes. So the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead the input. Wait, the input is two integers per line. Wait, the input is given as a single line with two integers. For example, the first sample input is '4 2', and the output is 7. So the code needs to read two integers from stdin.\n\nSo in Python:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, compute as per the steps.\n\nSo code:\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, that's all? Let me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 4 2. The code:\n\ntotal =4, used=4.\n\nLoop: 4 >=2. new=2. total becomes 6. used is 4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nLoop again: 2 >=2. new=1. total 7. used is 0 +1=1. Loop ends. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 6 3. total=6, used=6. new=2. total becomes 8. used is 0+2=2. loop ends. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. total=5, used=5. new=1. total 6. used=0+1=1. loop ends. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. total is 3 +1=4. Correct.\n\nWhat about a=1, b=2. Then, total is 1. used=1. loop not entered. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial total=5, used=5.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew =5//2=2. total is 5+2=7. used is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nLoop again: 3//2=1. total 8. used is 1 +1=2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total 9. used is 0 +1=1. loop ends. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually:\n\nStart with 5 candles. Burn them all (5h). 5 used. Make 2 new (5//2=2). Burn them (2h). Now, 2 used. So 2 + 2 = 4 used? Wait, no. Wait, after burning the 2 new ones, the used is 2. Then, 2//2=1 new. So burn that (1h). Now, used is 1 (from previous 2%2=0 +1). So total is 5+2+1=8? Wait, but according to the code, the total was 5 + 2 + 1 + 1? Wait no. Let me retrace:\n\nOriginal code steps:\n\na=5, b=2.\n\ntotal starts as 5. used is 5.\n\nFirst iteration: new is 5//2=2. total +=2 → 7. used is 5%2=1 +2 =3.\n\nSecond iteration: new is 3//2=1. total becomes 7+1=8. used is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nThird iteration: new is 2//2=1. total becomes 8+1=9. used is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So total is 9.\n\nBut let's think:\n\nOriginal 5 candles → 5h. Then 5 used → 2 new. Burn them → +2h. Now, 2 used. So 2 used. Then make 1 new. Burn it → +1h. Now, 1 used. So total is 5+2+1 = 8. But according to code it's 9. Wait, why?\n\nWait, what's the mistake here?\n\nWait, when you make the new candles, the used candles are being converted into new ones. Let me retrace:\n\nOriginal 5 used candles. So first, you make 2 new. That uses 4 used candles (since 5//2=2, which is 2*2=4). So 5 -4 = 1 left. Then add 2 new. So used becomes 1 + 2 =3. Then, when you burn those 2 new candles, you add 2 hours. So after that, you have 3 used candles (the 1 leftover from before plus the 2 new ones that were burned). Then, you make 1 new (3//2=1). So that uses 2 of the 3 used. Now, the used is 1 (3%2=1) plus 1 new candle. Then you burn that new candle, adding 1 hour. Now, the used is 1 (from before) +1 (from burning the new) = 2. Then, you can make another new candle. Wait, but according to the code, after the third iteration, the used is 1. Wait, perhaps my manual calculation is wrong.\n\nLet me redo the code steps:\n\nLet me track each step:\n\nInitial:\n\ntotal =5, used=5.\n\nLoop 1:\n\nnew =5//2=2. total becomes 5+2=7. used is (5%2) + 2 = 1 +2 =3.\n\nLoop 2:\n\nnew =3//2=1. total becomes 7+1=8. used is (3%2) +1 =1 +1=2.\n\nLoop3:\n\nnew=2//2=1. total becomes 8+1=9. used is (2%2) +1=0+1=1. Now, loop ends.\n\nSo according to code, total is 9.\n\nBut according to my manual calculation earlier, I thought it should be 8. Where is the error?\n\nLet me think again:\n\nOriginal 5 candles. Burned for 5 hours. Then, 5 used. Make 2 new. So burn them, adding 2 hours. Now, the used is 5 - 2*2=1 (original used) + 2 (new ones burned) = 3? Or how?\n\nWait, when you make 2 new candles, you take 4 used ones. Then, you have 1 used left. Then, you burn the 2 new candles. So after burning, you have 1 (from before) + 2 (from burning the new ones) = 3 used. Then, you make 1 new candle (using 2 of the 3). Then, burn that new candle, adding 1 hour. Now, you have 1 (from 3-2=1) +1 (from burning the new) = 2. Then, you can make another candle. Wait, but in the code, after that, used is 2. So why does the code stop?\n\nWait, in the code, after the third iteration, used is 1. Wait, let me check the code steps again.\n\nAfter the second iteration, used is 2. So in the third iteration:\n\nnew =2//2=1. total increases by 1 (to 8+1=9). Then, used becomes (2%2) +1=0 +1=1. So now, used is 1. Which is less than b=2. So loop ends. But according to my manual calculation, after burning the new candle (the 1 made from 2 used), we have 1 used (from the previous 2%2=0 +1). So that's 1 used. But why can't we make another candle?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the manual calculation. Let me track all steps again:\n\nInitial: a=5, b=2.\n\ntotal =5, used=5.\n\nStep 1: make 2 new candles. So 5//2=2. So total becomes 5+2=7. Now, these 2 new candles are burned. So after burning, they add 2 hours. Then, the used candles are (original 5 - 2*2=1) + 2 (the new ones that were burned) = 1 +2 =3. So used is 3.\n\nStep 2: make 1 new (3//2=1). total becomes 7+1=8. Now, this new candle is burned, adding 1 hour. The used candles are (3 - 2=1) +1 (the new burned) = 2.\n\nStep3: make 1 new (2//2=1). total becomes 8+1=9. Now, this new candle is burned, adding 1 hour. The used candles are (2-2=0) +1 =1.\n\nSo after this, used is 1. So no more. So total is 9. Which is correct.\n\nBut why did I think earlier that it should be 8? Because I must have miscalculated.\n\nSo the code is correct. So the code works for that case.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct. So the code is as follows.\n\nNow, the code needs to read a and b from input. Then compute as per the steps.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line as two integers. Then compute.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut wait, the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input is given as a single line with two integers. The sample input shows two examples, but perhaps that's just for illustration. The actual input is a single line with two integers. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '4 2' and the output is 7, and the second is '6 3' with output 8. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input shows two test cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle one test case per run.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo the code should read a single line, split into two integers, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['4 2', '6 3'], which probably represents two test cases. However, the user's code is supposed to process one input line. So perhaps the sample input is showing two test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one.\n\nSo the code is written for one test case. So the code is as follows.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input, compute the total as explained.\n\nSo the code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = (used % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's the code. Let me check for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: a=1, b=2. Output is 1.\n\nEdge case 2: a=1, b=1000. Output is 1.\n\nEdge case 3: a=5, b=5. Output is 5 +1=6.\n\nAnother case: a=0? But according to the problem statement, a is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Then total is 2 +1=3. Because initial used is 2. Make 1 new, add 1 hour. Then used is 0 +1=1. So total is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using candles, considering he can reuse the remnants of burned-out candles to create new ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours initially.\n2. **Track Used Candles**: After burning all initial candles, collect the remnants. These remnants can be converted into new candles based on the given ratio `b`.\n3. **Iterative Conversion**: Continuously convert used candles into new ones as long as there are enough remnants to form a new candle. Each new candle adds an additional hour of light and contributes more remnants when it burns out.\n4. **Loop Until Exhaustion**: Keep track of the total hours and the number of used candles. The loop continues until there are not enough remnants to form another candle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nused = a\nwhile used >= b:\n    new = used // b\n    total += new\n    used = (used % b) + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by reading the input values `a` (number of initial candles) and `b` (the number of used candles needed to make a new one).\n2. **Total Hours Calculation**: Initialize `total` with `a` since each initial candle provides one hour of light.\n3. **Used Candles Tracking**: Track the number of used candles after each burn cycle.\n4. **Conversion Loop**: In each iteration of the loop, calculate how many new candles can be made from the used ones. Add these new candles to the total hours and update the count of used candles to include both the remnants from the previous conversion and the new burned candles.\n5. **Termination**: The loop terminates when there are not enough used candles to form a new one, at which point we print the total number of hours the room can be illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion process and ensures that all possible hours of illumination are accounted for, even after multiple conversions of used candles into new ones.",
