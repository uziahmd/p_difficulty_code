Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo, what does that mean for the order of characters? Well, since I can swap 0s and 1s, and 1s and 2s, but not 0s and 2s. So maybe the 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s, but 0s can't move past 2s. Wait, but if I can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, then maybe 0s can end up before 2s through some steps. Like, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, then maybe I can swap the 0 and 1 first, then the 1 and 2. But that would make the 0 come before the 2. Wait, but in that case, the 0 can move past the 1, and then the 1 can move past the 2. So the 0 can end up before the 2. So maybe the overall order is that 0s can be moved to the left as much as possible, then 1s, then 2s. But how?\n\nWait, but the swaps allowed are between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So the relative order between 0 and 2 can't be changed directly. But maybe through 1s. For example, if there's a 0, then a 1, then a 2. Then the 0 can move to the right of the 1 (by swapping with it), and the 1 can move to the right of the 2. But that would leave the 0 before the 2. So maybe the 0 can be moved past the 1, and the 1 can be moved past the 2, but the 0 can't be moved past the 2. Wait, no. Because once the 0 is next to the 2, but they can't be swapped. So if there's a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. So the 0 can't pass through the 2. So the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Wait, but maybe if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2. Then, the 0 can move past the 1, and then the 1 can move past the 2. But that would result in 0, 2, 1? Or wait, let me think:\n\nOriginal sequence: 0 1 2.\n\nFirst, swap 0 and 1: becomes 1 0 2. Then, swap 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. So you can't. But then, the 1 and 2 can be swapped. So after swapping 1 and 2, the sequence becomes 1 2 0. Wait, but that's not helpful. Hmm. So maybe the 0 can't get past the 2. So in this case, the 0 can only move to the left of the 1, but can't move past the 2. So the 0 can be moved to the left of the 1, but the 2 can be moved to the right of the 1. So the 0 and 2 can't cross each other. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string is preserved? Because you can't swap them. So for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, they can't be swapped. So the 0 will always be before the 2. If there's a 2 followed by a 0, they can't be swapped, so the 2 remains before the 0. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s are fixed. Only the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s. \n\nWait, that's a key insight. Because the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So the 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. But 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string is fixed. So the final string must have all 0s and 2s in the same order as they were in the original string. But the 1s can be moved around between them. So for example, if the original string is 0 2, then the final string is still 0 ",
    "response": "To solve the problem of finding the minimum lexicographical string from a given ternary string using specific swap rules, we need to understand the constraints:\n\n- We can **swap** adjacent:\n  - `'0'` and `'1'`\n  - `'1'` and `'2'`\n- But **not** `'0'` and `'2'` directly.\n\nThis implies that:\n- `'0'`s and `'2'`s **cannot** pass each other.
