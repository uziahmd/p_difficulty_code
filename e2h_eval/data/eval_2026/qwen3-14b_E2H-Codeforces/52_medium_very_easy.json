Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Vasily and his candles. So he starts with 'a' candles. Each burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The thing is, every 'b' used candles can be turned into a new one. And this new candle can be used again, burning for another hour. The question is to find out how many total hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2. So initially, he has 4 candles. He uses them all, giving 4 hours. Then, he has 4 used candles. Since b is 2, he can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those, adding 2 hours. Now, those two are now used. So he has 2 used candles. Again, divide by 2 to get 1 new. Add 1 hour. Now, that one is used. So he has 1 used candle. But since 1 is less than 2, he can't make any more. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Use them, 2 hours. Now 2 used. Not enough for 3. Wait, but wait. Wait, after using the 2, he has 2 used. But 2 is less than 3. So no more. But the sample output is 8. Wait 6 + 2 is 8? Oh right, because the initial 6 gives 6 hours, then 6 /3 is 2. So adding 2 hours. Total 8. Oh right. So that's the case.\n\nSo the process is: each time you use all the available candles, collect the used ones, convert them into new ones, and repeat until you can't make any more.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours and the number of used candles. Let me think of the steps:\n\nStart with a candles. Total hours is 0.\n\nBut wait, each time you light a candle, it burns for an hour. So the initial step is to burn all the candles. So for the initial a candles, you add a hours. Then, you have a used candles. Then, you can make a // b new candles. Then, those new ones are burned, adding (a//b) hours. Then, you have (a % b) + (a//b) used candles. Because the ones you made from the previous step are now used. Then repeat the process.\n\nWait, but the process is:\n\nEach time, the number of used candles is the ones from the previous step. So let's think of it as:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_used = a\n\nwhile current_used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = current_used // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    current_used = (current_used % b) + new_candles\n\nSo the initial step is that the current_used is a. Then, in each iteration, we take the current_used, divide by b to get new candles. Add that to the total. Then the new current_used is the remainder (current_used % b) plus the new_candles (since those new ones are now used after being burned).\n\nWait, but the initial step is that the total hours is a. Because when you first burn all the candles. Then, the used candles are a. Then, you make new ones. So maybe the code should be:\n\ntotal = 0\n\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n\n    new = current // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    current = (current % b) + new\n\nBut then, the initial total is zero. Wait no. Because the initial a candles are burned, which contributes a hours. Then, the used candles are a. Then, the process of making new ones. So the initial total is a, and then the process is:\n\ncurrent_used = a\n\nthen:\n\nwhile current_used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = current_used // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    current_used = (current_used % b) + new_candles\n\nWait, but in the first example, initial a is 4. So total starts as 4. Then current_used is 4. Then 4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. current_used is 4%2=0 +2 = 2. Then again, 2 >=2. 2//2=1. total is 6+1=7. current_used is 0 +1 =1. Now, 1 <2. So loop ends. So total is 7. Which matches.\n\nYes. So the code would be:\n\ntotal = a\n\ncurrent_used = a\n\nwhile current_used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = current_used // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    current_used = (current_used % b) + new_candles\n\nreturn total\n\nWait, but why do we add new_candles to the current_used? Because after making new_candles, those are now used once they are burned. So when you make new_candles, you burn them, which adds new_candles to the total. Then, after burning, they become used, so the next step's current_used is (current_used % b) (the leftover from previous step) plus the new_candles (which are now used).\n\nYes. So that seems correct.\n\nLet me test the first example again.\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal starts as 4. current_used is 4.\n\nLoop:\n\ncurrent_used >=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6.\n\ncurrent_used is 4%2=0 +2=2.\n\nLoop again: 2 >=2.\n\nnew_candles=2//2=1. total is 6+1=7. current_used is 0 +1=1. Loop ends.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal starts as 6. current_used=6.\n\nloop: 6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. current_used is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now, 2 <3. So loop ends. So total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. current_used=5. 5//5=1. total becomes 6. current_used is 0 +1=1. Now, 1 <5. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 5. current_used=5.\n\n5//2=2. total becomes 5+2=7. current_used is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nNow, 3 >=2. 3//2=1. total becomes 7+1=8. current_used is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2. 2//2=1. total is 8+1=9. current_used is 0 +1=1. Now, loop ends. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check:\n\nOriginal 5 candles: 5 hours. Then 5 used. Make 2 new (5//2=2). Burn them, 2 hours. Now, 5%2=1 +2 =3 used. Then make 1 new (3//2=1). Burn it, 1 hour. Now, 3%2=1 +1=2. Make 1 new. Burn it, 1 hour. Now, 2%2=0 +1=1. So total is 5+2+1+1=9. Yes.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total as a.\n\ncurrent_used = a.\n\nWhile current_used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = current_used // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    current_used = (current_used % b) + new_candles\n\nReturn total.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead a and b from input. Then compute as above.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is a single line with two integers. For example, the sample input is ['4 2', '6 3'] but perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers. The example shows two inputs, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo for each test case, the input is a single line. But in the sample input, there are two lines, perhaps indicating two test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads one line of input. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem says:\n\nInput: The single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo the code should read a single line, split into two integers. Then output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows two lines, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem's sample input may be showing two examples. But the actual code is supposed to read one line of input. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is 4 2, output is 7. The second input is 6 3, output 8.\n\nSo the code should read a single line, split into a and b.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the total as discussed.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n\n    new = current // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    current = current % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 4 2.\n\ntotal starts as 4. current is 4.\n\nLoop: 4//2=2. total becomes 6. current is 0 + 2 =2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total 7. current is 0 +1=1. Exit loop. Print 7.\n\nSample 2: 6 3.\n\ntotal is 6. current is 6.\n\n6//3=2. total is 8. current is 0 +2=2. Which is less than 3. So print 8.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 6. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2. Output is 9.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when a is 1 and b is 2. Then, initial total is 1. current is 1. Since 1 <2, loop doesn't run. Output is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. total starts as 2. current is 2. 2//2=1. total becomes 3. current is 0 +1=1. loop ends. Output 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead a and b from input, compute as per the algorithm.\n\nSo the code is:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current >= b:\n\n    new = current // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    current = current % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nI think that's all. Let me check if there are any edge cases.\n\nWhat if b is 1? Wait, no. The problem says that b is between 2 and 1000. So the constraints are 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000. So the code doesn't have to handle b=1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can keep his room illuminated using candles, considering he can reuse the remnants of burned-out candles to create new ones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`.\n2. **Burn Candles**: Each candle burns for exactly one hour.\n3. **Reuse Burned Candles**: After burning all initial candles, collect the remnants and convert them into new candles. This process continues until there are not enough remnants to form a new candle.\n4. **Iterative Process**: Continuously calculate the number of new candles that can be made from the remnants of the previously burned candles and add the corresponding hours to the total.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\ncurrent = a\nwhile current >= b:\n    new = current // b\n    total += new\n    current = current % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The total number of hours starts with the initial number of candles, `a`, since each candle burns for one hour.\n2. **Loop Until No More Candles Can Be Made**: While there are enough remnants to make new candles (i.e., `current` is at least `b`):\n   - Calculate the number of new candles that can be made from the current remnants.\n   - Add the number of new candles to the total hours.\n   - Update the count of remnants to include the leftover remnants from the previous iteration plus the newly made candles (which will be used in the next iteration).\n3. **Termination**: The loop stops when there are not enough remnants to form another candle, and the total number of hours is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently calculates the total hours by iteratively reusing the remnants, ensuring optimal use of available resources. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of iterations needed to reduce the remnants below the threshold for making new candles, which is efficient given the constraints.",
