Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a game with a number A of 2n digits. They take turns picking the leftmost digit, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. And I have to output the sequence of moves (H and M) that achieves this maximum sum. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. The key here is to find the optimal way for Homer and Marge to pick digits so that their combined total is maximized. Since each move affects the digits available for future moves, this seems like a dynamic programming problem. But with n up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. So a brute-force approach is impossible because 36! is way too big. So we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about the state. The state depends on how many digits each has taken so far. For example, after k moves, Homer might have taken h moves and Marge m moves, with h + m = k. But since each must take exactly n moves, the state can be represented by the number of moves each has made. Wait, but since the total moves are 2n, and each player takes exactly n moves, the state can be represented by the number of moves Homer has made so far. Let's say, for example, that Homer has made h moves and Marge has made m moves. Since h + m = current step. But since each has to make exactly n moves, the state can be represented by h and m, but since m = (current step) - h, maybe we can represent it as h and the current position in the string.\n\nWait, the problem is that the order of choices affects which digits are available. So for example, when the game starts, the first move is either H or M. Then the next move depends on who takes it. So the state needs to track how many digits each has taken so far, and the current position in the string.\n\nWait, but the digits are being taken from the front. So the current A is a substring of the original, starting from some index. For example, if the original A is '1234', and after two moves (say H and M), then the remaining digits are '34'. So the current state can be represented by the number of digits already taken, i.e., the current position in the original string. Let's say that after k digits have been taken, the next digit is at position k. So the state can be represented by how many digits have been taken so far (k), and how many times Homer has taken a digit (h). Because Marge's count is m = k - h. Since each player must take exactly n steps, the constraints are that h <= n, and m <= n. Also, since k = h + m, and m = k - h, then when k is the current number of digits taken, h can vary between max(0, k - n) and min(n, k). Because Marge can't take more than n steps, so k - h <= n => h >= k - n. Similarly, h can't exceed n.\n\nSo the DP state can be represented by (k, h), where k is the number of digits taken so far (so the next digit is at position k in the original string), and h is the number of times Homer has taken a digit so far. The value of the DP would be the maximum possible sum from this state onwards.\n\nThe transitions would be: for each state (k, h), the next move can be either H or M, provided that they haven't exceeded their allowed steps. For example, if Homer has already taken h steps, then he can take another step only if h < n. Similarly for Marge, she can take a step if (k - h) < n (since m = k - h, and m must be < n).\n\nSo for each state (k, h), we can choose to take H or M, and compute the maximum sum.\n\nBut what's the base case? When k = 2n, meaning all digits are taken. Then the sum is zero.\n\nFor each state (k, h), the next digit is A[k], and if we choose H, then we add this digit to Homer's number, and the sum is the value of this digit multiplied by 10^{n - h - 1} (since Homer's number will have h+1 digits, and the new digit is the next one in the sequence, which is the leftmost digit, so when building the number, each new digit is added to the left. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to their number. So for example, if Homer takes a digit, it's added",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their combined total prize is maximized. The game involves taking turns picking digits from a number A consisting of 2n digits, with each player making exactly n moves.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a dynamic programming approach to explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently. The state in our DP will be represented by the number of digits taken so far (k) and the number of moves Homer has made (h). This allows us to track the remaining digits and the moves each player can still make.\n2. **Recursive State Transitions**: From each state (k, h), we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and compute the maximum total prize achievable from that state onwards.\n3. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we memoize the results of each state to ensure efficient computation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    length = 2 * n\n\n    # Precompute the powers of 10 for the digits' positions\n    power = [1] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        power[i] = power[i - 1] * 10\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(k, h):\n        if k == 2 * n:\n            return (0, '')  # (max_sum, sequence)\n        max_sum = -1\n        best_seq = ''\n        # Current digit is A[k]\n        digit = int(A[k])\n        # Possible moves: H or M\n        # Try H if possible\n        if h < n:\n            new_h = h + 1\n            m = k - h\n            if m < n:\n                # Take H\n                val = digit * power[n - new_h]\n                sum_future, seq_future = dp(k + 1, new_h)\n                total = val + sum_future\n                if total > max_sum or (total == max_sum and (best_seq == '' or seq_future < best_seq)):\n                    max_sum = total\n                    best_seq = 'H' + seq_future\n        # Try M if possible\n        m = k - h\n        if m < n:\n            new_m = m + 1\n            # Take M\n            val = digit * power[n - new_m]\n            sum_future, seq_future = dp(k + 1, h)\n            total = val + sum_future\n            if total > max_sum or (total == max_sum and (best_seq == '' or seq_future < best_seq)):\n                max_sum = total\n                best_seq = 'M' + seq_future\n        return (max_sum, best_seq)\n\n    _, sequence = dp(0, 0)\n    print(sequence)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of digits `n` and the string `A`.\n2. **Precomputing Powers of 10**: This helps in quickly calculating the value of digits when they are added to the players' numbers, considering their position in the number.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function is defined with memoization to store results of subproblems. It takes the current position `k` and the number of moves Homer has made `h`, and returns the maximum total prize and the corresponding sequence of moves.\n4. **State Transitions**: For each state, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and recursively compute the maximum prize from the resulting states.\n5. **Memoization**: Using `functools.lru_cache`, we memoize the results of each state to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible sequences of moves while maximizing the total prize using dynamic programming and memoization.",
