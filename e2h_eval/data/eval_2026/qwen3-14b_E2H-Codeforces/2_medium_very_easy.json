Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. Let me think about the requirements.\n\nSo, the problem says that the letters form an X if two conditions are satisfied. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to check the diagonals. The main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All the cells in these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping cells? Like, in a square with odd length, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the middle cell is on both diagonals. So when checking the diagonals, we need to make sure that all cells in both diagonals are the same. But since the center is part of both, that's okay as long as all the cells in both diagonals are the same.\n\nSo first step: collect all the characters in the two diagonals and check if they are all the same. Then, collect all the other characters (non-diagonal) and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect those?\n\nLet me think about the indices. For a square of size n x n, where n is odd. For each cell (i, j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if either of those conditions is true, it's part of a diagonal. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal area.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check all the diagonal cells (both diagonals) to see if they are all the same character. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n\n2. Check all the non-diagonal cells to see if they are all the same character, and that this character is not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFirst, iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal. If yes, collect its character. Then check if all those characters are the same. Then for non-diagonal cells, collect their characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut wait, the diagonals might have overlapping cells (like the center). But that's okay because when we collect all the diagonal characters, even if there are duplicates, as long as all are same, it's okay.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Read the grid.\n\n- Collect all diagonal characters (both diagonals) into a set. If the size of the set is not 1, then return NO.\n\n- Then collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If the size is not 1, return NO.\n\n- Also, check that the two sets are different. If they are same, then return NO.\n\nBut wait, the non-diagonal set must have exactly one element, which is different from the diagonal's element.\n\nSo, for example, if the diagonal is 'x' and the non-diagonal is 'o', that's okay. But if the non-diagonal is also 'x', then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCheck that all diagonal cells are same (d_char).\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal cells are same (n_char).\n\nCheck that d_char != n_char.\n\nIf all three conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen for each cell (i, j), where i ranges from 0 to n-1, j ranges from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor each cell, check if it's on a diagonal. So, if i == j or i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo, for all cells:\n\nCollect the diagonal characters and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut perhaps for efficiency, we can loop through each cell once, and check if it's on a diagonal.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nInitialize two variables: diag_char and non_diag_char.\n\nBut since the first cell (i=0, j=0) is on the diagonal, we can take that as the reference for diag_char. Then check all other diagonal cells against it.\n\nSimilarly for non-diagonal cells. Take the first non-diagonal cell's character as the reference, and check others against it.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but the center is overlapping. So total diagonal cells is 2n - 1 (since for n=3, 3+3-1=5). Wait, for n=3, the number of cells in the diagonals is 3 (main) + 3 (anti) -1 (overlap) = 5. So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 9 -5 =4 cells. Which is correct. So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4. So in that case, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut for n=1? Well, the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFirst, check for all diagonal cells. Let's collect all the characters in the diagonals. Then check if they are all same. Similarly for non-diagonal.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, collect all the diagonal characters:\n\ndiag_chars = set()\n\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != non_diag_chars.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because for example, if the non-diagonal cells are empty (but that's impossible since n is >=3, and for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells). So in code, the non_diag_chars will have at least one element.\n\nBut for the case where all non-diagonal cells are same, but the diag_chars is same as non_diag_chars. For example, if all cells are same. Then diag_chars is {x}, non_diag_chars is {x} → so the condition diag_chars != non_diag_chars is false. So output NO.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe diagonals are positions where i==j or i +j =4.\n\nFor i=0, j=0 → yes. i=0, j=4 → yes.\n\ni=1, j=1 → yes. i=1, j=3 → yes.\n\ni=2, j=2 → yes. i=2, j=2 → same. So for i=2, j=2 is in both diagonals.\n\ni=3, j=1 → yes (i +j =4). etc.\n\nLooking at the diagonal cells:\n\nRow 0: x, x (from j=0 and j=4)\n\nRow 1: x, x (j=1 and j=3)\n\nRow 2: x (j=2)\n\nRow 3: x, x (j=1 and j=3)\n\nRow 4: x, x (j=0 and j=4)\n\nWait, but looking at row 2: the cell (2,2) is x. But the other cells in row 2: (2,0) is s, (2,1) is o, (2,3) is o, (2,4) is o. So for the diagonals, the cells in row 2 are (i=2, j=2) → x. So the diag_chars would be {x, s}? No, wait, the other cells in the diagonals?\n\nWait, the first row (row 0) has x at (0,0) and (0,4). The second row (row 1) has x at (1,1) and (1,3). Row 2 has (2,2) → x. Row 3 has (3,1) and (3,3) → x and x. Row 4 has (4,0) and (4,4) → x and x.\n\nWait, but what about (i=2, j=0)? No, that's not on any diagonal. Because i=2, j=0: i +j =2, which is not 4 (n-1 is 4 for n=5). So the diagonals are all x except for the cell (2,0) is s? No, (2,0) is not on the diagonal. Wait, the cell (2,0) is in row 2, column 0. i=2, j=0. i + j = 2, which is not equal to 4. So it's not on the diagonal. So the only cell in row 2 that is on the diagonal is (2,2). So the diag_chars are all x. But what about the other cells?\n\nWait, looking at the first sample input, the third row is 'soxoo' → row 2. So (i=2, j=0) is 's', which is not on the diagonal. So the diagonals for this sample have all x's. So diag_chars is {'x'}, and the non-diagonal cells include the 's' in (2,0), and others. So the non_diag_chars includes 's', 'o', etc. So the non-diagonal cells have multiple characters, so len(non_diag_chars) is more than 1. Hence, the output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are (i=0,0) → w; (i=0,2) → w; (i=1,1) → w; (i=2,0) → w; (i=2,2) → w. So all diagonals are 'w'. The non-diagonal cells are:\n\nRow 0: j=1 → s.\n\nRow 1: j=0 → s, j=2 → s.\n\nRow 2: j=1 → s.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells are all 's'. So diag_chars is {'w'}, non_diag is {'s'}, which are different. So output is YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) x; (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x; (2,2) e. So the diag_chars would be {x, e} → so len is 2. Hence, output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the non-diagonal cells have multiple characters. For example, in row 2, column 0 is 's', which is non-diagonal. Then, other non-diagonal cells may have 'o's. So the non_diag_chars would include 's' and 'o', hence len is 2, so output is NO.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, for reading input, the first line is n, then n lines follow. However, in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, but the actual input is given via standard input. For example, the first input line is 5, then 5 lines of the grid.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is written as ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...], but that's probably just a way to represent the input. In reality, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read n as the first input, then read n lines.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n from input. Then read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j), check if it's on a diagonal. Collect the characters in diag_chars and non_diag_chars.\n\nBut in Python, for the code, perhaps:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, process.\n\nBut need to make sure that each line is exactly n characters. But according to the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains n letters. So we can assume that.\n\nSo, code:\n\nThen, create two sets:\n\ndiag_chars = set()\n\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check if len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != non_diag_chars.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diag_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is n^2 - (2n -1). For n=3, 9 -5 =4. For n=5, 25 -9=16. So it's not possible for non_diag_chars to be empty. So the code is safe.\n\nBut what if all the non-diagonal cells are same? Then len(non_diag_chars) is 1.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about some edge cases.\n\nTest case where all cells are same. For example, n=3, all 'a's. Then diag_chars is {'a'}, non_diag_chars is {'a'}, so the condition diag_chars != non_diag_chars is false. Output NO.\n\nAnother test case where diagonals are 'a' and non-diagonals are 'b'. Then output YES.\n\nAnother case where diagonals are 'a' and non-diagonals are 'a' → output NO.\n\nAnother case where diagonals have two different characters. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal is 'a', 'a', 'b' → then diag_chars is {'a', 'b'}, so output NO.\n\nSo code handles these.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n, then grid.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_chars = set()\n\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != non_diag_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, comparing sets for equality. So diag_chars is a set with one element, and non_diag_chars is a set with one element. So, if they are different, then it's okay.\n\nBut for example, if diag_chars is {'x'}, non_diag is {'o'}, then the condition is true.\n\nBut if diag_chars is {'x'}, non_diag is {'x'}, then the condition is false.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the diag_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, the diagonals have 2n-1 cells. For n=3, 5 cells. So diag_chars can't be empty.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, grid as given. The diag_chars is {x} ?\n\nBut in the first sample, the third row (i=2) is 'soxoo'. So (i=2, j=2) is x. So all the diagonal cells are x. But the non-diagonal cells include s, o, etc. So non_diag_chars has multiple elements. So the code returns NO.\n\nSecond sample input: n=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0)=w, (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w, (2,2)=w. So diag_chars is {w}. The non-diagonal cells are (0,1)=s, (1,0)=s, (1,2)=s, (2,1)=s. So non_diag_chars is {s}. So the code returns YES.\n\nThird sample input: n=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0)=x, (0,2)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,0)=x, (2,2)=e. So diag_chars is {x, e} → len is 2 → code returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are (0,0)=a, (0,2)=a, (1,1)=b, (2,0)=a, (2,2)=a. So diag_chars is {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals: (0,0)=a, (0,2)=a, (1,1)=a, (2,0)=a, (2,2)=a. So diag_chars is {a}. Non-diagonal cells: (0,1)=b, (1,0)=b, (1,2)=a, (2,1)=b. So non_diag_chars is {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal has same characters but same as diagonal. For example, all cells are a. Then diag_chars is {a}, non_diag is {a} → output NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The grid forms an \"X\" if both diagonals contain the same character and all other cells (non-diagonal) contain the same character different from the diagonal's character.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Character Collection**: Traverse each cell in the grid to collect characters from both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) into one set. Collect characters from all other cells (non-diagonal) into another set.\n3. **Validation**: Check if both sets contain exactly one unique character each and that these characters are different. If these conditions are met, the grid forms an \"X\"; otherwise, it does not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_chars = set()\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != non_diag_chars:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first input line is the integer `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n- **Character Collection**: We iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals, its character is added to `diag_chars`. Otherwise, it is added to `non_diag_chars`.\n- **Validation**: The solution checks if both `diag_chars` and `non_diag_chars` contain exactly one unique character and that these characters are different. If so, it prints \"YES\"; otherwise, it prints \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
