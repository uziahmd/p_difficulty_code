Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. The problem says that the X is formed when both diagonals have the same letters, and all other squares have the same letter different from the diagonals. So, how do I check that?\n\nFirst, let me think about the structure. For a square of size n x n where n is odd, the main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left. All the cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the other cells (not on either diagonal) must be the same, but different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check all cells on both diagonals. They should all be the same character. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check all other cells (non-diagonal) to see if they are all the same character, say 'o_char', and that 'o_char' is not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how do I iterate through the cells?\n\nLet me think. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if it's on either of these diagonals, it's part of the X's diagonals. Otherwise, it's part of the other squares.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping cells? Like, the center cell of the square (when n is odd) is part of both diagonals. But that's okay, since it's still part of the diagonals.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on either diagonal.\n- Collect all the characters from the diagonals into a set. If the size of this set is more than 1, then it's invalid.\n- Similarly, collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If this set's size is more than 1, invalid.\n- Also, check that the two sets are different. Because the non-diagonal characters must be different from the diagonal ones.\n\nWait, but what if there are no non-diagonal characters? Like when n=1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but the center cell is counted in both. So total diagonal cells are 2n - 1. For n=3, that's 5 cells. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nCheck that all diagonal cells are same. Check that all non-diagonal cells are same. Check that the two are different.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is n followed by n lines each with n characters.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst case is 5, then lines like xooox, etc. The output is NO. Let's see why. Let's imagine the diagonals: for each cell (i,j) where i==j or i+j = 4 (since n=5, 0-based indices). For example, the first row is x o o o x. The first cell (0,0) is x, and (0,4) is x. Then for row 1, (1,1) is o, (1,3) is o. Row 2, (2,2) is x. So the diagonals are x, o, x, o, x? Wait, no. Let me think again. For n=5, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). The anti-diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). So the diagonals include (0,0), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,4). Wait, but (2,2) is in both diagonals. So the total number of unique cells in diagonals is 2n - 1. For n=5, 2*5-1=9 cells. Which makes sense.\n\nSo for the first sample input, the diagonals would have:\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nLine 0: x o o o x → positions (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nLine 1: o x o x o → (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x.\n\nLine 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is x. And (2,2) is also part of the anti-diagonal. So (i=2, j=2) is in both diagonals.\n\nLine 3: o x o x o → (3,1) is x, (3,3) is x.\n\nLine 4: x o o o x → (4,0) is x, (4,4) is x.\n\nSo the diagonals have x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x? Wait, but in line 2, (2,2) is x. But what about the other cells? Let me check:\n\nLooking at line 2, which is 'soxoo'. So (2,0) is s, (2,1) is o, (2,2) is x, (2,3) is o, (2,4) is o. So the diagonals for this line are (2,2) which is x. So the diagonals are:\n\nLooking at all the cells on the diagonals. Let me list them:\n\nFor main diagonal (i == j):\n\n(0,0): x\n\n(1,1): x\n\n(2,2): x\n\n(3,3): x\n\n(4,4): x\n\nFor anti-diagonal (i + j = 4):\n\n(0,4): x\n\n(1,3): x\n\n(2,2): x\n\n(3,1): x\n\n(4,0): x\n\nSo all the diagonal cells are x. So the first condition is satisfied. Now, the non-diagonal cells. Let's look at the other cells.\n\nFor example, in line 0, positions (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are o, o, o. But (0,0) and (0,4) are on the diagonals. So those are non-diagonal cells. Then in line 1, positions (1,0), (1,2), (1,4) are o, o, o. But (1,1) and (1,3) are on diagonals. So those are non-diagonal. For line 2, the non-diagonal cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4). Which are s, o, o, o. Oh, here's a problem. The non-diagonal cells are supposed to all be the same. But here, (2,0) is s, which is different from the others. So the non-diagonal cells have s and o. Therefore, the first sample input is invalid, hence output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to code this.\n\nFirst, read n. Then read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j), check if it's on the diagonal. If so, add to diagonal_chars. Else, add to other_chars.\n\nThen check:\n\n- All elements in diagonal_chars are same.\n\n- All elements in other_chars are same.\n\n- The two characters are different.\n\nIf all three conditions are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut how to collect the characters.\n\nSo for each i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   for each j from 0 to n-1:\n\n      if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n          add to diagonal_chars\n\n      else:\n\n          add to other_chars\n\nOnce we have these two lists, check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) == 1 and len(set(other_chars)) == 1 and diagonal_chars[0] != other_chars[0]\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3. For example, when n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 2*3-1 = 5. Total cells is 9. So other_chars has 4 cells. So for n >=3, other_chars is not empty. So no problem.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line as a string. Let's store them as a grid, perhaps a list of lists.\n\nThen collect diagonal and other characters.\n\nThen check the conditions.\n\nSo code in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) == 1 and len(set(other_chars)) == 1 and diagonal_chars[0] != other_chars[0]:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, other_chars is 4 elements. So no.\n\nBut for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut what if the other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but the input constraints say n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut in code, for example, when n=3, the other_chars will have 4 elements. So the code is safe.\n\nBut what if the other_chars is empty? For example, n=1, but that's not allowed. So the code is safe.\n\nSo this seems straightforward.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=5, the grid is:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the diagonal chars are all x's? Let's see.\n\nIn the third row (i=2), the third row is 'soxoo'.\n\nAt i=2, j=2 is x. So yes. The other cells on the diagonals are x. So diagonal_chars is all x's. Then other_chars includes the s in (2,0). So other_chars has s and o's. So the set of other_chars has two elements. So the code returns NO. Which matches the first sample.\n\nSecond sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0: w (main diagonal)\n\ni=0, j=2: w (anti-diagonal)\n\ni=1, j=1: w (main and anti)\n\ni=2, j=0: w (anti)\n\ni=2, j=2: w (main)\n\nSo diagonal_chars are all w's. The other cells are:\n\nFor example, (0,1) is s. (1,0) is s. (1,2) is s. (2,1) is s. So other_chars is all s. So the two sets are {w} and {s}, which are different. So output YES. Which matches sample.\n\nThird sample input is:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0: x (main)\n\ni=0, j=2: x (anti)\n\ni=1, j=1: x (main and anti)\n\ni=2, j=0: x (anti)\n\ni=2, j=2: e (main)\n\nSo the diagonal_chars are x, x, x, x, e. So set is {x, e} → size 2. So condition fails. So output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are a, others are b. Should return YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are a, but other cells have some a and some b. Then set for other_chars is {a, b} → len >1 → NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have two different letters. Like, for n=3, first diagonal is a, then another is b. Then set of diagonal_chars is {a, b} → len 2 → NO.\n\nSo the code handles all these cases.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the code would read n, then read n lines. So for example, the first input line is n, then the next n lines are the grid.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as first line n, then n lines of n letters each.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = []\nother = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal)) == 1 and len(set(other)) == 1 and diagonal[0] != other[0]:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the other list is empty? Well, for n=3, other has 4 elements. So no.\n\nBut for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut what if the other list is empty? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nThis code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all cells are same. Then diagonals are same, other cells are same. But they are same as diagonals. So output is NO.\n\nYes, because the other cells must be different.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'a' and others are 'a' → output NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are 'a' and others are 'b' → YES.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same but different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Characters Collection**: Iterate through each cell in the grid to collect characters that lie on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Collect characters not on these diagonals separately.\n3. **Validation**: Check if all characters on the diagonals are the same, all non-diagonal characters are the same, and ensure that the characters on the diagonals are different from the non-diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) == 1 and len(set(other_chars)) == 1 and diagonal_chars[0] != other_chars[0]:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first input line is the integer `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n- **Collecting Characters**: We iterate over each cell in the grid. If a cell lies on either of the two diagonals (checked using conditions `i == j` or `i + j == n - 1`), it is added to `diagonal_chars`; otherwise, it is added to `other_chars`.\n- **Validation Checks**: Using sets, we check if all characters in `diagonal_chars` are the same and all characters in `other_chars` are the same. Additionally, we ensure that the characters in `diagonal_chars` and `other_chars` are different. If all these conditions are met, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal given the constraints.",
