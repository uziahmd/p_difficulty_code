For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of major and minor triads. For a major triad, there should be an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. For a minor triad, it's 3 and then 4 semitones. The total distance between X and Z would be 7 in both cases, but the order matters for the classification.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Convert each note into a numerical value representing its position in the 12-note scale. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H (which is B in some notations, but according to the problem statement, the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, that's 12 notes. So H is the 11th note? Let me list them:\n\nLet me index them from 0 to 11. Let's see:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nWait, but the problem says after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic. So for any two notes, the distance is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but considering the direction. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. And the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check that. From C (0) to C# (1) is 1, then D (2), D# (3), E (4). So yes, four semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? No, because if Y is higher than X, then it's Y - X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X)? Because the distance is measured from lower to upper. So for example, between E and C: E is 4, C is 0. The distance from E to C would be (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones. Because you go E -> F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11), C (0). That's 8 steps. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (Y + 12 - X). Which can be written as (Y - X) % 12? No. Wait, if Y is larger than X, then (Y - X) is positive, mod 12 would be same. If Y is smaller than X, then (Y - X) is negative, and mod 12 would give the positive equivalent. For example, if X is 4 (E) and Y is 0 (C), then Y - X is -4. Mod 12 would be 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So the distance is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to upper, so for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. So when we compute the distance between two notes, it's (Y - X) mod 12, but only if we consider the direction. Wait, but in the problem description, the distance between X and Y is considered as the number of semitones from X to Y, but the way the problem defines it, it's always the minimal way? No, no. Wait the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured",
