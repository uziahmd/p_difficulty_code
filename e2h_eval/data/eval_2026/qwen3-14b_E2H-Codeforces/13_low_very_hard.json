For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The input is three notes, and we have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of major and minor triads. \n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. The total from X to Z would be 7 semitones. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate distances properly considering the circular arrangement of the 12 notes.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad requires X to Y to be 3 semitones and Y to Z to be 4. So the total would be 7 as well, but the order of the intervals is different.\n\nThe challenge here is to compute the distances between all possible permutations of the three notes and check if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nFirst step: map each note to its position in the sequence. Let's list the order:\n\nThe notes are given as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the problem statement says that after H comes C again. Also, the example includes 'H' as a note. Wait, in the problem description, the list is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right. So the order is:\n\nLet me list them with indexes. Let's assign each note a numerical value. For example:\n\nC is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Then, the next note after H (11) is C (0) again.\n\nBut when calculating the distance between two notes, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. For example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Let's check that. Let's see: C (0) to C# (1) is 1, then D (2) is 2, D# 3, E is 4. So yes, from C to E is 4 semitones. But if the notes are reversed, like E to C, the distance is 8 semitones? Because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to upper. So if you have two notes, the distance is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but if the target is lower than the start, then you add 12? Or maybe the distance is computed as the minimal number of steps in the cyclic order? No, no. Wait, according to the problem statement:\n\nThe distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. The distance is taken from the lowest to the upper. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. So the distance is not the minimal, but the number of steps moving forward in the scale.\n\nSo for two notes, X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if Y is lower than X, then it's (Y + 12 - X) semitones? Wait, no. Let me think. Let's take X as C (0), Y as E (4). The distance is 4 semitones. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 - 4 + 12) = 8 semitones. Because you have to go from E to F (1), F to F# (2), etc., up to C. So the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y - X + 12). Which can be written as (Y - X) % 12, but since the problem defines the distance as the number of semitones moving forward from X to Y. Wait, no. Because if Y is lower than X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). For example, X is E (4), Y is C (0). The distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones. Which is correct. So the formula for the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y -",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation fits the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of notes. This helps in calculating distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Define a helper function to compute the distance between two notes in semitones, considering the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes and check each permutation against the criteria for major and minor triads.\n4. **Classification**: Based on the checks, classify the triad as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = [\"C\", \"C#\", \"D\", \"D#\", \"E\", \"F\", \"F#\", \"G\", \"G#\", \"A\", \"B\", \"H\"]\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef distance(x, y):\n    # Calculate the distance from x to y in semitones (forward direction)\n    return (y - x) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\n# Read input and output the result\nimport sys\n\ninput_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nnotes = input_line.split()\nresult = classify_chord(notes)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: The `note_to_index` function converts each note (e.g., \"C\", \"C#\", etc.) to a numerical index based on its position in the list of 12 notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `distance` function computes the number of semitones from one note to another, taking into account the cyclic nature of the musical scale using modulo arithmetic.\n3. **Checking Triads**: The `is_major` and `is_minor` functions check if a permutation of notes meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, respectively.\n4. **Classifying the Chord**: The `classify_chord` function generates all permutations of the input notes and checks each permutation against the criteria for major and minor triads. If none match, it classifies the chord as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are considered, and the solution efficiently determines the type of triad using permutations and modular arithmetic.",
