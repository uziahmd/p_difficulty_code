    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0 and 2 directly. Hmm.\n\nSo, the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So, what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nLet me think about the possible rearrangements. Since 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2, but 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. But maybe through some steps? Like, if there's a 0, then a 1, then a 2. Can I move the 0 past the 1 and then past the 2? Wait, no. Because 0 can only swap with 1. So if I have 0 and 2 separated by a 1, maybe I can move the 0 to the right of the 1, then the 1 can be moved to the right of the 2? Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, for example, consider \"012\". The 0 and 1 can be swapped to get \"102\", then the 1 and 2 can be swapped to get \"120\". But then the 0 is at the end. But can I get the 0 to the right of the 2? Like, \"021\" would require swapping 0 and 2, which isn't allowed. So perhaps the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Because you can't swap them directly. So, any 0s must come before 2s in the final string? Or maybe not, but how?\n\nWait, suppose I have a 0 followed by a 2. Since they can't be swapped, their order can't be changed. But if there's a 1 between them, maybe I can move the 0 past the 1, and the 2 past the 1? For example, let's say I have \"0 1 2\". Then I can swap 0 and 1 to get \"1 0 2\", then swap 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. So the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the 0 can't get past the 2. So in this case, the 0 can be moved to the right of the 1, but the 2 can't be moved left past the 0. Therefore, the 0 can't be moved to the right of the 2. Therefore, the relative positions of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Wait, but maybe if there's a sequence of 1s between them?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"0 1 1 2\". Can I arrange the 0 to be after the 2? Let's see. The 0 can be moved right through the 1s. So, moving the 0 to the right, but the 2 can be moved left through the 1s. So maybe the 0 can be moved to the right of the 2?\n\nWait, but the 0 can't swap with the 2. So, for instance, if you have \"0 1 2\", you can't swap the 0 and 2. But if you have \"0 1 1 2\", you can move the 0 to the right of the 1s, but the 2 can be moved left through the 1s. So perhaps the 0 can be moved to the right of the 2? Let me think:\n\nOriginal string: 0 1 1 2. Let's try to move the 0 to the right of the 2. How?\n\nFirst, the 0 can be swapped with the first 1, then the second 1, etc. But the 2 can be moved left through the 1s. For example, the 2 can be swapped with the first 1, then with the next 1, etc. So maybe the 0 can be moved to the right of the 2? Let's see:\n\nSuppose we have 0 1 1 2. Let's move the 0 to the right as much as possible. Then, the 2 can be moved to the left as much as possible. But since they are separated by 1s, maybe the 0 can be moved past the 1s to the right, and the 2 can be moved left past the 1s. But can they cross each other? Like, if the 0 is on the left of the 1s and the 2 is on the right, then perhaps the 0 can be moved all the way to the right of the 1s, and the 2 can be moved all the way to the left of the 1s. But then, the 0 would be on the left of the 2? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nOriginal: [0,1,1,2]\n\nMove 0 to the right through the 1s:\n\nAfter moving 0 to the right, it would be [1,1,0,2]. Then, the 2 can be moved left through the 1s. But the 2 can't be swapped with the 0. So the 2 can be moved to the left until it hits the 0. For example, the 2 can be swapped with the 1s to the left. Let's say the 2 is at position 3. The string is [1,1,0,2]. The 2 can't be swapped with the 0. So the 2 can't move left past the 0. So the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the 0 can't be moved past the 2. Therefore, the order of 0s and 2s in the original string can't be changed. Because if there's a 0 followed by a 2, even with 1s in between, they can't be swapped. Because the 0 can only be moved through 1s, and the 2 can be moved through 1s, but they can't cross each other. So the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string is fixed. Wait, but that's not true. Let me think again.\n\nWait, suppose the original string is \"0 1 2\". Then the 0 can be moved to the right of the 1, making \"1 0 2\". Then the 2 can't be moved to the left of the 0. So the 0 is before the 2. So the original order of 0 before 2 is maintained. But if the original string was \"2 1 0\", then the 0 can be moved left through the 1, and the 2 can be moved right through the 1. But since the 0 and 2 can't be swapped, their order is preserved. So in this case, the 2 is before the 0 in the original string, and they can't be swapped, so in the final string, the 2 is still before the 0.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string cannot be changed. Because they can't be swapped directly, and they can't be moved past each other via the 1s. Because the 0 can move through 1s, and the 2 can move through 1s, but they can't cross each other. So the 0s and 2s in the original string are fixed in their relative order. So, for example, if there's a 0 before a 2 in the original string, then in the final string, all 0s that were before 2s in the original string will remain before them, and vice versa.\n\nBut what about the 1s? The 1s can be moved around freely? Because 1 can be swapped with 0 and 2. So for example, 1s can be moved left or right through 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nWait, if I have a 1 next to a 0, I can swap them. So 1 can move left or right through 0s. Similarly, 1 can move left or right through 2s. So the 1s can be moved anywhere, as long as they are between 0s and 2s. But since the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other, the 1s can be arranged between them.\n\nSo the overall idea is that the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. The 1s can be placed anywhere between them, but the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So the problem reduces to grouping the 0s, 1s, and 2s, but with the 0s and 2s in their original order, and the 1s can be placed in between.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 1s optimally. For example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, then the 1s can be placed in between them. But how?\n\nLet me think of the entire string as consisting of sequences of 0s, 1s, and 2s, but with the 0s and 2s in their original relative order. So, for example, the original string may have a 0, then some 1s, then a 2, then some 1s, then another 0, etc. But the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So the order of 0s and 2s is fixed, but the 1s can be moved around.\n\nSo the approach is to split the original string into groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s. But the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. However, the 1s can be moved around. So, for the minimum lex string, we want to arrange the 1s as far to the left as possible, but considering that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s. For example, if there is a 0 followed by some 1s and then a 2, we can arrange the 1s between the 0 and 2. But how does that help us make the lex smallest string?\n\nThe lex smallest string would have as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. But given that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So, for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. But between them, we can arrange the 1s. But also, if there are 1s in between, we can move them around.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved between the 0s and 2s. So the idea is that all 1s can be placed between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nLet me think of the entire string as consisting of a sequence of 0s, 2s, and 1s. But the 0s and 2s are in their original order. The 1s can be placed anywhere else.\n\nSo, the minimal lex string would be formed by arranging the 0s and 2s in their original order, but inserting all the 1s between them. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their relative order, and the 1s can be placed in between. For example, if the original string has a 0, then some 1s, then a 2, then some 1s, then another 0, then some 1s, then a 2, etc. Then the 1s can be moved around, but the 0s and 2s must stay in their original order.\n\nSo, the minimal lex string would be to arrange the 1s between the 0s and 2s. But how to do that optimally.\n\nFor example, suppose the original string is \"0 1 2\". The 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the 0 comes before the 2. The 1 can be moved between them. But in this case, the minimal string is \"012\", which is already the case. But if the original string was \"0 2 1\", then the 0 comes before the 2, and the 1 can be moved to the left of the 2. So the minimal string is \"012\".\n\nSo the problem becomes: collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and collect all the 1s, and then insert the 1s in between the 0s and 2s in such a way that the overall string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nAnother approach: the allowed swaps allow us to arrange the 1s freely between the 0s and 2s. Because the 1 can move through 0s and 2s. So, for example, if there's a 1 between a 0 and a 2, we can move it to the left of the 0, but wait no. Because the 1 can move left through 0s. Wait, if the 1 is to the right of a 0, then we can swap them. So, for example, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. But that would change the order of the 0 and 1, but since the 0 is before the 1 in the original string, but we can swap them. Wait, but the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. But then the 0 and 1's order can be changed. So this contradicts my previous conclusion that the 0s and 2s' order is fixed.\n\nWait, this suggests that my earlier reasoning was wrong. Let me re-examine that.\n\nIf the original string is \"0 2\", then the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. But if there's a 1 between them, like \"0 1 2\", then the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0? No. Because the 1 can be swapped with the 0. So the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. For example, \"0 1 2\" can become \"1 0 2\" (by swapping the 0 and 1). But then the 0 is before the 2, which is the same as before. However, the 1 is now to the left of the 0. But the 0 and 2's order hasn't changed. So the 0 is still before the 2. So the 0 and 2's relative order is preserved. So the 1 can be moved around between the 0 and 2, but the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So, the conclusion is that the relative order of 0s and 2s is preserved, but the 1s can be placed anywhere between them.\n\nSo, the minimal lex string would be to arrange all the 0s and 2s in their original order, but with all the 1s inserted between them, and also possibly before the first 0 and after the last 2. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose the original string is \"2 0 1\". The 2 comes before the 0, which is the original order. But since we can't swap 2 and 0, the 2 must come before the 0. However, the 1 can be moved around. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\"? Wait no, because the 2 is before the 0 in the original string. So the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\"? No, that's impossible. Wait, original string is \"2 0 1\". The 2 and 0 are in the original order. So the 2 must come before the 0. But the 1 can be moved around. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\"? No. Because the original order requires that the 2 comes before the 0. So the 2 can't be moved after the 0. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. Because the original order has 2 before 0. So the 2 must come before the 0. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. Wait, but how can we arrange the 0 and 2?\n\nIn the original string \"2 0 1\", the 2 is before the 0. So in the final string, the 2 must come before the 0. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. Wait, but the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the minimal string would be something like \"0 1 2\"? No, that's not possible. Wait, the original string is \"2 0 1\". The 2 is before the 0. So the 2 must come before the 0. So the minimal string could be \"0 1 2\"? No, that's impossible. So perhaps the correct minimal string is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. Let's see.\n\nWait, the original string is \"2 0 1\". The 2 is before the 0. So the 2 must come before the 0. So the minimal string can't have the 0 before the 2. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. The minimal possible string would be \"0 1 2\" is not allowed. So the minimal possible string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\"? No, because the 2 is before the 0. So the 2 can't be moved after the 0. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal string would be something like \"0 1 2\" is not possible. Wait, I'm confused here. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal string is \"2 0 1\". The allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. So, the 2 and 0 can't be swapped directly. But the 2 and 0 are separated by a 0? Wait, the original string is \"2 0 1\". So the 2 is first, then 0, then 1. Let's see what we can do.\n\nWe can swap the 0 and 1 (since they are adjacent) to get \"2 1 0\". Then, the 1 and 2 can be swapped (since they are adjacent). So, swapping the 2 and 1 gives \"1 2 0\". Then, the 0 can be swapped with the 2? No, because that's a 2 and 0. Not allowed. So the 0 can be moved left through the 1? Wait, the 0 is after the 2. So in the string \"1 2 0\", the 0 is after the 2. The 0 and 2 can't be swapped. But the 0 can be moved left through the 1? Wait, the 0 is after the 2. So the 0 is next to the 2. Can't be swapped. So the 0 is stuck. So the minimal string is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal possible string is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. Wait, but how can we get the 0 to be before the 2?\n\nIt seems that in this case, the 0 is originally after the 2, and since we can't swap them, the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal string is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal possible string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal possible string is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal string would be something else.\n\nWait, in the original string \"2 0 1\", what's the minimal possible string? Let's see.\n\nPossible steps:\n\nOriginal: 2 0 1.\n\nWe can swap 0 and 1: 2 1 0.\n\nThen, swap 1 and 2: 1 2 0.\n\nThen, can't do anything else. So the string is \"120\".\n\nAlternatively, can we find a better arrangement? For example, can we get \"012\"?\n\nNo, because the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the minimal string is \"012\" is not possible. The minimal possible is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. The minimal possible is \"012\" is not possible, so the best we can do is \"0 1 2\" can't be achieved. So the minimal is \"0 1 2\" can't be achieved. So the minimal is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the answer is \"012\" is not possible. So the minimal possible is \"012\" is not possible. So what is the minimal possible?\n\nThe options are:\n\n- \"0 1 2\" is not possible.\n\n- \"0 2 1\" is not possible because the 2 is before the 0 in the original string. So the 0 can't be moved before the 2.\n\nWait, the original string is \"2 0 1\". The 0 is after the 2. So the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. The minimal possible string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. Then, what's the minimal possible string?\n\nThe options are:\n\nWe can arrange the 1s between the 2 and 0. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. Wait, but the 2 is before the 0. So the minimal possible string would be \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the answer is \"012\" is not possible. So the minimal possible is \"012\" is not possible. Then, the minimal possible is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the minimal is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the answer is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. Therefore, the minimal string is \"012\" is not possible. So the minimal string is \"012\" is not possible. So what is the minimal string in this case?\n\nThe minimal possible is \"012\" is not possible. So the minimal possible is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So the answer is \"0 1 2\" is not possible. So what's the actual minimal string for the input \"201\"?\n\nLet me think again. The original string is \"2 0 1\".\n\nWe can do the following steps:\n\nOriginal: 2 0 1 → swap 0 and 1 → 2 1 0 → swap 1 and 2 → 1 2 0. Now, can we do anything else? The 0 can't be moved left past the 2. So the string is \"120\".\n\nAlternatively, can we get \"012\"? No, because the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the minimal string is \"012\" is not possible. So the minimal possible is \"012\" is not possible. The answer is \"012\" is not possible. So the minimal string is \"012\" is not possible. So the answer is \"012\" is not possible. Therefore, the minimal string is \"012\" is not possible. So the answer is \"012\" is not possible. So the answer is \"012\" is not possible. Wait, but what about \"0 1 2\"? That would require the 0 to be before the 2. Which is not allowed. So the answer is \"012\" is not possible. So the minimal string is \"012\" is not possible. So the minimal possible is \"012\" is not possible. So the answer is \"012\" is not possible. So the minimal possible string is \"012\" is not possible. Therefore, the answer is \"012\" is not possible. Therefore, the answer is \"120\", which is the minimal possible.\n\nSo the key takeaway is that the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string must be preserved. So the 0s and 2s are in the same order as in the original string, but the 1s can be arranged between them.\n\nSo, the approach is to collect all the 0s and 2s in the original order, and collect all the 1s. Then, the 1s can be inserted between the 0s and 2s, but in such a way that the overall string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a sequence of 0s and 2s, like [0, 2], and we have a bunch of 1s. We can arrange the 1s between the 0 and 2. So the lex smallest would be to put all the 1s before the 2, but after the 0. Because 0 is smaller than 1, and 1 is smaller than 2. So inserting all 1s between the 0 and 2 would make the string \"01...12\".\n\nSimilarly, if there are multiple 0s and 2s, like [0, 0, 2, 2], then between each pair of 0s and 2s, we can insert the 1s. But how to distribute the 1s optimally.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nAn alternative approach: the minimal string is obtained by greedily placing as many 0s as possible first, followed by 1s, followed by 2s. However, the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nThe final string will consist of a sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s, but the 0s and 2s are in the same order as in the original string. The 1s can be placed between them, before the first 0, after the last 2, and between any 0 and 2.\n\nSo, the minimal string would be to arrange all the 1s as early as possible. But how?\n\nLet me think of the original string as a list of blocks. For example, the original string can be split into a list of characters that are either 0 or 2 (call them 'fixed' characters) and the 1s. The 'fixed' characters must appear in the same order as in the original string. The 1s can be placed anywhere else.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to inserting all the 1s into the sequence of fixed characters (0s and 2s) in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nThe lex smallest string would be achieved by placing the 1s as far to the left as possible. However, the fixed characters are in their original order. So between two fixed characters, where can we insert the 1s?\n\nFor example, between a 0 and a 2, inserting the 1s would be optimal. Because 0 < 1 < 2, so inserting 1s between them would help.\n\nBut also, inserting 1s before the first fixed character (if there are any 0s and 2s) would be better than putting them after.\n\nSo the strategy is to collect all the 1s and distribute them between the fixed characters (the 0s and 2s) in a way that the 1s are placed in the earliest possible positions.\n\nWait, but how to distribute the 1s between the fixed characters. For example, between two fixed characters, say a 0 followed by a 2. Inserting all the 1s between them would be better than inserting some before and some after.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s between the fixed characters.\n\nLet me think of the fixed characters as a list. For example, fixed = [0, 2, 0, 2]. The 1s can be inserted in the gaps between these fixed characters, and also before the first one, and after the last one.\n\nThe minimal lex string would be to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gaps.\n\nBecause inserting 1s before the first fixed character (if that is a 0) would be better than inserting them after. But if the first fixed character is a 2, then inserting the 1s before it would be better than inserting them after.\n\nWait, for example, if the fixed characters are [2, 0], then inserting 1s before the 2 would give 1...1 2 0, which is better than inserting them between 2 and 0, which would give 2 1...1 0. But inserting before the 2 would be better, since 1 is less than 2.\n\nSo the idea is that the 1s should be inserted into the earliest possible positions where they can contribute to a smaller lex order.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- Split the original string into two parts: the fixed characters (0s and 2s) in their original order, and the 1s.\n\n- Then, insert all the 1s into the gaps between the fixed characters, choosing the earliest possible gaps to insert them.\n\nBut how to choose which gaps to insert the 1s into.\n\nFor example, the fixed characters are [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k], where each a_i is 0 or 2.\n\nThe possible insertion points are:\n\n- Before a_1.\n\n- Between a_1 and a_2.\n\n- Between a_2 and a_3.\n\n- ...\n\n- After a_k.\n\nThe goal is to insert all the 1s into these positions, such that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nSince inserting 1s into the earliest possible positions would be better, we need to find for each insertion point, whether inserting 1s there would lead to a smaller string.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe lex order depends on the earliest position where the 1s are inserted. For example, inserting a 1 before the first fixed character (if that is a 2) would be better than inserting it between two fixed characters.\n\nBut how to determine the optimal insertion points.\n\nLet me think of the insertion points as positions where we can add 1s. For each insertion point, the optimal is to insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible positions.\n\nBut the earliest possible insertion point is the first one where inserting 1s would not make the string worse.\n\nWait, the earliest insertion point is the first one where inserting 1s would contribute to a smaller lex order.\n\nFor example, the first insertion point is before the first fixed character. Let's say the first fixed character is 0. Inserting 1s before it would be worse than inserting them after. Because 0 is smaller than 1. So inserting 1s before the 0 would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than having 0s first.\n\nBut if the first fixed character is 2, then inserting 1s before it would be better than inserting them after, since 1 is smaller than 2.\n\nSo the general rule is:\n\nFor each insertion point, we need to decide whether inserting the 1s there would be beneficial.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that the 1s should be inserted in the earliest possible position where inserting them would not cause a larger lex order.\n\nFor example, between two fixed characters, say a and b. The insertion of 1s between a and b would be better than inserting them after b if a is 0 and b is 2. Because inserting 1s between them would make the string 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s.\n\nBut how to find the optimal positions.\n\nLet me think of the insertion points as follows:\n\nEach insertion point can be considered as a position between the fixed characters. For each insertion point, we can determine whether inserting 1s there would be better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nThe key observation is that inserting 1s into a gap between a fixed character a and a fixed character b is better than inserting them into a later gap if the gap is between a and b where a is as small as possible and b is as large as possible.\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since the 1s are all the same, inserting them all into the earliest possible insertion point where inserting them would improve the lex order.\n\nLet me think of the insertion points in order. For example:\n\nInsertion points are ordered as follows:\n\n0: before the first fixed character.\n\n1: between first and second fixed character.\n\n...\n\nk: after the last fixed character.\n\nWe need to choose which insertion points to insert the 1s into, with the priority being to insert them as early as possible, but only if inserting them there improves the lex order.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nFor example, consider inserting into the first insertion point (before the first fixed character). If the first fixed character is 0, inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0. So we should not insert any 1s here. But if the first fixed character is 2, inserting 1s here would be better than inserting them after the 2.\n\nSo, the idea is to find for each insertion point, whether inserting 1s there would be better than not inserting them there.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps, the best way is to iterate through the insertion points and for each, insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not make the string worse.\n\nWait, but the earliest insertion point where inserting 1s would be beneficial.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Collect all the fixed characters (0s and 2s) in their original order. Let's call this list 'fixed'.\n\n2. Collect all the 1s into a list 'ones'.\n\n3. Now, the problem is to insert the 'ones' into the 'fixed' list, in the gaps, to form the minimal lex string.\n\nTo find the optimal insertion points, we can think of the following:\n\nFor each possible gap between the fixed characters (including before the first and after the last), we can decide whether to insert some 1s there.\n\nThe decision for each gap is based on whether inserting 1s there would lead to a lex smaller string.\n\nFor example, consider inserting between two fixed characters, say a and b. If a is 0 and b is 2, then inserting 1s between them is better than inserting them after b. Because inserting them between would make the string have 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s.\n\nBut if a is 2 and b is 0, then inserting 1s between them would be worse than inserting them before the 2 or after the 0. But since the fixed characters are in their original order, a 2 followed by a 0 is allowed (as per the original order), but inserting 1s between them would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. But since 1 is smaller than 2, but 0 is smaller than 1. So the lex order would be worse than inserting the 1s before the 2 (which would make the string start with 1s, which is better than 2, but worse than 0).\n\nWait, but the fixed characters are in their original order. So if the original order has a 2 followed by a 0, then the 2 must come before the 0. So inserting 1s between them would be 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which would be worse than inserting the 1s before the 2 (e.g., 1s followed by 2 followed by 0) which is better than inserting between them. So inserting the 1s before the 2 is better.\n\nSo, the insertion points should be chosen in a way that the 1s are inserted into the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not violate the fixed order and would help minimize the lex order.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n- Iterate through the possible insertion points (from left to right).\n\n- For each insertion point, decide how many 1s to insert there.\n\n- The decision is based on whether inserting 1s here would be better than inserting them later.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nLet me think of the insertion points as positions. For each position, the decision to insert 1s there depends on the characters before and after the insertion point.\n\nFor example, inserting 1s before the first fixed character:\n\nIf the first fixed character is 0: inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0. So we should not insert any 1s here.\n\nIf the first fixed character is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a ternary string consisting of '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. The key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's must remain unchanged, while '1's can be freely rearranged around them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Fixed Characters**: Extract all '0's and '2's from the input string while maintaining their original order. These characters are considered \"fixed\" because they cannot be swapped with each other.\n2. **Collect All '1's**: Gather all '1's from the input string.\n3. **Insert '1's Strategically**: Insert the collected '1's into the gaps between the fixed characters (including before the first fixed character and after the last fixed character) in a way that results in the lexicographically smallest string.

The '1's are then strategically inserted into the earliest possible positions relative to the fixed characters to achieve the lexicographically smallest string. This involves checking the positions where inserting '1's would yield the smallest possible result, particularly focusing on inserting them before the first '2' if present, or at the beginning if all fixed characters are '0's. This approach ensures that we minimize the lexicographical order efficiently.",
