And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times, then find the average of all those sums. Then, output that average with enough decimal precision.\n\nSo the input is n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output is the average of all the sums of consecutive k-day periods.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this efficiently.\n\nFirst, the straightforward way would be to compute the sum for each window of size k, then take the average of all those sums. However, if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach that checks each window in O(n) time would result in O(nk) time, which would be too slow for large n and k. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 1e5, then the total operations would be around 2e10, which is way beyond acceptable time limits.\n\nTherefore, we need a more efficient approach. The standard way to handle sliding window sums is to use a prefix sum array. Let me think about that.\n\nThe prefix sum array can be built where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements. Then, the sum of a window from index j to j+k-1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based, need to be careful here) can be computed as prefix[j + k] - prefix[j], depending on how the prefix array is structured.\n\nOnce I have all the window sums, I need to compute their average. So the total number of windows is (n - k + 1). The sum of all window sums divided by (n - k + 1) is the answer.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array.\n2. For each possible starting index (from 0 to n - k), compute the sum of the window as prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n3. Sum all these window sums and divide by the number of windows.\n\nBut how to compute the sum of all window sums efficiently?\n\nLet me think: Each element a[i] contributes to exactly k windows. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if the window is of size k, then each element a[i] is part of the windows that start at positions from max(0, i - k + 1) to i. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, for each element a[i], how many windows include it? Well, the number of windows that include a[i] is equal to the number of possible starting positions such that the window includes a[i]. For example, the first element is included in exactly 1 window (the first window). The second element is included in 2 windows (the first and second window) if k is 2. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that for each element a[i], it's included in min(i, n - k) + 1? Or maybe not. Let me think of the number of windows that include a[i].\n\nThe window starts at position s, and ends at s + k - 1. So for a[i], the starting position s must satisfy s <= i <= s + k - 1. Which implies that s <= i and s >= i - k + 1. Also, since s can't be less than 0, and the window can't go beyond the array.\n\nBut the starting positions s can be from 0 to (n - k). So for a given i, the number of windows that include a[i] is the number of s's such that s ≤ i ≤ s + k - 1. Let me rearrange this inequality:\n\ns ≤ i and s ≥ i - k + 1. But also, s has to be ≥ 0 and s ≤ (n - k).\n\nSo the number of windows that include a[i] is the number of s in [max(0, i - k + 1), min(n - k, i)] ] ?\n\nWait, but for each a[i], the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of possible starting positions s such that s ≤ i and s + k - 1 ≥ i. Which simplifies to s ≤ i and s ≥ i - k + 1. But since s has to be between 0 and (n -k), the actual count is the number of s in the interval [s_start, s_end], where s_start = max(0, i - k + 1) and s_end = min(n -k, i). But since the window starts at s and ends at s + k - 1, the maximum possible s for which i is included is s_max = i - (k - 1) ? No, wait. For example, if the window starts at s, then the last element in the window is s + k - 1. So for a[i] to be in the window, s <= i <= s + k -1. So s can be as small as i - (k-1) (but not less than 0), and as large as i (but not larger than n -k). So the number of windows that include a[i] is the number of s in [max(0, i - k + 1), min(n -k, i)] ] ?\n\nBut the length of that interval is min(n -k, i) - max(0, i - k + 1) + 1. Hmm. But perhaps there's a simpler way. For example, for each element a[i], the number of windows that include it is the number of possible windows that start at s where s ranges from max(0, i - k + 1) to min(n -k, i). But this seems complicated to calculate. However, perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the total number of windows is m = n -k + 1. Each window has exactly k elements. So the sum of all window sums is equal to the sum of all elements multiplied by the number of times they appear in the windows. So, if I can compute for each element a[i], how many times it appears in the windows, then multiply by a[i], and sum all that, that would give me the total sum of all window sums.\n\nSo the total sum of all window sums is sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (count_i * a[i]), where count_i is the number of windows that include a[i].\n\nSo how to compute count_i?\n\nFor each element a[i], the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of possible starting positions s such that the window [s, s + k - 1] includes i. Since the window starts at s and has length k, the earliest s that includes i is s = max(0, i - k + 1) ? Or wait, the earliest s that includes i is s = i - (k-1) + 1? Let me think differently. The window starts at s, and ends at s + k -1. So for i to be in the window, s ≤ i ≤ s + k -1 → s ≤ i and s ≥ i - (k -1). But s can't be less than 0, and can't be more than (n -k) (since the window starts at s and ends at s + k - 1 ≤ n - 1 → s ≤ n -k).\n\nSo the valid range of s is from s_low = max(0, i - (k -1)) to s_high = min(n -k, i). Because s can't be less than 0, and can't be larger than n -k. And for s to be such that s ≤ i and s ≥ i - (k-1). \n\nSo the number of s's is s_high - s_low + 1.\n\nBut what is this value?\n\nLet me think of it for different positions of i.\n\nCase 1: i is in the first k-1 elements. For example, i is 0. Then s can be from 0 to 0 (since s must be ≤ i (which is 0) and ≥ i -k +1 = 0 -k +1 = -k +1. So the lower bound is 0, upper bound is 0. So count is 1. Which makes sense, since only the first window includes a[0].\n\nCase 2: i is in the middle. For example, when i is such that the window can start anywhere from (i - (k-1)) to i. But if i is in the middle, then the number of windows that include it is k. Wait, for example, if k is 3, and i is 2. Then the possible s values are s=0 (window 0-2), s=1 (window 1-3), s=2 (window 2-4). So that's 3 windows. So count is 3. Which is k. So for elements that are not near the edges, the count is k.\n\nBut for elements near the end, like i = n-1. Then the s can be from (i -k +1) to (n -k). Let's see. For example, if n=5, k=3. i is 4 (last element). The possible s is max(0, 4 - 3 +1) = 2. And s_high is min(5-3=2, 4) → 2. So count is 2-2 +1 = 1. Which is correct because only the window starting at s=2 (elements 2,3,4) includes a[4].\n\nSo the count for each element depends on its position. For elements in the middle, it's k. For elements near the beginning, it's (i + 1) (if i is less than k-1). For elements near the end, it's (n -k - (i - (n -k)) )? Not sure. But how can I find a formula for count_i?\n\nAlternatively, the count_i can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe earliest window that includes a[i] is the one that starts at s = max(0, i - k + 1). The latest window that includes a[i] is the one that starts at s = min(n -k, i). The number of windows is (min(n -k, i) - max(0, i -k +1) + 1).\n\nBut calculating this for each i may be computationally feasible, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, for each element a[i], the number of windows that include it is:\n\nnumber of windows = min(i + 1, n -k + 1) - max(0, i - (k - 1)) + 1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The number of windows that include a[i] is the number of possible starting positions s such that s ≤ i and s +k -1 ≥ i. Which is equivalent to s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. But s also has to be between 0 and (n -k).\n\nSo the valid s's are in the interval [s_start, s_end], where s_start = max(0, i -k +1) and s_end = min(n -k, i). The number of s's is s_end - s_start + 1.\n\nSo for each i, we can compute this.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this would take O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute the total sum of all window sums as sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a[i] * count_i), where count_i is the number of windows that include a[i], as computed above.\n\nThen, divide this total by the number of windows (m = n -k + 1) to get the average.\n\nThis approach is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut let me test this with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 3 2\n\na = [3,4,7]\n\nNumber of windows m = 3 - 2 +1 = 2.\n\nThe windows are [3,4] sum 7, [4,7] sum 11. Total sum is 7+11=18. Average is 18/2=9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nNow, compute count_i for each element:\n\nFor i=0 (a=3):\n\ns_start = max(0, 0 -2 +1) = max(0, -1) = 0.\n\ns_end = min(3-2=1, 0) → 0.\n\ncount_i = 0 -0 +1 = 1. So contribution is 3*1=3.\n\nFor i=1 (a=4):\n\ns_start = max(0, 1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0.\n\ns_end = min(1, 1) = 1.\n\ncount_i = 1 -0 +1 = 2. Contribution is 4*2=8.\n\nFor i=2 (a=7):\n\ns_start = max(0, 2-2+1)=max(0,1)=1.\n\ns_end = min(1, 2) → 1.\n\ncount_i = 1-1+1=1. Contribution is 7*1=7.\n\nTotal sum is 3+8+7=18. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is 1 1. So n=1, k=1. m=1. The sum is a[0] * count_i. For i=0:\n\ns_start = max(0, 0-1+1) = 0. s_end = min(0,0) → 0. count_i is 1. So total sum is 10*1=10. Divided by 1 → 10. Correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=8, k=2. a = [1, 2,4,100000, 123,456,789,1]\n\nm=8-2+1=7.\n\nEach window is two consecutive elements. The sum of each window is 1+2=3, 2+4=6, 4+100000=100004, 100000+123=100123, 123+456=579, 456+789=1245, 789+1=790. Sum all these: 3 +6=9, +100004=100013, +100123=200136, +579=200715, +1245=201960, +790=202750. Then divide by 7. Let me check the sample output: 28964.2857142857.\n\nWait, the sample output is 28964.2857... Let me compute 202750 /7.\n\n202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... which matches the sample. So the approach works.\n\nSo the code needs to compute for each element a[i], the count_i as described.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nIf m is zero? No, since k<=n.\n\nCompute the total_sum as sum over all elements a[i] multiplied by count_i.\n\nThen, the average is total_sum / m.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute count_i for each i.\n\nImplementing count_i:\n\nfor each i in 0..n-1:\n\ns_start = max(0, i -k +1)\n\ns_end = min(n -k, i)\n\ncount_i = s_end - s_start + 1 if s_end >= s_start else 0.\n\nWait, but in the case where i -k +1 is negative, s_start is 0. And s_end is min(n-k, i). For example, when i is 0, and k=2, then s_start is 0, s_end is min(n-k, 0). Since n-k is 3-2=1 for the first sample, so min(1,0) is 0. So count is 0-0 +1=1.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    s_start = max(0, i - k + 1)\n\n    s_end = min(n - k, i)\n\n    if s_end < s_start:\n\n        count = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        count = s_end - s_start + 1\n\n    total += a[i] * count\n\nBut wait, n -k is the maximum possible s (since s can be up to n -k, because the window starts at s and has length k, so s +k -1 = n -k +k -1 = n-1, which is the last index).\n\nBut in code, for Python, indices are 0-based. So for the array a of length n, the indices are 0..n-1.\n\nSo for each i in 0..n-1:\n\ns_start = max(0, i -k +1)\n\ns_end = min( (n -k), i )\n\nBut n -k is the maximum possible s (since s can be from 0 to n -k). So for example, if i is larger than n -k, then s_end is min(n -k, i) → n -k.\n\nBut for example, if i is 5, and n -k is 3, then s_end is 3.\n\nSo the code for count_i is correct.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nYes. Now, let's think about the code.\n\nBut let's test for the third sample:\n\nn=8, k=2. So n -k = 6.\n\nFor each i in 0..7:\n\ni=0:\n\ns_start = max(0, 0 -2 +1) = max(0,-1) =0.\n\ns_end = min(6, 0) → 0. count is 0-0 +1=1. So a[0] *1.\n\ni=1:\n\ns_start = max(0, 1-2+1) = max(0,0)=0.\n\ns_end = min(6,1) →1. count is 1-0 +1=2.\n\ni=2:\n\ns_start = max(0, 2-2+1)=1.\n\ns_end = min(6, 2) →2. count is 2-1+1=2.\n\nSimilarly for i=3:\n\ns_start = max(0, 3-2+1)=2.\n\ns_end = min(6,3) →3. count is 3-2+1=2.\n\nSimilarly, for i=4:\n\ns_start = max(0, 4-2+1)=3.\n\ns_end = min(6,4) →4. count is 4-3+1=2.\n\ni=5:\n\ns_start =5-2+1=4. s_end = min(6,5)=5. count is 5-4+1=2.\n\ni=6:\n\ns_start =6-2+1=5. s_end = min(6,6) =6. count is 6-5+1=2.\n\ni=7:\n\ns_start =7-2+1=6. s_end = min(6,7) →6. count is 6-6+1=1.\n\nSo for each element:\n\ni=0: 1 → 1 * 1 = 1\n\ni=1: 2 * 2 =4\n\ni=2:4 * 2=8\n\ni=3: 100000 *2=200000\n\ni=4: 123 *2=246\n\ni=5:456 *2=912\n\ni=6:789 *2= 1578\n\ni=7:1 *1=1\n\nTotal sum is 1 +4=5 +8=13 +200000=200013 +246=200259 +912=201171 +1578=202749 +1=202750. Which matches the earlier calculation. So yes, this approach works.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nCompute total_sum as 0.\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    s_start = max(0, i - k +1)\n\n    s_end = min(n -k, i)\n\n    count = s_end - s_start +1 if s_end >= s_start else 0\n\n    total_sum += a[i] * count\n\naverage = total_sum / m\n\nThen output the average with enough decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in Python, division is done with /, which returns a float. However, for large numbers, this could be a problem with precision? But the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-6, so using floating point division should be sufficient.\n\nNow, for the code, the problem says that the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows three test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSo the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, but the original problem statement says that the input is given as per the problem. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three separate inputs. So perhaps the problem is expecting to process multiple test cases. However, looking at the problem statement again, the sample input shows that the code is supposed to read from stdin, but the original problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, the original problem's sample input shows three examples, but perhaps the actual problem requires that the code reads a single test case. But in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is given as per the first paragraph. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case. Wait, the original problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nBut the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. However, looking back, the sample input shows that the user provided three different inputs, and the outputs are three different results. But perhaps this is just a way to show multiple examples, but the actual code should process a single test case. Wait, the original problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. However, the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. But perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each line represents a separate test case, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample output shows three outputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement is unclear on this. However, looking back at the problem statement, the sample input shows that the user input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual problem's input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the actual code should read a single test case. But in the problem's sample input, the input is written as a list of strings, each being a separate test case. However, the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, which for programming competition problems usually has a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich is three separate test cases. But the sample output is three lines. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement's input description says that the input is for a single test case. This is conflicting. But perhaps the problem is that the sample input is presented in a way that shows multiple test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, looking at the problem's note, the third example says that there are 7 weeks. So the code should read a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input is given as a list of multiple test cases, which suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. However, in programming competitions, the code is expected to read from standard input, which is typically a single test case. However, the sample input seems to have multiple test cases, which suggests that perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is presented as a separate string, but in reality, the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the sample outputs, the output for each test case is printed on a separate line. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases until EOF, and for each, output the result.\n\nBut the problem statement does not mention this. However, the original problem's sample input shows three test cases and outputs three lines. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, reading from stdin, the code can read all lines at once, split into test cases. However, the problem's original input format is not clear.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input section:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the sample input is a way to show multiple examples, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. However, the user's code must be able to read from stdin and output the correct answer. So perhaps the sample input is not a real input, but the code should handle one test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the code must read from standard input. Therefore, the code should read one test case. But why does the sample input show multiple test cases? Perhaps it's a mistake in the problem statement, and the code should process one test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample outputs, the outputs are three different lines. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines (n and k, then the array). So the code should read until EOF.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines, split into test cases, and process each.\n\nBut how to read the input correctly?\n\nIn Python, the standard way to read multiple test cases is to read all lines from stdin and process them. However, the input for each test case is two lines: first line with n and k, second line with n integers.\n\nSo for example, the sample input is three test cases, each with two lines. So the code should read the input as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nFor each pair of lines (first line is n and k, second line is the array), process them.\n\nBut in practice, in programming contests, sometimes the input is given with multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not mention it. However, the problem statement's sample input shows three test cases. Therefore, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, the code should read all the input lines, and process them as pairs.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nWhich is three test cases. So the code should read lines in pairs.\n\nThus, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of two lines (each group being a test case). However, sometimes the input may have leading/trailing spaces or empty lines, but assuming that the input is properly formatted.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can read all lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut for that, perhaps the code can read all input as a list of lines, then iterate through them two at a time.\n\nBut for the code submission, perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description may not have mentioned it. However, the sample input and output indicate that.\n\nBut the problem statement says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the problem's input description says that the input is for a single test case. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input has multiple test cases, and the output has multiple lines, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nSo, the code will process multiple test cases. For each test case:\n\nRead n and k from the first line.\n\nRead the next line as the array of n integers.\n\nCompute the average as discussed.\n\nPrint the average with 10 decimal digits, as in the sample outputs.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    read n, k\n\n    read a list of n integers\n\n    compute the average\n\n    print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to read the input lines? Because in some cases, the input may have multiple lines, but in Python, reading via input() may be problematic if there are multiple test cases. So perhaps read all the lines at once.\n\nBut for the purpose of the problem, perhaps the code should read from stdin, and process each test case as per the input.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and k from the current line\n\n        if idx >= len(lines):\n\n            break\n\n        line = lines[idx].strip()\n\n        if not line:\n\n            idx +=1\n\n            continue\n\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        # Read the next line for the array\n\n        if idx >= len(lines):\n\n            # invalid input, but assume that the input is correct\n\n            a = []\n\n        else:\n\n            a = list(map(int, lines[idx].strip().split()))\n\n            idx +=1\n\n        # process the test case\n\n        m = n -k +1\n\n        total_sum = 0\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            s_start = max(0, i -k +1)\n\n            s_end = min(n -k, i)\n\n            if s_end < s_start:\n\n                count = 0\n\n            else:\n\n                count = s_end - s_start +1\n\n            total_sum += a[i] * count\n\n        average = total_sum / m\n\n        # print with 10 decimal digits\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut need to make sure that the output has at least 6 decimal digits, and the sample outputs have 10 digits. The problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 1e-6. So printing 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nBut in the sample output, the first case is 9.0000000000. So the code should format the output with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when using the format string, for example, if the average is 9, then formatting with .10f will give 9.0000000000.\n\nBut what about floating point precision? For example, when the average is a fraction that cannot be represented exactly as a float, but the problem allows for some error.\n\nBut using the approach of computing the total_sum as an integer (since all a[i] are integers, and count_i is integer, so total_sum is integer) and then dividing by m (integer) as a float, which in Python is handled with floating point precision.\n\nBut for very large numbers, perhaps there is a loss of precision. However, given that the problem allows for 1e-6 error, and Python uses double-precision floats (which have about 15-17 decimal digits of precision), this should be acceptable.\n\nBut for cases where the sum is very large, perhaps using floating points could lead to inaccuracies. However, since the sum is up to (2e5) * (1e5) * (2e5) = 4e12 (but for n=2e5, k=2e5, then m=1, and each a[i] is multiplied by count_i which is 1. So the sum is sum(a) which is up to 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10. Dividing by m=1 gives 2e10, which can be stored as a float (as a double can handle up to ~1e308). So no problem.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFor the third test case:\n\nn=8, k=2, a=[1,2,4,100000, 123,456,789,1]\n\ntotal_sum is 202750, m=7. 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714...\n\nWhich when printed with 10 decimals is 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut the sample output is 28964.2857142857. So the code should output that.\n\nBut in Python, when you do print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(28964.285714285714)), it will round to 10 decimals. Let's see:\n\nThe exact value is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857142857..., so the 10th decimal is the 7th digit after the decimal point?\n\nWait, the format .10f prints 10 digits after the decimal point. For example, 9.0 becomes 9.0000000000.\n\nSo for the third test case, the code should output 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut in the sample output, it's given as '28964.2857142857'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nTest case where n=k. Then m=1. The sum is sum(a), average is sum(a)/1 = sum(a).\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, k=1. Output is a[0].\n\nAnother edge case: when k=1. Then each window is a single element. The number of windows is n. Each element is counted once. So the total_sum is sum(a). average is sum(a)/n.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: when k= n-1. For example, n=3, k=2. Then m=2. Each element is counted once except the first and last. For example, for i=0, count is 1. i=1, count is 2. i=2, count is 1. So total_sum is a[0] + 2*a[1] + a[2]. Which is sum of (a[0]+a[1]) + (a[1]+a[2]) → same as total_sum.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for reading multiple test cases, the code should read all lines and process them in pairs.\n\nBut sometimes, the input may have leading or trailing whitespaces. However, the code uses strip().\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and k\n\n        line = lines[idx].strip()\n\n        if not line:\n\n            idx +=1\n\n            continue\n\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        # Read a's line\n\n        if idx >= len(lines):\n\n            a = []\n\n        else:\n\n            a_line = lines[idx].strip()\n\n            a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n\n            idx +=1\n\n        # process\n\n        m = n - k + 1\n\n        total_sum = 0\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            s_start =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks, where each week is defined as a sequence of `k` consecutive days from a list of `n` recorded sleep times. The solution must efficiently handle large input sizes and provide the result with high precision.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to compute the average sleep time for all possible consecutive `k`-day periods (weeks) from a list of `n` days. Each week's total sleep time is the sum of its `k` days, and we need the average of all these sums.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Using a sliding window technique with prefix sums would be inefficient for very large `n`. Instead, we use a mathematical approach to determine how many times each day's sleep time contributes to the total sum of all weeks.\n3. **Contribution Counting**: For each day, determine how many weeks include that day. This count helps in calculating the total contribution of each day's sleep time to the overall sum of all weeks.\n4. **Summing Contributions**: Multiply each day's sleep time by its contribution count and sum these values to get the total sum of all weeks' sleep times.\n5. **Average Calculation**: Divide the total sum by the number of weeks to get the required average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Skip empty lines\n        while idx < len(lines) and lines[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n        if idx >= len(lines):\n            break\n        # Read n and k\n        n_k_line = lines[idx].strip()\n        n, k = map(int, n_k_line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        # Read the array line\n        while idx < len(lines) and lines[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n        if idx >= len(lines):\n            a = []\n        else:\n            a_line = lines[idx].strip()\n            a = list(map(int, a_line.split()))\n            idx += 1\n        # Process the test case\n        m = n - k + 1\n        total_sum = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            s_start = max(0, i - k + 1)\n            s_end = min(n - k, i)\n            if s_end < s_start:\n                count = 0\n            else:\n                count = s_end - s_start + 1\n            total_sum += a[i] * count\n        average = total_sum / m\n        # Print with 10 decimal places\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n2. **Handling Each Test Case**: For each test case, we read the number of days `n` and the week length `k`, followed by the list of sleep times.\n3. **Contribution Calculation**: For each day, we determine how many weeks it contributes to using the start and end indices of valid weeks that include the day.\n4. **Total Sum Calculation**: Each day's contribution is calculated by multiplying its sleep time by the number of weeks it is included in, summing these contributions gives the total sum of all weeks.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The total sum is divided by the number of weeks to get the average, which is then printed with 10 decimal places to ensure precision.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation even for large input sizes, adhering to the constraints and providing results with the required precision.",
