    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain inequalities. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe we can find a way to simplify this.\n\nWait, the problem says that x is between A and B, y is between B and C (but since B ≤ y and y ≤ C, and also B ≤ C), and z is between C and D. Also, the order of the sides is such that x ≤ y ≤ z. Because the problem says that x is up to B, then y starts from B and goes up to C, and z starts from C. So the order is x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. Therefore, for the triangle, since x ≤ y ≤ z, the triangle inequality requires that x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order a ≤ b ≤ c, the necessary and sufficient condition is a + b > c. Because if that's true, then the other inequalities (a + c > b and b + c > a) are automatically satisfied since c is the largest.\n\nSo the main condition here is x + y > z. But given that x ≤ B, y ≥ B, and z ≥ C. Wait, but how do x, y, z relate? Let me think. Since x is up to B, and y is at least B. So x can be as small as A, and y can be as small as B. But since x ≤ y (because x ≤ B and y ≥ B?), no. Wait, the problem says that x is between A and B, and y is between B and C. So x can be up to B, and y starts from B. So x can be less than or equal to y. For example, if x is B and y is B, then x = y. So the order is x ≤ y ≤ z. Because x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So yes, x ≤ y ≤ z.\n\nTherefore, the triangle condition is x + y > z. So our task is to count all triples (x, y, z) where:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\n\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\n\nand x ≤ y ≤ z (which is already implied by the ranges, since x ≤ B ≤ y and y ≤ C ≤ z, so x ≤ y ≤ z),\n\nand x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of (x, y, z) in those ranges where x + y > z.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe brute-force approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z and check the condition. However, since the ranges can be up to 5e5, that's way too slow. For example, if A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5, then x can be up to 5e5, y can be up to 5e5, z can be up to 5e5. So the total combinations would be O( (5e5)^3 ), which is impossible.\n\nWe need a smarter approach. Let's think about the variables.\n\nSince x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C, and z ranges from C to D. But for each x and y, the z can be from max(C, ... ?) up to some value. Wait, but z has to be >= C and also <= D, and also satisfy x + y > z. So for a given x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, D] where z < x + y. But since z must be at least C, the valid range for z is from C to min(D, x + y - 1). However, since z must be >= C, if x + y - 1 < C, there are no valid z for this x and y. Otherwise, the number of z's is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C.\n\nSo for each x and y, the number of valid z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently for all x and y?\n\nThe problem is that x ranges from A to B (say, X values) and y ranges from B to C (Y values). So the total number of x and y pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). Which could be up to (5e5)^2, which is 2.5e11 operations. That's way too big for Python to handle in time. So even O(N^2) is not feasible here.\n\nThus, we need to find a way to compute this more efficiently. Let's think about the constraints again.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem. We need to calculate the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of the count of z in [C, D] where z < x + y.\n\nBut z must be >= C, so for each x and y, the lower bound of z is C, upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). So the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C. Else zero.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nif x + y > C, then the number of z is min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1. But if x + y <= C, then there are no z's (since z >= C, and x + y -1 < C implies z must be >= C and <= x + y -1, which is impossible).\n\nSo the condition for x and y is x + y > C. Because if x + y <= C, then even the smallest possible z (C) is larger than x + y - 1, so no solution. So for x and y where x + y > C, we can contribute some count. Otherwise, nothing.\n\nSo the problem becomes:\n\nFor all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], such that x + y > C, compute the number of z's which is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1).\n\nSo the total answer is sum_{x, y} [ if x + y > C then (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) else 0 ].\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me consider that for each x and y, the term is:\n\nif x + y > C: then (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) = min(D - C + 1, x + y - C).\n\nBecause:\n\nmin(D, x + y -1) - C + 1 = (x + y -1 - C + 1) if x + y -1 <= D → x + y - C.\n\nOr D - C + 1 if x + y -1 >= D → x + y - C is larger than D - C + 1.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nmin(D, x + y - 1) is either x + y -1 (if x + y -1 ≤ D) or D otherwise.\n\nThen subtract C and add 1:\n\nCase 1: x + y -1 ≤ D → min(...) = x + y -1 → (x + y -1 - C + 1) = x + y - C.\n\nCase 2: x + y -1 > D → min(...) = D → D - C + 1.\n\nSo the term is:\n\nif x + y > C:\n\n   if x + y -1 <= D → x + y - C\n\n   else → D - C + 1\n\nSo the term can be written as:\n\nmax(0, min(x + y - C, D - C + 1)).\n\nBut since x + y > C, then x + y - C is positive. So the term is min(x + y - C, D - C + 1).\n\nSo the problem is to compute sum over x and y (with x in [A,B], y in [B,C], x + y > C) of min( x + y - C, D - C + 1 )\n\nLet me denote K = D - C + 1. So K is the maximum possible contribution for any x and y. So the term becomes min( (x + y - C), K )\n\nSo the sum is sum_{x,y} [ min( (x + y - C), K ) * I(x + y > C) }, where I is indicator function.\n\nNow, how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nFirst, note that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let me consider that for x and y, their sum s = x + y.\n\nLet me define for each possible s, the number of (x, y) pairs that have sum s and s > C. Then, for each such s, the contribution to the total sum is min(s - C, K) multiplied by the count of pairs with that s.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute for all possible s (from min_s to max_s) where min_s is A + B (since x ≥ A, y ≥ B) and max_s is B + C (since x ≤ B, y ≤ C), the number of pairs (x, y) that sum to s and s > C. Then for each such s, multiply the count by min(s - C, K) and sum all those.\n\nThis seems promising, but how do we compute the count of pairs (x, y) for each s?\n\nBut even this approach may not be efficient unless we can find a way to compute the counts for ranges of s.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of s. For x in [A, B], y in [B, C], s ranges from (A + B) to (B + C). Let me denote S_min = A + B, S_max = B + C.\n\nNow, for each s in [S_min, S_max], compute the number of (x, y) pairs such that x + y = s, x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C].\n\nOnce we have that, we can proceed.\n\nBut how to compute that count for each s?\n\nThis is a classic problem of counting the number of solutions to x + y = s with x in [X_low, X_high], y in [Y_low, Y_high]. Let me think.\n\nFor x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y = s. So for a given s, y = s - x. So for x to be valid, y must be in [B, C]. So for each x in [A, B], y must be in [B, C], which implies that s - x must be between B and C. So:\n\nB ≤ s - x ≤ C → s - C ≤ x ≤ s - B.\n\nAlso, x must be in [A, B].\n\nSo combining these, x must be in the intersection of [A, B] and [s - C, s - B].\n\nSo the number of x's in that interval is max(0, min(B, s - B) - max(A, s - C) + 1).\n\nSo for each s, the count is max(0, min(B, s - B) - max(A, s - C) + 1).\n\nBut this formula gives the number of x's for which y = s -x is in [B, C].\n\nSo that's how we can compute the count of pairs (x, y) that sum to s.\n\nBut for each s, we can compute this count in O(1) time. However, if we need to process all s from S_min to S_max, that's O(S_max - S_min + 1) steps, which can be up to (B + C) - (A + B) + 1 = C - A + 1. Since A can be as low as 1, and C up to 5e5, this could be O(5e5) steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute K = D - C + 1. If D < C, then K is 0 (but since C ≤ D, D - C + 1 is at least 1).\n\nWait, no. The input constraints say that A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So C ≤ D. So D - C + 1 is ≥ 1.\n\nSo for each s in [S_min, S_max], compute the count of (x, y) pairs that sum to s. Then, for each such s, if s > C, then add to the total sum the count multiplied by min(s - C, K). Otherwise, nothing.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate S_min = A + B, S_max = B + C.\n\nFor each s from S_min to S_max:\n\n   if s <= C: continue (since x + y > C is required)\n\n   else:\n\n      compute the count of (x, y) pairs that sum to s.\n\n      compute the contribution: count * min(s - C, K)\n\n      add this to the total.\n\nSo the question is, how to compute for each s the count of pairs (x, y) summing to s, and then process it.\n\nNow, the problem is that for s in the range [S_min, S_max], which can be up to (B + C) - (A + B) + 1 = C - A + 1. For example, if A is 1 and C is 5e5, then this is 5e5 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo this approach is O( (C - A + 1) ) steps, which is acceptable for the constraints.\n\nSo now, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nCompute S_min = A + B.\n\nS_max = B + C.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor s in S_min ... S_max:\n\n    if s <= C:\n\n        continue\n\n    else:\n\n        # compute the number of pairs (x, y) that sum to s.\n\n        # x in [A, B], y in [B, C]\n\n        # y = s - x must be in [B, C]\n\n        # => x must be in [s - C, s - B]\n\n        # and also x must be in [A, B]\n\n        lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n        upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n        if lower_x > upper_x:\n\n            continue\n\n        count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n        contribution = count_pairs * min( s - C, K )\n\n        total += contribution\n\nreturn total\n\nWait, but why is the upper_x min(B, s - B)?\n\nBecause y = s - x must be >= B → s - x >= B → x <= s - B.\n\nSimilarly, y <= C → s - x <= C → x >= s - C.\n\nSo x must be between [s - C, s - B], and also between [A, B]. So the lower bound for x is max(A, s - C), upper bound is min(B, s - B).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nLet's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4 → Output is 4.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nK = D - C + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\n\nS_min = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nS_max = 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo s ranges from 3 to 5.\n\nFor each s:\n\ns=3: check if s > C (3 > 3? No. So skip.)\n\ns=4: 4>3 → yes.\n\nCompute lower_x = max(1, 4 - 3) = max(1, 1) = 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 4 - B (B is 2) → 4 - 2 = 2. So min(2, 2) = 2.\n\ncount_pairs = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ncontribution: 2 * min(4 - 3, 2) → 2 * 1 = 2.\n\ns=5:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 5-3=2) → 2.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 5-2=3) → 2.\n\ncount_pairs = 2-2+1=1.\n\ncontribution: 1 * min(5-3=2, 2) → 1*2=2.\n\nSo total is 2 + 2 = 4. Which matches the first sample. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input 1 2 2 5 → output 3.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nK = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.\n\nS_min = 1+2=3, S_max = 2+2=4.\n\ns ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nCheck s > C (C is 2). So s=3 and 4 are both > 2.\n\nFor s=3:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 3 - C=3-2=1) → 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 3 - B=3-2=1) → 1.\n\ncount_pairs = 1-1+1=1.\n\ncontribution: 1 * min(3-2=1, 4) → 1*1=1.\n\ns=4:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 4-2=2) → 2.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 4 - 2 = 2) → 2.\n\ncount_pairs = 1.\n\ncontribution: 1 * min(4-2=2, 4) → 2.\n\nTotal is 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the second sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nA=B=C=D=5e5.\n\nK = 5e5 - 5e5 + 1 = 1.\n\nS_min = 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6.\n\nS_max = 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6.\n\ns=1e6.\n\nCheck if s > C (5e5). Yes.\n\nlower_x = max(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) = max(5e5, 5e5) = 5e5.\n\nupper_x = min(5e5, 1e6 - B (which is 5e5) → 1e6 - 5e5 = 5e5. So upper_x = 5e5.\n\ncount_pairs = 5e5 - 5e5 + 1 = 1.\n\ncontribution: 1 * min(1e6 - 5e5 = 5e5, 1) → 1 * 1 = 1. So total is 1. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nAnother test case: when x + y is larger than D. For example, A=1, B=3, C=3, D=5. So K = 5 - 3 + 1 = 3. Suppose s = 3 + 3 = 6. Then s - C = 6 -3 =3. min(3, 3) is 3. So contribution is count_pairs * 3.\n\nBut if D is 5, then z can be up to 5. So for x + y = 6, z must be < 6. So z can be from C=3 to min(5, 5) (since 6-1=5). So 5-3 +1 = 3. Which is exactly K. So the code correctly computes min(3, K=3) → 3.\n\nAnother case: when x + y - C is larger than K. For example, D=5, C=3, K=3. Suppose x + y = 7. Then s - C is 4, which is larger than K=3. So contribution is 3. Which is correct because z can be from 3 to 5 (3 numbers).\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut what about the ranges of s? For example, when A and B are large, but the code loops from S_min to S_max. How long is that loop?\n\nThe maximum possible S_max - S_min + 1 is (B + C) - (A + B) + 1 = C - A + 1. Since A can be as small as 1, and C up to 5e5, this is O(5e5) steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nIn Python, even 5e5 steps are manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input. For each test case, process as per above.\n\nWait, the input is given as multiple lines? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. But in the example, the input is given as a list of strings like ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', ...], but that's probably for the sample input. The actual input is one line with four integers.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nSo the code should read one line of input. But in the sample input, there are three test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nBut that's probably for the purposes of the example. However, in reality, the problem says that the input is four integers on one line. But perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is the first line containing four integers. So the code should read one line of input. But the sample shows multiple lines. Wait, perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where the user is to read multiple test cases. However, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut that's probably just a way to show multiple test cases. But in reality, the problem might have multiple test cases, but the original problem description says that the input is four integers. However, the sample shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases, each on separate lines.\n\nBut the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that the user is supposed to read multiple lines, but the problem actually expects a single test case. But that's conflicting with the sample.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows three lines, each with four integers. The sample output shows three lines. So perhaps the problem expects to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So perhaps the original problem has only one test case. But the sample shows multiple. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['1 2 3 4', ...], which suggests that perhaps the input is multiple lines. However, the original problem may have been miswritten. Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code needs to read from stdin. For example, the code may need to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the sample is wrong, and the actual problem expects one test case.\n\nBut given that the sample shows multiple lines, perhaps the problem expects multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the original problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the first example, the input is \"1 2 3 4\" and the output is \"4\". The second input is \"1 2 2 5\" and output is \"3\", etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input has multiple lines, perhaps the actual problem expects multiple test cases. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo that's confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output, the user probably needs to read multiple test cases. For example, the sample input shows three lines, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the original problem's input description is unclear. However, the user's code must pass the sample, which suggests that the code should read multiple lines.\n\nBut given that the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, split them into individual test cases, and process each one.\n\nSo the code should read all lines from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is four integers. However, the sample shows multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is from Codeforces or similar, where the code is supposed to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut given the sample, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So maybe the sample is formatted incorrectly, and the actual input is one line per test case.\n\nBut regardless, the user's code must pass the sample. For example, in the sample input, the code must read three lines, and output three lines.\n\nSo in the code, perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, for each line, process it as a test case.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read all lines from stdin, split each into four integers, and process each.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute the answer and print\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as three lines. So that would work.\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead each line from input, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer for that line, and print.\n\nNow, implementing the logic discussed earlier.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nA, B, C, D = ... \n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nS_min = A + B\n\nS_max = B + C\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor s in range(S_min, S_max + 1):\n\n    if s <= C:\n\n        continue\n\n    # compute lower_x and upper_x\n\n    lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n    upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n    if lower_x > upper_x:\n\n        continue\n\n    count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n    contribution = count_pairs * min( s - C, K )\n\n    total += contribution\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, what if s - B is less than A? For example, suppose s is such that s - B is less than A. Then upper_x would be min(B, ...) which is s - B. But if that is less than A, then lower_x would be A, upper_x would be s - B. Which is less than A. Then lower_x > upper_x, so no contribution.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, testing the code with the first sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ns ranges from 3 to 5.\n\ns=3: s <= C (3) → skip.\n\ns=4:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 4-3=1) → 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 4-2=2) → 2.\n\ncount_pairs = 2-1+1=2.\n\ncontribution: 2 * min(4-3=1, 2) → 2*1=2.\n\ns=5:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 5-3=2) → 2.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 5-2=3) → 2.\n\ncount_pairs=1. contribution 1 * min(5-3=2, 2) → 2. Total 2+2=4. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when A=500000, B=500000, C=500000, D=500000.\n\ns_min = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6.\n\ns_max = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6.\n\ns=1e6. Check if s > C (500000) → yes.\n\nlower_x = max(500000, 1e6 - 500000) → 500000.\n\nupper_x = min(500000, 1e6 - 500000) → 500000.\n\ncount_pairs = 1.\n\ncontribution is 1 * min(1e6 - 500000 = 500000, K=1) → 1 * 1 =1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: when x and y can have multiple possibilities.\n\nBut code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the possible ranges of s. For example, when A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5. Then S_min = 1 + 5e5 = 500001, S_max = 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6.\n\nBut for each s in this range, we have to check whether s > C (which is 5e5). So for s starting from 500001 up to 1e6.\n\nBut for each such s, compute lower_x and upper_x.\n\nBut this would take O(5e5) steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nNow, in Python, looping from S_min to S_max can be done with a for loop. However, when S_max is up to 1e6 (for example), and for each test case, it's manageable.\n\nBut what about when A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5. Then S_max - S_min +1 is 1e6 - 500001 +1 = 500000 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut for large values, the code may take some time. However, given that the constraints are up to 5e5, and per test case O(5e5) steps, and assuming that the number of test cases is small (like 10), it's acceptable.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead each line from stdin, split into A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nCompute S_min and S_max.\n\nLoop s from S_min to S_max.\n\nFor each s, compute lower_x and upper_x.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        K = D - C + 1\n        S_min = A + B\n        S_max = B + C\n        total = 0\n        for s in range(S_min, S_max + 1):\n            if s <= C:\n                continue\n            lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n            upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n            if lower_x > upper_x:\n                continue\n            count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n            contribution = count_pairs * min(s - C, K)\n            total += contribution\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, for the case when D is less than C? No, the problem says that C ≤ D. So K is always ≥ 1.\n\nBut in code, when D = C, K = 1.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput line '1 2 3 4' → output 4. Correct.\n\nSample 2: '1 2 2 5' → output 3. Correct.\n\nSample 3: '500000 500000 500000 500000' → output 1. Correct.\n\nNow, what about when s - B is larger than B? For example, if s is very large. Let's take B=2, s=5. s-B = 5 - 2 = 3. upper_x is min(B=2, 3) → 2. So that's correct.\n\nAnother case: when s - B is less than A. For example, A=3, B=5, s= 3 + 5 = 8. Then s - B = 8 - 5 = 3. upper_x is min(5, 3) → 3. lower_x is max(3, s - C). Suppose C is 4. s is 8. s - C = 8 - 4 = 4. lower_x is max(3,4) → 4. upper_x is 3. So lower_x > upper_x, so no contribution.\n\nSo code skips.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy specific constraints. The constraints are given as $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key is to ensure that the triangle inequality holds, which for ordered sides $x \\leq y \\leq z$ translates to $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: The problem requires counting valid triangles where $x$ ranges from $A$ to $B$, $y$ from $B$ to $C$, and $z$ from $C$ to $D$. The triangle inequality simplifies to checking $x + y > z$.\n2. **Range Calculation**: For each possible sum $s = x + y$, determine the valid range of $z$ values such that $z < s$. This translates to counting valid $z$ values within the range $[C, D]$.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating over all possible $x$, $y$, and $z$, we compute the valid sums $s$ and count the valid pairs $(x, y)$ for each sum $s$. This reduces the complexity significantly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        K = D - C + 1\n        S_min = A + B\n        S_max = B + C\n        total = 0\n        for s in range(S_min, S_max + 1):\n            if s <= C:\n                continue\n            lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n            upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n            if lower_x > upper_x:\n                continue\n            count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n            contribution = count_pairs * min(s - C, K)\n            total += contribution\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines of input, each containing four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Range Calculation**: For each line, it calculates the minimum and maximum possible sums $s = x + y$.\n3. **Valid Sums Check**: For each valid sum $s$, it checks if $s > C$ (since $z$ must be at least $C$).\n4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: For each valid sum $s$, it determines the range of $x$ values that can form valid pairs with $y$ such that $x + y = s$. This is done by adjusting bounds based on the constraints.\n5. **Contribution Calculation**: For each valid pair $(x, y)$, the number of valid $z$ values is computed and added to the total count.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the valid ranges and leverages mathematical insights to avoid brute-force iteration, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
