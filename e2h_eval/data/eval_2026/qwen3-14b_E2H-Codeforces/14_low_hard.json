He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo for a given m, we need to find all n's where this count equals m. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5!, the count is 1 (5/5=1). For 6!, same as 5! multiplied by 6, which adds no 5s. So the count remains 1. Similarly up to 9. But when you get to 10, you add another 5 (from 10), so the count becomes 2. So the numbers 5-9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero. Hence 5 numbers.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how do we find those n's?\n\nThe approach I think is to first find the possible n's that would result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing. Because as n increases, the count can stay the same or increase. So for example, when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases.\n\nSo for a given m, there could be zero or more n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. The key is to find the range of n's where f(n) = m.\n\nBut how do we find those n's?\n\nFirst, we need to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Then all numbers between them would be valid. But wait, maybe not. Because for example, when m is 5, perhaps there's a range of numbers where the count is exactly 5. But how do we find that?\n\nBut how to find the minimal and maximal n for a given m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds. Let me think.\n\nLet's consider that for a given m, there might be some n's where f(n) = m. But how do we find if there exists such n's?\n\nWait, the function f(n) is strictly increasing? No, because for example, when n is 5,6,7,8,9, the count is 1. So f(n) increases by 1 when n crosses multiples of 5, but for numbers in between, it's same. So the function is non-decreasing.\n\nSo for a given m, there could be a range of n's where f(n) = m. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose I want to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then, the largest n where f(n) = m would be the smallest n where f(n) >= m+1 minus one. But wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nSuppose that for some m, the minimal n where f(n) = m is x. Then the maximum n where f(n) = m is y. Then the numbers from x to y would all have f(n) = m. But how to find x and y?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, we can find the lower and upper bounds of n where f(n) = m. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m+1. Let's call this high.\n\nThen, the numbers between low and high-1 would have exactly m trailing zeros. So the count is high - low.\n\nBut wait, what if there's no n such that f(n) = m? For example, if m is 5, but there's no n where f(n) is exactly 5. Then this approach would return zero.\n\nSo how to find if there exists any n for a given m?\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this left.\n\n- Then check if f(left) is equal to m. If not, then there are no solutions.\n\n- Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) >=",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The approach involves using the properties of factorials and binary search to efficiently find the range of valid $ n $ values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: For a given $ m $, we use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m $. Similarly, we find the smallest $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m+1 $. The difference between these two bounds gives the range of valid $ n $ values.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: If the count of trailing zeros at the lower bound is not equal to $ m $, there are no valid $ n $ values for that $ m $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target  # Upper bound for binary search\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < target:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if m == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    \n    lower = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_trailing_zeros(lower) != m:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    \n    upper = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    result = list(range(lower, upper))\n    print(len(result))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing up the integer divisions of $ n $ by powers of 5.\n\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the target value. This helps in determining the lower and upper bounds of valid $ n $ values for a given $ m $.\n\n3. **main()**: The main function reads the input $ m $, checks if there are valid $ n $ values by using the helper functions, and then prints the count and the list of valid $ n $ values in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
