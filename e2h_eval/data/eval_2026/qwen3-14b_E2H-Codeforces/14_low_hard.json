He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So for any n, the number of trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where this count equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nWait, the function that counts the number of trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases. Because when n increases by 1, the count can stay the same or increase. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, the count increases. So for a given m, there might be a range of n's that give exactly m zeros. But how to find that range?\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's? Let's think about binary search. For example, if I can find the smallest n where the count is m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count. Wait, but maybe there's no such n. For example, if m is 5, then maybe there's a range of numbers that produce exactly 5 zeros.\n\nWait, but sometimes there might be no n that gives exactly m zeros. For example, if m is 5, but the count jumps from 4 to 6. Then there's no solution. Like, maybe for some m, there's no n such that the count is exactly m. So the answer would be zero.\n\nSo first, I need to find the possible n's where the count is exactly m. How?\n\nLet me think: The count function (let's call it f(n)) is non-decreasing. So for a given m, there's a range of n's where f(n) = m. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think about the possible values of n. For example, if I can find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and then find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) would be the answers. But how?\n\nWait, but for example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Let's check:\n\nFor n=5, f(5) = 1 (since 5/5=1). For n=6, same as 5, because 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1. So adding 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. until the next multiple of 5. So the next multiple is 10. For n=10, f(10) is 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0). So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) give exactly 1 zero. That's 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, there's a range of numbers that give exactly m zeros. But how do we find the lower and upper bounds of that range?\n\nBut how to find if such numbers exist. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n where f(n) = m. If there's no such n (i.e., m is not achievable), then output 0.\n\nBut how to find these n's?\n\nAlternatively, since the function f(n) is non-decreasing, for each m, there could be a range of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if that n's f(n) is equal to m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal and maximal n's.\n\nBut perhaps the approach is to find the lower and upper bounds where f(n) equals m.\n\nAnother approach: For each m, the possible n's are in the range [low, high], where low is the first n where f(n) = m, and high is the last n where f(n) = m. But how to find these?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's must be between 5*m and 5*m + 4 (but this is not accurate, because the count of trailing",
    "response": "To solve the problem of finding the number of positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros, we need to understand how trailing zeros are formed in factorials. The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the count of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to `n`, because there are always more factors of 2 than 5.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in `n!` is given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis function is non-decreasing as `n` increases. Therefore, for a given `m`, we can find a range of values of `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search**:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest `n` such that `count_trailing_zeros(n) == m`.\n   - Then, find the largest `n` such that `count_trailing_zeros(n) == m`.\n\n2. **Check Validity**:\n   - If no such `n` exists (i.e., `count_trailing_zeros(n)` never equals `m`), output `0`.\n\n3. **Generate Result**:\n   - If a valid range of `n` exists, output all numbers in this range.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- We define a helper function `count_trailing_zeros(n)` to compute the number of trailing zeros in `n!`.\n- We use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds of `n` such that `count_trailing_zeros(n) == m`.\n- If the count at the lower bound is not equal to `m`, then no such `n` exists.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Find the lower bound where count is >= m\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    lower = low\n    if count_trailing_zeros(lower) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # Find the upper bound where count is <= m\n    low = lower\n    high = 5 * m + 5\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) > m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    upper = low - 1\n\n    return list(range(lower, upper + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    if not input:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n    try:\n        m = int(input)\n    except:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n\n    results = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(results))\n    if results:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, results)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Usage\n\nFor input:\n```\n1\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nFor input:\n```\n5\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n0\n```\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- Binary search is used twice, each with logarithmic complexity.\n- The total time complexity is approximately `O(log n)` for each binary search, making this solution efficient even for large values of `m` (up to 100,000).",
