And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I need to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those weeks.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the input. The first line has n and k. Then the second line has n integers representing the sleep times each day. The output should be the average of all the weeks' averages. Oh right, but how do I compute that efficiently?\n\nWait, the straightforward approach would be to take every consecutive k elements, sum them, divide by k, then take the average of all those values. But if n is up to 2e5, then doing this naively would be O(nk) time, which would be way too slow. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 1e5, then n-k+1 is about 1e5, and each sum would take O(k) time, leading to O(1e10) operations. That's definitely not feasible.\n\nSo I need a more efficient way. Oh right, sliding window technique! Because each consecutive window overlaps with the previous one by k-1 elements. So if I can compute the sum of the first window, then for each next window, subtract the element that's leaving and add the new element that's entering. That way, each step takes O(1) time, leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nYes. So the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the first k elements. Then, for each subsequent window, subtract a[i] and add a[i + k], etc.\n\nBut wait, the total number of windows is (n - k + 1). For each of these, we need to compute their sum, then divide by k, and then take the average of all those.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute all the window sums using the sliding window approach.\n- Sum all those window sums, then divide by (number of windows * k) ?\n\nWait, because the average of all the weeks' averages is equal to the total sum of all the window sums divided by (number of windows * k). Because each window's average is (sum)/k, and then the average of all those is (sum of all window sums / (number of windows * k)).\n\nYes. So instead of computing each average and then averaging them, I can just compute the total sum of all window sums, then divide by (number of windows * k). Which is the same as the average of all the averages.\n\nSo the key is to compute the total sum of all the window sums. Then divide by ( (n - k + 1) * k ), which is the total number of elements across all windows.\n\nSo how do I compute the total sum of all window sums?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the first sample input: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]. The windows are [3,4] sum 7, [4,7] sum 11. Total sum is 7 + 11 = 18. Then divide by (2 * 2) = 4, which gives 4.5. Wait but the sample output is 9.000... Wait no, wait the sample output says for that input the output is 9.000... Wait what's the actual calculation here?\n\nWait in the first example, the problem says that the result is 9.000... Wait let me check the example again.\n\nWait the first example input is:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe output is 9.0000000000.\n\nWait how? Let me compute it. The weeks are two weeks. First week is days 1-2, sum 3+4=7, average 7/2 = 3.5. Second week is days 2-3, sum 4+7=11, average 11/2=5.5. The average of these two averages is (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? But the sample output says 9.0?\n\nWait that's conflicting. Oh wait, no, maybe I made a mistake in the example. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait the sample input says:\n\nIn the first example, the input is 3 2 and the array [3,4,7]. The output is 9.000... But according to my calculation, the average of the two averages is (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 4.5. But the sample output says 9.0. Wait that's impossible. Oh wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the problem says: \"the result is ... for example, if k=2, n=3 and a = [3,4,7], then the result is ...\". Wait the example in the problem says that the result is 9.0? Or perhaps there's a typo here. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait the problem says: \"the result is . You should write a program which will calculate average sleeping time of Polycarp over all weeks.\"\n\nWait the example given in the problem is probably incomplete. Let me check the user's provided examples.\n\nLooking at the user's input examples:\n\nThe first input is '3 2\\n3 4 7' and the output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nWait according to that, the answer is 9.0. How?\n\nLet me re-calculate. Oh wait, perhaps the problem says that the average is the sum of all the weeks' total sleep times divided by the number of weeks, but not divided by k. Wait no, the problem says that each week's average is the average per week. Then the overall average is the average of all those averages.\n\nWait for example, in the first case, the two weeks have averages of 3.5 and 5.5. The average of those is (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. That suggests that I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait perhaps the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the total sleep times per week. Like, the average of the sum of each week, not the average per week.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So perhaps the problem requires that the average is the sum of all the weeks' total sleep times divided by the number of weeks. But that would be the average of the sum per week, not the average of the average per week.\n\nWait but the problem says that Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. Then, the average is the average of the average per week. So for example, the first example's two weeks have averages 3.5 and 5.5. The average of these is 4.5, but the sample output is 9.0. That's impossible unless I have a misunderstanding.\n\nWait maybe the problem says that the average is the sum of all the weeks' total sleep times divided by the number of weeks. But that would be the average of the sum per week, not the average of the average per week. Let me check the note.\n\nIn the third example, the input is 8 2, and the array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. The output is 28964.2857142857.\n\nThe note says that there are 7 weeks. So the sum of all weeks' total sleep times is (sum of each week's sum). Then the average is that sum divided by 7. Let's see.\n\nFor example, the third example's output is 28964.2857... Let's see:\n\nEach week is two consecutive days. The weeks are:\n\n[1,2] sum 3 → average 1.5\n\n[2,4] sum 6 → average 3.0\n\n[4,100000] sum 100004 → average 50002.0\n\n[100000, 123] sum 100123 → average 50061.5\n\n[123, 456] sum 579 → average 289.5\n\n[456, 789] sum 1245 → average 622.5\n\n[789, 1] sum 790 → average 395.0\n\nThe average of these averages would be (1.5 + 3.0 + 50002.0 + 50061.5 + 289.5 + 622.5 + 395.0)/7 → let's compute that. Let me add them up:\n\n1.5 + 3 = 4.5\n\nplus 50002 → 50006.5 \n\nplus 50061.5 → 100,068 \n\nplus 289.5 → 100,357.5 \n\nplus 622.5 → 100,980 \n\nplus 395 → 101,375. \n\nDivide by 7 → 101375 /7 = approx 14482.142857... But the sample output is 28964.28... which is exactly double that. So that suggests that the problem is not taking the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. Because if you take the sum of all the sums, then divide by the number of weeks, that's the average of the sums. Let's compute that.\n\nSum of the sums in the third example:\n\n3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = \n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n+100004 = 100013 \n\n+100123 → 200136 \n\n+579 → 200715 \n\n+1245 → 201,960 \n\n+790 → 202,750 \n\nThen divide by 7 weeks: 202750 /7 = 28964.2857... which matches the sample output. \n\nAh, so the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the sum of each week. Wait but the problem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nSo in that example, the sum of the two weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 weeks gives 9. Which is the sample output. Oh! So the problem is asking for the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the average per week. So the problem statement's wording is confusing. \n\nSo the problem says that Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. Then, the average is the average of the sum of each week. Because in the first example, the average is (7 + 11)/2 = 9. Which is the sample output. \n\nBut why does the problem say \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\"? That would imply that each week's average is computed, and then the overall average. However, according to the sample, that's not the case. \n\nBut the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. \n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the total sum of all the window sums, then divide by the number of windows. Because that's the average of the sum of each week. \n\nSo the initial approach was wrong. The correct way is to compute the total sum of all the window sums, then divide by (number of windows), which is (n - k + 1). \n\nSo for the first example, the sum of the two windows is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 gives 9, which is the sample output. \n\nThat's a crucial point. So the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the sum of each week. \n\nSo the problem's description is a bit misleading. So the correct formula is:\n\nTotal sum of all window sums divided by (number of windows).\n\nSo how to compute that? Well, the sliding window approach allows us to compute the sum of all window sums efficiently.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the sum of all the window sums.\n\n2. Divide that by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1).\n\nSo the question is, how to compute the sum of all window sums efficiently.\n\nLet me think. For example, for the array [a1, a2, ..., an], each element ai contributes to exactly k windows. Wait no. Wait for each element ai, how many windows include it?\n\nIf the window size is k, then for the first element, it's included in exactly 1 window (the first window). For the second element, it's included in 2 windows (first and second). Wait no. Let me think.\n\nActually, for an element at position i (starting from 1), the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of positions where the window starts at or before i and ends at or after i. \n\nAlternatively, for the element at index i (0-based?), the number of windows that include it is min(i + 1, n - k + 1) ? Not sure. Let me think of a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each element ai, the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of possible starting positions such that the window includes ai. For example, for a window of size k, the first window starts at 0 (assuming 0-based), ends at k-1. The next starts at 1, ends at k, etc. \n\nFor element ai (0-based), the earliest window that includes it is the window that starts at max(0, i - k + 1) ? No, perhaps better to think: the window that starts at s and ends at s + k - 1. For ai to be in the window, s ≤ i ≤ s + k - 1 → s ≤ i and s ≥ i - k + 1. Also, s must be ≥0 and s + k -1 < n → s can range from 0 to n -k.\n\nSo the number of windows that include ai is the number of s values that satisfy s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k + 1, and also s ≥0 and s ≤ n -k.\n\nSo the number of such s is min(i + 1, n -k +1) - max(0, i -k +1) ?\n\nAlternatively, for each ai, the number of windows that include it is the number of windows that start at positions from max(0, i -k + 1) to min(i, n -k). \n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. For example, for any ai, the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of positions where the window starts at s, and s ≤ i ≤ s + k -1. So s can be from max(0, i -k + 1) to min(i, n -k). \n\nBut maybe there's a pattern. For example, for the first k-1 elements, the number of windows that include them increases. For elements in the middle, they are included in exactly k windows. For the last k-1 elements, the number decreases. \n\nBut perhaps there's a formula. Let me think. For each ai, the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of possible windows that contain it. For example, the first element is in 1 window. The second element is in 2 windows. ... until the k-th element, which is in k windows. Then, the (k+1)-th element is in k windows. And so on until the (n -k +1)th element. Then the (n -k +2)th element is in k-1 windows, etc. \n\nBut for the general case, the number of windows that include ai is min(i + 1, n -k + 1) ?\n\nNo. Wait for example, when i is in the middle of the array. Let's take n=5, k=3. Then the number of windows is 5-3+1=3. The windows are [0,1,2], [1,2,3], [2,3,4]. \n\nFor element 0: included only in the first window. So count 1.\n\nelement 1: included in first and second window → count 2.\n\nelement 2: included in all three windows → count 3.\n\nelement 3: included in second and third → count 2.\n\nelement 4: included in third → count 1.\n\nSo for each element, the count is min(i + 1, n -k + 1, ...) ?\n\nWait for element i (0-based), the count is min(i + 1, n -k + 1) ?\n\nNo, for element i=2 in this case, i+1 is 3. n -k +1 is 3. So yes. For i=3, i+1 is 4, but the maximum possible is 3 (since there are 3 windows). So the count is min(i + 1, n -k + 1) ?\n\nWait for i=3, the count is 2. But i+1 is 4, and n -k +1 is 3. So min(4, 3) is 3, which is incorrect. So that approach isn't correct.\n\nAlternatively, the count is min( i + 1, n -k + 1 ) ?\n\nNo. Maybe the count is min( i + 1, n -k + 1, n - i ) ?\n\nFor example, for element i=3 in the above example, n=5, k=3. n - i = 5-3=2. So min(3+1=4, 3, 2) → 2. Which is correct. For element i=2, min(3, 3, 5-2=3) → 3. Correct. For i=0, min(1, 3, 5-0=5) → 1. Correct. For i=1, min(2, 3, 4) → 2. Correct. For i=4, min(5, 3, 1) → 1. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for the number of windows that include ai is min( i + 1, n -k + 1, n - i ). But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for each ai, the number of windows that include it is the number of windows that start at s where s ranges from max(0, i -k +1) to min( i, n -k ). \n\nBut regardless of that, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the total sum of all window sums. Because if we can find that, then we can divide by the number of windows to get the answer.\n\nThe total sum of all window sums is equal to the sum of each element multiplied by the number of windows that include it. So if I can compute for each element ai, how many times it's counted in the total sum, then multiply by ai and sum all those.\n\nSo the total sum is sum_{i=0 to n-1} (ai * cnt_i), where cnt_i is the number of windows that include ai.\n\nSo how to compute cnt_i for each ai?\n\nFor each ai, the number of windows that include it is the number of possible starting positions s such that s <= i <= s + k -1. Which can be rewritten as s <= i and s >= i - k + 1. Also, s must be between 0 and n -k.\n\nSo the valid range of s is [max(0, i - k + 1), min( n -k, i ) ].\n\nThe number of such s is min(n -k, i) - max(0, i -k + 1) + 1.\n\nSo for each ai, compute that value.\n\nBut calculating this for each element might be O(1) per element, leading to O(n) time. Which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each element ai in the array, compute the count of how many windows include it. Then multiply ai by that count and add to the total sum.\n\nOnce the total sum is found, divide it by the number of windows (n -k +1) to get the answer.\n\nThis approach is O(n) time and O(1) space (if we process each element in a loop).\n\nLet me test this approach with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: n=3, k=2, a = [3,4,7]\n\nNumber of windows is 3-2+1 = 2.\n\nFor each element:\n\ni=0 (a=3):\n\nmax(0, 0 - 2 +1) = max(0, -1) = 0.\n\nmin( n -k = 3-2=1, i=0) → 0.\n\nSo the count is 0 -0 +1 = 1. So 3*1 = 3.\n\ni=1 (a=4):\n\nmax(0, 1 -2 +1) = max(0, 0) → 0.\n\nmin(1, 1) → 1.\n\ncount is 1 -0 +1 = 2. So 4 * 2 = 8.\n\ni=2 (a=7):\n\nmax(0, 2-2+1) = max(0, 1) → 1.\n\nmin(1, 2) → 1.\n\ncount is 1 -1 +1 = 1. So 7 * 1 =7.\n\nTotal sum is 3 +8 +7 = 18. Divided by 2 gives 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: the third example input:\n\nn=8, k=2. The array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1].\n\nNumber of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\nFor each element:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 7.\n\nFor each ai, compute the count.\n\nLet me take the element at i=3 (value 100000). \n\nmax(0, 3 -2 +1) = max(0, 2) = 2.\n\nmin( n -k = 8-2=6, i=3) → 3.\n\nso count is 3 - 2 +1 = 2. So this element contributes 100000 * 2 = 200000.\n\nSimilarly, for i=0:\n\nmax(0, 0 -2 +1) = max(0,-1)=0.\n\nmin(6, 0) → 0. count is 0-0 +1 =1 → 1 *1 =1.\n\ni=1:\n\nmax(0, 1-2+1)=0.\n\nmin(6,1) →1. count 1-0+1=2 → 2*2=4.\n\ni=2:\n\nmax(0, 2-2+1)=1.\n\nmin(6, 2) →2. count 2-1 +1 =2 → 4 * 2=8.\n\ni=3: as before, 2 → 100000 *2 =200000.\n\ni=4:\n\nmax(0,4-2+1) =3.\n\nmin(6,4) →4. count 4-3+1=2 → 123 *2=246.\n\ni=5:\n\nmax(0,5-2+1)=4.\n\nmin(6,5) →5. count 5-4+1=2 → 456 *2=912.\n\ni=6:\n\nmax(0,6-2+1)=5.\n\nmin(6,6) →6. count 6-5+1=2 → 789 *2=1578.\n\ni=7:\n\nmax(0,7-2+1)=6.\n\nmin(6,7) →6. count 6-6+1=1 → 1*1=1.\n\nSo adding all contributions:\n\n1 +4 +8 +200000 +246 +912 +1578 +1 = \n\nLet me compute:\n\nStart with 1 +4 =5; +8=13; +200000 = 200013; +246 = 200259; +912 = 201171; +1578 = 202749; +1 = 202750. Which matches the earlier calculation. Dividing by 7 gives 202750 /7 = 28964.2857..., which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to computing for each element ai, the count as described, then multiply and sum.\n\nNow, how to compute the count for each ai?\n\nFor each i (0-based?), let me think:\n\nThe formula is:\n\nstart = max(0, i - k + 1)\n\nend = min( n -k, i )\n\ncount = end - start +1.\n\nBut n -k is the maximum possible s (since s can be from 0 to n -k).\n\nSo for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nstart = max(0, i - k +1 )\n\nend = min( i, n -k )\n\nif end < start, then count is 0. But since k <=n, and i ranges from 0 to n-1, then for any i, there must be at least one window that includes it. So the count is always >=1.\n\nBut how to compute start and end?\n\nLet me code this in Python.\n\nBut first, note that in Python, the indices are 0-based. So for the input array, we can process each element as 0-based.\n\nSo for each element at index i (0-based), compute:\n\nstart_s = max(0, i - k + 1)\n\nend_s = min( i, n -k )\n\ncount = end_s - start_s + 1\n\nSo for each element, multiply by count and accumulate.\n\nOnce that's done, the total sum is divided by (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nSo this approach is O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array as list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = 0.\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   start_s = max(0, i - k + 1)\n\n   end_s = min( i, n -k )\n\n   count = end_s - start_s +1\n\n   total_sum += a[i] * count\n\nthen, average = total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nThen, output the average with sufficient decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if k is 1? For example, n=1, k=1. Then the number of windows is 1, and for i=0, start_s = max(0, 0 -1 +1) = max(0, 0) = 0. end_s = min(0, 1-1=0) → 0. count is 0-0+1=1. So total_sum is a[0] * 1. Divided by 1, correct.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input is '1 1\\n10'. Output is 10.000... So the code would compute:\n\nn=1, k=1. For i=0, start_s is max(0, 0 -1 +1) = 0. end_s is min(0, 0) = 0. count is 1. total_sum =10 *1 =10. divided by 1 → 10. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in Python, for large n (up to 2e5), this loop is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the input. But the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user provided examples have multiple inputs, but the problem says that the input is a single test case. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given by the user, the first input is ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'], which seems to be multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases as part of the examples, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is a single test case. However, the sample input given by the user includes multiple test cases. But that's probably because the user is showing multiple examples. However, the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich would produce output 9.0000000000.\n\nSo the code must read one test case. But perhaps the user's sample input is not properly formatted, but the actual code must handle one test case.\n\nSo the code must read two lines: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the total_sum as explained.\n\nThen compute average = total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nThen output the average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to handle floating points? For example, in Python, division is done with /, and then format the output with enough decimal digits.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut for very large numbers, like 1e5 * 2e5, the total_sum can be up to 1e5 * 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e16, which is within Python's integer handling.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    start_s = max(0, i - k + 1)\n    end_s = min(i, n - k)\n    count = end_s - start_s + 1\n    total += a[i] * count\navg = total / (n - k + 1)\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nWait but in Python, when you print with .10f, it rounds to 10 decimal places. However, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error is <= 1e-6. So printing with 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\ntotal is 3*1 +4*2 +7*1 = 3 +8 +7=18. avg is 18/(3-2+1) = 18/2=9. So printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThe second sample input is n=1, k=1. a=[10]. total is 10*1 =10. avg is 10/1=10.0 → printed as 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=8, k=2, a = [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\ntotal is 202750. avg is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich is printed with 10 decimals as 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut the sample output is '28964.2857142857'.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut let me check the third sample's code.\n\nYes, the code would compute the total as 202750, and divided by 7. 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714..., so the print statement would format it as 28964.2857142857 (with 10 decimals). Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: k =n. So there is only one window. Each element is counted once. So total is sum(a) * 1. Divided by 1 → sum(a). Which is correct.\n\nCase 2: k=1. So each window is one element. The number of windows is n. Each element is counted once. So total is sum(a). Divided by n → average of all elements. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=1. Then the average is (a[0] +a[1])/2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=4, k=2. The array [1,2,3,4]. The windows are [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]. Their sums are 3,5,7. Total sum is 15. Divided by 3 → 5.0. \n\nUsing the code:\n\nFor each element:\n\ni=0:\n\nstart_s = max(0, 0 -2 +1) = max(0, -1) =0.\n\nend_s = min(0, 4-2=2) → 0. count 0-0+1=1 → 1*1=1.\n\ni=1:\n\nstart_s = max(0, 1-2+1)=0.\n\nend_s = min(1, 2) →1. count 1-0+1=2 → 2*2=4.\n\ni=2:\n\nstart_s = max(0, 2-2+1)=1.\n\nend_s = min(2, 2) →2. count 2-1+1=2 →3*2=6.\n\ni=3:\n\nstart_s = max(0, 3-2+1)=2.\n\nend_s = min(3, 2) →2. count 2-2+1=1 →4*1=4.\n\nTotal sum is 1 +4 +6 +4 =15. Divided by 3 →5. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of `k` days from a list of `n` days. The solution must efficiently compute this average given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task requires calculating the average sleep time for each possible week (consecutive `k` days) and then finding the average of these averages. However, this can be optimized by recognizing that we can compute the total sum of all weekly sums and then divide by the number of weeks to get the result directly.\n2. **Efficient Calculation Using Sliding Window Technique**: Instead of recalculating the sum for each window from scratch, we use the contribution of each day to all possible windows it belongs to. This approach avoids redundant calculations and ensures linear time complexity.\n3. **Contribution Counting**: For each day in the list, determine how many windows include that day. This count helps in computing the total contribution of each day to the overall sum of all weekly sums.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        start_s = max(0, i - k + 1)\n        end_s = min(i, n - k)\n        count = end_s - start_s + 1\n        total += a[i] * count\n    avg = total / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(avg))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the week length `k`, and the list of sleep times.\n2. **Total Contribution Calculation**: For each day `i` in the list, we calculate how many windows include this day. This is done using the range of valid starting positions for windows that include the day.\n3. **Summing Contributions**: Each day's contribution to the total sum of all weekly sums is calculated by multiplying the day's sleep time by the number of windows that include it.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of contributions is divided by the number of weeks (which is `n - k + 1`) to get the final average sleep time per week.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the given constraints.",
