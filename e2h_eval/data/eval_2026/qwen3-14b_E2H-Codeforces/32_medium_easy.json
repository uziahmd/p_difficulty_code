    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to consider each element, remove it, compute the new max and min, and then find the minimum instability. But if we do this naively, it would be O(n^2) time, which isn't feasible for n up to 1e5. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, what's the original instability? It's max(a) - min(a). When we remove one element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nIf the element we remove is not the current max or min, then the max and min remain the same. So the instability remains the same as the original. But if we remove the max, then the new max is the second highest element. Similarly, if we remove the min, the new min is the second lowest. So maybe the optimal choice is to remove either the max or the min, but not sure.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are multiple instances of max or min. For example, if the array has multiple max elements, removing one of them would leave others, so the max remains the same. So in that case, removing a max element doesn't change the max. Similarly for min.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to look at the cases where removing an element affects the max or min. So the idea is:\n\nThe original array's max and min are known. Let's sort the array first. Wait, sorting might help here. Let's think.\n\nIf the array is sorted, then the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Now, when we remove one element, the new instability depends on which element we remove. For example, if we remove the first element (the min), then the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1], so the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If we remove the last element (the max), the new instability is a[-2] - a[0]. If we remove some element in the middle, then the max and min remain the same, so the instability is the same as original. So the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0], original instability).\n\nWait, but that's only if the array is sorted. Let me think again. Suppose the array is sorted. Then, the original instability is a[n-1] - a[0]. If we remove any element except the first or last, the instability remains the same. So the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a[n-1] - a[1], a[n-2] - a[0], a[n-1] - a[0] - (if we remove some element that's not min or max, but that's not possible because the instability would be same as original). Wait, no. If you remove an element that's not the min or max, then the min and max stay the same. So the instability remains the same as original. Therefore, the minimal instability would be the minimum between the two options: removing the first element (so instability is a[n-1] - a[1]) or removing the last element (instability is a[n-2] - a[0]). But wait, what if there are duplicates?\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. Sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove the first element, the new array is [3,3,7], instability is 4. If we remove the last element, the array becomes [1,3,3], instability is 2. Which is better. So in this case, the answer is 2. Which matches the example given.\n\nBut according to the previous idea, the minimal would be min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] ). So for this example, a[-1] - a[1] is 7-3=4, a[-2] -a[0] is 3-1=2. So the minimum is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 100000]. Removing either element gives instability 0. Which is min between (a[-1]-a[1] (but n=2, a[-1] is 100000, a[1] is 100000, so 0) and a[-2] -a[0] (a[-2] is 1, a[0] is 1, 0). So correct.\n\nSo this suggests that the solution is to sort the array, then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]). But why?\n\nBecause when you remove the first element (the min), the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]. When you remove the last element (the max), the new instability is a[-2] - a[0]. And for all other elements, the instability remains the same as original (a[-1] - a[0]). So the minimal possible is the minimum between these two options.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple elements that are min or max?\n\nFor example, say the array is [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]. The original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 1s, the new instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 3s, the new instability is 3-1=2. But if we remove the 2, the instability is still 3-1=2. So the minimum is 2. But according to our approach, the min between a[-1]-a[1] (3-1=2) and a[-2]-a[0] (2-1=1). Wait, a[-2] is 2. So the a[-2] - a[0] is 2-1=1. Which would be better. But that's not possible, because in this case, the array after removing the last element (3) would be [1,1,2,3]. The instability is 3-1=2. Wait, why is that?\n\nAh, because the a[-2] in the original array is 2. So when we remove the last element (3), the new array's max is 3 (the previous a[-2] is 2, but the original array is [1,1,2,3,3]. So after removing the last element, the array is [1,1,2,3]. The max is 3, min is 1. So instability is 2. But according to a[-2] - a[0], which is 2-1=1. Which is wrong. So why is there a discrepancy here?\n\nWait, because in this case, the original array is sorted. So the a[-2] is 3. Wait no, original array is [1,1,2,3,3]. So when sorted, the array is [1,1,2,3,3]. So a[-1] is 3, a[-2] is 3. So a[-2] - a[0] is 3-1=2. Oh right. So the previous example was incorrect. So in that case, the a[-2] is 3, so a[-2] - a[0] is 3-1=2. Which is correct. So the approach is correct.\n\nSo the idea is that, after sorting the array, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut why? Because when you remove the first element (the min), the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1]. So instability is a[-1] - a[1]. When you remove the last element (the max), the new max is a[-2], and the min is a[0], so instability is a[-2] - a[0]. All other removals would leave the min and max as before, so the instability is a[-1] - a[0]. So the minimal between those three options is the answer.\n\nWait, but what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Original instability is 3. If we remove 1, instability is 3 (4-2). Remove 4, instability is 2 (3-1). So the answer is 2. Which is min between 3 and 2. So the approach works.\n\nSo the solution is to sort the array, then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut what if the array has more than two elements? Let's take another example. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 5, 7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove 1, instability is 7-3=4. If we remove 7, instability is 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. But according to the approach, the minimum between (7-3=4) and (5-1=4) is 4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 10]. Original instability is 9. If we remove 1, instability is 10-2=8. If we remove 10, instability is 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. Which is the min between 8 and 4. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute the original instability (max - min) which is a[-1] - a[0].\n\n- The possible minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what if the array has multiple elements that are the same as the min or max? For example, [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then, removing any element gives instability 0. Which is correct. According to the approach, a[-1] - a[1] is 1 -1 = 0. a[-2] - a[0] is 1-1=0. So correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 1, 3, 3]. Original instability is 2. If we remove 1, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove 3, the instability is 3-1=2. But if we remove one of the 1s, the array becomes [1,3,3], instability is 2. But according to the approach, the min between a[-1]-a[1] (3-1=2) and a[-2]-a[0] (3-1=2). So the answer is 2, which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 2, 3]. Original instability is 2. If you remove 1, the instability is 3-2=1. If you remove 3, the instability is 2-1=1. So the answer is 1. Which is min between 3-2=1 and 2-1=1. So correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nTherefore, the steps for the solution are:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what about when the array has n=2 elements?\n\nLike the second example given: [1, 100000]. After sorting, it's [1, 100000]. Then, a[-1] - a[1] is 100000 - 100000 = 0. a[-2] - a[0] is 1 - 1 = 0. So the answer is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo for all cases, the solution is to sort the array and then take the minimum between those two values.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it, then compute min between (a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what about when n is 2? Then, a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So the two options are a[-1] - a[1] = 0 and a[-2] - a[0] = 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo yes, this approach works for all n >= 2.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n, then list a. Sort a. Then compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what about when n is larger than 2? For example, n=3. Let's say the array is [1, 2, 3]. Then, the options are:\n\nremove 1: instability is 3-2=1.\n\nremove 3: instability is 2-1=1.\n\nremove 2: instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is 1. Which is the min between 1 and 1. So correct.\n\nSo the code would return the correct value.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test the first example:\n\nInput is 4 elements [1,3,3,7]. Sorted is [1,3,3,7]. So a[-1] - a[1] is 7-3=4. a[-2] - a[0] is 3-1=2. So the minimum is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 1, 1, 1]. The answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. The options are (9 - 3) = 6, (7 - 1) = 6. So the answer is 6. But if you remove 3, the instability is 9-1=8. Wait, but according to our approach, the answer is 6. Which is correct. Because the minimal is achieved by removing the first element (1) or the last element (9). So the instability is 9-3=6 or 7-1=6. Which is indeed the minimum possible.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead n, then the array. Sort it. Then compute min between a[-1] - a[1] and a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So the two options are a[-1] - a[1] = a[1] - a[1] = 0, and a[-2] - a[0] = a[0] - a[0] = 0. So correct.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code would have a[-1] - a[1] = a[1] - a[1] = 0. Similarly for option2. So even if n=2, the code can be handled by the same formula. So the code can be simplified to:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n\nWait, but for n=2, a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So the code would compute min(a[1] - a[1], a[0] - a[0]) = min(0, 0) = 0. Which is correct. So the code can handle all cases, even n=2.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort, then compute min between a[-1] - a[1] and a[-2] - a[0].\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\na[-1] - a[1] = 7-3=4.\n\na[-2] - a[0] = 3-1=2 → min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]\n\na[-1] -a[1] is 100000 - 100000 = 0. a[-2] -a[0] is 1-1=0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1,2,3]. min between 3-2=1 and 2-1=1 → 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,2,3]. sorted is [1,2,2,3]. option1 is 3-2=1. option2 is 2-1=1. min is 1.\n\nAnother test case: [1,2,3,4,5]. option1 is 5-2=3. option2 is 4-1=3. So answer is 3.\n\nBut if you remove 3, the instability is 5-1=4. Which is worse. So the code's approach is correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut wait, what about when the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. So sorted. The original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, instability is 5-2=3. If we remove 5, instability is 4-1=3. So the answer is 3. Which is min between 5-2=3 and 4-1=3. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct. Thus, the Python code is as described.\n",
