    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with the examples given. For instance, the input 'ababa' gives output 3. The substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So even though they overlap, it's allowed.\n\nThe challenge is to find all possible substrings, check their occurrences, and find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check all possible substrings?\n\nLet me think about the brute force approach first. For each possible substring length, starting from the maximum possible down to 1, check if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice. Once found, return that length.\n\nThe maximum possible length for a substring that can appear twice is floor(n/2), where n is the length of the string. For example, if the string is length 5, the maximum possible is 2 (since a substring of length 3 would need at least two occurrences, but 3*2=6 which is longer than 5). Wait, no. Wait, for example, in 'aaaaa', the substring of length 3 'aaa' appears multiple times. So the maximum possible length is up to n-1, but for the substring to appear at least twice, the length can be up to (n-1) if the string is like 'aa' (length 2, substring of length 1 appears twice). Wait, for a string of length n, the maximum possible length of a substring that occurs twice is floor(n/2). Because for example, if the string is of length 5, then a substring of length 2 can occur twice (like positions 0-1 and 3-4). But a substring of length 3 would require two occurrences, which would take 3 + 3 - overlap. But if the string is 5 characters long, the maximum possible is 2, since two occurrences of length 3 would need at least 3+1 = 4 characters (if overlapping by 2). Hmm, maybe not. For example, in 'aaaaa', the substring 'aaa' occurs starting at 0, 1, 2. So for a string of length 5, the maximum possible length is 3, which is 5-2. So perhaps the maximum possible length to check is n-1, but for the substring to have two occurrences, the length can be up to n-1 (for example, if the string is 'aa', then length 1 is the max, which is n-1).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop through possible lengths from the maximum possible (which is len(s) - 1) down to 1. For each length l, check all possible substrings of length l. For each substring, check if it appears at least twice. If any such substring exists, return l as the answer. If none found for any length, return 0.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor the input string s:\n\n- For l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   - For each starting index i from 0 to len(s) - l:\n\n      - Take substring s[i:i+l]\n\n      - Check if this substring appears again in the string (at least once more)\n\n      - If found, return l as the maximum length.\n\n- If no such substring found for any l, return 0.\n\nBut how to efficiently check if a substring appears again?\n\nFor each substring of length l, we can collect all occurrences and check if there are at least two. However, for each substring, checking all possible positions might be O(n) per substring. But considering that the maximum length of the string is 100, this approach may be feasible.\n\nLet me think about the time complexity. For each possible l (up to 100), for each possible starting index (up to 100), and for each substring, checking if it appears again. For each substring, checking if it exists again can be done by checking all other positions. For example, for a substring of length l, for each occurrence, check if there's another occurrence.\n\nBut for each substring of length l, we can collect all the starting indices where it occurs, and see if the count is >= 2.\n\nBut for each l, the number of possible substrings is O(n) (for each l, there are n - l + 1 substrings). For each of these substrings, checking if it occurs again can be done by checking all other substrings of the same length. However, this could be O(n^2) per l. But for n=100, the total operations would be O(n^3) in the worst case, which for n=100 would be 1e6 operations. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo for example, for each l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   create a dictionary that maps substrings of length l to their counts.\n\n   if any of the counts is >=2, return l.\n\nSo for each l, we can collect all substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\nBut how to collect that? For example, for each l, iterate through all possible starting indices, collect the substrings, and track their counts. If any count is >=2, then return l.\n\nYes. So this approach would work.\n\nLet me think of the example 'ababa':\n\nlen(s) is 5. So l starts from 4 down to 1.\n\nFor l=4:\n\nsubstrings are 'abab' (indices 0-3), 'baba' (indices 1-4). Both are unique, so no.\n\nl=3: substrings are 'aba' (0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). So the substring 'aba' occurs twice. So return 3.\n\nSo the code would return 3.\n\nAnother example: 'zzz' (input is 'zzz'). len is 3. So l starts at 2.\n\nFor l=2: substrings are 'zz' (indices 0-1), 'zz' (indices 1-2). So count is 2. So return 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: 'abcd' has length 4. For l=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bcd' — both unique. l=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — all unique. l=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' — all unique. So output is 0.\n\nSo this approach works for the sample cases.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor the given string s:\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor l in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   seen = {}\n\n   for i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1):\n\n      substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n      if substr in seen:\n\n          # already seen once, so at least two occurrences\n\n          return l\n\n      else:\n\n          seen[substr] = 1\n\n   # after checking all substrings of length l, if any had duplicates, we would have returned\n\nSo wait, but in this approach, for each l, we check all substrings of length l. For each substring, if it's seen again, then we can immediately return l as the maximum. Because we are checking l from largest to smallest. So once we find a l where there's at least one duplicate substring, that's the maximum possible.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the case of 'ababa', when l=3, the first occurrence is 'aba' (i=0). Then when i=2, the substring is 'aba' again. So during the loop for i=2, substr is 'aba' which is in seen (from i=0). So the code returns 3 immediately.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple substrings of the same l? For example, if there are two different substrings of length l that each occur twice. But the code would return l as soon as it finds the first occurrence of a duplicate.\n\nBut that's correct, because the code is looking for the maximum possible l. So once we find any l where there's a duplicate, we can return it immediately.\n\nBut the code above would not work correctly. Because in the loop for l, for each substring, we check if it's in the 'seen' dictionary. However, if the same substring occurs more than once, then when we check the second occurrence, we can return l. But in the code above, the 'seen' is a dictionary that tracks whether the substring has been seen before. So for example, when we process the first occurrence, we add it to 'seen'. When processing the second occurrence, we check if it's in 'seen' and return.\n\nBut this approach would miss some cases where a substring occurs more than once but not in consecutive positions. Wait, no. Because for example, if the substring occurs three times, then during the first occurrence, it's added to 'seen'. Then during the second occurrence, we check and find it in 'seen', return l. So it's correct.\n\nBut the code as written would check for each substring of length l, and if any of them occurs more than once, return l. So the code is correct.\n\nBut the code needs to be structured as follows:\n\nLoop l from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   create a set (or a dictionary) to track substrings of length l.\n\n   for each i in 0 to len(s)-l:\n\n      substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n      if substr is in the set:\n\n          return l\n\n      else:\n\n          add substr to the set\n\n   (if after checking all substrings of length l, no duplicates found, proceed to l-1)\n\nIf after checking all possible l, nothing found, return 0.\n\nWait, but the code for this would be:\n\ndef longest_substring(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return l\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\nWait, but this code would not work correctly. For example, consider the case where a substring occurs three times. For example, 'aaaaa' with l=3. The substrings are 'aaa' (i=0), 'aaa' (i=1), 'aaa' (i=2). The first occurrence is added to the set. The second occurrence is checked and found in the set, so returns 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about a case where the same substring occurs in non-consecutive positions? Like for example, the string is 'abab', and l=2. The substrings are 'ab' (i=0), 'ba' (i=1), 'ab' (i=2). So during the loop, when i=0, 'ab' is added. Then i=1, 'ba' is added. Then i=2, 'ab' is checked. It's in the set, so returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So this code seems to handle that.\n\nBut wait, what about a case where a substring appears twice but not consecutively. For example, 'abcab', l=2. The substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'ca', 'ab'. So when i=0, 'ab' is added. Then i=3, 'ab' is checked again. So the code returns 2. Correct.\n\nSo this code seems to work.\n\nBut why in the first example, for the input 'ababa', when l=3, the code checks i=0, substr is 'aba' added to the set. Then i=1, substr is 'bab' added. Then i=2, substr is 'aba' which is in the set. So returns 3. Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nBut what about overlapping occurrences? For example, the sample input 'ababa' with l=3. The code correctly finds that 'aba' occurs twice. The code does not care about overlapping, as long as the substrings are present.\n\nSo this approach should handle overlapping occurrences.\n\nNow, the code for this function would be as described.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is a list of strings, and for each of them, output the answer.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line containing the string. Wait, no. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWait, but the problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows a list of strings. That suggests that perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are given. However, the original problem statement may have been presented with a note that the input is a list of strings. But perhaps that's a mistake.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user wrote:\n\n## Input\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nBut the sample input shows ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which is a list of strings. However, that may be a formatting error. Because according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. But the sample shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the sample input, and the actual input is a single string, and the sample input is perhaps a list of test cases.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. So the sample input may be incorrect. But perhaps the actual problem is that the input is a list of strings, and for each of them, output the answer. But the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\nThis suggests that the problem is expecting multiple test cases. But the original problem description says that the first input line contains the string. Which would imply that the input is a single string. However, perhaps the problem was presented in a way that the input is a list of strings. But this is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input is given as a single string. But the sample input shows a list of strings. Which is confusing. However, perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted. For example, maybe the input is a list of strings, but the actual input is read as a single line. For example, perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted, and the actual input is a single string. But the sample input shows that for the input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nBut that would suggest that the program needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is wrong, and the actual input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the problem expects that each test case is processed as a separate input.\n\nBut how to reconcile this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented with a note that the input is a list of strings, but the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple strings, and the output shows multiple numbers, perhaps the actual problem is that the input is a list of strings, each on separate lines, or something similar.\n\nBut the problem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nSo perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the actual input is a single string. However, the sample input shows multiple strings. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the input is a list of strings, and the code must process each of them, outputting the corresponding answers.\n\nBut how is the input given? For example, in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, perhaps as a single line with multiple strings separated by spaces. Or perhaps the problem is presented incorrectly.\n\nBut since the user provided the sample input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and the output as ['0', '3', '2'], perhaps the actual input is a list of strings, and the code must read them as multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted and the actual input is a single string. For example, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nand the output is:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is written as a list. However, the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nAssuming that the problem requires processing a single string, but the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output the desired outputs. So perhaps the input is a single string, and the sample input is a mistake. For example, the sample input may be:\n\nInput:\n\nababa\n\nOutput:\n\n3\n\nBut the sample shows that for the input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is that the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So this is unclear.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are given as lists, perhaps the actual input is a list of strings, each on a separate line. For example, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each string, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So this is conflicting. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the actual problem is that the code should process multiple test cases, each being a single string.\n\nBut how to resolve this ambiguity?\n\nWell, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nThis suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the actual input is a list of strings, each on their own line, and the code must process each of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a Python list, but the actual input is a single line containing the string. For example, the first sample input is 'abcd', and the output is '0'.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps the user intended that the code should process multiple test cases, each given as a separate line, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a single string, perhaps the sample input is wrong. However, given that the sample input and output are given as lists, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to proceed? Well, the user provided the following note:\n\nNote that this is a hard question.\n\nBut the user also says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nAssuming that the input is a single string, and the sample input is a mistake, perhaps the code should read a single string from input, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample shows that for 'ababa', the output is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single string, and output the answer. So the sample input may have been a mistake, perhaps the user intended that the input is a single string, and the sample input shows multiple test cases as an example.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nWell, the user provided the sample input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and the output as ['0', '3', '2']. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a list of strings, each on their own line, and output the answers for each.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, if the input is given as multiple lines, each being a string, then the code should process each line.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect.\n\nIn any case, given the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the code is supposed to read a single string from input, and output the answer for that string.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple strings, so perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. However, given that the sample input shows that for the input 'ababa', the output is 3, which is correct, and for 'zzz' the output is 2.\n\nSo for now, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code is supposed to read a single string from input, and output the answer. The sample input may have been a mistake in formatting.\n\nThus, the code will read a single string from input, and compute the answer.\n\nNow, the code for that.\n\nLet me think about the code.\n\nRead the input string from stdin.\n\nImplement the function as discussed.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen process s.\n\nNow, implement the function.\n\nBut for the code to handle the sample input, perhaps the input is given as a list of strings, but that's unclear.\n\nBut given the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string, the code should read a single string.\n\nBut the sample shows that the input is a list of strings. Perhaps the user intended that the code should process multiple test cases, each given as a separate line.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string, and output the answers for each.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are lists, perhaps the actual problem is that the code should read multiple test cases, each on separate lines.\n\nSo, for example, the input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nSo the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So this is conflicting. However, given the sample input and output, I think that the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to confirm?\n\nWell, the user's note says that the sample input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which is a Python list. But that's probably just an example of the input format. However, in reality, the input is given as a single line for each test case.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nThus, the code will read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin using sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), which will give a list of strings, each being a line from input.\n\nBut for example, if the input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThen the code would read those three lines, process each, and output 0, 3, 2.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is confusing.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code will be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        # process s and print the result\n\nBut how to handle empty lines? Well, the problem says that the input strings are non-empty.\n\nBut the code must read each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first line containing the string. So this is conflicting. However, given the sample input and output, I think the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut since the user provided the sample input as a list, but the problem says that the first input line contains the string, perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code should read a single string.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple strings, and the output shows multiple numbers, I think that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, assuming that, the code would read all lines from input, process each one, and output the corresponding answer.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef longest_duplicate(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return str(l)\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return '0'\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        print(longest_duplicate(s))\n\nBut wait, what if the input is a single line? For example, in the first sample input, the input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but the code would read each line as a separate string. However, if the input is given as a single line, like 'abcd', then the code would process it correctly.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, which may be a mistake. But the code is written to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. However, the sample shows multiple test cases, so perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description.\n\nBut regardless, the code that passes the sample input must be written.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nFor input lines:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThe code would process:\n\nFor 'abcd', the longest is 0.\n\nFor 'ababa', the longest is 3.\n\nFor 'zzz', the longest is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, this code would handle the sample input correctly.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is of length 1? For example, input 'a' — output is 0, since no substring can appear twice.\n\nAnother test case: input 'aa' — the longest is 1. Because the substring 'a' appears twice.\n\nThe code would check for l=1 (since len(s)-1 is 1). For l=1, the substrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). When i=1, substr is 'a' which is in the set (added at i=0). So returns 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 'aaa' — l=2. The substrings are 'aa' (i=0), 'aa' (i=1). So returns 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'abab' — l=2. substrings are 'ab', 'ba', 'ab'. So returns 2.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears more than once but not consecutively?\n\nFor example, 'abcab', l=2. The substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'ca', 'ab'. The code returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, reading input from stdin, and outputting the correct answers.\n\nThus, the final code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        max_len = 0\n        for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - l + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+l]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(l)\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            else:\n                continue\n            break\n        else:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but this code uses nested loops. Let me explain:\n\nFor each line in the input:\n\n   s = line.strip()\n\n   n = len(s)\n\n   max_len = 0\n\n   for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n       seen = set()\n\n       for i in ...:\n\n           substr = ...\n\n           if substr in seen:\n\n               print(l)\n\n               break\n\n           seen.add(...)\n\n       else:\n\n           continue\n\n       break\n\n   else:\n\n       print(0)\n\nSo, for each l, we check all substrings. If any of them is found in the set, we print l and break out of the loop. Otherwise, after checking all l's, print 0.\n\nThis code uses the for-else construct. The inner loop (for i in ...) has an else clause that is executed only if the loop completes normally (without break). So, if during the inner loop, a duplicate is found, we break and print l. Otherwise, after checking all substrings of length l, we continue to the next l. If no l is found, the outer loop's else clause is executed, printing 0.\n\nYes, this code should work.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nFor 'abcd', the code checks l=3, then 2, then 1. For each, no duplicates. So prints 0.\n\nFor 'ababa', l=4: substrings are 'abab' (i=0), 'baba' (i=1). No duplicates. Then l=3: for i=0, substr 'aba' added. i=1: 'bab' added. i=2: substr 'aba' is in seen, so print 3 and break.\n\nFor 'zzz', l=2: substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). So print 2.\n\nThus, the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, what about the case where there are multiple possible l's? For example, the string 'aaaaa' would have l=4, then 3, etc. For l=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So the code would return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaa' — the longest substring that appears twice is 'aa' (length 2), but also 'aabbaa' has 'aa' at the start and end. But also, there's a substring of length 3 'aab' (no), 'abb' (no), 'bba' (no), 'baa' (no). But for l=3, no duplicates. For l=2: 'aa' appears at 0-1, 4-5. So returns 2.\n\nBut for l=4, the substrings are 'aabb' (i=0), 'abba' (i=1), 'bbaa' (i=2). No duplicates. So code returns 2.\n\nBut what about the substring 'aa' of length 2. So the code would return 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which is an important consideration for the solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Brute Force with Optimization**: We iterate over possible substring lengths starting from the maximum possible length down to 1. For each length, we check all possible substrings of that length to see if they appear more than once.\n2. **Early Termination**: As soon as we find a valid substring of a certain length that appears at least twice, we immediately return that length, ensuring we get the maximum possible length efficiently.\n3. **Set for Tracking Substrings**: For each length, we use a set to track substrings encountered. If a substring is seen again, we know it appears at least twice and can terminate early.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        found = False\n        for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - l + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+l]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(l)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        else:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads each line from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n2. **Iterating Over Lengths**: For each string, we check possible substring lengths starting from the maximum possible (length of string minus one) down to 1.\n3. **Checking Substrings**: For each length, we use a set to track substrings. If a substring is encountered again, we print the length and terminate early.\n4. **Handling No Matches**: If no valid substring is found for any length, we print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring by leveraging early termination and a set for quick lookups, making the solution both effective and efficient for the given constraints.",
