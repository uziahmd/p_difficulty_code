Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a game with a number A of 2n digits. They take turns picking the leftmost digit, appending it to their own number. Each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 + S2. And I have to output the sequence of moves (H or M) that achieves this maximum. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. So the problem is about choosing which player takes the next digit in order to maximize the total sum. But since both players are making exactly n moves, the order in which they take the digits will determine their numbers.\n\nThe challenge here is to find the optimal sequence of choices. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. The brute force approach would be trying all possible combinations, but that's impossible because for 36 steps, there are C(36, 18) possibilities, which is way too big. So we need a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet me think about the state. Let's consider that at any step, the number of digits left is 2n - k, where k is the number of digits already taken. Wait, but each move takes one digit. So the state can be represented by how many digits each player has taken so far. For example, suppose Homer has taken h digits and Marge has taken m digits. Since each makes exactly n moves, the total steps taken so far is h + m, and the remaining steps are (n - h) + (n - m) = 2n - (h + m). But since the players alternate turns, but the choice of who takes the next step depends on the current state. Wait, no. Wait, the players decide before each turn who will make the next move. So the order of the moves is determined by the sequence of H and M. However, the problem says that each player must make exactly n moves. So the sequence must have exactly n H's and n M's.\n\nSo the problem is to choose a sequence of H and M with exactly n of each, such that when you take the digits in order, the sum of the two numbers formed is maximized.\n\nBut how to model this? Because each choice affects the digits that are available for future steps, and the value of the numbers depends on the order in which digits are added.\n\nWait, the numbers S1 and S2 are built by taking digits from the front of A. For example, if the first move is H, then the first digit of A is added to S1, and the rest of the digits are the original A without that first digit. Then, the next move could be H or M again, and so on.\n\nThe key is that the order in which the digits are taken affects the numbers S1 and S2. Each time a digit is taken, it's added to the end of the respective player's number. So the value of S1 is the digits taken by Homer in the order they were taken. For example, if Homer takes digits in order 1, then 3, then 5, his number is 135. Similarly for Marge.\n\nBut since the digits are taken from the front of A, the sequence of digits taken is determined by the order of the moves. For example, if the initial A is 1234, and the first move is H, then the first digit (1) is taken by Homer. Then, the next A is 234. Then, if the next move is H again, Homer takes 2, and so on.\n\nSo the problem is to choose the order of H and M (with exactly n each) to maximize the sum of the numbers formed by their digits.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a certain number of digits left, and a certain number of H and M moves that have already been made. For example, the state can be (h, m), where h is the number of H moves made so far, and m is the number of M moves made so far. Since the total steps taken is h + m, and the remaining steps are (2n - h - m). At each step, we can choose to take H or M, provided that we don't exceed n moves for either.\n\nBut the problem is that the digits taken so far affect the current state of A. However, since the digits are taken from the front, the current state of A can be represented by how many digits have been taken. For example, if we have taken k digits so far, the current A is the original A with the first k digits removed. So, for a given state (h, m), the number of digits taken is k = h + m. Therefore, the current A is the original A starting from index k. So, the state can be represented as (h, m), and the current position in the original A is determined by h + m.\n\nSo, the DP state can be (h, m), representing that Homer has made h moves and Marge has made m moves. The value of the DP would be the maximum total sum achievable from this state onward.\n\nThe transitions would be: from state (h, m), the next move can be H (if h < n) or M (if m < n). For each possible choice, we take the next digit (which is A[k], where k = h + m), and add it to the respective player's number, and then proceed recursively.\n\nBut the problem is that the value of the numbers S1 and S2 depends on the digits collected. However, since each digit is added to the end of the player's number, the value of the number is the sum of digit * 10^position, where position depends on when the digit was added. For example, the first digit added to S1 contributes digit * 10^{n-1}, since there are n digits in total. The second digit contributes digit * 10^{n-2}, etc. Wait, no. Because the number is built by appending digits. For example, if Homer takes digits in the order d1, d2, ..., dn, then his number is d1 followed by d2, etc. So the value is d1 * 10^{n-1} + d2 * 10^{n-2} + ... + dn * 10^0.\n\nBut when considering the DP, how can we track the contribution of each digit? Because each choice of H or M adds a digit to the respective player's number, and the contribution of that digit depends on the position in their sequence. For example, if Homer has already made h moves, then the next digit he takes will be the (h+1)-th digit in his number, which contributes digit * 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nSo for each state (h, m), when we take a digit, if it's for Homer, then the contribution to the total sum is digit * 10^{n - h - 1} (since after taking this digit, Homer has h+1 digits, so the position is h+1-th, and the exponent is n - (h+1) = n - h - 1). Similarly for Marge.\n\nTherefore, the DP can be designed to calculate the maximum possible total sum from the current state (h, m) onwards. The recurrence would be:\n\ndp[h][m] = max(\n    (current digit added to Homer's number) + dp[h+1][m], \n    (current digit added to Marge's number) + dp[h][m+1]\n)\n\nBut since n can be up to 18, the state space is (n+1) x (n+1) = 19x19 = 361 states. That's manageable. However, for each state, we need to compute the value of the current digit added to either H or M, depending on the choice.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the current digit? For the state (h, m), the number of digits taken so far is k = h + m. So the current digit is the (k)th digit of the original A (assuming zero-based or one-based? Well, the original input is given as a string. Let's say the original A is stored as a string, and for the state (h, m), the current digit is A[k], where k = h + m. For example, when h=0, m=0, k=0, so the first digit of A is taken.\n\nBut since the digits are taken from the front, each step removes the first digit. So the current digit is the (h + m)th character in the original string.\n\nSo, the DP can be memoized with the state (h, m), and for each state, we compute the maximum total sum from that state onwards.\n\nNow, the base case is when h + m = 2n, which is when all digits are taken. Then, the value is 0.\n\nFor each state (h, m), the current digit is A[k], where k = h + m. Then, if we choose to take H next (if h < n), then the contribution is (digit * 10^{n - h - 1}) plus the result of the DP for state (h+1, m). Similarly for M.\n\nSo the DP needs to track the maximum sum possible from the current state.\n\nBut how do we compute 10^{n - h - 1}? Well, since n is up to 18, the exponents can be precomputed. For example, for each possible position, we can precompute the power of 10 needed.\n\nBut wait, for each digit added to Homer's number, the position in his number is (h + 1)th. Since he has to take exactly n digits, the value of that digit is digit * 10^{n - (h + 1)}.\n\nSimilarly for Marge's digits.\n\nSo, for each possible h and m, when we take a digit for Homer, the multiplier is 10^{n - h - 1}, and for Marge, it's 10^{n - m - 1}.\n\nSo, the DP can be implemented with memoization, and for each state, we compute the best choice between H and M.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, we can reconstruct the path by checking which choice (H or M) gives the maximum value at each step.\n\nBut since n is up to 18, and the state is (h, m), which is 19x19, the DP is feasible.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this DP approach.\n\nLet's think about the steps needed:\n\nFirst, read n and the string A. Then, precompute the powers of 10 up to 18, since for n=18, the maximum exponent is 18-0-1=17 (for the first digit added to a player's number).\n\nBut wait, for a player's first digit, h is 0, so the exponent is n - 0 - 1 = n-1. For example, when n is 2, the first digit of Homer's number contributes digit * 10^(1) (since 2-0-1=1). Then the next digit contributes 10^0.\n\nSo for each possible h and m, we can compute the multiplier for H and M.\n\nBut how to precompute these multipliers? Well, during the DP, for each state (h, m), when considering adding a digit to H, we can compute the multiplier as 10^(n - h - 1), and similarly for M.\n\nBut calculating 10^something can be done on the fly. However, for large exponents, it's better to precompute them once.\n\nBut for Python, even with exponents up to 18, calculating 10**exponent is trivial.\n\nNow, the DP can be memoized using memoization (like lru_cache), but since n can be up to 18, and the state is (h, m), which is small, recursion with memoization is feasible. Alternatively, we can use memoization with a table.\n\nBut for Python, recursion with memoization may hit stack limits for some cases, but with n=18, the maximum recursion depth would be 36 steps (since each step increases h or m by 1), which is manageable.\n\nBut let's think about implementing this with memoization.\n\nBut the problem is that for each state (h, m), we need to know the current digit. Which is A[h + m].\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\nRead n and A as a string.\n\nprecompute the powers of 10? Or compute them as needed.\n\nImplement a memoization function, say, dp(h, m), which returns the maximum total sum possible from this state.\n\nThen, for each state, check if h + m == 2n: return 0.\n\nElse, current digit is A[h + m].\n\nIf we choose H (if h < n):\n\nvalue_h = digit * 10 ** (n - h - 1) + dp(h + 1, m)\n\nSimilarly for M (if m < n):\n\nvalue_m = digit * 10 ** (n - m - 1) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\nThen, the maximum between value_h and value_m (depending on which is allowed).\n\nBut how do we handle the choice between H and M when both are allowed?\n\nFor example, when h < n and m < n, then both options are possible, and we choose the one with higher value.\n\nBut in the case where only one option is possible (e.g., h == n, so only M can be chosen), then that's the only option.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, then we need to reconstruct the path.\n\nBut how to reconstruct the path? For that, during the DP, we can also track the choice made (H or M) at each step. Alternatively, after computing the DP table, we can simulate the process again, choosing at each step which option (H or M) gives the maximum value.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement the DP with memoization, and then reconstruct the path by choosing, for each step, whether to take H or M based on which gives the higher value.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, for memoization, we can use lru_cache with a function. However, since the input A is a string, and the function parameters are h and m, we need to make sure that the function is able to access A. But since the function is inside the code, perhaps we can pass A as a global variable, or have it as a parameter. However, for memoization, the function parameters must be hashable and not include mutable structures like strings. Wait, but in the DP function, the parameters are h and m, and the current digit is determined by the position h + m in the string A. So, the DP function can refer to the global A string.\n\nBut for memoization, the parameters h and m are sufficient.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as:\n\nRead n and A.\n\nCompute the length of A as 2n.\n\nImplement a memoized recursive function dp(h, m) that returns the maximum total sum from state (h, m).\n\nOnce the dp is computed, then we need to reconstruct the path.\n\nReconstruction can be done as follows:\n\nStart with h = 0, m = 0.\n\nAt each step, check if h + m is equal to 2n. If not, check which choice (H or M) is better.\n\nBut how to compare which choice gives the higher value. For that, we can compute the value of choosing H and the value of choosing M, and pick the one with higher value. However, during the reconstruction, we need to compute these values again. But since the DP function already computes these, perhaps we can use the same function.\n\nBut during the reconstruction, we can call the dp function again. However, since the dp function is memoized, this is efficient.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, we can also store for each state (h, m) which choice (H or M) was taken to reach the maximum. But that would require storing an additional table for the choices.\n\nBut perhaps during reconstruction, we can recompute the best choice each time.\n\nLet me think.\n\nFor example, during reconstruction:\n\ncurrent_h = 0\n\ncurrent_m = 0\n\nresult = ''\n\nwhile current_h + current_m < 2n:\n\n    k = current_h + current_m\n\n    digit = A[k]\n\n    if current_h < n and current_m < n:\n\n        # both options possible\n\n        val_h = digit * 10 ** (n - current_h - 1) + dp(current_h + 1, current_m)\n\n        val_m = digit * 10 ** (n - current_m - 1) + dp(current_h, current_m + 1)\n\n        if val_h > val_m:\n\n            result += 'H'\n\n            current_h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            result += 'M'\n\n            current_m += 1\n\n    elif current_h < n:\n\n        # must choose H\n\n        result += 'H'\n\n        current_h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # must choose M\n\n        result += 'M'\n\n        current_m += 1\n\nBut this requires recomputing the dp values during reconstruction. However, since the dp function is memoized, this is not a problem. However, in practice, the dp function is already computed once, so during reconstruction, we can just call the same function again, which would be O(1) per call.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, using lru_cache with a recursive function would work.\n\nBut there's a problem here: the dp function returns the maximum total sum from the current state. However, during the reconstruction, when we choose H, the value is digit * ... + dp(...). But during the reconstruction, the code is comparing the value of choosing H vs M. However, during the initial DP computation, the function already calculated the maximum between these options. So during the reconstruction, the code is effectively re-computing the same values. However, since the dp function is memoized, this is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps during the initial DP computation, we can also track the choice made. But that would require more memory, but for 19x19 states, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed with the first approach.\n\nNow, the problem is that the DP function needs to be memoized. However, in Python, for a recursive function with parameters h and m, we can use lru_cache.\n\nBut the problem is that the A string is part of the input, and the dp function uses it. However, since the dp function is inside the code, and the A is fixed during the execution of the program, this is okay.\n\nBut in Python, when using memoization, the function must be written in a way that the parameters are hashable. So, for example, the function dp(h, m) is called with integers h and m.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nThen, the code defines a function dp(h, m) which uses the global A.\n\nBut for memoization, the function needs to be decorated with @lru_cache(maxsize=None). However, since the function uses the global A, which is fixed during the processing of the input, this is acceptable.\n\nBut what if the same code is called multiple times? Well, in this problem, it's called once per test case.\n\nBut for the purposes of the code, the code reads the input once, and processes it once.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nSample Output: HHMM\n\nLet's see. For n=2, the digits are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nThe optimal sequence is HHMM.\n\nHomer takes 1, then 2, then Marge takes 3, then 4. So S1 is 12, S2 is 34. Sum is 46.\n\nAnother option is HMHM. Let's see:\n\nH takes 1, M takes 2, H takes 3, M takes 4. S1 is 13, S2 is 24. Sum is 37. Which is worse.\n\nAnother option is HMMH: H takes 1, M takes 2, M takes 3, H takes 4. S1 is 14, S2 is 23. Sum 37.\n\nSo the first option is better.\n\nSo the code should return HHMM.\n\nNow, the DP approach for this case:\n\nAt state (0,0), current digit is 1. Choosing H gives 1 * 10^(2-0-1) = 1*10^1 = 10. Then, the next state is (1,0). The digit is 2. Again, choosing H gives 2*10^(2-1-1) = 2*10^0 = 2. Next state (2,0). Now, since Homer has taken 2 moves (n=2), the next moves must be M. So the next digit is 3. M takes it, contributing 3*10^(2-0-1) = 3*10^1 = 30. Then next state (2,1). The digit is 4. M takes it, contributing 4*10^(2-1-1) = 4*10^0 =4. Total sum is 10+2+30+4 = 46.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to capture that.\n\nNow, the code needs to compute the maximum sum and the path.\n\nBut for the DP function, the code must return the maximum sum possible from the current state.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing the DP function with memoization.\n\nBut for the exponents, 10 ** (n - h - 1) can be calculated as pow(10, n - h - 1). However, since n can be up to 18, and h can be up to n, the exponents can be up to 18-0-1=17, which is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, exponents are calculated quickly.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in Python, for the @lru_cache decorator, the function must have parameters that are hashable. So, the function dp is defined with parameters h and m, which are integers.\n\nBut in the code, the function will be:\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    if h + m == 2 * n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    current_digit = int(A[h + m])\n\n    # compute the value for choosing H and M\n\n    if h < n and m < n:\n\n        # both options possible\n\n        val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n\n        val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\n        return max(val_h, val_m)\n\n    elif h < n:\n\n        # must choose H\n\n        return current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n\n    else:\n\n        # must choose M\n\n        return current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\nWait, but in the case where h < n and m < n, but one of the options gives a higher value than the other. However, the code returns the max of the two.\n\nBut this is correct. However, during the reconstruction phase, we need to know which choice was taken. So, the code for the reconstruction would need to check which option gives the maximum value.\n\nBut during the reconstruction, we can re-calculate the value for each possible choice.\n\nBut in the sample input, for the first step, the code would choose H, because val_h is 10 + ... which is higher than choosing M (which would be 1 * 10^ (n - m -1) = 1 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 10, but then the rest of the steps would be different. So the code would choose between the two options.\n\nBut the code as written would compute the correct maximum.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, then the path can be reconstructed.\n\nBut for the code to work, the DP function must be called once, then the path is reconstructed.\n\nNow, the problem is that for n=18, the exponents can be 10^17, which is a very big number. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not a problem.\n\nBut for memoization, the function dp is called with h and m, which are up to 18 each. So the number of states is 19 * 19 = 361. So the code will run quickly.\n\nNow, the code for the reconstruction.\n\nOnce the DP is computed, we need to generate the path.\n\nWe can start with h = 0, m = 0. At each step, we check if we can choose H or M, and choose the one that gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to compare the two options? For example, in the code, during the reconstruction, for each state (h, m), we can compute the value of choosing H and the value of choosing M, and pick the one with higher value. However, since the DP function already returns the maximum value for that state, this approach is valid.\n\nBut during the reconstruction, the code can be written as follows:\n\ndef get_path():\n\n    h = 0\n\n    m = 0\n\n    path = []\n\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n\n        current_pos = h + m\n\n        current_digit = int(A[current_pos])\n\n        if h < n and m < n:\n\n            # check which option gives higher value\n\n            val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n\n            val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\n            if val_h > val_m:\n\n                path.append('H')\n\n                h += 1\n\n            else:\n\n                path.append('M')\n\n                m += 1\n\n        elif h < n:\n\n            path.append('H')\n\n            h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            path.append('M')\n\n            m += 1\n\n    return ''.join(path)\n\nBut this code calls the dp function again for each state during reconstruction. However, since the dp function is memoized, this is acceptable and efficient.\n\nBut in Python, the function dp is memoized, so each call to dp(h, m) during reconstruction is O(1).\n\nBut during the initial DP calculation, the function is already computed. So this approach is acceptable.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the function dp is decorated with lru_cache. However, the code must be written in a way that the function is defined inside the code. Also, the code must read the input and output the correct answer.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead n and A.\n\nCompute the DP function.\n\nGenerate the path.\n\nPrint the path.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n\n    def dp(h, m):\n\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n\n            return 0\n\n        current_pos = h + m\n\n        current_digit = int(A[current_pos])\n\n        if h < n and m < n:\n\n            val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n\n            val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\n            return max(val_h, val_m)\n\n        elif h < n:\n\n            return current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n\n        else:\n\n            return current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\n    # Now reconstruct the path\n\n    h = 0\n\n    m = 0\n\n    path = []\n\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n\n        current_pos = h + m\n\n        current_digit = int(A[current_pos])\n\n        if h < n and m < n:\n\n            val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n\n            val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n\n            if val_h > val_m:\n\n                path.append('H')\n\n                h += 1\n\n            else:\n\n                path.append('M')\n\n                m += 1\n\n        elif h < n:\n\n            path.append('H')\n\n            h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            path.append('M')\n\n            m += 1\n\n    print(''.join(path))\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the function dp is defined inside the main function, and the variables n and A are accessible from the outer scope. But in Python, that's allowed.\n\nBut what about the case where there are multiple choices leading to the same maximum value? For example, if val_h equals val_m, the code chooses 'M' (since the code uses 'else' clause). However, the problem statement says that any correct solution is acceptable. So in such cases, the code can choose either option, and the output is acceptable.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nThe code would generate the path as follows:\n\nInitially h=0, m=0.\n\ncurrent_pos is 0, current_digit is 1.\n\nval_h = 1 * 10^(2-0-1) + dp(1,0). 10^1 is 10. dp(1,0) is ?\n\nLet's think recursively. But perhaps the code will correctly compute the maximum.\n\nBut in the sample, the code returns 'HHMM'.\n\nBut during the reconstruction phase, the code will choose H first, then H again, then M, then M.\n\nAnother sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n9911\n\nOutput: HMHM\n\nLet's see. The digits are 9,9,1,1.\n\nThe optimal sequence is HMHM.\n\nH takes 9, M takes 9, H takes 1, M takes 1. So S1 is 91, S2 is 91. Sum is 182.\n\nAlternative sequences:\n\nIf the sequence is HHHM, but no, since n=2, each must take exactly 2 steps. So the sequence must have 2 H and 2 M.\n\nAnother option is HMMH: H takes 9, M takes 9, M takes 1, H takes 1. S1 is 91, S2 is 91. Same sum. But the code may choose HMHM or HMMH. But the sample output is HMHM.\n\nBut the code would choose between the two options based on which one is computed first. However, since the code compares val_h and val_m, and in case of equality, it chooses M.\n\nBut during the first step, when h=0, m=0, current digit is 9. val_h is 9 * 10^(2-0-1) = 9 * 10^1 = 90, plus dp(1,0). val_m is 9 * 10^(2-0-1) = 90 plus dp(0,1). So which is better?\n\nLet's think about what dp(1,0) and dp(0,1) return.\n\nFor dp(1,0):\n\ncurrent_pos is 1 (h=1, m=0; h + m = 1). The digit is 9.\n\nh=1 < 2, m=0 < 2.\n\nval_h is 9 * 10^(2-1-1) = 9 * 10^0 =9 + dp(2, 0). dp(2,0) is when h=2, m=0. Now, h + m = 2. The next steps are m=0, so need to take m steps. The remaining digits are positions 2 and 3 (digits 1 and 1). So for dp(2,0):\n\ncurrent_pos is 2 (h=2, m=0). current digit is 1. Since h is already 2 (n=2), must choose M. So val is 1 * 10^(2 - 0 - 1) = 1 * 10^1 = 10, plus dp(2,1). dp(2,1): current_pos is 3, digit is 1. m is 1 < 2. So choose M again. val is 1 * 10^(2-1-1) = 1 * 1 = 1. So total for dp(2,0) is 10 + 1 = 11. So dp(1,0) is 9 + 11 = 20.\n\nFor dp(0,1): current_pos is 0 + 1 =1, digit is 9. h=0, m=1. Now, both can choose H or M. Let's see:\n\nval_h: 9 * 10^(2-0-1) = 90 + dp(1,1). dp(1,1) has h + m = 2. current_pos is 2, digit is 1. Now, h=1 < 2 and m=1 < 2. So can choose H or M.\n\nval_h for dp(1,1): 1 * 10^(2-1-1) = 1*1 =1 + dp(2,1). dp(2,1) is same as before, which is 1. So total is 1 + 1 = 2. val_m for dp(1,1) is 1 * 10^(2-1-1) =1 + dp(1,2). dp(1,2) is when h=1, m=2. current_pos is 3, digit is 1. Must choose H (since m is already 2). So val is 1 * 10^(2-1-1) =1 + dp(2,2) (which is 0). So total is 1. So dp(1,1) returns max(2, 1) = 2. So back to dp(0,1): val_h is 90 + 2 = 92. val_m is 9 * 10^(2-1-1) =9*1=9 + dp(0,2). dp(0,2) has current_pos 2, digit 1. Must choose H. So 1 * 10^(2-0-1) =10 + dp(1,2). dp(1,2) is 1*1 + 0 =1. So total for dp(0,2) is 10 +1 = 11. So val_m is 9 + 11 =20. So dp(0,1) returns max(92, 20) =92.\n\nThus, back to the initial choice between val_h (90 + 20 = 110?) Wait, no. Wait, for the initial state (0,0), val_h is 90 + dp(1,0) = 90 + 20 = 110. val_m is 90 + dp(0,1) = 90 + 92 = 182. So the code would choose val_m (182) which is larger. So the first step is M? But the sample output is HMHM. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, that suggests that the code would choose M first, which contradicts the sample output. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, this indicates that there's a mistake in my analysis. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the sample input for the second case is:\n\nn=2, A=9911.\n\nThe output is HMHM. Which gives sum 91 + 91 = 182.\n\nBut according to the previous calculation, the code would choose M first, leading to a higher value. So why is the sample output HMHM?\n\nAh, there's a mistake in my analysis. Let's re-examine the scenario.\n\nWhen the code is at state (0,0), and current digit is 9.\n\nval_h is 9 * 10^(2-0-1) = 9 * 10^1 = 90, plus dp(1, 0).\n\nval_m is 9 * 10^(2-0-1) = 90, plus dp(0, 1).\n\nSo the code compares 90 + dp(1,0) and 90 + dp(0,1). So the choice depends on which of dp(1,0) and dp(0,1) is larger.\n\nEarlier calculation said that dp(1,0) is 20, and dp(0,1) is 92. Thus, val_m would be 90 +92= 182, which is larger than val_h (90 +20=110). So the code would choose M first. But the sample output starts with H. So there's a contradiction here. That indicates that there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, this suggests that my code would produce a different result than the sample. So what is wrong?\n\nLet me re",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a given number alternately, with each player making exactly `n` moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of the numbers formed by the digits each player collects.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach to explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently. The state of our DP function will be defined by the number of moves each player has made so far.\n2. **State Representation**: The state is represented by two integers `h` and `m`, indicating the number of moves Homer and Marge have made respectively. This allows us to track the current position in the original number `A`.\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each state, we consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and compute the maximum total prize value achievable from that state onwards.\n4. **Reconstruction of Path**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves by comparing the values obtained from each possible move at each step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[current_pos])\n        if h < n and m < n:\n            val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n            val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n            return max(val_h, val_m)\n        elif h < n:\n            return current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n        else:\n            return current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n    \n    h = 0\n    m = 0\n    path = []\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        current_pos = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[current_pos])\n        if h < n and m < n:\n            val_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp(h + 1, m)\n            val_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp(h, m + 1)\n            if val_h > val_m:\n                path.append('H')\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                path.append('M')\n                m += 1\n        elif h < n:\n            path.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            path.append('M')\n            m += 1\n    print(''.join(path))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of length `2n`.\n2. **DP Function**: The `dp` function uses memoization to store results of subproblems. It calculates the maximum total prize value starting from the state `(h, m)` where `h` and `m` are the number of moves made by Homer and Marge respectively.\n3. **Transitions**: For each state, the function evaluates both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and returns the maximum value achievable.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the optimal sequence by checking which move (H or M) gives the higher value at each step, ensuring we follow the optimal path.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible move sequences using dynamic programming, leveraging memoization to avoid redundant calculations and reconstructing the optimal path once the DP table is built.",
