Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors have to be compatible. The colors can be specific letters or question marks (which are wildcards). \n\nSo, first, I need to think about how to pair them optimally. Let's think about the approach.\n\nLet me think about the steps. The main idea is to match as many pairs as possible. The challenge is to decide which pairs to make, especially considering the question marks that can act as any color.\n\nFirst, maybe we can handle the cases where both left and right have specific colors. For example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a', they can be paired. But if there are multiple such pairs, we need to pair them optimally. Also, we need to account for the question marks, which can be matched with any other.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of it as a bipartite graph matching problem. But with n up to 150,000, that's going to be too slow for standard algorithms like Hungarian. So we need a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think of a way to maximize the pairs. Here's an idea:\n\nFirst, process all the pairs where both are specific colors. For each color, count how many left and right boots have that color. Then, the maximum possible pairs for these would be the minimum of left and right counts for each color. However, since we can't pair them unless they are same color, but the question marks can be used to fill in gaps.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used to pair with any. So perhaps the optimal approach is:\n\n1. First, pair the specific colors. For each color c (not '?'), pair left[c] with right[c], taking as many as possible. But how to track which ones are used?\n\nBut maybe we can first pair all same-colored boots. For example, for each color c, the number of left boots with color c is L[c], and the number of right boots with color c is R[c]. The number of pairs here is min(L[c], R[c]). However, once we pair them, those boots are used and cannot be used again.\n\nBut then, after that, the remaining left and right boots (including those with '?') can be paired using the question marks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should handle the question marks in a way that uses them optimally. For example, if a left boot is a '?', it can be paired with any right boot that hasn't been paired yet. Similarly, if a right boot is a '?', it can be paired with any left boot that hasn't been paired yet.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each '?' can be matched with any other. So, perhaps we can first pair the specific colors, then use the remaining '?'s to pair with the remaining boots.\n\nBut here's the problem: suppose there are some left boots with specific colors and some right boots with specific colors, but they are not matching. For example, a left 'a' and a right 'b'. These can't be paired. But if there's a '?' in either side, they can be used to pair.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nStep 1: Pair as many same-color specific boots as possible. For example, for each color c (not '?'), pair left and right boots with c. Let's collect all these pairs.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already used? Because once a left boot is used in a pair, it can't be used again. Similarly for right.\n\nSo, perhaps we can create two arrays: left_used and right_used, which mark whether a boot is already paired. Then, for each color c (excluding '?'), we can iterate through the left boots with color c and the right boots with color c, and pair them as long as they are not used.\n\nBut with n up to 1.5e5, we need an efficient way. For example, for each color c, collect the indices of left boots with color c, and same for right. Then, for each color c, the number of possible pairs is the min of the size of left list and right list. Then, pair them in some order (like first left with first right, etc.), and mark them as used.\n\nOnce that is done, we have the remaining boots (those not used yet) which may include some specific colors and some '?'.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair the remaining boots. Since '?' can be matched with any, but we need to pair them optimally. How to do that?\n\nThe remaining left boots and right boots can be grouped into:\n\n- Left boots with specific colors (not used yet)\n- Right boots with specific colors (not used yet)\n- Left boots with '?'\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots, considering that each boot can have a specific color or an indefinite color represented by a question mark ('?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that each pair consists of one left and one right boot with compatible colors.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: First, we pair boots with specific colors (non '?') where both the left and right boots have the same color. This ensures that we use up as many specific color matches as possible.\n2. **Handle Indefinite Colors**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots that have indefinite colors ('?'). These can be paired with any remaining boots, either specific or indefinite.\n3. **Track Used Boots**: We maintain arrays to track which boots have been used in pairs to ensure no boot is used more than once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # For the first test case, but the input seems to be multiple test cases?\n    # Wait, looking back at the example input, it's unclear how many test cases there are.\n    # However, the original problem statement says that the input is for a single test case.\n    # The given example seems to have multiple test cases, but perhaps the user made a mistake.\n    # Based on the problem statement, the input is for a single test case.\n    # So, assuming that the input is as per the problem statement.\n\n    # Let me recheck the problem statement:\n    # Input: first line contains n, then l, then r.\n\n    # So, the code should read n, l, r.\n\n    # But the sample input shows something else.
