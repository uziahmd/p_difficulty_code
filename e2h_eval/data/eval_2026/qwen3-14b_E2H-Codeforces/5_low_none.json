Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) are compatible if they are the same. A question mark (?) can pair with any color, including another question mark.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Let's see. The main challenge is to maximize the number of pairs, considering that each boot can be used only once. Also, the question marks add flexibility here.\n\nLet me think of possible steps:\n\n1. Pair up the specific colors first. For example, if there's a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with color 'a', we can pair them. But since there might be multiple such pairs, we need to find all possible matches.\n\nBut how do we handle the question marks? They can act as wildcards. However, using a question mark for a specific color might be better than using it for another, depending on the situation.\n\nHmm. Maybe the strategy is:\n\n- First, match specific colors where both are not '?'. For example, for each color c, count how many left boots have c and how many right boots have c. The number of pairs for each color c is the minimum of these two counts. But since each boot can be used once, we need to track which ones are used.\n\nWait, but that's not directly applicable because the positions matter. Because once you use a left boot for a certain color, it can't be reused. So maybe we need to process the pairs in a way that uses up the specific colors first, then use the question marks.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can:\n\n- For each color c (excluding '?'), match left and right boots of color c. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those with '?'), match them with each other or with the remaining specific colors.\n\nBut how to efficiently track which boots are used?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as a bipartite graph matching problem, where each left boot is connected to right boots that are compatible. Then, find the maximum matching. However, given n can be up to 150,000, standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms (like Hopcroft-Karp) would be too slow. So we need a greedy approach.\n\nSo, we need a greedy method that can efficiently compute the maximum pairs.\n\nLet me think again. Let's break down the problem into parts.\n\nFirst, process the pairs where both are specific colors. For example, for each color c (a-z), we can pair left[c] with right[c]. The number of such pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But how to track individual indices?\n\nWait, but the actual indices are important because once a boot is used, it can't be used again. So perhaps we need to collect all the positions where the left boot is color c and the right boot is color c, and pair them up. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nAn alternative idea is:\n\n- Create two dictionaries: for left boots, group by their color (including ?), and same for right boots.\n\nFor example, left_counts is a dictionary where keys are colors, and values are lists of indices of left boots with that color. Similarly for right_counts.\n\nThen, for each color c (excluding ?), we can take the min of the number of left and right boots of color c, and pair them. But how to pair them? For example, take the first m left boots of color c and pair them with the first m right boots of color c.\n\nOnce those are paired, we can remove those from the left and right counts. Then, handle the question marks.\n\nBut then, after that, we have some left boots with ?, some right boots with ?. Also, there may be some leftover specific colors. For example, suppose after pairing specific colors, there are left boots with color 'a' that couldn't be matched because there were no right 'a's left. These could be matched with right boots that are '?'.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Pair all possible specific color matches (non-?) between left and right. For each color c, pair as many as possible.\n\n2. Then, pair the remaining left '?' with remaining right '?'. Also, pair remaining left '?' with remaining specific right colors, and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used to match with either side. So, perhaps after pairing the specific colors, we can:\n\n- For the remaining left and right boots, collect the left '?' and right '?'.\n\nBut also, there might be left boots with specific colors that couldn't be matched (because the right had no matching color), and similarly for the right.\n\nSo, for example, after step 1, we have:\n\nleft_remaining: some left boots (possibly with",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors, where a question mark ('?') can match any color. The solution involves efficiently pairing specific colors first and then using question marks to fill in remaining matches.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Boots by Color**: First, group the indices of left and right boots by their respective colors. This helps in efficiently accessing and matching boots with specific colors.\n2. **Match Specific Colors**: For each color (excluding '?'), match as many left boots with the same color as right boots. This ensures that specific color pairs are used optimally.\n3. **Handle Question Marks**: After handling specific color pairs, use the remaining question marks from both left and right boots to form pairs. Question marks can be matched with each other or with remaining specific colors from the opposite side.\n4. **Track Used Boots**: Maintain sets to track which boots have already been used to ensure each boot is only used once in a pair.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    left_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    used_left = set()\n    used_right = set()\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors (non-?)\n    for c in left_color_map:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        if c in right_color_map:\n            left_list = left_color_map[c]\n            right_list = right_color_map[c]\n            min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(min_len):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                if left_idx not in used_left and right_idx not in used_right:\n                    pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                    used_left.add(left_idx)\n                    used_right.add(right_idx)\n\n    # Step 2: Handle remaining ? in left and right\n    # Collect remaining left ? and right ?\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and i not in used_left:\n            left_q.append(i)\n        if r[i] == '?' and i not in used_right:\n            right_q.append(i)\n\n    # Pair left ? with right ?\n    min_len = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        pairs.append((left_q[i] + 1, right_q[i] + 1))\n        used_left.add(left_q[i])\n        used_right.add(right_q[i])\n\n    # Step 3: Pair remaining left ? with non-? right boots\n    # Collect remaining right non-? boots\n    for c in right_color_map:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        right_list = right_color_map[c]\n        for idx_r in right_list:\n            if idx_r in used_right:\n                continue\n            # Find a left ? not used\n            for idx_l in left_color_map['?']:\n                if idx_l in used_left:\n                    continue\n                pairs.append((idx_l + 1, idx_r + 1))\n                used_left.add(idx_l)\n                used_right.add(idx_r)\n                break\n\n    # Step 4: Pair remaining right ? with non-? left boots\n    for c in left_color_map:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        left_list = left_color_map[c]\n        for idx_l in left_list:\n            if idx_l in used_left:\n                continue\n            # Find a right ? not used\n            for idx_r in right_color_map['?']:\n                if idx_r in used_right:\n                    continue\n                pairs.append((idx_l + 1, idx_r + 1))\n                used_left.add(idx_l)\n                used_right.add(idx_r)\n                break\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping by Color**: We use dictionaries to map each color to the list of indices of boots that have that color. This allows efficient access to all boots of a specific color.\n2. **Matching Specific Colors**: For each color (excluding '?'), we match the left boots with the same color as right boots. This ensures that specific color pairs are used first.\n3. **Handling Question Marks**: After handling specific colors, we use the remaining question marks to form pairs with each other or with remaining specific colors. This ensures that we maximize the number of valid pairs by leveraging the flexibility of question marks.\n4. **Tracking Usage**: Sets are used to keep track of which boots have already been paired to ensure no boot is used more than once.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures the maximum number of compatible pairs are formed.",
