The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the construction rules again.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, that initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those leaves) are connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So the process is like building layers. \n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's consider the example given. For k=4, the smallest snowflake. Let's see:\n\nInitially, 1 node. Then add k nodes connected to it. So that's 1 + 4 = 5 nodes. But then, each of those 4 nodes is a leaf. So we need to connect each to k new nodes. So each of the 4 nodes gets 4 new nodes. That adds 4*4=16 nodes. Total becomes 1 +4 +16 = 21? Wait but the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nWait the example input includes 13 as a yes. Let me think. How can a snowflake have 13 nodes?\n\nLet me think about the construction steps again. Let me think recursively. The snowflake is built in layers. Let's model the number of nodes after each step.\n\nLet me think about the construction steps:\n\nThe first step: Start with 1 node. Then, connect it to k nodes. So total nodes is 1 + k. But then, the next step is to take each leaf (the k nodes connected to the root) and connect them to k new nodes. Each of those leaves is connected to k new nodes. So each such step adds k * (number of leaves) nodes.\n\nBut how many layers are there? Let's think about the process. The initial step is layer 0 (the root). Then, layer 1 is the k children of the root. Then, each of those nodes in layer 1 has k children. But this step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do this once. So the total nodes would be:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node.\n\nLayer 1: k nodes.\n\nLayer 2: k * k nodes.\n\nTotal: 1 + k + k².\n\nWait for example, if k=2, then 1+2+4=7. But according to the sample input, when n=6, the output is NO. But for n=13, the output is YES. Let's check. For example, if k=3, then 1+3+9=13. So that's possible. So that's why n=13 is a yes.\n\nSo the snowflake can be constructed with m layers. Wait, but how many layers? The initial step is adding the first layer (the k children of the root). Then, the second step is adding the children to each of the leaves. So the process can be done once (so two layers), or more times. Wait, but the problem says that the step \"each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\"\n\nSo the initial step (adding the first layer) is part of the construction. Then, the step of adding more layers (like the second layer) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has two layers: the root, then k children, then each of those children adds k children. So the total nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But what about if you do more steps?\n\nLike, for example, if after adding the second layer, you add another layer. Then the third layer would be adding k * k^2 nodes. So the total would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But then, the step of adding layers must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first layer) is mandatory. Then, the second step (adding the second layer) is mandatory. But perhaps the process can be done more than once. So the snowflake can have any number of layers, as long as there are at least two layers (i.e., the step of adding layers is done once).\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe construction steps:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, so the first step is adding the first layer (k children of root). Then, the second step is doing the process once. Which is adding new nodes to all leaves (those that have only one connection). So the second step is done once. So the minimal case is when after the first step (adding the first layer), the second step is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. However, the step could be done multiple times. So for example, after adding the second layer, you can again do the step: take all the leaves (which are the nodes in the second layer) and add k children to each. So the total would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes can be written as 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >= 2. Because the step is done at least once. Wait, but how does that fit with the steps? Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then, the step (adding new nodes to each leaf) is done once. That adds k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k^2. Then, if we do that step again, that would add k^3 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the formula for the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m >= 2. Because the first term is 1 (k^0), then the next is k^1 (the first layer), then k^2 (second layer), etc. But m must be at least 2, because the step is done once. So the sum is from i=0 to m, where m >= 2. But wait, the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). So for example, when m=2, it's (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some integer k>1 and m >=2. Wait, but that's not exactly correct. Because the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But in our case, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, which equals (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1). However, according to the problem's construction, the step of adding layers is done at least once. So the minimum m is 2. Because when m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which corresponds to the first step (adding k nodes) and then adding the second step (adding k^2 nodes). So the sum must be of the form (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m >= 2, and k >=2. Wait, but m here is the number of layers minus 1? Or maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, the sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >= 1. Because the first step (adding k nodes) is the first term (k^1) and the step is done once. But the problem says that the step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is required, and then the step of adding to leaves once. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum up to m=2. So m is at least 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given n, check if there exists integers k >=2 and m >=2 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait no. Let me re-express the sum. The sum S is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^t, where t is the number of layers. For example, if we have 1 layer (the initial step, adding k nodes), then the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem, the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. Which implies that after the initial step (adding the first layer), we have to perform the step once. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is 1 +k +k^2 = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So the exponent in the formula is m+1, where m is the number of steps. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the sum as S = (k^{s} -1)/(k-1), where s is the number of terms. For example, the sum 1 +k +k^2 is s=3 terms, so (k^3 -1)/(k-1). And the problem requires that the number of terms is at least 3. Because the first step (adding k nodes) is 1 +k (two terms), but then the step is done once (adding k^2 nodes, making three terms). So the number of terms s must be >=3. So the problem becomes: check if n can be expressed as (k^s -1)/(k-1), where s >=3 and k >=2.\n\nWait, but then for the example input n=13, we have k=3, s=3. (3^3 -1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 = 26/2=13. Which matches. Similarly, for n=6, let's see. Suppose s=3. Then (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. We need to find k>=2 such that this equals 6. Let's see for k=2: 4+2+1=7>6. For k=1, but k must be >1. So no solution. So n=6 is not possible. Hence the sample input says for 6, output is NO.\n\nAnother sample input is n=255. Let's see. 255 is 2^8 -1. So (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So s=8. So 8 >=3. So yes. So the answer is YES.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to checking if n can be written as (k^s -1)/(k-1) for some integers k >=2, s >=3.\n\nBut how do we check this for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nSo the approach is: for each test case n, check if there exists a pair (k, s) with k >=2, s >=3 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) = n. If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that for each possible s (starting from 3 up to some maximum), we can check if there's a k such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to find an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about possible values of s. For a given s, what is the possible range of k?\n\nFor example, for s=3, (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k^2 +k +1 =n. So solving for k in this equation.\n\nSimilarly for s=4: k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =n.\n\nBut for each s, the value of k must be such that the sum equals n. Also, note that for fixed s, the function f(k) = (k^s -1)/(k-1) increases with k. So for each s, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there's a solution.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible s that we need to check?\n\nLet's think: for s >=3, the minimal value of f(k) is when k=2. For s=3, it's 2^2 +2 +1=7. For s=4, 2^3+2^2+2+1= 15. For s=5, 31, etc. For each s, the minimal value is 2^{s} -1 (since (2^s -1)/(2-1) = 2^s -1). Wait, no. Wait for s terms, the sum is (k^s -1)/(k-1). For k=2, that's 2^s -1. So for example, s=3 gives 2^3 -1=7, which is indeed 1+2+4=7.\n\nSo for each s, the minimal value is 2^s -1. Since n can be up to 1e18, the maximum possible s is log2(1e18 +1). Let's compute log2(1e18). Since 2^60 is about 1e18 (approx 1.15e18), so for s up to 60, perhaps. So for each n, we can check s up to log2(n) +1. Since for s larger than log2(n)+1, the minimal value (for k=2) would be larger than n, so no solution.\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate s from 3 up to log2(n)+1, and for each s, perform a binary search on k to see if there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut for n=1, the minimal s is 3, but 2^3 -1=7>1. So for n=1, answer is NO.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each test case n:\n\nCheck for all possible s (starting from 3 up to max_s), and for each s, check if there exists a k >=2 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nIf any such pair (k,s) exists, return YES. Else, NO.\n\nNow, for each s, how to compute k?\n\nLet me think for a given s, the equation is:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{s-1} k^i = n.\n\nWhich is equal to (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nWe can rearrange this as k^s -1 =n*(k-1)\n\n=> k^s -n*k + (n-1) =0.\n\nBut solving this equation for k is difficult analytically. However, for a fixed s, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nBut for binary search, we need to find the lower and upper bounds for k.\n\nFor a fixed s, the function f(k) = sum_{i=0}^{s-1} k^i is strictly increasing with k. So for a given s, if we can find k such that f(k) =n, then it's unique.\n\nSo for each s, we can perform a binary search on k between 2 and some upper limit.\n\nWhat is the upper limit for k for a given s?\n\nWell, for a given s, the minimal value of f(k) is when k=2, which is 2^s -1. If n is less than that, then there's no solution for this s. So for each s, the upper bound for k can be determined as follows:\n\nFor the given s, the maximum possible k is such that f(k) <=n.\n\nBut since f(k) increases with k, for binary search, the upper bound can be found as follows: for example, for s=3, the maximum possible k is such that k^2 +k +1 <=n. So k can be up to sqrt(n). Similarly, for general s, the maximum k can be up to n^(1/(s-1)), since for k >=2, the sum is at least k^{s-1} (since the sum includes k^{s-1} as the last term). So for k^{s-1} <=n => k <=n^{1/(s-1)}.\n\nSo for binary search, for each s, the upper bound can be set as n^(1/(s-1)) +1. But since n can be up to 1e18, and s can be up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nSo the steps for each test case:\n\nFor each possible s (from 3 up to max_s):\n\n   compute the minimal possible value for k=2, which is 2^s -1. If this is larger than n, then no solution for this s. Skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search for k in [2, upper] to find if there exists a k such that f(k) =n.\n\n      if found, return YES.\n\nIf none of the s's work, return NO.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut how to compute f(k) for given k and s?\n\nBut for large s and k, computing k^s may overflow. However, since n can be up to 1e18, and s is up to 60, even for k=2 and s=60, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is manageable. However, for larger s, like s=60, and k=2, the sum is 2^60 -1, which is 1e18.\n\nBut for each k and s, we need to compute sum_{i=0}^{s-1} k^i. However, for large s and k, this can be very big, but during the binary search, we can compute this sum incrementally and check if it exceeds n. So during the binary search steps, for a given k and s, we can compute the sum and check if it equals n.\n\nBut how to compute this sum without overflowing?\n\nWait, but since n is up to 1e18, during the binary search, if during the calculation of the sum, the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's larger than n.\n\nSo for a given k and s, compute the sum step by step:\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nFor i from 0 to s-1:\n\n   total += k^i\n\n   if total >n: break and return that it's larger than n.\n\nBut calculating k^i for each step may be time-consuming. Alternatively, we can compute the sum as (k^s -1)/(k-1), but for this, we need to compute k^s, which can be done via exponentiation, but again, we need to handle large exponents.\n\nBut for the purposes of checking if the sum equals n, perhaps it's better to compute the sum incrementally, and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nLet me think about the code for the function that computes the sum for a given k and s. Let's call this function check(k, s, n):\n\ndef check(k, s, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(s):\n\n        term = k**i\n\n        if term > n:\n\n            return 1  # sum exceeds n\n\n        total += term\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return 1\n\n    if total ==n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # sum is less than n\n\nBut wait, for large s (like 60), and k=2, this loop would run 60 times. For each binary search step, this is acceptable, as the total number of steps would be manageable.\n\nBut for very large k and s, the term k^i can be huge. For example, if k is 1e9 and s is 3, then the sum is 1 + 1e9 + 1e18. Which for n=1e18, the sum is 1e18 + ... which would be larger than n. So during the loop, the term can be checked for exceeding n. So for example, in the loop:\n\nterm = k^i. But for i-th term, we can compute it as k^i, but if during the computation, the term exceeds n, then the total will also exceed n, so we can break early.\n\nBut calculating k^i can be done incrementally. For example, for each step, the term is previous_term *k. So:\n\nprev_term = 1 (for i=0)\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in 0 to s-1:\n\n   total += prev_term\n\n   if total >n: return 1\n\n   if prev_term >n: return 1\n\n   prev_term *=k\n\n   if prev_term >n: return 1\n\nBut this way, we avoid calculating k^i directly, which can be computationally expensive and prone to overflow. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so overflow isn't an issue. However, for performance, this approach is better.\n\nSo let's implement the check function as:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current_term = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        if current_term > n:\n\n            return 1  # sum will exceed n\n\n        total += current_term\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return 1\n\n        current_term *= k\n\n    if total == n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1\n\nWait, but for s steps, the loop runs s times. For example, for s=3, the terms are 1, k, k^2. So the loop adds each term. So for s steps, the code is correct.\n\nNow, for the binary search part. For a given s, we want to find if there's a k such that compute_sum(k, s, n) returns 0.\n\nThe binary search for k would have lower bound 2 and upper bound upper.\n\nWhat is the upper bound for k?\n\nAs discussed earlier, for the sum to be <=n, the maximum possible k is such that k^{s-1} <=n. Because the sum is at least k^{s-1} (since the sum includes the term k^{s-1}).\n\nThus, the upper bound can be set as n^(1/(s-1)) + 1. However, since s can be up to 60, and n up to 1e18, the upper bound for k is manageable.\n\nBut how to compute this upper bound? Well, for binary search, we can start with low=2 and high= something like 2e9, but that might be too slow for large s. Alternatively, we can compute high as the integer part of n^(1/(s-1)) + 2.\n\nBut in Python, we can compute this using binary search for the upper bound. Alternatively, for each s, the upper bound can be set as 2, and then multiplied by 2 until compute_sum(high, s, n) returns 1 (meaning that the sum is larger than n). Then, the high can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, during the binary search for k, we can start with low=2, high=2, and while compute_sum(high, s, n) returns -1 (sum <n), multiply high by 2. Once we have a high where compute_sum(high, s, n) returns 1, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the upper bound for binary search.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor a given s, the steps are:\n\n- Check if the minimal possible sum for k=2 is <=n. The minimal sum is compute_sum(2, s, n). If this returns 1, then no solution for this s. Else, proceed.\n\nBut wait, compute_sum(2, s, n) returns 0 if the sum equals n, 1 if sum exceeds, -1 if sum is less. So, for the minimal sum (k=2), if compute_sum(2, s, n) returns 1, then the sum is larger than n. So no solution. If returns -1, then the sum is smaller than n. So there may be a k larger than 2 which gives sum equal to n.\n\nSo the steps for a given s:\n\nif compute_sum(2, s, n) returns 1: then no solution for this s.\n\nelse:\n\n   find the upper bound for k (high) such that compute_sum(high, s, n) returns 1.\n\n   perform binary search between low=2 and high to find if any k exists.\n\nBut how to find high?\n\nInitialize high=2. While compute_sum(high, s, n) returns -1, multiply high by 2. Once compute_sum(high, s, n) returns 1, then binary search between low=2 and high.\n\nOnce that is done, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nSo during the binary search for k, for a given s, we can find if there's a k that satisfies the condition.\n\nOnce any such (k, s) is found, return YES.\n\nNow, the next thing is to iterate over all possible s. What is the maximum possible s?\n\nThe maximum s is such that for k=2, the sum is 2^s -1 <=n. So 2^s -1 <=n => s <= log2(n+1). For n up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So s can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate s from 3 up to 60 (or until 2^s -1 exceeds n).\n\nSo the code outline for each test case is:\n\nfor each n:\n\n    if n ==1: output NO\n\n    else:\n\n        found = False\n\n        for s in 3 to max_s:\n\n            if 2^s -1 >n:\n\n                break  # since higher s will have higher minimal sum\n\n            else:\n\n                perform the binary search for k as described above.\n\n                if found, set found=True and break\n\n        if found: output YES else NO\n\nBut how to compute max_s?\n\nmax_s can be up to 60, as explained.\n\nSo, for example, for n=1e18, 2^60 is about 1.15e18. So for s=60, 2^60 -1 is 1.15e18-1, which is larger than 1e18. So for s=59, 2^59 is 5.7e17, which is less than 1e18. So the maximum s for n=1e18 is 59.\n\nSo in code, for each n, we can iterate s from 3 up to 60 (or until 2^s -1 >n).\n\nNow, handling the edge cases.\n\nFor example, n=7: s=3, k=2. 2^3-1=7. So returns YES.\n\nn=1: no.\n\nn=2: no.\n\nn=3: no.\n\nn=6: no.\n\nn=13: s=3, k=3. sum is 1+3+9=13.\n\nAnother case: n=15. For s=3, check if there's k such that sum is 15. Let's see:\n\nk=2: 1+2+4=7 <15.\n\nk=3: 1+3+9=13 <15.\n\nk=4: 1+4+16=21>15. So no. So for s=3, no solution. What about s=4?\n\nFor s=4, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 = (k^4 -1)/(k-1). Let's see for k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes! So n=15 is YES.\n\nSo the sample input for n=15 is YES. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code needs to handle this case.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the function to check for a given s and n whether there's a k.\n\nNow, considering that for large s, say 60, the minimal sum for k=2 is 2^60 -1, which is about 1e18. So for n=1e18, the code will check s up to 60.\n\nNow, the code for each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n ==1: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for s in 3 to 60:\n\n       compute the minimal sum for k=2. How? Well, compute_sum(2, s, n). But for that, we can compute the sum as (2^s -1). However, if 2^s -1 exceeds n, then for this s, there's no solution.\n\nBut how to compute 2^s -1? Well, for s up to 60, 2^s can be calculated as 1 << s. But for s=60, it's 1<<60 which is 1152921504606846976, which is about 1e18.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, for s up to 60, 2^s can be computed.\n\nBut perhaps during the loop for s, we can check if 2^s -1 >n. If so, break, since higher s will have higher minimal sum.\n\nBut how to compute 2^s -1?\n\nIn code, for each s:\n\nmin_sum = 2^s -1.\n\nif min_sum >n:\n\n   break.\n\nelse:\n\n   proceed to check for possible k.\n\nBut for s up to 60, 2^s can be computed as pow(2, s).\n\nBut for very large s, like 60, pow(2, s) can be computed.\n\nBut in code, for each s, we can calculate the minimal sum as (2^s -1). If this is larger than n, break. Else, proceed.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBut even for s=60, 2^s is manageable as a Python integer.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor s in range(3, 61):\n\n    min_sum = (1 << s) -1  # 2^s -1\n\n    if min_sum >n:\n\n        break\n\n    else:\n\n        perform the binary search for k for this s.\n\nBut wait, for example, when s=3, min_sum is 7. For n=7, it's okay. But for n=7, the code would check for s=3, and find that k=2 is a solution.\n\nBut in the code, for each s, the code checks if the minimal sum (for k=2) is <=n. If yes, then perform the binary search for k.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, the minimal sum is less than n, and there exists a k>2 that gives sum equal to n. So the code proceeds.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nNow, the code for each s:\n\nOnce we know that for k=2, the sum is <=n, then we need to find a k where the sum is exactly n.\n\nSo, for each s, perform the following steps:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, s, n) == -1:\n\n    high *=2\n\nOnce high is found such that compute_sum(high, s, n) returns 1 (sum exceeds n), then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut during this process, the compute_sum function is called. Now, the compute_sum function is as defined before.\n\nNow, implementing the compute_sum function as a helper function.\n\nBut in Python, for very large exponents, even with the incremental approach, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about possible optimizations.\n\nFor example, for s=3, the sum is k^2 +k +1 =n. So solving for k: k^2 +k +1 -n=0. The discriminant is 1 -4*(1-n) = 4n -3. The positive root is (-1 + sqrt(4n-3))/2. So for s=3, we can compute k as floor of that value and check nearby integers. But for general s, this approach may not be feasible. However, for the binary search approach, it's manageable.\n\nBut for the code, the binary search approach is general and can be used for all s.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing compute_sum:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current_term = 1\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        if current_term > n:\n\n            return 1\n\n        total += current_term\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return 1\n\n        current_term *= k\n\n    if total == n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nNow, for each s, perform the steps:\n\nOnce we have s and know that 2^s-1 <=n, then:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, s, n) == -1:\n\n    high *=2\n\nOnce high is found, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThen, during binary search:\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) //2\n\n    res = compute_sum(mid, s, n)\n\n    if res ==0:\n\n        return True\n\n    elif res == -1:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\n    else:\n\n        high = mid -1\n\nIf during this process, a mid is found where compute_sum returns 0, then return True.\n\nSo, putting this into code.\n\nNow, considering that for each test case, the maximum s is 60, and for each s, the binary search for k is O(log(high)), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1 → NO\n\n2 → NO\n\n3 → NO\n\n6 → NO\n\n13 → YES (s=3, k=3)\n\n15 → YES (s=4, k=2)\n\n255 → YES (s=8, k=2: sum is 2^8-1=255)\n\n10101 → YES ?\n\nLet me check for 10101. Let's see:\n\nFor example, s=3. Let's see if there is a k where k^2 +k +1 =10101 → k^2 +k +1 =10101 → k^2 +k =10100 → k^2 +k -10100=0 → discriminant is 1 +4*10100 = 40401 → sqrt(40401)= 201. So k = (-1 +201)/2 = 200/2=100. So k=100. So yes, for s=3, k=100. So 100^2 +100 +1 = 10000 +100 +1 = 10101. So yes. Hence output YES.\n\nAnother sample input: 1000000000000000000 → output NO.\n\nSo for n=1e18, check if there's any s and k.\n\nFor example, for s=3, check if there's k such that k^2 +k +1 =1e18. Solving for k:\n\nk^2 +k +1 =1e18 → k^2 ≈1e18 → k≈1e9. Let's compute k^2 +k +1 for k= 999999999:\n\nk^2 = (1e9 -1)^2 = 1e18 - 2e9 +1. Adding k gives 1e18 -2e9 +1 + 1e9 -1 = 1e18 -1e9. Adding 1 gives 1e18 -1e9 +1. Which is less than 1e18. So for k= 1e9, k^2 +k +1 = 1e18 + 1e9 +1, which is larger than 1e18. So between k=999,999,999 and 1e9, there's no integer solution. Hence, for s=3, no solution. For other s, perhaps?\n\nBut for example, for s=2, but the problem requires s >=3. So no. So the answer is NO.\n\nSo the code should return NO for n=1e18.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n ==1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    for s in range(3, 61):\n\n        # compute 2^s -1\n\n        # but for s up to 60,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single vertex and expanding outward, ensuring that each new layer follows specific rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph can be represented as a sum of a geometric series. For a given integer $ k > 1 $ and number of layers $ s \\geq 3 $, the total number of vertices $ n $ can be expressed as $ (k^s - 1) / (k - 1) $.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Layers**: For each possible number of layers $ s $ from 3 up to 60 (since $ 2^{60} $ exceeds $ 10^{18} $), check if there exists an integer $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $.\n3. **Binary Search for Valid $ k $**: For each $ s $, use binary search to determine if there exists a valid $ k $ such that the sum of the series equals $ n $.
