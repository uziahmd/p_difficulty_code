The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake is built in a certain way, and we need to check if such a graph can have exactly n vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the snowflake. Let me re-read the description.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so those leaves) are connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So, the process is like building layers. \n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's model the construction steps.\n\nLet me consider the example given for k=4. The smallest snowflake would be:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then connect to 4 nodes. Now, each of those 4 is a leaf. Then, each of them must be connected to k new nodes. So after that step, each of the original 4 has 4 new nodes. So total nodes would be 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 +4 +16 = 21? But the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait the sample input includes n=13 as a YES. Let me think about that. How can 13 be achieved?\n\nLet me think of the construction steps. Suppose the process is done for some steps. Let's model the possible numbers.\n\nLet me think recursively. The snowflake is built in layers. Let's say that the first layer is the initial node. Then, the second layer adds k nodes. Then, each of those nodes adds k more nodes in the third layer. But the process must be done at least once. Wait, the step where each leaf is connected to k new nodes is done at least once. So, the minimal case is when we have two layers: the initial node, then the first layer (k nodes), and then each of those is connected to k nodes. So that would be three layers. Wait, but maybe the step is done once. For example, the first step is adding the initial k nodes. Then the second step is adding the next layer. So the minimal snowflake would have 1 + k + k*k nodes. For example, if k=2, then 1+2+4=7 nodes. But according to the sample input, for n=6, the output is NO. Let's see. Let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input includes n=6, output is NO. So for example, if k=2, the minimal is 7, which is larger than 6. So 6 cannot be formed. But perhaps there are other ways to build the snowflake. Wait, maybe there are multiple steps. Like, maybe the process is done more than once. Let me think again.\n\nThe process is: start with 1 node. Then, add k nodes connected to it. Then, each node that is a leaf (i.e., connected to only one other node) is connected to k new nodes. This step is done at least once. So the step of adding new layers is done once or more. So the number of layers can be more than two.\n\nLet me think of the structure. Let's model the number of nodes as a function of the number of layers and k.\n\nLet me consider that each time we perform a step, all current leaves (nodes with degree 1) get k new children. So the first step is:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node (root)\nAfter first expansion (step 1): root has k children. Now, the leaves are these k nodes. So the total nodes is 1 + k.\n\nThen, step 2: each of the k leaves gets k new children. Now, the leaves are the new nodes added in this step. The total nodes is 1 + k + k*k.\n\nIf we do another step (step 3), each of the k^2 leaves gets k children. Total nodes is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. And so on.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal number of steps is 1. Which gives us the total of 1 +k +k^2 nodes. Wait, no. Wait, the first step is adding k nodes. Then, the step (adding new nodes to the leaves) is done once. So after the first step, we have 1 +k nodes. Then, the step is done once, meaning that each leaf (the k nodes) gets k new nodes. So the total becomes 1 +k +k*k = 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the total number of nodes for a snowflake is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m, where m is the number of steps. Wait, no. Because the first step is adding k nodes. Then, each step after that adds more layers. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial step is the first expansion. Then, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves is done once. So the total number of layers is 2. For example, the first expansion (step 1) gives the first layer. Then, the second expansion (step 2) gives the second layer.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k * k = 1 +k +k². So for m steps, where m is the number of times the expansion was done. Wait, the initial step (adding the first k nodes) is part of the process. Then, the expansion steps are done once or more. Let me think of the process as follows:\n\nThe snowflake is built in stages. The first stage is the root node. Then, the first expansion adds k nodes connected to the root. Then, each subsequent expansion adds layers by connecting each leaf (from the previous step) to k new nodes. The number of expansions (steps) must be at least 1. So the minimal number of expansions is 1, which gives the total nodes as 1 + k + k². But if you do two expansions, it's 1 +k +k² +k^3. And so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes for a snowflake is:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1.\n\nWait, but m is the number of expansions. Let me think again. The first expansion (after the root) is adding k nodes. Then, the first expansion step (the required step) adds the next layer. So for m expansion steps, the total nodes would be sum_{i=0}^m k^i. But wait, for m=1, sum is 1 +k. But according to the rules, the expansion step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the sum must be 1 +k +k²? Or is the sum 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1?\n\nWait, the initial step is creating the root. Then, the first expansion is adding k nodes connected to the root. Then, the step (adding new nodes to the leaves) is done once. That would be adding k² nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k². Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So m is the number of steps, which is 2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the number of layers. The root is layer 0. Then, layer 1 is the k nodes connected to it. Then, layer 2 is each of the layer 1 nodes connected to k nodes. So for each layer beyond the first, the number of nodes is multiplied by k. The number of layers must be at least 2 (since the expansion step is done once). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. If you add another layer, it's 1 +k +k² +k^3, etc. So the total number of nodes is the sum from i=0 to m of k^i, where m ≥ 2? No, because m=2 would be 1 +k +k². Wait, sum from i=0 to m of k^i equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². So the total number of nodes is (k^{d} -1)/(k-1), where d is the number of layers. But the number of layers must be at least 2. Because the expansion step is done once. For example, if d=2, then the sum is 1 +k. Which would be the case when only the first expansion is done. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh! So the step of adding new nodes to the leaves is done at least once. So the initial step is adding k nodes (so the root has k children). Then, the step (adding new nodes to the leaves) is done once. So that means that each of those k leaves gets k new children. So the total nodes is 1 +k +k*k = 1 +k +k². So the minimal number of layers is 2 (the root, then the first layer, then the second layer). Therefore, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k². So the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, for example, when k=2 and d=3 layers (sum from i=0 to 2 of 2^i) = 1 +2 +4 =7. Which is (2^3 -1)/(2-1) =7. So yes.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is S = (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of layers. But m must be at least 3? Or what is m here?\n\nWait, the sum for the snowflake is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d} ?\n\nNo. Let me think again. The initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves is done once. So that's adding k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k². Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So the number of terms is 3. So the number of layers is 3? Or the number of steps? Maybe it's easier to think that the snowflake can be represented as S = (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m is the number of layers (starting from 1?), but with constraints on m.\n\nBut the problem is that the snowflake requires that the step of adding new nodes to the leaves is done at least once. Which implies that the number of layers is at least 2 (the initial step of adding the first k nodes, then adding the next layer). Wait, maybe the formula for the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k * (k^m -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nNo, perhaps I need to model the process again.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake construction:\n\n- Start with 1 node (level 0).\n\n- Level 1: add k nodes connected to level 0. Now, there are 1 +k nodes.\n\n- Then, for each level >=1, we perform the step of adding new nodes to leaves. For each such step, each leaf (which is in the previous level) adds k new nodes. So, for example, after the first expansion (level 1), we perform the step once, adding k * k nodes (each of the k leaves adds k nodes). So total nodes is 1 +k +k².\n\nIf we perform another step, then each of the k² leaves (from level 2) adds k nodes. So total nodes is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m is the number of times we've done the expansion step. Wait, no. Because the initial expansion (level 1) is done once, and then each expansion step adds another layer. So the number of expansion steps is m, and the total nodes is 1 + k * (k^m -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think for m expansion steps. The first expansion (step 1) adds k nodes. Then, each subsequent expansion step adds k * (previous number of leaves). For example:\n\nm=1 expansion steps: the initial step (adding k nodes) plus one expansion step (adding k² nodes). So total is 1 +k +k².\n\nm=2 expansion steps: adding k, then k², then k³. So total 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k*(k^m -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, for m expansion steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No. Let me think again. The first term is 1. Then, the expansion steps are m steps. Each expansion step adds a new layer. The first expansion step (after the initial) adds k nodes. Then, the next expansion steps add k², then k³, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, the first expansion step (adding k nodes) is the first layer. Then, the expansion steps are done once (as per the problem's requirement). So for m expansion steps, the total number of layers is m+1. For example, m=1 expansion steps (the required step) would be adding one layer (the first layer, which is k nodes) and then another step (adding the second layer, k² nodes). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the number of expansion steps and the layers.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^d, where d is the number of layers after the initial node. And d must be at least 2. Because the expansion step must be done once. Let me think:\n\nd=1: sum is 1 +k. But that's only the initial step. However, the problem says that the expansion step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So for d=1, that would mean that after adding the first k nodes, the expansion step is not done. Which is invalid. Hence, d must be ≥ 2. So the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d, where d ≥ 2.\n\nBut then, the sum is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) - 1 +1? Wait, the sum from i=0 to d of k^i is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So for d ≥ 2, the sum is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). But in this case, the expansion steps are done d-1 times? Or something else.\n\nBut regardless, the problem requires that the number of nodes n can be written in the form (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 3. Because for d=2, m would be d+1=3. For example, if d=2, then sum is 1 +k +k² = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). And m is 3.\n\nWait, that seems right. So the snowflake can have n nodes if and only if there exists integers k>1 and m≥3 such that n = (k^m -1)/(k-1). Because for m=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². For m=4, it's 1 +k +k² +k³, etc. So the problem reduces to checking if n can be expressed in this form for some k>1 and m≥3.\n\nBut wait, what about other possibilities? For example, suppose there are multiple steps. For instance, if you have m=3, which gives 1 +k +k². But also, perhaps there's a different way to build the snowflake with different steps. But according to the problem's rules, the snowflake is built by adding layers, so the only possible forms are the ones described.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1), for some integers k>1 and m≥3.\n\nBut how to check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nSo the approach is: for each test case n, check if there exists k>1 and m≥3 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about possible values of m. Since m is at least 3, and for a given n, m can't be too big. For example, for m=3, the minimal k is 2, so (2^3 -1)/(2-1) =7. For m=3, the maximum possible k would be such that (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1 ≤n. So for large n, m can be up to log_2(n). But since n can be up to 1e18, trying all possible m up to 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18) is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each n, iterate over possible m from 3 up to log_2(n) +1 (since for m=60, even k=2 would give 2^60 which is about 1e18). For each m, check if there exists a k>1 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n. If for any m and k, this holds, then return YES. Else, return NO.\n\nNow, how to check for a given m, if there exists k such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nNote that (k^m -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nSo for each m, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for fixed m, the function f(k) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} is strictly increasing in k. So for each m, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... upper_bound], and check if f(k) equals n.\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given m?\n\nWell, since f(k) = 1 +k + ... +k^{m-1} ≥ 1 +k +k^2 ≥ 1 +2 +4 =7 for m≥3. For a given n, the maximum possible k for a given m is when m is fixed. For example, for m=3, the equation is k^2 +k +1 =n. So k^2 <n →k < sqrt(n). Similarly for higher m. So for each m, the upper bound for k can be set to n^(1/(m-1)) ), since for m ≥3, the term k^{m-1} is part of the sum. So the sum is ≥k^{m-1}, so k^{m-1} ≤n →k ≤n^{1/(m-1)}.\n\nThus, for each m, the binary search for k can be done between 2 and n^(1/(m-1)).\n\nBut since m can be up to log_2(n), for each m, the binary search is O(log n) steps. And since m is up to around 60, the total time per test case is acceptable for t=1e4.\n\nNow, the steps for solving the problem:\n\nFor each n:\n\nCheck if there exists m ≥3 and k≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i =n.\n\nSo, for each m from 3 up to max_m (which can be up to 60, since 2^60 is ~1e18), do:\n\n- Compute the possible k via binary search.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and m? For example, for m=3 and k=2, sum is 1+2+4=7.\n\nBut for large m and k, calculating this sum directly may cause overflow. However, since n can be up to 1e18, and for each step during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow.\n\nSo during the binary search for a given m and k, compute the sum as follows:\n\nInitialize sum =0.\n\nFor i from 0 to m-1:\n\nsum += k^i.\n\nBut calculating k^i directly could be expensive for large exponents. Alternatively, we can compute the sum iteratively, and check if it exceeds n. For example, for a given k and m, compute the sum step by step, adding k^i each time. If during the computation, the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's larger than n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum without overflow? Well, since n is up to 1e18, and m is up to 60, even for k=1e9 and m=2, the sum is 1e9 +1, which is manageable as a 64-bit integer. So Python can handle big integers, so no problem.\n\nBut for the binary search, for each candidate k, we can compute the sum for m terms, and compare with n.\n\nNow, for each m, the binary search for k is between low=2 and high=upper_bound. What is upper_bound? For example, for m, the maximum possible k is when the sum is equal to n. Since the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} ≥k^{m-1}, so k^{m-1} ≤n →k ≤n^(1/(m-1)).\n\nSo for a given m, the upper bound for k is floor(n^(1/(m-1))) +1. But in practice, during the binary search, we can start with low=2, high= some value, and adjust accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute n^(1/(m-1))? For example, for m=3, it's n^(1/2). We can compute this using integer exponentiation, but for the purposes of binary search, perhaps it's easier to set high to n, but that would be inefficient. However, since m can be up to 60, and for m=60, the upper bound for k is n^(1/59), which is small even for n=1e18.\n\nSo for example, for m=60, the upper bound for k is 1e18^(1/59) ≈ 1e(18/59) ≈ 1e0.3 ≈ 2. So the upper bound is 2. So for m=60, the possible k is 2, and the sum would be 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^59. Which is 2^60 -1. For n=1e18, this is 1.15e18. So if n is 1e18, then for m=60, k=2 gives sum= 1.15e18 which is larger than n. So the binary search would find that the sum is larger than n, and thus no solution.\n\nSo for each m, the binary search can proceed with low=2 and high= some upper bound. But for the upper bound, perhaps we can use high = n. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can use high = 2, and compute the upper bound as follows:\n\nBut perhaps during the binary search, we can start with high=2, and keep doubling until the sum exceeds n. Then, set high to that value. But that may take some steps. However, given that m is small, this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{m-1} <=n. Since for k>=2, the sum is at least 1 +2 + 2^2 + ... +2^{m-1} = 2^m -1. So for k=2, the sum is 2^m-1. So if 2^m-1 >n, then for this m, there's no possible k. So for each m, first check if 2^m-1 >n. If so, then no need to check further for this m. Otherwise, proceed with binary search.\n\nSo for each m starting from 3 up to max_m (where max_m is the maximum possible m such that 2^m -1 <=n):\n\nLet's compute max_m as follows. For example, for n=1e18, 2^m -1 <=1e18. Let's compute m_max:\n\n2^60 is 1.15e18. So 2^60-1 is about 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, m_max is 59, since 2^59-1 is 5.7e17 <1e18.\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate m from 3 up to log2(n)+1. For each m, check if 2^m -1 <=n. If not, break. Else, proceed with binary search for k in this m.\n\nOnce we have the m, perform binary search on k.\n\nNow, the steps for each test case:\n\nCheck if n is 1: then output NO (since the minimal snowflake is 7 for k=2, m=3).\n\nElse:\n\nFor each m from 3 to max_m:\n\nCompute the minimal sum for k=2, which is 2^m -1. If this is larger than n, break (since higher m would have even larger minimal sum).\n\nElse, perform binary search for k in [2, ... upper_bound] where upper_bound is such that the sum for k=upper_bound and m is >=n.\n\nBut how to find upper_bound for binary search? Well, for the binary search, we can start with low=2, high=2. Then, while the sum for k=high and m is less than n, multiply high by 2. Once we have a high where the sum is >=n, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nOnce we have the binary search range, we can check for k in that range.\n\nOnce the binary search is done, check if any k gives sum equal to n.\n\nIf for any m and k, the sum equals n, then return YES.\n\nOtherwise, after checking all possible m, return NO.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, for each test case n:\n\nif n < 7: return NO (since the minimal possible is 7 for m=3, k=2)\n\nelse:\n\nfor m in 3 to max_m:\n\ncompute the minimal sum for k=2: 2^m -1. If this is larger than n, break (since higher m would have even larger sums)\n\nelse:\n\nfind if there exists k such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i =n.\n\nHow to compute sum for given k and m?\n\nWe can compute it as follows:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(m):\n\n        total += k ** i\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n    return total\n\nBut for large m and k, this could be slow. However, since m is up to 60, and for each test case, this is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, exponentiation is fast, but for large exponents, even 2^60 is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum using the formula (k^m -1) // (k-1), but only if k !=1. Since k>1, this is valid.\n\nBut for the purposes of checking, we can use this formula. However, for cases where k is large and m is large, computing k^m could be expensive. But since m is up to 60, and k is up to say 1e6, then k^m could be up to (1e6)^60, which is way larger than 1e18, but in Python, integers can handle that. However, for the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo during the binary search, for a given k and m, we can compute the sum incrementally, adding each term and checking if it exceeds n. If it does, return early.\n\nThis is better because for some cases, even if the formula (k^m -1)/(k-1) is correct, the actual sum could be larger than n, and we can break early.\n\nSo here's the plan for the compute_sum function:\n\ndef check(k, m, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(m):\n\n        term = k ** i\n\n        if term > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        total += term\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n    return total\n\nBut even this can be optimized. For example, during the loop, if the term is already larger than n, then the sum will be larger than n, so return infinity.\n\nBut for m up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, for each m, perform the binary search for k.\n\nSo, for a given m, the steps are:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, m) < n:\n\n    high *=2\n\nOnce we have high, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nIn the binary search, for mid = (low + high) // 2, compute the sum. If sum <n: need to increase k. Else if sum>n: decrease k. Else, found.\n\nBut during the binary search, we need to handle possible overflows, but the check function returns infinity if the sum exceeds n.\n\nOnce found, return YES.\n\nNow, let's test some examples.\n\nSample input:\n\nTest case n=13.\n\nCheck for m=3: sum is 1 +k +k² =13 →k² +k +1 =13 →k² +k -12=0 →k=( -1 ± sqrt(1+48))/2 →sqrt(49)=7 →k=( -1 +7)/2=3. So k=3. So sum is 1+3+9=13. So YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=15. Let's see:\n\nFor m=3: 1 +k +k² =15 →k² +k -14=0 →k=(-1 + sqrt(57))/2 ≈ ( -1 +7.54)/2 ≈ 3.27. So no integer solution. For m=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k^3 =15. Try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 → yes. So YES.\n\nSo for n=15, answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6: output is NO. For m=3, sum is 1 +k +k² =6 →k² +k -5=0. Discriminant 1+20=21. sqrt(21)=~4.58. k=( -1 +4.58)/2 ~1.79. Not integer. So no solution. For m=4, sum would be 1 +k +k² +k^3. For k=2, sum is 1+2+4+8=15>6. So no solution. Thus, answer is NO.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n < 7 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\nfor m in 3 to max_m:\n\n    compute minimal sum for k=2: 2^m -1. If this is >n → break.\n\n    else:\n\n        perform binary search for k in this m.\n\n        if found → return YES.\n\nif after all m, no solution → output NO.\n\nNow, how to find max_m for a given n?\n\nmax_m can be up to log2(n) +1. For example, for n=1e18, log2(n) is about 60.\n\nSo in code, for each n, m can start from 3 up to 60 (since for m=60, 2^60 is 1.15e18. For n=1e18, 2^60-1 is 1.15e18 which is larger than 1e18, so m would be up to 59 for n=1e18.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can loop m from 3 to 60, and for each m, check if 2^m -1 <=n. If not, break.\n\nNow, code steps in Python.\n\nBut for large exponents, 2^m could be computed as 1 << m, but for m up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nBut for m up to 60, even for n=1e18, 2^60 is 1.15e18, which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement a function to check for a given m and n, whether there exists a k.\n\nImplement the binary search.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n\n    if n < 7:\n\n        return False\n\n    max_m = 60  # since 2^60 is 1e18ish\n\n    for m in range(3, max_m +1):\n\n        # Check if 2^m -1 <=n. If not, break.\n\n        # Compute 2^m -1:\n\n        min_sum = (1 << m) -1  # 2^m -1\n\n        if min_sum > n:\n\n            break\n\n        # Now perform binary search for k in this m.\n\n        # Find upper bound for k.\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = 2\n\n        while True:\n\n            s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n\n            if s < n:\n\n                high *=2\n\n            else:\n\n                break\n\n        # Now binary search between low and high.\n\n        while low <= high:\n\n            mid = (low + high) //2\n\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n\n            if s == n:\n\n                return True\n\n            elif s <n:\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut need to implement compute_sum.\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n\n    total =0\n\n    for i in range(m):\n\n        term = k **i\n\n        if term > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        total += term\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n    return total\n\nBut for m up to 60, and k up to say 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nWait, but for k=2 and m=60, the sum is 2^60-1, which is 1.15e18, which is okay for Python.\n\nBut for larger k and m, the sum can be very big. However, in the binary search, we check if the term exceeds n, and return early.\n\nNow, let's test for n=13 and m=3.\n\ncompute_sum(3,3,13) → i=0: 1, i=1: 3, i=2:9. total is 1+3+9=13 → returns 13. So returns True.\n\nAnother example, n=15 and m=4. For k=2, compute_sum(2,4,15) is 1+2+4+8=15 → returns 15. So returns True.\n\nBut for the code, during the binary search, when m=4 and n=15, the code will find k=2.\n\nNow, what about cases where the same n can be achieved with different m and k? For example, n=31 can be achieved with m=3 and k=3 (1+3+9=13? No. Wait 3^3-1/(3-1) is (27-1)/2=13. No. Wait for m=5, k=2: 1+2+4+8+16=31. So yes. So for n=31, the code would find m=5, k=2.\n\nSo the code should handle this.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about n=7? It's 1+2+4=7. So m=3, k=2. So returns YES.\n\nn=1: returns NO.\n\nn=2: returns NO.\n\nn=3: returns NO.\n\nn=6: returns NO.\n\nSample input includes n=13",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single vertex and expanding by adding new vertices in subsequent layers. The key insight is to check if `n` can be represented in the form of a geometric series sum for some integer `k > 1` and at least 3 layers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding `k` new vertices in each subsequent layer. The total number of vertices after `m` layers can be represented by the sum of a geometric series: $ S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1} $, which simplifies to $ S = \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} $.\n\n2. **Constraints Check**: For `n` to be valid, it must be possible to express it in the form of the geometric series sum for some integers `k > 1` and `m ≥ 3`.\n\n3. **Iterative Check**: For each test case, iterate over possible values of `m` (number of layers) starting from 3 up to a maximum feasible value (logarithmic in `n`). For each `m`, use binary search to find if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Use binary search within each possible `m` to efficiently determine if a valid `k` exists. This approach ensures that we handle very large values of `n` efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(m):\n        term = k ** i\n        if term > n:\n            return float('inf')\n        total += term\n        if total > n:\n            return float('inf')\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_m = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1.15e18\n    for m in range(3, max_m + 1):\n        # Check if 2^m - 1 <= n\n        try:\n            min_sum = (1 << m) - 1\n        except OverflowError:\n            min_sum = float('inf')\n        if min_sum > n:\n            break\n        # Now perform binary search for k in this m\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound\n        while True:\n            s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n            if s < n:\n                high *= 2\n            else:\n                break\n        # Binary search between low and high\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each number of vertices `n`, we check if it can be represented as a sum of a geometric series with at least 3 terms.\n3. **Binary Search**: For each potential number of layers `m`, binary search is used to find a valid `k` such that the sum of the series matches `n`.\n4. **Efficiency**: The approach ensures that we efficiently check feasible values of `k` and `m`, leveraging the properties of geometric series and binary search to handle very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the constraints and ensures correctness by leveraging mathematical properties and binary search techniques.",
