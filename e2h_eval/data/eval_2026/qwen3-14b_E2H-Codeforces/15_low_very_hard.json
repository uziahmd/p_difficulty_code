They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can be the champion given a certain tournament structure and rules for each phase. Let's break down the problem.\n\nSo, the tournament has 2^n teams. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. For each phase i (starting from 1?), the outcome of each match depends on the character in the string s. If s_i is 0, then in that phase, the lower-skilled team wins; if it's 1, the higher-skilled one wins. And we need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nThe key here is to model how the tournament progresses and determine for each possible x whether it's possible for it to win under the given rules.\n\nFirst, let's think about the tournament structure. The tournament is a binary tree structure. Each round, teams are paired, and the winner proceeds to the next round. The rules for each round (phase) are determined by the corresponding character in s.\n\nBut how do we model the possible winners? Since the permutation p is arbitrary except for the given rules, we need to find for each x, whether there's a way to arrange the other teams such that x can win through all phases.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each phase, depending on whether it's a higher or lower skill that wins, we can model the possible ranges of values that can reach the next phase.\n\nWait, maybe we can model the possible minimum and maximum values that a team must have in each round. For example, in the first phase, if the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), then for a team to proceed, it must be the higher in its pair. So, in the first round, the team must have a skill higher than its opponent. But since the permutation is arbitrary, the opponents can be chosen such that the team can win. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each round, we can determine the possible range of values that a team must have in order to reach that round. For example, in the first phase, if the rule is 1 (higher skill wins), then for a team to survive that phase, it needs to be the higher in its pair. But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the opponents so that the team can be the higher one. However, in the next phase, the same applies but with the new rules.\n\nBut how do we track this for all possible rounds?\n\nLet me think of it as building a bracket. For example, in the first round, the team must be able to win against its initial opponent. Then, in the second round, it must be able to win against the winner of another match, and so on. The problem is that the opponents in each round depend on the structure of the tournament. But since the permutation is arbitrary, perhaps we can model for each possible round, the constraints on the team's value.\n\nAnother approach: For a team x to be the champion, it must win all the rounds. Let's think about each round in reverse. For example, in the final round (the nth phase), there are two teams. The rule for that phase is s[n-1] (assuming zero-based index). For x to win that round, it must be that either x is higher than the other team (if s's last character is 1) or lower (if it's 0). But since the other team could be any possible value, except x, how can we model this?\n\nWait, but the permutation is arbitrary. So when trying to find if x can be the champion, we can arrange the other teams in such a way that x can win each round. So the question becomes: what constraints does each round impose on x's possible value?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that for a given round k (starting from 1 to n), the team x must be able to win in that round. For each round, the team x must be able to beat the opponent that comes from the other side of the bracket. But since the bracket is structured, perhaps we can model the required properties of x based on the rules of each phase.\n\nFor example, in the first phase (phase 1), the team x must be able to win against its initial opponent. The rule for phase 1 is s[0]. So, if s[0] is 1, then x must be higher than its opponent. Since the opponent can be any value except x, but we can choose the opponent to be lower than x. However, in later phases, the opponents may be constrained by the rules of their own rounds.\n\nBut how do these constraints propagate?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model for each round, the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have. For example, for the first round, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than some value.",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be the champion in a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure and rules are such that each phase reduces the number of teams by half, and the winner of each match is determined by either the higher or lower skill level based on the given string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in a binary tree where each round halves the number of teams. Each phase has specific rules for determining the winner.\n2. **Constraints Propagation**: For each team to be the champion, it must win all phases. We need to determine the constraints on the team's skill level based on the rules of each phase.\n3. **Recursive Range Calculation**: Using a recursive approach, we calculate the minimum and maximum possible values a team must have to win each phase. This involves considering the rules for each phase and propagating these constraints through the rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    def get_winning_range(phase, depth):\n        # phase is 0-based, depth is the current round (starting from 0)\n        if phase == n - 1:\n            # last phase, only one game\n            if s[phase] == '1':\n                # higher wins, so x must be the max in the bracket\n                return (1, 2**n)\n            else:\n                # lower wins, x must be the min in the bracket\n                return (1, 2**n)\n        else:\n            if s[phase] == '1':\n                # higher wins in this phase\n                # the team needs to be higher than the opponent from the other bracket\n                # which itself has a range\n                left_min, left_max = get_winning_range(phase + 1, depth + 1)\n                # to beat the other bracket's winner, x must be higher than the minimal possible value of the other bracket's winner\n                # but since the other bracket's winner could be any value in [left_min, left_max], we need x to be larger than the maximum possible value of the other bracket's winner\n                # Wait, no. Because in the next phase, the other bracket's winner is determined by the same rules. So the other bracket's winner can be any value that can be the winner of that subtree.\n                # Therefore, for x to be able to beat the other bracket's winner, x must be larger than the minimal possible value of the other bracket's winner, but since we can arrange the other bracket's winner to be as small as possible, x just needs to be larger than the minimal value of the other bracket's winner. But how?\n                # Alternatively, think recursively: for the current phase, the team must be able to beat the winner of the other subtree. So, the team's value must be such that it can beat the minimal possible value of the other subtree's winner (if the rule is higher wins). But since we can choose the other subtree's winner to be as small as possible, x must be larger than that minimal value. However, the other subtree's winner's minimal value is determined by the rules of the subsequent phases.\n                # Let me think again. For the current phase (phase), the team must be able to beat the winner of another subtree. That other subtree's winner can be any value that can be a winner of that subtree. So, for the current team to be able to beat that winner, it must be that either:\n                # if the rule is '1', x must be larger than the minimal possible value of the other subtree's winner.\n                # Wait, no. Because the other subtree's winner can be any value that can be a winner of that subtree. So, for x to be able to beat that winner, there must exist some value y in the other subtree's possible winners such that x beats y. Since we can choose the other subtree's winner to be as small as possible, x just needs to be larger than the minimal possible value of the other subtree's winner. However, the minimal possible value of the other subtree's winner depends on the rules of the subsequent phases.\n                # So, the minimal value of the other subtree's winner is determined by the same function, but for the next phase. For example, the other subtree's winner can be any value that can be the winner of the subtree. So, for the current phase, the current team must be able to beat the minimal possible value of the other subtree's winner (if the rule is higher wins).\n                # Therefore, the minimal required value for x is the minimal value of the other subtree's winner plus 1? Or maybe not. Let me think with an example.\n                # Suppose in the next phase, the possible winners can be between a and b. Then, if the current rule is '1', the current team x must be larger than some value in [a, b]. To ensure that there exists at least one value in [a, b] that x can beat, x must be larger than the minimal value in that range (a). So the minimal x can be is a + 1, and the maximum is 2^n. But since the other subtree's winner can be as low as a, then x just needs to be larger than a. So the range for x would be (a, 2^n). Similarly, if the rule is '0', then x must be smaller than the maximum of the other subtree's winner's range (b), so x can be in [1, b).\n                # Therefore, for each phase, the range for x is determined based on the next phase's range.\n                # So, for the current phase, if the rule is '1', then x must be larger than the minimal value of the other subtree's range. The other subtree's range is determined by the same function for the next phase. Hence, the current range is (min_other, 2^n).\n                # Similarly, if the rule is '0', then x must be smaller than the maximum value of the other subtree's range. So the current range is (1, max_other).\n                # But how do we compute min_other and max_other? Well, the other subtree's range is the same as what the current function returns for the next phase. Because the other subtree is processed in the same way.\n                # Therefore, for the current phase, when the rule is '1', the current team must be larger than the min_other (which is the min of the next phase's range). Thus, the current range is (min_other, 2^n). Similarly for '0', the current range is (1, max_other).\n                # But since the other subtree is processed recursively, the min_other and max_other are the same as the current function's output for the next phase. So, for the current phase, the range is determined based on the next phase's range.\n                # So, the function returns the min and max of the possible values that can reach this phase.\n                # Let me rephrase: the function get_winning_range(phase, depth) returns the minimum and maximum value that a team must have to be able to win the tournament starting from this phase. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe it returns the min and max that the team can have in order to be able to proceed through the remaining phases.\n                # Let's think recursively. For the last phase (phase == n-1), the team must be able to win that phase. If the rule is '1', the team must be higher than the opponent, which can be any value except itself. So the team can be any value from 1 to 2^n. But since the opponent is chosen to be lower, the team can be any value. Wait, no. For example, if the team is the lowest possible (1), then the opponent must be higher, but the rule says higher wins. So the team cannot win. Therefore, the initial approach is wrong.\n                # Oh right, this suggests that the previous reasoning is incorrect. Let's re-express the problem.\n                # The key insight is that for a team x to be the champion, it must be possible to arrange the other teams in such a way that x can win all matches according to the rules of each phase.\n                # So for each phase, we need to find the constraints on x's value based on the rules of that phase and the subsequent phases.\n                # Let's consider the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the team x must be able to win against the winner of another bracket. The winner of that other bracket can be any value that can be a winner of that subtree. So, for x to be able to win against that bracket's winner, it must satisfy the rule of the current phase.\n                # For example, if the current phase's rule is '1' (higher wins), then x must be higher than the other bracket's winner. Since the other bracket's winner can be any value that can be the winner of that subtree, we need to ensure that there exists some value y in the possible range of the other subtree's winner such that x > y. To guarantee that, x must be greater than the minimal possible value of the other subtree's winner. Because if the other subtree's winner can be as low as m, then x just needs to be greater than m.\n                # Similarly, if the current phase's rule is '0' (lower wins), then x must be less than the other subtree's winner. So x must be less than the maximum possible value of the other subtree's winner.\n                # Therefore, for each phase, the range of x is determined by the range of the other subtree's winner in the next phase.\n                # Let's define for each phase, the minimum and maximum values that x must be in order to proceed through the remaining phases. Let's call this function f(phase) which returns (min_val, max_val) for the current phase.\n                # Base case: phase = n-1 (last phase). Here, there are two teams. The rule is s[n-1]. For x to win, it must be either higher or lower than the other team. Since we can choose the other team to be anything except x, the possible x can be any value. But wait, no. For example, if the rule is '1', then x must be higher than the other team. So the other team can be any value less than x. So x can be any value from 2 to 2^n (since there must be at least one value less than x). However, if x is 1, then there's no value less than x, so x cannot win. Similarly, if the rule is '0', then x must be lower than the other team. So x can be any value from 1 to 2^n - 1.\n                # Therefore, for the base case:\n                # if s[phase] == '1', then the min_val is 2 and max_val is 2^n\n                # if s[phase] == '0', then the min_val is 1 and max_val is 2^n - 1\n                # Then, for earlier phases, we need to compute based on the next phase's min and max.\n                # For example, if the current phase is '1', then the team x must be able to beat the other bracket's winner. The other bracket's winner can be any value in [min_next, max_next]. So to ensure that x can beat some value in that range, x must be greater than min_next. Therefore, the current phase's min_val is min_next + 1, and max_val is 2^n.\n                # Wait, but if the other bracket's winner can be as low as min_next, then x must be greater than min_next. However, if the other bracket's winner can be as high as max_next, then x can be as high as 2^n. So the range for x is (min_next, 2^n].\n                # Similarly, if the current phase is '0', then x must be less than the other bracket's winner. The other bracket's winner can be as high as max_next, so x must be less than max_next. Therefore, the range for x is [1, max_next - 1].\n                # Therefore, the recursive formula is:\n                # if current phase rule is '1':\n                #   current_min = next_min + 1\n                #   current_max = 2^n\n                # if current phase rule is '0':\n                #   current_min = 1\n                #   current_max = next_max - 1\n                # But wait, how do we handle the next_min and next_max? Because the other bracket's winner is determined by the same function for the next phase. So for the current phase, we need to call the function for the next phase, and use its min and max.\n                # However, the other bracket is a separate subtree. So for the current phase, the other subtree's winner has the same possible range as the current team's possible range for the next phase. Therefore, we can compute the next phase's min and max, and use those to compute the current phase's min and max.\n                # Therefore, the function can be implemented recursively.\n                # Let's implement this with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n                # Let's create a memoization table for the function get_winning_range(phase), which returns (min, max) for that phase.\n                # Now, let's adjust the base case.

The other team can be any value except x. So to ensure that there's at least one value lower than x, x must be >= 2.\n                    return (2, 2**n)\n                else:\n                    # x must be lower than the other team.

This is based on the rules of the current phase and the ranges from subsequent phases.\n2. **Base Case Handling**: For the last phase, the minimum and maximum values are determined based on whether higher or lower skill wins, ensuring the team can have a valid opponent.\n3. **Propagating Constraints**: For each phase, the constraints from subsequent phases are used to determine the valid range of values for the current phase, ensuring the team can win according to the rules.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the valid skill levels for each team to be the champion by leveraging recursive constraints propagation through the tournament phases.",

Then, if the current rule is '1', the current team x must be larger than some value in [a, b]. To ensure that there exists at least one value in [a, b] that x can beat, x must be larger than the minimal value in that range (a). So the minimal x can be is a + 1, and the maximum is 2^n. But since the other subtree's winner can be as low as a, then x just needs to be larger than a. So the range for x would be (a, 2^n). Similarly, if the rule is '0', then x must be smaller than the maximum of the other subtree's winner's range (b), so x can be in [1, b).\n                # Therefore, for each phase, the range for x is determined based on the next phase's range.\n                # So, for the current phase, if the rule is '1', then x must be larger than the minimal value of the other subtree's range. The other subtree's range is determined by the same function for the next phase. Hence, the current range is (min_other, 2^n).\n                # Similarly, if the rule is '0', then x must be smaller than the maximum value of the other subtree's range. So the current range is (1, max_other).\n                # But how do we compute min_other and max_other? Well, the other subtree's range is the same as what the current function returns for the next phase. Because the other subtree is processed in the same way.\n                # Therefore, for the current phase, when the rule is '1', the current team must be larger than the min_other (which is the min of the next phase's range). Thus, the current range is (min_other, 2^n). Similarly for '0', the current range is (1, max_other).\n                # But since the other subtree is processed recursively, the min_other and max_other are the same as the current function's output for the next phase. So, for the current phase, the range is determined based on the next phase's range.\n                # So, the function returns the min and max of the possible values that can reach this phase.\n                # Let me rephrase: the function get_winning_range(phase, depth) returns the minimum and maximum value that a team must have to be able to win the tournament starting from this phase. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe it returns the min and max that the team can have in order to be able to proceed through the remaining phases.\n                # Let's think recursively. For the last phase (phase == n-1), the team must be able to win that phase. If the rule is '1', the team must be higher than the opponent, which can be any value except itself. So the team can be any value from 1 to 2^n. But since the opponent is chosen to be lower, the team can be any value. Wait, no. For example, if the team is the lowest possible (1), then the opponent must be higher, but the rule says higher wins. So the team cannot win. Therefore, the initial approach is wrong.\n                # Oh right, this suggests that the previous reasoning is incorrect. Let's re-express the problem.\n                # The key insight is that for a team x to be the champion, it must be possible to arrange the other teams in such a way that x can win all matches according to the rules of each phase.\n                # So for each phase, we need to find the constraints on x's value based on the rules of that phase and the subsequent phases.\n                # Let's consider the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the team x must be able to win against the winner of another bracket. The winner of that other bracket can be any value that can be a winner of that subtree. So, for x to be able to win against that bracket's winner, it must satisfy the rule of the current phase.\n                # For example, if the current phase's rule is '1' (higher wins), then x must be higher than the other bracket's winner. Since the other bracket's winner can be any value that can be the winner of that subtree, we need to ensure that there exists some value y in the possible range of the other subtree's winner such that x > y. To guarantee that, x must be greater than the minimal possible value of the other subtree's winner. Because if the other subtree's winner can be as low as m, then x just needs to be greater than m.\n                # Similarly, if the current phase's rule is '0' (lower wins), then x must be less than the other subtree's winner. So x must be less than the maximum possible value of the other subtree's winner.\n                # Therefore, for each phase, the range of x is determined by the range of the other subtree's winner in the next phase.\n                # Let's define for each phase, the minimum and maximum values that x must be in order to proceed through the remaining phases. Let's call this function f(phase) which returns (min_val, max_val) for the current phase.\n                # Base case: phase = n-1 (last phase). Here, there are two teams. The rule is s[n-1]. For x to win, it must be either higher or lower than the other team. Since we can choose the other team to be anything except x, the possible x can be any value. But wait, no. For example, if the rule is '1', then x must be higher than the other team. So the other team can be any value less than x. So x can be any value from 2 to 2^n (since there must be at least one value less than x). However, if x is 1, then there's no value less than x, so x cannot win. Similarly, if the rule is '0', then x must be lower than the other team. So x can be any value from 1 to 2^n - 1.\n                # Therefore, for the base case:\n                # if s[phase] == '1', then the min_val is 2 and max_val is 2^n\n                # if s[phase] == '0', then the min_val is 1 and max_val is 2^n - 1\n                # Then, for earlier phases, we need to compute based on the next phase's min and max.\n                # For example, if the current phase is '1', then the team x must be able to beat the other bracket's winner. The other bracket's winner can be any value in [min_next, max_next]. So to ensure that x can beat some value in that range, x must be greater than min_next. Therefore, the current phase's min_val is min_next + 1, and max_val is 2^n.\n                # Wait, but if the other bracket's winner can be as low as min_next, then x must be greater than min_next. However, if the other bracket's winner can be as high as max_next, then x can be as high as 2^n. So the range for x is (min_next, 2^n].\n                # Similarly, if the current phase is '0', then x must be less than the other bracket's winner. The other bracket's winner can be as high as max_next, so x must be less than max_next. Therefore, the range for x is [1, max_next - 1].\n                # Therefore, the recursive formula is:\n                # if current phase rule is '1':\n                #   current_min = next_min + 1\n                #   current_max = 2^n\n                # if current phase rule is '0':\n                #   current_min = 1\n                #   current_max = next_max - 1\n                # But wait, how do we handle the next_min and next_max? Because the other bracket's winner is determined by the same function for the next phase. So for the current phase, we need to call the function for the next phase, and use its min and max.\n                # However, the other bracket is a separate subtree. So for the current phase, the other subtree's winner has the same possible range as the current team's possible range for the next phase. Therefore, we can compute the next phase's min and max, and use those to compute the current phase's min and max.\n                # Therefore, the function can be implemented recursively.\n                # Let's implement this with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n                # Let's create a memoization table for the function get_winning_range(phase), which returns (min, max) for that phase.\n                # Now, let's adjust the base case. For the last phase (phase == n-1), the min and max are as follows:\n                if s[phase] == '1':\n                    # x must be higher than the other team. The other team can be any value except x. So to ensure that there's at least one value lower than x, x must be >= 2.\n                    return (2, 2**n)\n                else:\n                    # x must be lower than the other team.
