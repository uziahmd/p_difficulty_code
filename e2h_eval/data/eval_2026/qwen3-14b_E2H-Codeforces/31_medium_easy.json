Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The original cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x for the new cards. \n\nSo first, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero. So the sum of the new cards must be -S. \n\nThe question is, what's the minimum number of cards needed to reach that sum. Each card can contribute between -x and x. So, for example, if the required sum is -S, how can we get there with as few cards as possible?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the example given. In the first case, the sum is -1 +1 +2 = 2. So the required sum from new cards is -2. Since x is 2, we can use one card of -2. So answer is 1.\n\nIn the second example, sum is -2 + -2 = -4. So required sum is 4. x is 3. Each card can contribute up to 3. So two cards: 3 + 1 =4. But wait, but each card can be any number between -3 and 3. So the maximum per card is 3. So for sum 4, the minimal number of cards is 2 (3 +1, or 2+2, etc). So the answer is 2.\n\nSo the key is to find the minimal number of cards needed to reach a target sum, where each card can contribute between -x and x. But since the problem allows using any numbers in that range, the optimal way is to use as many as possible the maximum possible per card. \n\nSo the target is T = -sum. Let's say T is the sum we need to reach with the new cards. So how to find the minimal number of cards?\n\nLet me think: For each card, the maximum contribution is x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). But wait, because T could be positive or negative. But since we can choose any numbers, including negative ones, but we want to reach the sum. Wait, no. Because the sum of the new cards must be exactly T. So for example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards is ceiling(T / x). But if T is negative, then it's the same as ceiling( |T| / x ), since each card can contribute up to -x (so for example, if T is -5 and x is 3, then you need two cards: -3 and -2, which sum to -5. So the number of cards is ceil(5/3) = 2.)\n\nWait, but how? Let me think again. Let me take T as the absolute value. Because the minimal number of cards is determined by how much each card can contribute. So for example, if the required sum is T (positive or negative), then the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ). Because each card can contribute up to x towards the required sum. So for example, if T is 4, x is 3: 4/3 is 1.333, so ceil is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then zero cards are needed. But in that case, the original sum is already zero. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards. Let's call it current_sum.\n\n2. The target sum for new cards is target = -current_sum.\n\n3. If target is zero, then answer is 0.\n\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach target. Which is ceil( |target| / x ), but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, for example, if target is 5 and x is 3. Then 5 /3 is 1.666, ceil is 2. Which is correct. Because two cards: 3 + 2 =5. So yes.\n\nAnother example: target is 3 and x is 3. Then 3/3=1, so 1 card.\n\nIf target is 2 and x is 3. Then 2/3 is 0.666, ceil is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula is ceil( |target| / x )\n\nBut wait, what if target is 4 and x is 2? Then 4/2 is 2, which is correct. Two cards of 2 each.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is ceil( |target| / x ), but only if target is not zero. If target is zero, then zero cards.\n\nBut wait, what if target is 5 and x is 3. Then the minimal number is 2. But what if x is 2? Then 5/2 is 2.5, ceil is 3. Which would be 2+2+1=5. So three cards. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n- Compute current_sum.\n\n- Compute target = -current_sum.\n\n- If target is zero, return 0.\n\n- Else, compute the absolute value of target, divide by x, take the ceiling of that. That's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let's test the examples.\n\nFirst example: input is 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. The current sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. Target is -2. So absolute value is 2. Divided by x (2) is 1. So ceil(1) is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example: input is 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Current sum is -4. Target is 4. Absolute value is 4. Divided by x (3) is 4/3 = 1.333, ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: suppose current_sum is 0. Then target is zero. Answer is 0.\n\nAnother test case: current_sum is 5, x is 5. Target is -5. Absolute value is 5. Divided by 5 is 1. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: current_sum is 5, x is 4. Target is -5. Absolute value is 5. 5/4 is 1.25, ceil is 2. So two cards: 4 and 1 (but since the cards can be any number between -4 and 4, so 4 and 1, sum 5. So yes.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the numbers on the cards can be any integer between -x and x. So the sum can be achieved with two cards. So the formula works.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list of numbers.\n\nCompute current_sum = sum of list.\n\ntarget = -current_sum.\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_target = abs(target)\n\n    min_cards = ceil(abs_target / x)\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but how to compute ceil in Python?\n\nIn Python, we can compute ceil(a / b) as (a + b - 1) // b when a and b are positive.\n\nYes. For example, 5 /3 is 1.666, (5 +3 -1) //3 = 7//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo for abs_target and x, both positive, the minimal number of cards is (abs_target + x -1) // x.\n\nSo that's the formula.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list of numbers.\n\nsum_found = sum(list)\n\ntarget = -sum_found\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_target = abs(target)\n\n    min_cards = (abs_target + x -1) // x\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nBut wait, what if x is zero? No, the input constraints say x is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nLet's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2, numbers are -1,1,2. sum is 2. target is -2. abs_target is 2. (2 + 2-1) //2 = (3)//2 = 1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=2, x=3. numbers are -2,-2. sum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Then output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=5. (5 +5-1)/5 =9//5=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=4. (5 +4-1)/4 = 8//4=2. Correct.\n\nWhat if target is 0? For example, sum is 0. Then output is 0.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead input: first line is two integers n and x. Second line is n integers.\n\nIn Python, we can read the first line as input().split(), then process.\n\nBut note that the input may be given as a list of strings, like in the example given in the problem. Wait, the example shows that the input is given as two lines. For example, the first input is '3 2\\n-1 1 2'.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and x.\n\nThen read the second line as the list of numbers.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(nums)\ntarget = -sum_found\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_target = abs(target)\n    min_cards = (abs_target + x -1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but what if the sum is zero? For example, if the sum is zero, then target is zero, and output is 0. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2 → target is -2 → abs is 2. (2 +2-1) //2 =3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4 → target is 4. (4+3-1)/3 =6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1 and the number is 1. sum is 1. target is -1. abs is 1. (1 +1-1)/1 =1/1=1. So output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x is 2. target is -3. abs is 3. (3 +2-1)/2 =4/2=2. Which is correct (2 cards: 2 and 1).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the newly found ones) equals zero. The numbers on the cards can range from -x to x, where x is a given integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the current sum, as we need the total sum to be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum by x. This is efficiently computed using integer arithmetic as `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_found = sum(nums)\ntarget = -sum_found\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_target = abs(target)\n    min_cards = (abs_target + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value of a card), followed by a list of integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more is needed to reach a total sum of zero.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the current sum of the found cards.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, we determine the minimum number of cards required to achieve the target sum. This is done by considering the maximum possible contribution per card (which is `x`) and calculating how many such contributions are needed to reach the target sum, rounding up to ensure we meet or exceed the target.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of cards required using straightforward arithmetic operations, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
