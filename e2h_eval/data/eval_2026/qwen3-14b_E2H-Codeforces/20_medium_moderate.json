For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to compute the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the example given, a beautiful multiset is one where for every possible prefix s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix does not exceed c_s. And the maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. Our goal is to count all possible assignments of c_s values that make this maximum exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The key seems to be figuring out, for a given set of c_s values, what is the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. Then, we need to count all c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute that maximum? Let's think about the constraints. Each string in the multiset contributes to the counts of all its prefixes. For example, if a string is \"01\", then it contributes to the count of \"0\" (prefix of length 1) and \"01\" (prefix of length 2). So, for each string in the multiset, all its prefixes must have their counts not exceeding their respective c_s values.\n\nThe problem is similar to some kind of tree structure where each node represents a binary string, and each node has two children (appending 0 or 1). The root is the empty string? Or maybe not. Wait, the strings are of length from 1 to n. But the prefixes can be of any length up to n. For example, a string of length 3 has prefixes of length 1, 2, and 3.\n\nSo, the problem is about choosing c_s values such that when building a multiset, the constraints on all prefixes are satisfied. The maximum size of such a multiset depends on the c_s values. We need to find the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. This feels like a problem where the maximum is determined by the minimum constraints along the paths in the trie of binary strings.\n\nFor example, consider that each string in the multiset contributes 1 to all of its prefixes. So, the total number of strings in the multiset is limited by the constraints on all prefixes. However, the way to maximize the size would be to arrange the strings in a way that each string's prefixes are not over-constrained. So, perhaps the maximum size is the minimum over all possible constraints of the sum of capacities along certain paths?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a flow problem. Each string in the multiset can be thought of as contributing 1 to each of its prefixes. The constraints are that for each prefix s, the total number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. The maximum size of the multiset is then the maximum number of strings that can be placed without violating any of these constraints.\n\nThis sounds like a problem of finding the maximum number of strings that can be selected such that for each prefix s, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. How do we compute this maximum?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a trie structure where each node represents a binary string. Each node has two children (for appending 0 and 1). The root is the empty string, but since our strings are of length ≥1, maybe the root isn't considered here. Wait, but for a string of length m, all its prefixes are of lengths 1 to m. So, the trie structure includes all possible prefixes.\n\nNow, the problem is similar to selecting a set of strings (each of length exactly n) such that for each node (prefix) s, the number of selected strings that pass through s (i.e., have s as a prefix) is ≤ c_s. The maximum size of such a set is the maximum number of strings that can be chosen under these constraints.\n\nHow do we compute this maximum? It seems like this is equivalent to finding the minimum capacity of all possible paths from the root to leaves (but the root isn't part of the strings here). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nEach string in the multiset is a path of length n from the root (if we imagine the root as the empty string). Each node along that path (except the root) corresponds to a prefix of the string. For each node, the capacity c_s limits how many times that node can be passed through by the selected strings. But each string contributes exactly once to each node along its path.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to selecting as many strings (paths of length n) as possible such that for each node (prefix), the number of selected strings passing through it is ≤ c_s. The maximum number of such strings is the answer for the given c_s values.\n\nNow, how to compute this maximum? Let's think of it as a problem where each node's capacity is c_s. Each selected string is a path from the root to a leaf (depth n). Each node along the path must not have more than c_s strings passing through it.\n\nBut how do we model this? It seems like a flow problem where each node has a capacity, and each path (string) uses up one unit of capacity for each node along its path. However, the maximum number of such paths is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s multiplied by the number of paths that pass through it divided by something?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where each node can be considered as having a capacity. The maximum number of paths (strings) that can be selected is determined by the minimum capacity along all possible paths. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose we have a node s which is a prefix of many strings. For instance, the root (empty string) is a prefix of all strings. So, the capacity c_root would limit the maximum number of strings. If the root's capacity is 5, then the maximum number of strings is at most 5. However, other nodes may have lower capacities. For example, if a node s with capacity 3 is a prefix of all strings, then the maximum number of strings is at most 3. Thus, the maximum number of strings is the minimum over all nodes of (the capacity of the node multiplied by the number of possible strings that pass through it divided by ... ? No, perhaps it's more nuanced.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each node s, the number of strings that pass through s is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. But since each string is of length n, the number of strings that pass through s is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. Let me denote this as x_s. Then, for each node s, x_s ≤ c_s. Also, for a node s of length l, the number of strings that pass through s is equal to the sum of the number of strings that pass through each of its children (s0 and s1) because each such string must pass through s. So, for example, x_s = x_{s0} + x_{s1}.\n\nThis forms a recursive relation. The maximum possible x_root (the total number of strings in the multiset) is the maximum value such that for all nodes s, x_s ≤ c_s and x_s = x_{s0} + x_{s1} (if s is not a leaf node; for leaves, x_s is just the number of strings that end at that node, which can be zero or more, but since they are leaves, their children don't exist).\n\nWait, but the leaves are the nodes of length n. For those nodes, their x_s is the number of strings in the multiset that are exactly equal to s. Since each string in the multiset is of length n, each string corresponds to exactly one leaf node. Therefore, for all leaves, x_s can be any non-negative integer (but constrained by their parent nodes, etc.).\n\nBut the x_s for internal nodes (non-leaves) is the sum of their children's x_s. Because any string passing through the node s must pass through one of its children. Therefore, for each node s, x_s = sum of x_{children of s}.\n\nMoreover, for each node s, x_s must be ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum possible x_root (which is the total number of strings in the multiset) is determined by these constraints. How do we compute this maximum?\n\nThis looks like a problem where we need to assign x_s values to all nodes such that:\n\n- For each node s, x_s ≤ c_s.\n\n- For each node s that is not a leaf, x_s = x_{s0} + x_{s1}.\n\nAnd we want to maximize x_root.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. However, since the constraints are hierarchical, perhaps the maximum x_root is determined by the minimum of c_s multiplied by some factor based on the depth of the node.\n\nAlternatively, considering the constraints, for each node s, the maximum possible x_s is min(c_s, sum of the maximum x of its children). Wait, but since x_s must equal the sum of its children's x, then for the maximum x_root, we need to set the x_s for each node s to be as large as possible, but constrained by c_s and the sum of children.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think recursively. For a node s, the maximum possible x_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum x values of its children. However, since the children's x values are also constrained by their own c's and their children.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum x_root is determined by the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} ), but I'm not sure. Wait, for example, if a node s has length l, then the number of leaves under it is 2^{n - l}. So, the maximum x_s could be min(c_s, ... ). But perhaps the maximum x_root is determined by the minimal c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)} }, for all nodes s. Because, for each node s, the maximum number of strings that can pass through it is c_s multiplied by the number of leaves under it. Wait, no. Because if you have a node s, then each string that passes through s can be any of the 2^{n - len(s)} strings under it. But the constraint is that the number of strings passing through s is x_s ≤ c_s. But for the maximum x_root, we want x_s as large as possible, but for each node s, x_s is constrained by the sum of its children's x. So, perhaps for each node s, the maximum x_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum x of its children. However, this seems like a bottom-up approach.\n\nLet me think of the tree structure. Starting from the leaves (nodes of length n), each leaf has no children. So, for a leaf node s, x_s can be at most c_s. But since it's a leaf, there are no children, so x_s can be up to c_s. However, the x_s for its parent (which is a node of length n-1) must be equal to the sum of the x_s of its two children. So, for the parent node, x_parent = x_child0 + x_child1. But each of x_child0 and x_child1 can be up to their respective c values. So, the maximum x_parent is min(c_parent, x_child0_max + x_child1_max). But x_child0_max is min(c_child0, ... ) and similarly for child1. So, this suggests that we need to compute for each node the maximum possible x_s given the constraints of its children and its own c_s.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming approach where we process nodes in order of increasing depth (from leaves up to the root). For each node, the maximum x_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum x of its children.\n\nWait, but if the sum of children's x is less than c_s, then x_s can be set to that sum. Otherwise, it can be set to c_s. Because the x_s must equal the sum of its children's x. Therefore, for the maximum x_root, the value is determined by the following:\n\nFor each node s, compute the maximum x_s as min(c_s, sum_children_max_x). This would ensure that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nSo, the maximum x_root is determined by this process. Therefore, for a given set of c_s values, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is the value computed by this bottom-up approach.\n\nTherefore, our problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s values (each c_s is between 0 and k, inclusive) such that the maximum x_root computed by this process is exactly f.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this count efficiently, given that n can be up to 15, which means there are 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2 nodes. For n=15, this is 2^16 - 2 = 65534 nodes. However, with n=15, even processing all nodes may be feasible, but we need to find a way to model the constraints on the c_s values such that the maximum x_root is exactly f.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the problem as follows: For each node s, the value of x_s is determined by the c_s and the x values of its children. However, since the x_s for a node is min(c_s, sum_children_x), and the sum_children_x is determined by their own min(c_child, ... ), the entire structure depends on the c_s values.\n\nBut for the problem, we need to count the number of c_s assignments where the final x_root is exactly f. However, directly computing this for all possible c_s assignments is impossible due to the high number of possibilities. For example, for n=15, the number of nodes is 2^16 - 2 ≈ 65534, and each c_s can be up to k (up to 2e5), so the total possibilities are (k+1)^{65534}, which is way too big.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the maximum x_root is determined by the minimal value of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) for all nodes s. Wait, why?\n\nLet me think of the case where all c_s are set to infinity. Then, the maximum x_root would be 2^n (since there are 2^n possible strings of length n). However, if there's a node s with c_s = m, then the maximum number of strings that can pass through s is m. Since each string that passes through s contributes to the count of s. The number of strings passing through s is x_s, which is the same as the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. For a node s of length l, the number of possible strings that can pass through it is 2^{n-l} (each of the remaining n-l bits can be 0 or 1). So, the maximum x_s is min(c_s, 2^{n-l} * ... ? No, because for the entire tree, the maximum x_root is determined by the minimal value of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} ) for all nodes s. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake n=2. Suppose all c_s are set to 1. Then, the maximum x_root would be 1. Because for the root node (length 0?), but in our problem, the nodes are of length 1 to n. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the root node. Let me re-express the tree structure.\n\nEach node s is a binary string of length l (1 ≤ l ≤ n). For each such node, the children are s0 and s1 (appended 0 and 1). The leaves are the nodes of length n.\n\nIn this structure, the x_s for a node s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. For the root (if it existed), but in our case, the nodes start from length 1. So, perhaps the root is the empty string, but since our strings are of length ≥1, the root isn't considered. But for the purpose of the problem, the x_root (if we consider the empty string) would be the total number of strings in the multiset. However, in our problem, the maximum x_root is the total number of strings in the multiset, which is the value we want to be exactly f.\n\nBut how is this x_root determined? According to the earlier approach, for each node s, x_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of x of its children. So, for the root node (if we had it), but in our problem, the nodes start from length 1. Let me think of the nodes as starting from length 1. Let's take n=2. Then, the nodes are of length 1 (0, 1) and length 2 (00, 01, 10, 11).\n\nFor each node of length 2 (leaves), x_s can be up to c_s. For their parent (nodes of length 1), x_parent is the sum of the x of their two children. But each child's x is up to their own c. So, for example, for the node '0' (length 1), x_0 = x_00 + x_01. And each x_00 and x_01 can be up to c_00 and c_01 respectively. So, the maximum x_0 is min(c_0, x_00 + x_01). But since x_00 can be up to c_00, x_01 up to c_01, then the maximum x_0 is min(c_0, c_00 + c_01). Similarly for node '1'.\n\nThen, the root (if it existed) would be the sum of x_0 and x_1, which is min(c_root, x_0 + x_1). But in our problem, there is no root node. However, the total number of strings in the multiset is x_0 + x_1, because each string is of length 2 and has exactly one of the two roots (0 or 1) as its first character. Therefore, the maximum total number of strings is min( (x_0 + x_1), ... ), but in this case, since there's no constraint on the root, the maximum is simply x_0 + x_1, which is min(c_0, c_00 + c_01) + min(c_1, c_10 + c_11). Wait, no. Because x_0 is min(c_0, c_00 + c_01), and x_1 is min(c_1, c_10 + c_11). Then, the total number of strings is x_0 + x_1. However, there's no constraint on the root (the empty string) in our problem, so the total is x_0 + x_1.\n\nBut in this case, how is the maximum total determined? It seems that for each node, the x_s is min(c_s, sum of children x). So, the maximum total is determined by this bottom-up calculation.\n\nThis suggests that for the entire tree, the maximum x_root (total number of strings) is determined by propagating up the tree, for each node, the value min(c_s, sum of children's x).\n\nTherefore, for the problem, the value f is determined by this process. Now, we need to count the number of assignments of c_s values (each between 0 and k) such that this process results in exactly f.\n\nThe key insight here is that for the maximum total to be exactly f, the process must result in f. However, how can we model this?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider that for each node, the value of x_s is determined by the minimum between c_s and the sum of x of its children. Therefore, the x values form a hierarchy.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of constraints on the c_s values. For the maximum total to be exactly f, the process must yield f. So, during the bottom-up calculation, the x values must satisfy that the root's x (the total) is exactly f. However, the root in this context is the sum of the x values of the nodes of length 1. Wait, but how is that calculated?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where for each node, we track the possible values of x_s and how they relate to the constraints on c_s and their children.\n\nBut for n up to 15, the number of nodes is manageable. For example, n=15 gives 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^15 = 2*(2^15 - 1) = 65534 nodes. For each node, during the bottom-up process, the x_s depends on its children. However, the variables involved are the c_s for each node. How can we model the dependencies?\n\nAnother idea: For each node, the x_s is determined by the minimum of c_s and the sum of x of its children. However, the sum of x of its children is determined by their own c values and their children. This seems complex, but perhaps we can think of it in terms of constraints on the c_s values.\n\nLet me think of the process in reverse. Suppose we want the maximum total x_root to be exactly f. Then, for the root (in the sense of the sum of the x of the nodes of length 1), the sum must be exactly f. However, each of those nodes (length 1) has their own x values, which depend on their children (nodes of length 2), and so on.\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each node, the value of x_s is determined by the minimum between c_s and the sum of x of its children. Therefore, for a node s, x_s can be written as:\n\nx_s = min(c_s, sum_{child} x_{child})\n\nBut since the x_{child} are determined similarly by their own c values and their children, this creates a recursive dependency.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find all possible assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that when this process is applied, the final x_root (sum of x of the nodes of length 1) is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about the possible values of x_s for each node. For a leaf node (length n), x_s can be any value between 0 and c_s. However, since it's a leaf, its x_s is exactly the number of strings in the multiset that are equal to s. But since the x_s for its parent is the sum of the x of its two children, the x_s for the leaf is part of that sum.\n\nBut how can we model this? Perhaps we can model for each node s, the possible range of x_s and the constraints on c_s based on the x_s of its children.\n\nLet me consider that for a node s, the x_s is determined by the minimum between c_s and the sum of its children's x. Therefore, for the x_s to be fixed, we must have that:\n\nEither c_s >= sum_children_x, in which case x_s = sum_children_x.\n\nOr c_s < sum_children_x, in which case x_s = c_s.\n\nBut in either case, the sum_children_x must be >= x_s. However, the sum_children_x is determined by their own c values and their children.\n\nThis seems very abstract. Maybe we can think of the problem as follows: For the entire tree, the x values are determined by the c values. The maximum x_root is the value we want to be exactly f.\n\nTo count the number of c assignments that achieve this, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming for each node, keeping track of possible x values and the constraints on c_s.\n\nBut with n up to 15, and nodes up to 65534, this seems computationally challenging. However, perhaps there is a way to model this using memoization and recursion, considering that for each node, the x value depends on the x values of its children.\n\nLet me think recursively. For a node s, suppose that we know the possible x values for its children. Then, for the node s, the x_s is min(c_s, sum_children_x). But the c_s can be chosen in such a way that this is satisfied. However, since c_s must be between 0 and k, we can model the constraints for each node based on the sum_children_x.\n\nLet me think of this as follows: For a node s, the sum_children_x is a certain value S. Then, the x_s can be either S (if c_s >= S) or c_s (if c_s < S). However, since the x_s is determined by the c_s, we need to choose c_s in a way that allows this.\n\nBut how does this affect the rest of the tree?\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the value of x_s is determined by the minimum between c_s and the sum of children's x. Therefore, for the x_s to be fixed, the c_s must be at least x_s, and also, if c_s is larger than the sum of children's x, then x_s is the sum. Otherwise, it's c_s.\n\nWait, but the sum of children's x is determined by their own c values. This seems like a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of counting the valid c assignments, we can think of the x values as being fixed, and then determine the constraints on the c_s values.\n\nLet me think of the process as follows:\n\nOnce the x values are determined for all nodes, the c_s values must satisfy for each node s:\n\nx_s <= c_s.\n\nAdditionally, for each node s, x_s must be equal to min(c_s, sum_children_x). Which implies that:\n\nIf sum_children_x <= c_s, then x_s = sum_children_x.\n\nIf sum_children_x > c_s, then x_s = c_s.\n\nBut since x_s is determined by the process, this gives us constraints on the relationship between c_s and sum_children_x.\n\nLet me think of the x values as fixed. For each node s, we can derive constraints on c_s based on the x_s and sum_children_x.\n\nLet me denote for each node s, the sum_children_x as S_s. Then:\n\nCase 1: x_s = S_s. This implies that c_s >= S_s.\n\nCase 2: x_s = c_s. This implies that c_s < S_s.\n\nSo for each node s, given x_s and S_s, we can derive the constraints on c_s.\n\nBut how do we find the x values and S_s values?\n\nWell, the x values are determined by the process, but this seems circular. However, if we fix the x values, then we can derive the constraints on the c_s values.\n\nBut how do we find all possible x value configurations that lead to the maximum total being exactly f?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible x values and how they propagate upwards.\n\nLet me think of the tree as a hierarchy of nodes, processed from the leaves up. For each node, we can compute the possible x values based on the x values of its children.\n\nLet me define for a node s:\n\nIf s is a leaf (length n), then S_s is 0 (no children). Therefore, x_s can be anything between 0 and c_s. But since x_s is determined by the process, which requires that x_s is min(c_s, S_s) = min(c_s, 0) = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Because for a leaf node, there are no children, so sum_children_x is 0. So according to the earlier formula, x_s = min(c_s, 0) = 0. But that's not correct. Because for a leaf node, x_s is the number of strings in the multiset that are exactly s. However, according to the earlier logic, the x_s for a node is the sum of its children's x. But for a leaf node, there are no children, so sum_children_x is zero. Hence, x_s would be min(c_s, 0), which is zero. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAh, here's a mistake in my previous reasoning. For a leaf node (length n), there are no children. So, the x_s for a leaf node is not determined by the sum of its children's x, but rather, it is the number of strings in the multiset that are exactly s. But according to the earlier logic, the x_s for a node is the sum of its children's x. However, for a leaf node, there are no children, so this would imply x_s = 0. But this is incorrect. \n\nWhat's wrong here? Let's go back to the initial analysis. The x_s for a node s is the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. For a leaf node (length n), the only strings that have s as a prefix are those that are exactly s. Hence, x_s can be any value between 0 and c_s. However, according to the earlier formula, x_s = sum of children's x. But for a leaf node, there are no children, so this formula would give x_s = 0, which contradicts the actual possibility of x_s being up to c_s.\n\nThis suggests that my earlier model was incorrect. Where is the error?\n\nLet me re-express the relationship between x_s and its children. For a node s that is not a leaf, x_s is the sum of the x of its children. This is because any string that has s as a prefix must have one of its children (s0 or s1) as a prefix. Hence, the count of strings with s as a prefix is the sum of those with s0 and s1 as prefixes. However, for a leaf node s (length n), there are no children. Hence, the number of strings with s as a prefix is the number of strings that are exactly s. Therefore, for a leaf node, x_s can be any value between 0 and c_s, but it is not determined by the sum of children's x. Hence, the earlier model was wrong for leaf nodes.\n\nThis changes things. So, the correct model is:\n\nFor each node s:\n\nIf s is not a leaf (i.e., length < n), then x_s = x_{s0} + x_{s1}.\n\nIf s is a leaf (length = n), then x_s can be any value between 0 and c_s.\n\nBut then, how do we determine x_s for non-leaf nodes? For non-leaf nodes, x_s is the sum of their children's x. However, the children's x values are constrained by their own c values.\n\nBut for the non-leaf nodes, their x_s is determined by their children's x, which are themselves constrained by their own c values. However, for non-leaf nodes, there's no constraint that x_s must be <= c_s. Wait, no! Earlier, I thought that for each node s, x_s must be <= c_s. But according to the problem statement, the beautiful multiset must satisfy that for every string s (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s. Hence, for every node s, x_s <= c_s. \n\nAh! So for every node s (including non-leaf nodes), x_s must be <= c_s. And for non-leaf nodes, x_s is equal to the sum of their children's x. Therefore, the sum of children's x must be <= c_s. Hence, for non-leaf nodes, we have:\n\nx_s = sum_children_x, and sum_children_x <= c_s.\n\nFor leaf nodes, x_s can be any value between 0 and c_s.\n\nThis changes the model completely. Now, for non-leaf nodes, the sum of children's x must be <= c_s. And for leaf nodes, x_s <= c_s.\n\nThus, the maximum x_root (the total number of strings in the multiset) is the sum of the x values of the root nodes (nodes of length 1). But for each node of length 1, its x value is the sum of its children's x (nodes of length 2), which must be <= c_s. And so on.\n\nNow, the problem becomes: assign c_s values for all nodes (with 1 ≤ len(s) ≤ n) such that for each node s:\n\n- if s is not a leaf: sum of x of children of s <= c_s.\n\n- if s is a leaf: x_s <= c_s.\n\nAnd for the leaf nodes, x_s can be any value between 0 and c_s, but the sum for their parent must be <= c_parent.\n\nBut how do we determine the x values for the nodes?\n\nThe maximum possible x_root (the total number of strings) is achieved when we maximize the x values under these constraints. How?\n\nFor each non-leaf node s, the x_s is the sum of its children's x. And for the leaf nodes, x_s can be as large as possible, up to c_s. However, to maximize the total, we would want to set x_s for each node to be as large as possible, given the constraints.\n\nFor example, for a leaf node s, we can set x_s to c_s (to maximize it). Then, for its parent node, the sum of its two children's x is 2*c_leaf (assuming both children are leaves), and this sum must be <= c_parent. To maximize the parent's x_s, we would set it to this sum, provided that it is <= c_parent. If it's larger, then we have to set it to c_parent. But how does this propagate up?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each node, we can choose the x values in a way that maximizes the total, under the constraints. This maximum is what we need to be exactly f.\n\nSo, the maximum x_root is determined by the following process:\n\nFor each node, starting from the leaves and moving up:\n\n- For a leaf node s, x_s = min(c_s, ...). But since it's a leaf, there are no children, so x_s can be set to c_s (since it's allowed to be up to c_s). But wait, for a leaf node, the x_s is not constrained by any sum of children. It can be anything up to c_s. So, to maximize the total, we would set x_s = c_s for all leaf nodes. Then, for their parents, the sum of children's x is 2*c_leaf (if both children are leaves), and this must be <= c_parent. If yes, then x_parent is this sum. If not, then x_parent is c_parent. And so on up to the root.\n\nThus, the maximum x_root is determined by this process. Therefore, for a given assignment of c_s values, the maximum x_root is computed as follows:\n\nStart with leaf nodes, set x_s = c_s.\n\nFor each non-leaf node s (processed in order of increasing length), set x_s = min(c_s, sum of x of children).\n\nThis way, we ensure that for each non-leaf node, x_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of its children's x, which are already computed. And for leaf nodes, x_s is set to c_s.\n\nThis seems to be the correct approach. So, the maximum x_root for a given set of c_s values is computed by this bottom-up process.\n\nNow, the problem is to count the number of c_s assignments (each c_s between 0 and k) such that this process results in exactly f.\n\nNow, how can we model this?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, we can compute the possible contribution to the maximum x_root, based on the c_s values of that node and its children.\n\nBut for the entire tree, the process is deterministic once the c_s values are chosen. So, we need to count the number of c_s assignments where this process yields exactly f.\n\nBut with n up to 15 and the number of nodes being 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^15 = 2^(16) - 2 = 65534, it's impractical to iterate through all possible assignments.\n\nWe need a smarter way. Let's think about the process again. For each node s, the value of x_s is determined as follows:\n\n- If s is a leaf: x_s = c_s.\n\n- Else: x_s = min(c_s, x_left + x_right), where x_left and x_right are the x values of the left and right children.\n\nThe maximum x_root is the sum of x values of the root nodes (those of length 1).\n\nNow, the question is: how can we model the possible values of x_s for each node based on their children and their c_s values?\n\nLet me think of this as a dynamic programming problem. For each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s values such that the x_s for that node is a certain value, and the x_s for its children are also properly computed.\n\nHowever, since the nodes are processed in a bottom-up manner, we can build this up recursively. Let's consider that for a node s, once we have processed its children, we can determine the number of ways to choose c_s such that the x_s for this node is a certain value, given the x values of its",
