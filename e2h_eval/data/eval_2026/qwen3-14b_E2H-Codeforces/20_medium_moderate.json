For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem seems a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to compute the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. For every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. The multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n. The maximum size of such a multiset is exactly f, and we need to count the number of c configurations that make this true.\n\nWait, but the question is about choosing the c_s values such that when you choose them, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, for each possible way of choosing the c_s's, we need to check if the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f, and count how many such c configurations exist.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think. The maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints imposed by the c_s's. For example, if all c_s are large enough, then the maximum possible size would be 2^n (since there are 2^n possible strings of length n). But when the c_s's are constrained, this maximum could be lower.\n\nBut how to find for a given set of c_s's, what is the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset?\n\nThis feels like a problem where we need to model the constraints as a tree or hierarchy. Because each string s of length m is a prefix of longer strings. So, for example, if a string s of length m is a prefix of some longer string t of length m+1, then the count for s affects the counts of its children.\n\nThis reminds me of the problem where you have to assign capacities to nodes in a trie, such that the maximum number of leaves you can select without exceeding the capacities of all prefixes. The maximum size would be the minimum over certain constraints, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a trie where each node represents a binary string. Each node has a capacity c_s. The multiset of length-n strings corresponds to selecting some leaves (each leaf is a string of length n) such that for every node in the trie (which represents a prefix), the number of leaves in its subtree does not exceed c_s.\n\nThen, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the maximum number of leaves we can select under these constraints. And we need the maximum to be exactly f.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of capacity assignments (each c_s is between 0 and k) such that the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected without violating the capacities of all prefixes is exactly f.\n\nNow, how do we compute for a given set of capacities, what is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming on the trie structure. But since n is up to 15, the total number of nodes is O(2^n) which for n=15 is 32767, which is manageable.\n\nBut how do we model the capacities and compute the maximum number of leaves?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves. Or maybe not. Let's think.\n\nSuppose we have a trie where each node has a capacity. For each node, the number of leaves in its subtree cannot exceed the capacity of that node. However, the capacity of the parent node also restricts the sum of capacities of its children. Wait, no. Because the capacity of a node s (say, of length m) limits how many times s can be a prefix. For example, if s is a prefix of t (a longer string), then each occurrence of t in the multiset contributes to the count of s. Therefore, the total number of leaves in the subtree of s (i.e., all leaves that start with s) cannot exceed c_s.\n\nSo, for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is at most c_s. Therefore, the problem becomes: assign capacities to each node (each node's capacity is between 0 and k), and find the maximum number of leaves that can be selected such that for every node, the number of leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum for a given set of capacities?\n\nThis sounds like a problem where the maximum number of leaves is the minimum of the capacities of all nodes along some path. But perhaps not. Alternatively, it's similar to the problem of finding the maximum flow in a tree where each node has a capacity, and the flow through a node is limited by its capacity.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between the capacity of the node and the sum of the maximum leaves from its children. Wait, no. Because if a node has two children, each can contribute up to their own capacity. But the node's capacity may limit the total. So, for example, if a node has capacity c, and each child can contribute up to their own maximum, then the maximum for the node is min(c, sum of children's maxima). Wait, no. Because the node's capacity is the maximum number of leaves in its subtree. For example, if the node's capacity is 3, and the sum of the children's maxima is 5, then the maximum for this node is 3. But if the sum is 2, then it's 2.\n\nSo, for each node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between the capacity of the node and the sum of the maximum leaves from its children. But since the children's maxima are determined by their own capacities and their children, this seems like a dynamic programming approach.\n\nSo, for the root (the empty string?), but wait, the root here would be the empty string, but in our problem, the nodes are all binary strings of lengths 1 to n. Wait, the root node is the empty string (length 0), but in our problem, the capacities are for strings of lengths 1 to n. However, the root's capacity isn't considered here. Wait, no. The problem says that for every string s of length from 1 to n, the count of prefixes is considered. So, the root (empty string) is not part of the constraints here. Wait, no. Because for any string of length n, it has prefixes of length 1, 2, ..., n. The empty string is a prefix of all strings, but according to the problem statement, the constraints are only for s of length from 1 to n. So, the empty string's capacity isn't considered here. Therefore, the root (empty string) isn't part of the problem's constraints.\n\nWait, the problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be <= c_s. So, for example, the empty string is not considered here. So the constraints are only for non-empty strings.\n\nBut the root (empty string) is the ancestor of all strings. However, the problem doesn't have a c_s for the empty string. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) is constrained by the capacities of all the prefixes of each leaf.\n\nSo, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is determined by the constraints on the capacities of all prefixes. So, for each leaf (string of length n), the count of leaves in the multiset that have it as their prefix (i.e., the leaf itself) is 1 per occurrence. But the constraints are that for each prefix s of the leaf, the number of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nSo, the problem of finding the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset for given c_s's is equivalent to finding the maximum number of leaves that can be selected such that for every node (prefix) s, the number of leaves in the subtree of s is <= c_s. And the maximum number is the largest possible such count.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with the trie structure, and the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints on each node's capacity.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum for a given set of capacities?\n\nThe approach is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves under constraints on the number of leaves in each subtree. For each node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, sum of the maximum leaves of its children). This is because the node's capacity limits the total number of leaves in its subtree. However, the sum of the children's maximum leaves gives the maximum possible if the node's capacity was unlimited. Therefore, the actual maximum for the node is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the children's maxima.\n\nWait, but how does this work? Let's think recursively. For a node that is a leaf (i.e., a string of length n), it has no children. The maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1 (if allowed by c_s). But wait, for a node of length n, the subtree is just itself. So the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1 if allowed by c_s. But for a node of length less than n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the sum of the maxima of its children, but capped by c_s.\n\nSo, for example, consider a node s of length m < n. Its two children are s0 and s1 (appending 0 and 1). The maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min(c_s, left_max + right_max), where left_max is the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s0, and right_max is the same for s1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of leaves for the entire trie (rooted at the empty string, but the root's capacity is not considered) is the sum of the maxima of the root's children (but the root's capacity isn't part of the problem). Wait, but the root here is not part of the constraints. So the root's children are the strings of length 1. Then, the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the maxima of the root's children (each of which is a string of length 1), but each of those maxima is min(c_s, sum of their children's maxima, etc.)\n\nSo, for the entire problem, the maximum number of leaves is computed as follows:\n\nStart from the leaves (strings of length n), each of which contributes 1 if c_s >= 1. Then, for each node moving up the trie (from depth n-1 to 1), compute the maximum number of leaves in their subtree as min(c_s, sum of children's maxima).\n\nBut how do we compute this for all nodes?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming approach where we process the nodes in order of decreasing depth. For each node, we compute the value as min(c_s, sum of children's values). For leaves (depth n), the value is min(c_s, 1), since they can contribute at most one leaf (themselves) if allowed by their capacity.\n\nWait, but for a node of length n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0. Because the subtree of a node of length n is just itself. So for that node, the maximum is min(c_s, 1).\n\nYes. So the algorithm to compute the maximum number of leaves for a given set of c_s's is:\n\nFor each node in the trie (binary strings of length from 1 to n), compute the value as follows:\n\nIf the node is a leaf (length n), then val = min(c_s, 1).\n\nElse, val = min(c_s, sum of vals of children).\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the sum of the vals of the root's children (the nodes of length 1), but wait, the root here is the empty string, which is not considered. So the root's children are the nodes of length 1. The maximum number of leaves is the sum of the vals of those nodes.\n\nWait, no. Because the root's children are the nodes of length 1. The maximum number of leaves is the sum of the values of the root's children, which is the sum of the values of the nodes of length 1. But each of those nodes' values is min(c_s, sum of their children's values). Which recursively includes all the constraints.\n\nSo, for example, for the root's children (nodes of length 1), their values are computed as min(c_s, sum of their children's values). The sum of those values is the total number of leaves that can be selected.\n\nSo, the maximum size is the sum of the values of the root's children (nodes of length 1).\n\nSo, given this, the problem reduces to:\n\nWe need to count the number of assignments of c_s (for all binary strings s of length 1 to n, 0 ≤ c_s ≤k) such that when we compute the above DP values, the sum of the root's children's values is exactly f.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that for n up to 15, the number of nodes is O(2^n), which for n=15 is 32767. But even that seems manageable with some DP approach.\n\nBut the challenge is to compute the number of assignments of c_s's such that the computed maximum size is exactly f.\n\nBut considering that for each node, the value depends on the c_s of that node and the values of its children. So, for each node, we can model the possible contributions based on the choices of c_s and the possible values from the children.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming on the trie, processing nodes in order of increasing depth (or decreasing depth, depending on how we model the dependencies). Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the nodes as being ordered in layers. The leaves are at depth n. Then, their parents are at depth n-1, and so on up to depth 1.\n\nFor each node, the value depends on its children's values. Therefore, we can process the nodes in order from depth n down to 1. For each node, we can compute the possible range of values that can be achieved given the constraints of c_s and the children's values.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me consider for a node u of depth d (d ranges from 1 to n). For each node u, we can model the possible values that can be assigned to it, based on the possible values of its children. However, since the value of u is min(c_u, sum_children_values), and c_u can vary from 0 to k, we need to find for each possible sum_children, what are the possible values that u can contribute, and how that depends on c_u.\n\nBut perhaps for each node, we can model the number of ways to assign c_u and the children's values such that the value of the node is a certain value.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the overall sum of the root's children's values is exactly f. So, the idea is to build a DP table where for each node, we track the possible values that the node can contribute, considering the constraints of c_s and the children.\n\nLet me think recursively. For a leaf node (depth n), the value is min(c_u, 1). Since c_u can be between 0 and k, the possible values are 0 or 1. For each leaf node, the number of ways to choose c_u such that the value is v is:\n\nif v=0: c_u can be 0 (only one option)\nif v=1: c_u can be 1 to k (so k options)\n\nBut for each leaf node, the contribution to the DP is the number of ways to choose c_u such that the value is v.\n\nFor non-leaf nodes (depth <n), their value is min(c_u, sum_children_values). Let's denote sum_children_values as S. Then, the value of the node is min(c_u, S). The possible choices of c_u can be from 0 to k. So, for each possible S, the value of the node can be any value between 0 and min(S, k). However, the choice of c_u determines the value.\n\nBut how do we model this for the DP?\n\nLet me think of each node as having a DP state that tracks the number of ways to assign c_s values to all descendants (including itself) such that the value of the node is a certain value.\n\nFor example, for a node u, the DP[u][v] represents the number of ways to assign c_s values to all nodes in the subtree rooted at u such that the value of u is v.\n\nThen, for the leaves, DP[u][0] = 1 (choosing c_u=0), and DP[u][1] = k (choosing c_u >=1).\n\nFor non-leaf nodes, which have two children (left and right), we can combine their DP states. Let me think.\n\nFor a node u with children left and right. The sum of the children's values is S = left_val + right_val. The value of u is min(c_u, S). Now, the possible values of u can be any value between 0 and min(S, k). However, for each possible S, the value of u is determined by the choice of c_u.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think. For each possible pair of left_val and right_val, we can compute S = left_val + right_val. Then, for the node u, the value can be any v such that v ≤ S and v ≤ k, and v is chosen by setting c_u ≥ v (but also, if c_u is larger than S, then the value is S). Wait, no: the value of u is min(c_u, S). So for a given S, the possible values of u are:\n\nif c_u ≥ S → value is S.\n\nif c_u < S → value is c_u.\n\nSo, for a given S, the possible values of u are from 0 to min(S, k). For each possible value v, the number of ways to choose c_u is:\n\nif v < S: then c_u can be exactly v. So 1 way (if v is between 0 and k). But wait, if v is less than S, then any c_u ≥v and < S would result in the value being v. Wait, no. If c_u is exactly v, then min(c_u, S) is v. But if c_u is higher than v but less than S, then min(c_u, S) is c_u, which would be higher than v. So to get exactly v, c_u must be exactly v. Because if c_u is larger than v, then the value would be larger than v. Unless S is smaller than c_u.\n\nWait, I'm confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe value of u is min(c_u, S). So, for a given S, the value of u is determined by c_u. So for any c_u in [0, k], the value is:\n\nif c_u ≤ S → value is c_u.\n\nif c_u > S → value is S.\n\nSo, for a given S, the possible values of u are:\n\n- All integers from 0 to min(S, k).\n\nBut how many ways are there to choose c_u such that the value is v?\n\nCase 1: v ≤ S and v ≤k. Then, the value is v if and only if c_u is exactly v. Because if c_u is v, then min(v, S) is v. If c_u is larger than v but ≤ S, then min(c_u, S) is c_u, which is larger than v. So to get exactly v, c_u must be exactly v. However, if v is larger than S, then it's impossible. Also, if S is less than k, then for c_u ≥ S, the value is S. So for the case where v = S, the number of ways is (k - S + 1) (since c_u can be from S to k). For other v < S, the number of ways is 1 (c_u =v). For v > S, it's zero.\n\nWait, this is important. So for a given S, the number of ways to get a value v is:\n\nif v < S and v ≤k: 1 way (choose c_u =v).\n\nif v = S and S ≤k: (k - S + 1) ways (c_u can be from S to k).\n\nif v > S: 0 ways.\n\nBut also, if S >k, then for v =k, the number of ways is (k - S +1) if S ≤k? No, wait. Let me rephrase.\n\nLet me suppose S is fixed. Then, for the value of u, which is min(c_u, S):\n\n- If c_u is in [0, S], then the value is c_u. So, for any v in [0, S], the number of ways to get v is 1 (choose c_u =v) except for when v =S, where the number of ways is (k - S +1) if S ≤k. Wait no, no. If S is fixed, and we want to get value v, then:\n\nIf v is in [0, S], then:\n\n- If v < S: then c_u must be exactly v. So 1 way (as long as v ≤k).\n\n- If v = S: then c_u can be any value between S and k. So (k - S +1) ways, provided that S ≤k. Otherwise, if S >k, then v=S can't be achieved, because c_u can't be larger than k.\n\nWait, but if S is larger than k, then the value of u is min(c_u, S) = c_u, since c_u can't exceed k. So in this case, for v =k, the number of ways is 1 (choose c_u =k), and for any v <k, it's 1 way if v is chosen as c_u. However, for v >k, it's zero.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's formalize.\n\nFor a given S and possible value v of u:\n\nThe number of valid c_u choices is:\n\nif v <= min(S, k):\n\n   if v < S:\n\n      if v <=k: 1 way (c_u =v)\n\n      else: 0\n\n   else (v == S):\n\n      if S <=k: (k - S +1) ways (c_u can be from S to k)\n\n      else: 0\n\nelse:\n\n   0\n\nBut S can be anything, and v can be from 0 to k.\n\nBut how do we use this in our DP?\n\nSo, for a node u with children left and right. We can compute the possible sum S of their values, and then for each possible S, compute the possible ways to choose c_u and the children's values.\n\nBut since the children's values can vary, we need to combine their possibilities.\n\nLet me think of the DP for a node u. For each possible value v that u can contribute, we want to count the number of ways to assign c_s's to the subtree of u such that u's value is v.\n\nFor a leaf node u (depth n), this is straightforward:\n\nDP[u][0] = 1 (c_u =0)\n\nDP[u][1] = k (c_u >=1, which is k options)\n\nBut for non-leaf nodes, which have two children (left and right), we need to compute for each possible value of left and right, the sum S = left_val + right_val. Then, for each possible S, compute the ways to choose c_u such that the value of u is v, and multiply by the number of ways for left and right to have their respective values.\n\nThis suggests that for each node u, we need to compute a DP table where for each possible value v, we accumulate the number of ways.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet me think of the children's DP tables. For each possible value of left (l) and right (r), the sum S = l + r. Then, for the current node u, the possible values are determined by S and the choice of c_u. For each possible (l, r), we can compute the contribution to the DP of u.\n\nBut the problem is that for each node, the number of possible values is up to k (which can be up to 2e5). However, since n is small (up to 15), the number of nodes is 2^15 - 1 = 32767. But if for each node, we have a DP table of size up to 2e5, this would be O(32767 * 2e5) = around 6e9 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThis is a problem. How can we optimize this?\n\nWait, but for each node u, the maximum possible value that can be contributed is the sum of the maximum possible values of its children. However, the sum of the children's values is S, which for a node at depth d, can be up to 2^{n-d} (since each level doubles the number of nodes). But for n=15, the maximum possible S for the root's children (depth 1) is 2^{n-1} = 32768. But for deeper nodes, the maximum S is smaller.\n\nWait, for example, for a node at depth d, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n -d} (if all capacities are set to allow that). So, for a node at depth d, the possible S (sum of children's values) can be up to 2^{n -d}.\n\nBut for n=15, 2^{n -d} for d=1 is 32768. So for the root's children, the maximum S is 32768. But for nodes deeper in the tree, the maximum S is smaller.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum possible value of S for any node is 2^{n -d}, which for d=1 is 2^{n-1} = 32768. However, for each node, the value of S can be up to that. So, for each node, the possible S is up to 2^{n -d}.\n\nBut since n is up to 15, 2^{n} is 32768. So, for each node, the maximum S is up to 32768. So, for each node, the DP for that node can be represented as a list of size up to 32768, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for the root's children (depth 1), the maximum possible value of S is 2^{n-1} (for example, when all capacities are set to maximum). So, for each node, the possible sum S can be up to 2^{n -d}, which is 2^{n -d}.\n\nThus, for each node, the maximum S is 2^{n -d}. For n=15, this is up to 32768. So, for each node, the possible S is up to 32768, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, for each node, we can compute a DP table where for each possible value v (up to k), we track the number of ways. However, since the value of the node is min(c_u, S), and S can be up to 32768, but k can be up to 2e5, perhaps we can find a way to compute the possible contributions.\n\nBut let's proceed with the approach. For each node u, we can compute a DP table that maps possible values v (for u's value) to the number of ways to assign c_s's in the subtree of u such that u's value is v.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor a node u:\n\nIf u is a leaf (depth n):\n\n   For v in 0..k:\n\n      if v == 0: ways = 1 (if c_u is 0)\n\n      elif v == 1: ways = k (if c_u is between 1 and k)\n\n      else: 0\n\n   But since for a leaf, the value can only be 0 or 1, the DP[u][v] is 1 if v=0, k if v=1, else 0.\n\nWait, but the value of the leaf is min(c_u, 1). So for any c_u >=1, the value is 1. So the number of ways to get value 1 is the number of c_u >=1, which is k (since c_u ranges from 0 to k, inclusive). So for the leaf node, the DP is:\n\ndp_leaf[v] = 1 if v ==0 (c_u=0), else k if v ==1 (c_u >=1), else 0.\n\nNow, for non-leaf nodes:\n\nEach node u has two children, left and right. For each possible value l of the left child and r of the right child, we compute S = l + r. Then, for the node u, the value v can be determined based on S and c_u.\n\nBut for each possible (l, r), we need to calculate the contribution to the DP of u. However, since the number of possible (l, r) pairs is O((max_l) * (max_r)), which for non-leaf nodes could be up to (2^{n -d})^2, but since n is small (up to 15), this might be manageable.\n\nBut for each node, we need to combine the DP of its children. Let's think of it as follows:\n\nFor node u, the DP[u][v] is the sum over all possible l and r (values of left and right children) of (ways_left[l] * ways_right[r]) multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_u such that min(c_u, l + r) = v.\n\nSo, for each possible l and r, compute S = l + r. Then, for this S, compute the number of ways to get a value v for u, and multiply by ways_left[l] * ways_right[r], and accumulate this into DP[u][v].\n\nBut how do we compute for a given S, the number of ways to choose c_u such that min(c_u, S) = v?\n\nAs discussed earlier, for a given S and v:\n\nif v > S: 0\n\nelif v == S:\n\n   if S <=k: (k - S +1) ways\n\n   else: 0\n\nelse (v < S):\n\n   if v <=k: 1 way\n\n   else: 0\n\nBut since S can be up to 2^{n -d} (for node u at depth d), and k can be up to 2e5, but for each S and v, this calculation is manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess all nodes in order of increasing depth (starting from leaves and moving up to the root's children).\n\n- For each node, compute its DP table based on the DP tables of its children.\n\nOnce we have the DP table for the root's children (nodes of depth 1), the answer is the number of ways where the sum of their values equals f.\n\nWait, no. The sum of the values of the root's children (nodes of depth 1) is the maximum size of the beautiful multiset. So, the answer is the number of ways where the sum of the values of the root's children is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute that sum?\n\nWait, the root's children are the nodes of depth 1 (each of which is a single character, 0 or 1). Each of these nodes has a value (say, v_0 and v_1). The maximum size of the beautiful multiset is v_0 + v_1.\n\nSo, the DP for the root's children (the two nodes of depth 1) would have their combined DP as the sum of their individual values.\n\nBut how do we combine them?\n\nActually, the root's children are the two nodes of depth 1 (assuming n ≥1). The maximum size is the sum of their values. So, the final answer is the number of ways where the sum of the values of the root's children equals f.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet me think. The root's children are the two nodes (0 and 1) of depth 1. Each of these nodes has their own DP tables. So, for the root's children, the total maximum size is the sum of the values of these two nodes. Therefore, the answer is the number of ways to assign c_s's to all nodes such that the sum of the values of the two root children is exactly f.\n\nSo, the DP for the root's children (the two nodes) would be the convolution of their individual DP tables. For example, if node A (depth 1, '0') has DP_A[v] ways to have value v, and node B (depth 1, '1') has DP_B[w] ways to have value w, then the total number of ways for the sum v + w = f is the sum over all v and w where v + w =f of DP_A[v] * DP_B[w].\n\nTherefore, once we compute the DP tables for the two root children, we can compute the answer by calculating the convolution of their DP tables at position f.\n\nBut how do we compute the DP tables for the root's children?\n\nThis suggests that the overall approach is:\n\n- Build the trie structure for all binary strings of length 1 to n.\n\n- For each node, compute its DP table as described.\n\n- Finally, compute the convolution of the DP tables of the two root children (depth 1 nodes) and find the count for sum f.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nNow, the main steps are:\n\n1. Generate all nodes in order of increasing depth (so that when processing a node, its children have already been processed).\n\nBut since the nodes are in a trie, each node has two children (except for leaves). For example, for a node of depth d, its children are of depth d+1.\n\nSo, the nodes can be processed in order of decreasing depth. Starting from depth n (leaves), then depth n-1, and so on up to depth 1.\n\nFor each node, we process it after its children.\n\nSo, the first step is to generate all the nodes in this order.\n\nNow, for n up to 15, the total number of nodes is 2^1 - 1 + 2^2 -1 + ... + 2^n -1? No, no. Wait, the nodes are all binary strings of length from 1 to n. The total number is sum_{d=1}^n 2^d} = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, this is 2^16 - 2 = 65534, which is manageable.\n\nBut generating all these nodes and their children is feasible.\n\nBut how to represent them? Perhaps using a trie structure, where each node is represented by its string, or by its depth and a binary identifier. But for n up to 15, we can represent each node by its depth and a binary number (like, for depth d, the binary number can be from 0 to 2^d -1, but that's perhaps not necessary).\n\nAlternatively, for each node, we can represent it by its binary string. But for n=15, storing all these strings is possible.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can generate all nodes recursively, and for each node, store its left and right children.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, we can generate its left and right children as follows: for a node represented by a binary string s, its left child is s+'0', and right child is s+'1'. But for depth d, the maximum length is n. So, for a node of depth d <n, it has children; otherwise, it's a leaf.\n\nOnce the trie is built, we can process the nodes in order of depth from n down to 1.\n\nOnce the trie is built, for each node, we compute its DP table.\n\nNow, for each node, the DP table can be represented as an array of size up to (max possible value for that node). For example, for a node at depth d, the maximum possible value is 2^{n -d} (since each level halves the maximum possible sum). For example, for depth n, the maximum value is 1. For depth n-1, it's 2, and so on up to depth 1, which has maximum value 2^{n-1}.\n\nBut since n is up to 15, the maximum possible value for any node is 2^14 = 16384. Which is manageable.\n\nBut for k up to 2e5, when we compute the number of ways for a given S and v, we need to check whether v is <=k.\n\nSo, during the DP computation for each node, when considering a particular S and v, we have to take into account the k value.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nLet me think. For each node, during the DP computation, when we compute the contribution for a given S and v, the number of ways depends on whether v is <=k. For example, if v is larger than k, then it's impossible to have that value, so it contributes zero.\n\nBut since k is given as part of the input, we need to take this into account during the DP steps.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\n- For each node, compute its DP table, which for each possible value v (up to the maximum possible for that node) stores the number of ways to assign c_s's in its subtree such that the node's value is v.\n\nOnce all nodes are processed, the answer is the number of ways where the sum of the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for each binary string (from length 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. The solution involves dynamic programming on a trie structure of binary strings and careful computation of constraints based on given parameters `k`, `n`, and `f`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Trie Structure**: Represent all binary strings of lengths from 1 to n as nodes in a trie. Each node will have two children (for '0' and '1') unless it is a leaf node (length n).\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) on Trie**: For each node, compute the number of ways to assign values such that the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected without violating constraints is exactly `f`.\n\n3. **Depth-First Processing**: Process nodes starting from the deepest (leaves) up to the root's children. This ensures that when processing a node, its children's DP tables are already computed.\n\n4. **Combining Results**: For non-leaf nodes, combine results from their children to compute possible values considering constraints on capacities.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: After processing all nodes, compute the convolution of the DP tables of the root's children to determine the number of valid configurations where the sum of their values equals `f`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx +=3\n        \n        #
