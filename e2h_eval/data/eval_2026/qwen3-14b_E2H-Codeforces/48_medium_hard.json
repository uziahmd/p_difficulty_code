He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, which could be Roman numerals. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the next line is the number c in base a. So the steps are:\n\n1. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals.\n\nSo the main parts are: converting from base a to decimal, then converting decimal to base b (or Roman).\n\nLet's think about the first part: converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have letters? Wait, the problem says that when converting to base b, if it's not R, then it's a normal base. But for the input c, since it's in base a, which can be up to 25. So, for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. Also, note that the input c is given as a string, which may have letters if a is greater than 10. For example, if a is 12, then digits can go up to B (11). So during the conversion from base a to decimal, I need to parse each character of c as a digit in base a.\n\nWait, how are the digits represented? For example, in base 12, digits would be 0-9, then A for 10, B for 11. So the input c's characters must be parsed accordingly. So for the first step, I need a function that takes a string and a base, and converts it to a decimal number.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal. So for each character in the string, we need to convert it to its value. Let's think about how to do that. For each character in the string, if it's a digit, then its value is int(c), else if it's a letter, then it's ord(c) - ord('A') + 10. But wait, the problem says that in the input c, the digits are in base a. So the input c can have letters only if a is larger than 10. For example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9, A-F. But the input c is given as a string, which may have letters. So during parsing, we need to handle that.\n\nSo, the first step is to process the input c into a decimal value. Let's write a helper function for that.\n\nOnce that is done, the second part is converting the decimal number to base b. If b is not R, then it's a normal base conversion. But if b is R, then we need to convert to Roman numerals.\n\nSo for the case where b is not R, we need to convert the decimal number into base b. Again, for bases larger than 10, letters are used (like A for 10, B for 11, etc). Also, leading zeros must be omitted. For example, if the converted number is zero, but according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the number isn't zero. But for other cases, like when converting to base 2, the output must not have leading zeros. However, the input c can be zero? Wait, the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the input c can be zero? Let me check the input description.\n\nThe input says that c is a non-negative integer in base a. It may have leading zeros, but the length is up to 10^3. Also, it says that if Roman numerals are included, the number is <= 3000 and not zero. Otherwise, the number won't be greater than 1e15. So for the case where the output is not Roman, the number can be zero? Well, for example, if the input is '0' in base a, then converting to base b would be zero. But the output must omit leading zeros. So for zero, the output is '0'.\n\nSo for the conversion to base b (non-R), the steps are:\n\n- Convert the decimal number to base b, using letters for digits above 9. For example, 10 is 'A', 11 'B', etc.\n\nBut how to handle that. Let's think about the standard way of converting a decimal number to another base. For example, for a number n, we repeatedly divide by the base and collect the remainders. Then reverse the collected remainders to get the digits. But for each remainder, if it's >=10, we need to represent it as a letter.\n\nSo, for example, if the remainder is 10, we use 'A', 11 'B', etc. So the letters are uppercase? Well, the problem says that the output for Roman numerals uses uppercase letters, but for other bases, perhaps the output uses uppercase letters as well. Looking at the examples:\n\nIn the sample input, for example, the input is 12 R and 4. The output is 'IV'. Which is correct. Another example is when the input is 5 R 4, output is IV. So the Roman numerals are in uppercase. For other bases, like the first example input is 10 2 and 1. Output is 1. So for base 2, the output is in digits. So for bases that require letters, like base 12, the output should use letters. So for example, if converting to base 12, the digits would be 0-9, A, B.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is a and b. But b can be R. So for example, the first line could be '16 R', then the second line is '5'.\n\nSo, the first thing is to parse a and b. So, for the first line, split into two parts. The first is a, which is an integer. The second is either an integer or 'R'.\n\nThen, read the second line as the string c.\n\nOnce we have a, b, and c, process as follows:\n\nStep 1: Convert c from base a to decimal.\n\nLet me think about the function for converting c to decimal. For example, if c is '1111001' in base 2, then it's 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 1 = 241. Which is the example in the input.\n\nSo the function for converting a string in base a to decimal is needed.\n\nBut how to handle letters in the string. For example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, then it's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, for each character in the string, we need to convert it to its value. Let's think about the code:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the base is 10 and the input has letters? Well, according to the problem statement, the input c is in base a. So if a is 10, then the input can't have letters. Because in base 10, digits are 0-9. So the code can assume that the input c is valid. But the problem says that the input is correct, so we don't need to check for invalid digits.\n\nSo, the function to_decimal would work.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then we need to convert it to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, for the case where b is not 'R', we need to convert the decimal number to base b, using letters for digits above 9.\n\nBut first, what if the decimal number is zero? For example, input c is '0' in base a. Then the output should be '0' in base b. But the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So for other cases, zero can be present.\n\nSo, for converting to base b (non-R):\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    # Now reverse the digits\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    # Convert each digit to character\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nWait, but what if the number is zero? The function returns '0'.\n\nBut for example, if the input is 0, then the output is '0'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So for the case when converting to Roman, we can assume that the number is non-zero.\n\nSo, the code for converting to base b (non-R) is as above.\n\nNow, the Roman numeral conversion.\n\nThe problem says that Roman numerals are built with certain symbols and subtractive principles.\n\nThe standard approach for converting a decimal number to Roman numerals is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, the standard list is:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, we check how many times the value fits into the number, and append the symbol that many times. For example, 4 is 'IV'.\n\nSo, the code for converting a decimal number to Roman numerals would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman is guaranteed to be <= 3000 and non-zero. So this function should handle all cases.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead a and b. Then read c.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal. Let's call that num.\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert num to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert num to base b, using the decimal_to_base function.\n\nBut wait, what about when the input is zero? For example, if the input c is zero (allowed in non-R cases), then the output should be '0'.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nLet's take the first input line: 10 2 and c is '1'.\n\nConvert c from base 10 to decimal: 1. Then convert to base 2: 1. Output is '1'.\n\nSecond input line: 16 R, c is 5. So 5 in base 16 is 5 in decimal. Convert to Roman: V.\n\nThird input line: 5 R, c is 4. So 4 in base 5 is 4 in decimal. Convert to Roman: IV.\n\nFourth input line: 2 2, c is 1111001. That's binary 1111001 which is 121 in decimal. Convert to base 2 again: 1111001. So output is same.\n\nFifth input line: 12 13, c is 'A'. In base 12, 'A' is 10 in decimal. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' (since 10 < 13). So output is 'A'.\n\nSo the sample outputs match.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nRead the input lines. Wait, the input is given as a list of test cases? Or is it that each line is a separate test case?\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (or R).\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a.\n\nSo each test case is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, no, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut that seems to be multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the program should read from stdin one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's example:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as a list of test cases, but the output is also a list. However, in the actual programming competition problem, the input is one test case. But the user here is providing the code that reads from stdin, which for the problem is a single test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. The sample input shows multiple test cases, but perhaps that's just for illustration. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1', which is a single test case. So the code must read two lines from input: first line is a and b, second line is c.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are multiple test cases. However, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases as a list, but the actual code must process one test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should read one test case. For example, in the sample input, the first line is the first test case, and the output is the first line of the output.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is two lines: first line is a and b, second line is c. So the code should read two lines. So the code will read two lines from stdin.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead the first line: split into a and b. Then read the second line as c.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    a_and_b_line = lines[0]\n    c_line = lines[1]\n\n    # Parse a and b\n    a_part, b_part = a_and_b_line.split()\n    a = int(a_part)\n    b = b_part if b_part != 'R' else 'R'\n\n    # Process c\n    c = c_line\n\n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    decimal_num = to_decimal(c, a)\n\n    # Now convert to base b\n    if b == 'R':\n        roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_num)\n        print(roman)\n    else:\n        base_b = decimal_to_base(decimal_num, int(b))\n        print(base_b)\n\nBut need to implement the helper functions to_decimal, decimal_to_base, decimal_to_roman.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: c is zero. For example, input a=10, b=10, c=0. Then output is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base 1? Wait, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code can assume that a and b are in that range. Wait, the input says that a and b are between 2 and 25. But for the case of b being R, it's allowed. So the code can assume that when b is not R, it's between 2 and 25.\n\nBut the code needs to handle when the input is zero. For example, when converting to base 2, the decimal_num is zero, then the code returns '0'.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base 10, the number is 0. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 10, but the number is 4, and the output is '4'.\n\nNow, the helper functions.\n\nImplementing to_decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\nBut what if the input is empty? According to the problem statement, c is a non-negative integer, so the input is not empty.\n\nBut the problem says that the input c may have leading zeros. For example, '0001' in base 10 would be 1.\n\nNow, the decimal_to_base function.\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut what if n is zero? Then return '0'.\n\nTesting with sample input 2: 16 R and c is 5. So decimal_num is 5. Convert to Roman: V.\n\nAnother sample: input 5 R and c is 4. The decimal_num is 4, which is IV.\n\nAnother sample: input 2 2 and c is 1111001. The decimal_num is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Converting to base 2: 121 in decimal is 1111001 in binary. So the output is same as input.\n\nAnother sample: input 12 13 and c is A. A in base 12 is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is less than 13, so it's 'A'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code for the Roman function.\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut what if n is 0? According to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So the code can assume that n is positive.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut in the code, the functions must be written. Also, note that the input c can be up to 10^3 characters. So converting it to decimal may be a problem for very large numbers. For example, if a is 25 and c is 1000 characters long, then the decimal number can be up to 25^1000, which is way beyond Python's handling. However, Python can handle big integers. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut for the problem statement, it says that when Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000. So for other cases, the number can be up to 1e15, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code should be okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing all functions in Python.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    a_and_b_line = lines[0]\n    c_line = lines[1]\n\n    a_part, b_part = a_and_b_line.split()\n    a = int(a_part)\n    b = b_part\n\n    c = c_line\n\n    decimal_num = to_decimal(c, a)\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_num)\n        print(roman)\n    else:\n        base_b = decimal_to_base(decimal_num, int(b))\n        print(base_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if the input has more than two lines? For example, in the sample input, there are five test cases. But the problem says that the code should read one test case. However, the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. So in the code, the code reads the first two lines.\n\nBut the code as written will read all lines, but take the first two. So for the sample input, when the code is run with multiple test cases, it would process the first two lines as the first test case. But the problem says that the code should process one test case.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n1\n\nOutput: 1.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n5\n\nOutput: V.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n4\n\nOutput: IV.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n1111001\n\nOutput: 1111001.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\nA\n\nOutput: A.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: input a=2, b=10, c=1010. Then decimal_num is 10. Output is '10'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c=255. Output is 'FF'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=R, c=3000. Output is 'MMMD'.\n\nBut the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat if the input c is '0'? For example, a=10, b=10, c=0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=2, c=0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=10, c=0. Output is 0.\n\nBut in the code, decimal_to_base returns '0' when n is zero.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the input c is '0' and b is R. But according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So the code can assume that this case does not happen.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) number, and then converting this decimal number to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in a specific base `a`. We convert this number to a decimal (base 10) integer. This conversion handles digits beyond 9 using letters (A-Z) for bases greater than 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**: Depending on whether the target base is Roman numerals (`R`) or another base:\n   - If the target is a numerical base, convert the decimal number to the specified base using standard base conversion techniques, handling digits beyond 9 with letters (A-Z).\n   - If the target is Roman numerals, use a predefined list of Roman numeral symbols and their corresponding values to construct the Roman numeral representation of the decimal number.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    a_and_b_line = lines[0]\n    c_line = lines[1]\n\n    a_part, b_part = a_and_b_line.split()\n    a = int(a_part)\n    b = b_part\n\n    c = c_line\n\n    decimal_num = to_decimal(c, a)\n\n    if b == 'R':\n        roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_num)\n        print(roman)\n    else:\n        base_b = decimal_to_base(decimal_num, int(b))\n        print(base_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the original base `a`, the target base `b` (which could be 'R' for Roman numerals), and the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input number `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer. This function handles both numeric digits and alphabetic characters for bases greater than 10.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: If the target base is not Roman numerals, the function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the specified base, using letters for digits greater than 9.\n4. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: If the target base is 'R', the function `decimal_to_roman` converts the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs, ensuring correct application of subtractive notation.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including leading zeros and large numbers, ensuring accurate conversion between different numeral systems.",
