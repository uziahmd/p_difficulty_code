The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. Conversely, a chest with an odd a_i needs a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many even and odd chests there are, and then matching them with the available even and odd keys. \n\nWait, right. Let me break it down:\n\nLet's count:\n- even_chests: number of a_i that are even.\n- odd_chests: number of a_i that are odd.\n\nSimilarly for keys:\n- even_keys: number of b_j that are even.\n- odd_keys: number of b_j that are odd.\n\nNow, for each even chest, we need an odd key. For each odd chest, we need an even key. \n\nBut the problem is that the number of available keys might not match the number of chests. So the maximum possible for even chests is the minimum between even_chests and odd_keys. Similarly, the maximum possible for odd chests is the minimum between odd_chests and even_keys. \n\nAdding those two minima together would give the total maximum chests that can be opened. \n\nWait, yes! Because each even chest requires an odd key. So the number of such pairs is min(even_chests, odd_keys). Similarly for the other case. \n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9, 11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check:\n\n8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7).\n\nSo min(even_chests=3, odd_keys=1) → 1. Then min(odd_chests=2, even_keys=3) → 2. Total 3, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input: \n\nChests are 2,4,6,8,10 → all even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0.\n\nKeys: 5 (odd). So even_keys=0, odd_keys=1.\n\nSo min(5, 1) → 1. Then min(0, 0) → 0. Total 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 → all even. So even_keys=4, odd_keys=0. So for even_chests (1) we need odd_keys (0). So min(1,0)=0. For odd_chests (0) and even_keys (4) → min(0,4)=0. Total 0. Which matches.\n\nSo the logic works for the samples. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Count even and odd in a_i.\n- Count even and odd in b_j.\n- Compute min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nThat's the plan. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, how to read the input? The input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first input line is given as a list of strings, like ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', ...]. But in the actual problem, the input is given as per standard input. Wait, the user says that the code should read from stdin. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then second line has n integers, third line m integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different test cases. Like, the first example input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nThen another example input is 5 1, etc. So the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem's input format is not clear. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user provided sample input as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin. Wait, perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces or similar, where each test case is processed. But in the problem description, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then second line has n numbers, third line m numbers. So each test case is three lines. However, the sample input shows three different test cases. So perhaps the code needs to handle multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three outputs. But in reality, the code should process each test case. However, the problem's original input may have multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and gives the input format as first line with n and m, etc. So perhaps the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, maybe the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should process a single test case. Or perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. \n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, there are three test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nThen the output is 3. Then the second input is 5 1, etc. So the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input may have multiple test cases. But how do we know?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: The input is given as first line with n and m, then the next two lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the original problem may have a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is from a programming contest where the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So perhaps the sample input is presented as multiple test cases in the problem statement. For example, the sample input shows three separate test cases, each with their own input and output. So the code must process each test case. \n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in the sample input, the input is given as three separate test cases. So the code needs to read all test cases. However, the problem's input format is not clear. \n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m... etc. So perhaps each test case is given as three lines, and the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's sample input shows three test cases. \n\nBut how does the code know how many test cases there are? Well, in programming contests, sometimes the code reads until EOF. For example, in the sample input, the code would read three test cases, each consisting of three lines. \n\nBut the problem's input is not specified. However, the user's example shows that the code should process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three outputs. \n\nBut in the original problem, perhaps the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input seems to indicate that there are multiple test cases. \n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nWhich is three test cases. The output is ['3', '1', '0'].\n\nSo the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input format is not explicitly given. But in programming contests, it's common that the code reads from standard input, and the input consists of multiple test cases. \n\nBut how to read them? Well, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into groups of three lines (each test case is three lines). But how to handle that in Python?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. But that's not the case here. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Let me check the original problem statement again. \n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m... etc. \n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. That suggests that the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as three lines, and the code must process multiple test cases. \n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? Well, in programming contests, sometimes the number of test cases is given in the first line. But in this problem, the problem statement doesn't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list of test cases, but the actual code should process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, but the code would need to process each of them. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has three test cases, and the output has three answers. \n\nBut how to read them in Python? Well, in programming contests, the code can read all input lines at once, split into groups of three lines. For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process each group of three lines as a test case. \n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think. \n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin using sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), then process them in groups of three. \n\nBut how to handle that? For example, if the input is:\n\nLine 1: n m\n\nLine 2: a_1 ... a_n\n\nLine 3: b_1 ... b_m\n\nThen for each test case, we need to read three lines. \n\nSo the code would read all lines, then process them in groups of three. \n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? Well, the number of test cases is equal to the number of groups of three lines. \n\nBut perhaps in the problem, the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, but the problem's original input is for a single test case. \n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from standard input and print to standard output. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, there are three test cases. \n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n and m... etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. \n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read a single test case. \n\nBut that would not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a contest where the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. \n\nBut without knowing the exact input format, it's hard to proceed. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. \n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think. \n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as three separate test cases. Each test case is three lines. So the code needs to read all test cases. \n\nThus, the code should read all lines from stdin, split into groups of three lines. For each group, process as a test case. \n\nBut how to do that in Python? \n\nFor example, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n    # process a test case\n\n    n, m = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    b = list(map(int, lines[i+2].split()))\n\n    # process and output\n\n    i += 3\n\nBut this would work if the input is given as multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. \n\nBut what if the input is only one test case? Then the code would process it correctly. \n\nSo, the code should handle multiple test cases. \n\nBut how to handle the case where the number of lines is not a multiple of three? Well, perhaps the problem ensures that the input is correct. \n\nSo, given that, the code can proceed with this approach. \n\nNow, the code for each test case is:\n\ncount even and odd in a, count even and odd in b. \n\nThen compute min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b). \n\nSo, for each test case:\n\neven_a = number of even numbers in a list.\n\nodd_a = n - even_a.\n\neven_b = number of even numbers in b list.\n\nodd_b = m - even_b.\n\nresult = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n\nThen print(result)\n\nSo, the code for each test case is straightforward. \n\nNow, implement this in Python. \n\nBut how to read the input. Let's proceed. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead all lines. Then process in groups of three. \n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich is three lines. \n\nSo, the code will read lines[0], lines[1], lines[2], then lines[3], lines[4], lines[5], etc. \n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and m\n\n        n, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        b = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        # process\n\n        even_a = 0\n\n        odd_a = 0\n\n        for num in a:\n\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n\n                even_a += 1\n\n            else:\n\n                odd_a += 1\n\n        even_b = 0\n\n        odd_b = 0\n\n        for num in b:\n\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n\n                even_b += 1\n\n            else:\n\n                odd_b += 1\n\n        res = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n\n        print(res)\n\nBut this code would process each test case correctly. \n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the third test case is:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nSo, for a, the list is [10], even. So even_a is 1, odd_a 0. \n\nFor b, all even. even_b=4, odd_b=0. \n\nres is min(1, 0) + min(0,4) → 0 + 0 = 0. Which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what about when the input has multiple test cases. \n\nBut this code should handle that. \n\nBut in some cases, the code may have idx going out of range. For example, if the input is incomplete. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct. \n\nSo, the code should be correct. \n\nBut in the sample input, the code would process each test case and print the result. \n\nNow, test the code against the sample input. \n\nSample Input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=5, m=4. a = [9,14,6,2,11]. even_a is 3 (14,6,2). odd_a is 2 (9,11). \n\nb is [8,4,7,20]. even_b=3 (8,4,20), odd_b=1 (7). \n\nres = min(3,1) + min(2,3) → 1 + 2 = 3. Correct. \n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=5, m=1. a is [2,4,6,8,10]. even_a=5, odd_a=0. \n\nb is [5]. even_b=0, odd_b=1. \n\nres = min(5,1) + min(0,0) → 1 + 0 = 1. Correct. \n\nThird test case: res is 0. \n\nSo the code outputs 3, 1, 0. Which matches the sample. \n\nTherefore, this code should be correct. \n\nNow, implement this in Python. \n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin. Also, note that for large n and m (up to 1e5), the code must process the input efficiently. However, since the code is reading the entire input at once, and splitting into lines, it's efficient. \n\nAlso, for counting even and odd, the code can be optimized. For example, using list comprehensions. But for the purposes of code, the current approach is acceptable. \n\nAnother thing: in Python, for very large numbers, the modulo operation is O(1), so no problem. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nNow, write the code accordingly. \n\nBut in the code, the lines are read as per the groups. \n\nNow, the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout. \n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number.

Specifically, the number of such pairs is constrained by the smaller count of each pair type.\n3. **Sum Results**: The total number of chests that can be opened is the sum of the two possible pairings (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and m\n        n, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        b = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        even_a = 0\n        odd_a = 0\n        for num in a:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_a += 1\n            else:\n                odd_a += 1\n        \n        even_b = 0\n        odd_b = 0\n        for num in b:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_b += 1\n            else:\n                odd_b += 1\n        \n        res = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing.\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, we read the number of chests and keys, followed by the lists of numbers on the chests and keys.\n3. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We count how many even and odd numbers are present in both the chests and keys lists.\n4. **Calculating Maximum Openable Chests**: By matching even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys, we determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the minimum counts of these pairs.\n5. **Output**: The result for each test case is printed immediately after processing it.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the given keys, leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers.",
