    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then determining the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly a p-reachable graph is. Oh right, it's a directed graph that contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So for each such pair, both directions must be reachable. Wait no, wait: the definition says \"u and v are reachable from each other.\" So that means there's a path from u to v and from v to u. So each such pair contributes to the count p. But the problem says that the graph must have exactly p such pairs.\n\nThe first part of the problem is to find the minimum number of nodes needed. Then, among all such graphs with that minimal number of nodes, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs. \n\nUnidirectional pairs are ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v, there's a path from u to v, but no path from v to u. So these are pairs where one direction is reachable but not the other. \n\nSo the approach here is probably to model the problem in terms of strongly connected components (SCCs). Because if two nodes are in the same SCC, they are mutually reachable. But if they are in different components, depending on the structure of the DAG of SCCs, there might be reachability in one direction but not the other. \n\nBut how does this relate to the p value? Well, for the p-reachable condition, the number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability is exactly p. So each such pair must be in the same SCC. Because if two nodes are in the same SCC, they are mutually reachable. If they are in different SCCs, then depending on the DAG structure, maybe they are not mutually reachable. \n\nWait, but in a DAG of SCCs, if there's a path from component A to component B, then any node in A can reach any node in B. But if there's no path between A and B, then they can't reach each other. So for two nodes u and v in different SCCs, they are mutually reachable only if their components are in a cycle in the DAG of components. But since the DAG is acyclic, that's not possible. So the only way two nodes are mutually reachable is if they are in the same SCC. \n\nTherefore, the number of pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability is equal to the sum over each SCC of C(k, 2), where k is the size of the component. Because for each component of size k, there are k*(k-1)/2 ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v. \n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing a set of components (with sizes s_1, s_2, ..., s_m) such that the sum of C(s_i, 2) equals p. And we want to minimize the total number of nodes, which is sum(s_i). Then, among those configurations, we need to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs. \n\nSo first, the minimal number of nodes. How to find the minimal sum of s_i's given that sum_{i} C(s_i, 2) = p. \n\nLet me think about this. For each component, C(s, 2) is the number of pairs in it. To minimize the total nodes, we need to maximize the number of pairs per node. Because for a given number of pairs, using as large as possible components (since C(s, 2) grows quadratically) would allow us to use fewer nodes. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if we have two components of size 3, that gives C(3,2)*2 = 3*2=6. If instead, we have one component of size 4, that's C(4,2)=6. So the total nodes are 4 vs 6. So using larger components is better. Therefore, to minimize the total nodes, we need to have as large as possible components. \n\nSo the strategy is to find the minimal number of nodes such that the sum of C(s_i, 2) equals p. This is equivalent to finding the minimal sum of s_i's where the sum of s_i*(s_i -1)/2 equals p. \n\nSo the problem becomes similar to representing p as a sum of triangular numbers, with the minimal sum of the bases. \n\nHow do we compute that? Let's think. For example, if p is 3, then the optimal is a single component of size 3 (C(3,2)=3). Sum of nodes is 3. Which matches the first example. \n\nAnother example: if p is 4. Let",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs (u, v) such that `u < v` and both nodes are mutually reachable. This can be achieved by forming strongly connected components (SCCs) where each component contributes a certain number of mutual reachability pairs.\n\n2. **Triangular Numbers**: The number of mutual reachability pairs in an SCC of size `s` is given by the triangular number formula `C(s, 2) = s*(s-1)/2`. To minimize the number of nodes, we need to maximize the use of larger components since they contribute more pairs per node.\n\n3. **Greedy Algorithm**: We use a greedy approach to decompose `p` into the sum of triangular numbers starting from the largest possible component size downwards. This ensures the minimal number of nodes.\n\n4. **Unidirectional Pairs Calculation**: Once the minimal number of nodes is determined, we calculate the maximum number of unidirectional pairs by considering the structure of the graph formed by the components.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    # Find the minimal number of nodes\n    total_nodes = 0\n    remaining_p = p\n    components = []\n    \n    # Try to take the largest possible component first\n    s = 1\n    while True:\n        max_possible = s * (s - 1) // 2\n        if max_possible <= remaining_p:\n            components.append(s)\n            remaining_p -= max_possible\n            total_nodes += s\n            s += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Now, if remaining_p > 0, we need to adjust the last component\n    if remaining_p > 0:\n        # Find the current size of the last component\n        # We have components in increasing order, but maybe not optimal\n        # So we need to find the best way to split the remaining_p\n        # Let's try to find the largest possible s such that s*(s-1)/2 <= remaining_p\n        s = 1\n        while True:\n            max_possible = s * (s - 1) // 2\n            if max_possible <= remaining_p:\n                s += 1\n            else:\n                break\n        s -= 1\n        max_possible = s * (s - 1) // 2\n        # Now replace the last component with s, and see if there's any left\n        # But we need to check if the previous components are optimal\n        # For example, if we have components like [3, 3], and remaining_p is 1, it's better to replace one of them\n        # However, since we are trying to minimize the number of nodes, the initial approach might not be optimal\n        # So perhaps we need to re-calculate the components properly\n        \n        # Let's reset and compute the components correctly\n        components = []\n        remaining_p = p\n        s = 1\n        while remaining_p > 0:\n            max_possible = s * (s - 1) // 2\n            if max_possible <= remaining_p:\n                components.append(s)\n                remaining_p -= max_possible\n                s += 1\n            else:\n                # Find the maximum s' such that s'*(s'-1)/2 <= remaining_p\n                s_prime = 1\n                while s_prime * (s_prime - 1) // 2 <= remaining_p:\n                    s_prime += 1\n                s_prime -= 1\n                components.append(s_prime)\n                remaining_p -= s_prime * (s_prime - 1) // 2\n                s = s_prime + 1\n        total_nodes = sum(components)\n    \n    # Now calculate the maximum number of unidirectional pairs\n    # The number of unidirectional pairs is total_pairs - mutual_pairs - self_pairs\n    # But mutual_pairs is p\n    # Also, the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1)\n    # Because for each of the n nodes, there are n-1 choices for v\n    # But the mutual pairs are counted as p, and the rest can be unidirectional or not\n    # Wait, how to compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs?\n    # The unidirectional pairs are those (u, v) where u != v, and there is a path from u to v but not from v to u.\n    # To maximize this, we need to arrange the components in a DAG where edges go from one component to another in a way that maximizes the number of such pairs.\n    # The maximum number of unidirectional pairs is achieved when the components are arranged in a linear chain (each component points to the next).\n    # In this case, for each pair of components A and B, if A comes before B, then all nodes in A can reach all nodes in B, but not vice versa.\n    # So the number of such pairs is sum_{i<j} (size_i * size_j)\n    # Additionally, within each component, there are no unidirectional pairs because they are strongly connected.\n    # So the total unidirectional pairs is sum_{i<j} size_i * size_j\n    # Now, the sum of all ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1)\n    # The number of mutual pairs is p (since each mutual pair is counted once in the problem's definition)\n    # But wait, the mutual pairs are counted as C(s, 2) for each component, which is exactly p.\n    # However, the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1)\n    # The number of unidirectional pairs is equal to (total_ordered_pairs - mutual_pairs - self_pairs) / 2?
