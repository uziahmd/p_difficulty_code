The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a frog jumping on a number line. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But the frog can't land on positions outside [0, x] when calculating f(x). For each x from 0 to m, we need to compute f(x) and sum all those values.\n\nHmm. So for each i from 0 to m, compute how many distinct positions the frog can reach, given that all jumps must stay within [0, i]. Then sum all those f(i).\n\nConstraints are m up to 1e9, and a and b up to 1e5. So any O(m) solution is impossible. We need an O(1) or O(a + b) approach per test case.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b. But the frog can't go below 0 or above x. So for a given x, the reachable positions are those that can be formed by some combination of +a and -b steps, but without going out of bounds.\n\nBut how do we model this? It feels like a BFS problem, but for large x (up to 1e9), we can't simulate it for each x.\n\nWait, but the sum is over all x from 0 to m. So perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be derived for f(x) based on certain properties of a and b.\n\nFirst, let's think about the general case where the frog can reach certain positions. Let's consider the possible positions the frog can reach without any constraints (i.e., ignoring the [0,x] restriction). What's the set of positions?\n\nThe frog starts at 0. Each jump adds a or subtracts b. So the positions are numbers of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But since the frog can perform multiple jumps, perhaps the positions are all numbers that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b, with coefficients such that the total steps are allowed. However, since the frog can move back and forth, the key is to find the set of positions reachable via these steps.\n\nBut the problem here is that the frog can't go beyond the current x. So for each x, the reachable positions are those that can be formed by the linear combinations, but also lie within [0, x].\n\nBut how to model this for varying x?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the set of reachable positions is determined by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Because if the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d = gcd(a,b), but perhaps only certain positions.\n\nWait, let's think about the problem without the [0, x] constraint. Suppose the frog can jump any number of times. Then the positions reachable are all integers that can be written as a linear combination of a and b, with integer coefficients. However, since the frog starts at 0, and each jump adds +a or subtracts b, the positions are those that can be written as (some number of a steps) minus (some number of b steps). So, the positions are all integers of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But this is equivalent to all integers of the form m*a + n*b, where m and n are integers (since subtracting l*b is same as adding (-l)*b). However, since the frog can't have negative steps, maybe the actual positions are more constrained.\n\nWait, but the frog can make any sequence of jumps. For example, if the frog jumps +a once, then -b once, then +a again, etc. So the positions are all numbers that can be written as (k*a - l*b) where k and l are non-negative integers. However, this is equivalent to numbers that are congruent to 0 modulo d, where d = gcd(a, b). Because a and b are multiples of d, so their linear combinations are multiples of d. Also, since the frog can reach any multiple of d that is sufficiently large. But for small numbers, it depends on the specific values of a and b.\n\nBut in our problem, the frog can't go beyond x. So for each x, the reachable positions are the multiples of d that are in [0, x], but only those that can be reached through some sequence of jumps.\n\nWait, but maybe the frog can reach any multiple of d that is ≥ 0, provided that it's possible to reach it by moving forward and backward steps. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose a and b are coprime. Then the frog can reach any integer that is ≥ (some value). But for smaller numbers, it may not be possible.\n\nBut the problem is that when considering the frog's movement, the positions are constrained by the fact that during the jumps, the frog can't go outside [0, x]. So even if a position is a multiple of d, but to reach it requires passing through a position that is outside [0, x], then it's not counted.\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to model the reachable positions for all x ≥ some value. Let's think about the following:\n\nLet d = gcd(a, b). Let's first note that all reachable positions must be multiples of d. So for any x, the maximum possible number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1 (if all multiples are reachable). But this is only possible if the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nBut when can the frog reach all multiples of d in [0, x]?\n\nThis depends on whether the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d. Let's think of the problem in terms of the frog being able to reach any position that is a multiple of d, given that the frog can jump forward and backward. But the problem is that the frog can't go beyond x. So for x large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. But for small x, some multiples may not be reachable.\n\nBut how do we determine for which x the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x?\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime. Then the frog can reach any integer that is ≥ (a - b) ? Or maybe there's some minimal value beyond which all multiples can be reached. For example, the classic coin problem: the largest amount that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b (assuming they are coprime) is ab - a - b. But that applies when you can use any number of coins, but here the problem is different.\n\nBut perhaps there's a similar concept here. Let's think of the problem as the frog can reach any multiple of d that is greater than or equal to some value. Once x is larger than that value, all multiples of d up to x are reachable. Then, for x less than that value, only some multiples are reachable.\n\nBut how do we find that value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of d that is ≥ 0, provided that the frog can reach it by some combination of jumps. However, during the process of reaching that position, the frog must not step outside [0, x].\n\nBut since the frog is allowed to take any path as long as it doesn't go outside [0, x], maybe for x being large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. But for smaller x, some positions are not reachable.\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's try to think of examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: m=7, a=5, b=3. d = gcd(5,3)=1. So all integers are reachable, but subject to the constraints.\n\nIn the sample explanation, for x=5, f(5)=3. The positions reachable are 0, 5, and 5-3=2. Wait, but 0+5=5, then from 5 you can subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, you can add 5 to get 7, but that's outside [0,5], so not allowed. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. So three positions. Then for x=7, the frog can reach more positions. For example, from 2, add 5 to get 7 (allowed), so 7 is included. Also, from 7, subtract 3 to get 4, etc. So the reachable positions would be 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1 (from 4-3?), etc.\n\nWait, but how to model this for general x?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider the problem as follows. The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and can be written as (k*a - l*b) where k and l are non-negative integers, and during the jumps, the frog never goes below 0 or above x. However, for x large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. So for x >= some value, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut what is that \"some value\"?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= (a - b) or something like that. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the problem as a graph. Each position is a node, and edges are the possible jumps. The frog can reach any node that is reachable from 0 via these edges, and the path must not go beyond x. But for varying x, this is dynamic.\n\nBut since x can be up to 1e9, we can't precompute for each x. So we need a mathematical formula.\n\nLet me think again. Let's assume that the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x] once x is large enough. Let's call this threshold T. Then, for x < T, the number of reachable positions is some function, and for x >= T, it's floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nSo the sum over i from 0 to m of f(i) can be split into two parts: sum for i < T, and sum for i >= T.\n\nBut how do we find T?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is the minimal value such that for all multiples of d greater than or equal to T, the frog can reach them. How to find T?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is the minimal value such that T is a multiple of d, and T can be expressed as (k*a - l*b), and also, T - a is a multiple of d, and can be reached. But this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= some value. For example, if the frog can reach a certain position, then adding a steps (forward) will allow reaching higher positions. Similarly, subtracting b steps (backward) can allow lower positions. However, the problem is that the frog can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut if x is large enough, then the frog can reach any multiple of d in [0, x] by starting from 0, adding a steps until it reaches a position, and then adjusting with b steps as needed.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where this becomes possible?\n\nLet me think of the case when a and b are coprime. Then, according to the coin problem, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b is ab -a -b. However, in our case, the frog can only use positive steps of a and negative steps of b. So the reachable positions are those that can be written as (k*a - l*b), where k and l are non-negative integers. This is different from the standard coin problem, where you can use any combination of coins (so coefficients can be positive or negative? No, in the coin problem, you can't have negative coins. So perhaps the analogy isn't direct.)\n\nBut perhaps for the frog's problem, the reachable positions are all numbers that can be written as (k*a - l*b) where k and l are non-negative integers. And since the frog starts at 0, the reachable positions are the numbers that are in the set S = {k*a - l*b | k, l ∈ N ∪ {0}}.\n\nBut since a and b are positive integers, and d = gcd(a, b), then S consists of all multiples of d that are >= -infinity? No, but the frog can't have negative positions. Wait, but the frog can only reach positions that are non-negative. So S is the set of non-negative integers that can be written as k*a - l*b for non-negative integers k, l. But this is equivalent to the set of non-negative integers that can be expressed as k*a + m*b, where m is a non-negative integer? No, because k*a - l*b = k*a + (-l)*b, but l is non-negative. So that's not exactly the same as the standard coin problem.\n\nAlternatively, since the frog can perform any number of forward and backward jumps, perhaps the set S is the set of all integers that are congruent to 0 mod d and are >= some value.\n\nBut how to find that value?\n\nLet me think of an example. Take a=5, b=3, d=1. The frog can reach 0 (start), then 5 (jump +a). From 5, can subtract 3 to reach 2. From 2, can add 5 to reach 7. From 7, subtract 3 to reach 4. From 4, subtract 3 to reach 1. From 1, add 5 to reach 6. From 6, subtract 3 to reach 3. From 3, subtract 3 to reach 0. So the reachable positions are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1. So all numbers from 0 to 7 except 0? No, all numbers except maybe some. Wait, in the first sample input, for x=7, the answer is 8. Which matches the count of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So for x=7, all numbers are reachable. So when x is large enough, the frog can reach all numbers.\n\nBut why? Because once the frog can reach positions up to some value, adding a steps allows to reach higher positions. For example, once the frog can reach 1, adding 5 steps gets to 6, which can then subtract 3 to get 3, etc.\n\nSo in this case, for x >= some value (like 5?), the frog can reach all numbers. But how to find that value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number that can be reached is zero, and once the frog can reach a certain range, adding a steps allows to reach higher positions. So for example, if the frog can reach a consecutive sequence of a numbers, then it can reach all numbers beyond that.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the problem in terms of BFS. For each position, the frog can reach positions by adding a or subtracting b. But for the purpose of finding all positions that can be reached (without considering the x limit), the BFS would generate all positions that can be reached. However, since x can be up to 1e9, we need to find a pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the minimal x such that all multiples of d in [0, x] can be reached, and for x >= that value, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nOnce we find that minimal x, say T, then for all x >= T, the f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1. For x < T, we need to calculate f(x) individually.\n\nBut how to compute T?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= some value. Let's say that the minimal value is s. Then, once x is >= s, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows. Since the frog can jump forward by a and backward by b, and since the frog can reach positions by combining these jumps, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= (some value) and can be reached by some combination of jumps. Let's denote that value as the minimal value such that the frog can reach all multiples of d >= that value.\n\nBut how to compute this value?\n\nAnother approach: Let's imagine that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d and can be written as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients k and l (non-negative). Let's divide everything by d. Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since d is gcd(a,b), a' and b' are coprime.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding all positions that are multiples of d, and in terms of a' and b', the problem becomes: can the frog reach any integer that is >= some value using steps of +a' and -b'?\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, the problem is now similar to the classic coin problem but with steps that can be added or subtracted. However, the frog can't go below 0.\n\nWait, but the problem is now: for the transformed problem, the frog can reach any integer that is a linear combination of a' and b', but with coefficients k and l non-negative. So, in terms of the new variables, the positions are of the form k*a' - l*b', where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position must be >=0.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, the set of reachable positions is all integers that are >= (some value). Let me think of the minimal number of steps required to reach all numbers beyond a certain point.\n\nIn the classic coin problem, the largest amount that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b is ab -a -b. But that's when you can use any number of coins (so positive coefficients). Here, the situation is different because we can have negative coefficients (since we can subtract b steps). However, the frog can't go below 0, so the problem is more constrained.\n\nAlternatively, since the frog can add a' steps and subtract b' steps, the reachable positions are all integers that are >=0 and can be written as (k*a' - l*b'), where k and l are non-negative integers. Let me think of this as the set of integers that can be expressed as k*a' - l*b' >=0.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, the set of such numbers includes all integers >= some value. How to find that value?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. Let's consider that the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of 1 (since a' and b' are coprime) and is >=0. But how?\n\nFor example, if a'=2 and b'=3. Then, the frog can reach:\n\n0 (starting point).\n\nFrom 0, can add 2 to get 2. From 2, can subtract 3 to get -1 (invalid), so that's not allowed. So 2 is valid. From 0, can't subtract 3. From 2, can add 2 to get 4. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1. From 1, add 2 to get 3. From 3, subtract 3 to get 0. From 3, add 2 to get 5. Etc. So the reachable positions are 0, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, etc. So once the frog can reach 1, then adding 2 steps allows reaching 3, 5, etc. And subtracting 3 steps allows reaching 0 again. So for any x >= 1, the frog can reach all numbers >= 1?\n\nWait, but for x=1, the frog can reach 0 and 1. For x=2, can reach 0, 2, 1 (from 2-3 is invalid, but from 0 +2 is 2, and from 2-3 is invalid. But earlier steps showed that from 2, you can't get to 1 unless you have another way. Wait, earlier analysis said that from 2, you can't subtract 3. But how did we reach 1?\n\nAh, earlier steps: from 0, add 2 to get 2. Then add 2 again to get 4. Subtract 3 from 4 to get 1. So yes, 1 is reachable. So for x >= 4, the frog can reach 1. Then, from 1, adding 2 steps gives 3, then adding 2 gives 5, etc. So for x >= 1, the frog can reach all numbers >= 1? No, because for x=1, it can reach 0 and 1. For x=2, it can reach 0, 2, and 1 (since to get 1, the frog has to go to 4 (which is beyond x=2?), but that's not allowed. So for x=2, the frog can't reach 1. Wait, but how?\n\nThis suggests that the previous analysis was wrong. Let me re-examine this scenario.\n\nIn this case, a'=2, b'=3. The frog starts at 0. The allowed positions are between 0 and x.\n\nIf x is 2, then the frog can reach 0, and 2 (by jumping +a'). But to reach 1, the frog would need to go from 0 to 2, then subtract 3 (but 2-3 = -1, which is invalid). So it can't reach 1. Hence, for x=2, f(x) is 2 (positions 0 and 2). For x=4, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4, and 1 (since 4-3=1). So for x=4, f(x) is 4.\n\nSo the threshold T here is 4. Once x is >= 4, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 to x. Because for example, if x is 5, then 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. How to reach 3? From 4 (which is allowed) subtract 3 to get 1, then add 2 to get 3. Or from 0, add 2 twice to get 4, subtract 3 to get 1, add 2 to get 3. So yes. For x=5, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4,5. So for x >= 4, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 to x.\n\nSo the threshold T is 4 here. How to find this T for general a' and b' (coprime)?\n\nIn this example, T = a' * b' - a' - b' + something? Wait, the classic coin problem says that the largest unrepresentable number is (a*b -a -b). But in our case, the numbers are different. Let me see. For a'=2 and b'=3, the classic largest unrepresentable is 2*3 -2 -3 = 1. Which is the same as the T in our case (T is 4, which is larger than 1). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is (a' -1)*(b' -1) ?\n\nIn our example, (2-1)*(3-1) = 2. Which is less than 4. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is the maximum between a and b. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: the frog can reach any number that is >= (some value) by using the forward jumps. Once the frog can reach a certain number, adding a steps allows reaching higher numbers. But to reach the lower numbers, the frog may need to use combinations of forward and backward jumps.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where all numbers from 0 to x are reachable?\n\nThis seems challenging. Perhaps the way to proceed is to find all positions that can be reached when x is large enough, and then find the minimal x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the transformed problem (with a' and b' coprime), the minimal x where all numbers from 0 to x are reachable is (a' + b') - 1. Or something similar.\n\nIn our example, a'=2, b'=3. Then a'+b' -1 = 4. Which matches the T we found earlier. Let's check another example. Let a'=1, b'=2. Then the minimal x where all numbers are reachable would be 1+2-1=2. Let's see: For x=2, can the frog reach all numbers from 0 to 2?\n\nYes. Starting at 0, jump +1 to get 1, then again to 2. Also, from 0, can't jump -2. So for x=2, the reachable positions are 0,1,2. Which is all numbers. So yes. For x=1, the frog can reach 0 and 1. So yes, T is 1+2-1=2.\n\nAnother example: a'=3, b'=5. Then T would be 3+5-1=7. Let's see if for x=7, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 to 7.\n\nLet me think. Starting from 0, can reach 3 (jump +3). From 3, subtract 5 (invalid). So can't. So can reach 3. From 3, add 3 to get 6. From 6, subtract 5 to get 1. From 1, add 3 to get 4. From 4, add 3 to get 7. From 7, subtract 5 to get 2. From 2, add 3 to get 5. From 5, subtract 5 to get 0. So yes, all numbers from 0 to 7 are reachable. For example, 0, 3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 2, 5. So all numbers 0-7. So yes. So T is indeed 3+5-1=7.\n\nSo this seems to hold. So for coprime a' and b', the minimal x where all numbers from 0 to x are reachable is a' + b' - 1. Once x is >= a' + b' - 1, then the frog can reach all numbers from 0 to x.\n\nSo this suggests that the threshold T is (a' + b' - 1) * d. Wait, because in the transformed problem, a' and b' are coprime. So the original a and b are a = a' * d, b = b' * d. So the threshold T in the original problem would be (a' + b' - 1) * d. Because in the transformed problem, the threshold is a' + b' - 1, and multiplying by d gives the original value.\n\nWait, but in the first example, a=5, b=3. d=1, a'=5, b'=3. So T would be 5+3-1=7. Which matches the first sample input where for x=7, all positions are reachable. And the sample input has m=7, and f(7) is 8 (positions 0-7). So yes, this seems correct.\n\nAnother example: when a=2, b=3, d=1. T is 2+3-1=4. Which matches our previous analysis.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct formula for T. Thus, for the original problem, once x >= T, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x], which for d=1 is all numbers. For general d, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nWait, no. Because the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x], which is floor(x/d) + 1 positions. But in the transformed problem (after dividing by d), the numbers are integers. So in the original problem, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1, provided that x >= T.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b).\n\nIf d is not 1, then the frog can only reach multiples of d. However, the problem is that the frog can't reach positions that are not multiples of d. So for any x, the reachable positions are the multiples of d that can be reached, and are within [0, x].\n\nBut the threshold T is (a' + b' - 1) * d, where a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Since a' and b' are coprime.\n\nOnce x >= T, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1. For x < T, we need to compute the number of reachable positions.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each x from 0 to m:\n\nif x < T: compute the number of multiples of d that are reachable and <=x.\n\nelse: floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for x < T?\n\nBut T could be up to (a' + b' - 1)*d. Given that a and b can be up to 1e5, and d can be up to 1e5, T could be up to (1e5 + 1e5 -1)*1e5 = around 2e10. Which is way too big to process for each x up to m=1e9. Wait, but if m is up to 1e9, and T is up to 2e10, then for cases where m < T, we have to compute for all x up to m, which is 1e9 steps. Which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a way to compute the sum for x < T efficiently.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. For x < T, the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that can be reached by the frog's jumps. But how to find that number?\n\nBut for x < T, the reachable positions are the multiples of d that are reachable in the transformed problem (a', b') up to x/d. Because the transformed problem is for numbers divided by d.\n\nLet me think. Let me define the transformed problem: the frog can reach numbers in the transformed space (where each unit is d) as per a' and b'. So the original problem's reachable positions are multiples of d, and the transformed problem's reachable positions are the numbers in the transformed space.\n\nIn the transformed problem, the threshold is T' = a' + b' -1. So for any x in the original problem, the transformed x is x_transformed = x / d. If x_transformed >= T', then the number of reachable positions in transformed space is x_transformed + 1. Otherwise, it's the number of reachable positions in the transformed space up to x_transformed.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to solving the transformed problem, which is for a' and b' coprime, and then multiplying the counts by 1 (since each position in transformed space corresponds to d * transformed position in original space).\n\nSo the problem is to compute for the transformed problem (a', b' coprime) and for each x_transformed (original x divided by d), the number of reachable positions in transformed space up to x_transformed, then multiply by 1 (since each corresponds to a unique position in original space). However, this is only true if x >= T' in transformed space. Otherwise, it's the count for the transformed problem.\n\nThus, for the original problem, the sum is:\n\nsum_{x=0}^m [f(x)] = sum_{x=0}^m [number of reachable multiples of d in [0, x]] \n\nWhich equals sum_{k=0}^{floor(m/d)} [number of reachable positions in transformed space up to k] * (number of x that correspond to k in transformed space).\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nEach original x corresponds to a transformed x' = floor(x/d) ?\n\nNo, for each original x, the transformed x' is x divided by d. But the transformed problem's reachable positions are integers. So for original x, the maximum transformed position that can be considered is floor(x/d). Because if the transformed position is t, then the original position is t*d, which must be <= x. So t <= x/d.\n\nSo for each original x, the number of reachable positions is the number of reachable transformed positions t where t <= floor(x/d).\n\nSo the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x) is equal to the sum over all possible t (transformed positions) of (the number of x's where floor(x/d) >= t and x <= m) multiplied by the number of reachable positions in transformed space up to t.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think of it as follows:\n\nFor each transformed position t, how many original x's include t in their reachable positions?\n\nBut this seems complicated. Alternatively, for each transformed position t, the number of original x's where t is reachable and x >= t*d. So for each t, the contribution to the sum is (number of x's in [t*d, m]) multiplied by 1 (since each x includes t in its reachable positions if t is reachable).\n\nBut this would require knowing for each t whether it is reachable in the transformed problem.\n\nBut this seems difficult. However, for the transformed problem, we can precompute for all t up to T' (the threshold in transformed space) whether it's reachable. Then, for each such t, compute how many x's (original) include t in their reachable positions.\n\nBut given that T' can be up to (a' + b' -1), which for a' and b' up to 1e5, is up to 2e5. So for each test case, we can precompute for the transformed problem all reachable positions up to T', then compute their contributions.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nd = gcd(a, b)\n\na' = a / d\n\nb' = b / d\n\nT' = a' + b' - 1\n\nIn the transformed problem, for any t >= T', all positions from 0 to t are reachable.\n\nFor t < T', we need to know if t is reachable in the transformed problem.\n\nOnce we have that information, for each t in the transformed problem, we can calculate how many original x's (from 0 to m) include t in their reachable positions.\n\nSo, the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x) is equal to the sum over all t (in transformed problem) of the number of x's where t is reachable and t <= floor(x/d) and x <= m.\n\nBut this can be rewritten as for each t, the number of x's such that x >= t*d and x <= m. Because if x >= t*d, then floor(x/d) >= t. So for each t that is reachable in transformed problem, the contribution is max(0, m - t*d + 1).\n\nBut wait, this would be the case if for all x >= t*d, the transformed x' = floor(x/d) >= t. So t is included in the reachable positions of x. Therefore, the number of x's where t is included in f(x) is the number of x's >= t*d and <= m. Which is max(0, m - t*d + 1).\n\nBut this would count for each t, how many x's include t in their reachable positions. However, this would count all x's where t is reachable and x >= t*d. But in reality, for x < t*d, floor(x/d) < t, so t is not included in the reachable positions of x.\n\nBut this is only true if t is reachable in the transformed problem. So the total sum is the sum over all t (reachable in transformed problem) of max(0, m - t*d + 1).\n\nBut how to find all t that are reachable in the transformed problem?\n\nBut for t >= T', all t are reachable. So for the transformed problem, the reachable positions are:\n\nAll t in [0, T'] that are reachable, plus all t >= T'.\n\nSo the sum can be split into two parts:\n\n1. For t in [0, T'] that are reachable: contribute max(0, m - t*d + 1)\n\n2. For t >= T'+1: contribute max(0, m - t*d + 1)\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me handle each part separately.\n\nFirst, compute the reachable positions in the transformed problem for t in [0, T'].\n\nThen, for the first part, sum over those t.\n\nFor the second part, the number of t's is infinite, but since x can't exceed m, we can find the minimum t where t*d <= m.\n\nLet me think about the second part.\n\nFor t >= T'+1, and t*d <= m.\n\nThe contribution is sum_{t = T'+1}^{floor(m/d)} (m - t*d + 1).\n\nBut since for t >= T'+1, all t are reachable.\n\nLet me compute this sum.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nmax_t = floor(m / d)\n\nif max_t < T'+1, then this part contributes 0.\n\nElse:\n\nThe sum from t = T'+1 to max_t of (m - t*d + 1) = sum_{t = T'+1}^{max_t} ( (m +1) - d*t )\n\nWhich is equal to (m+1)*(max_t - T') - d * sum_{t=T'+1}^{max_t} t.\n\nSum_{t=a}^b t = (b*(b+1)/2) - ((a-1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line from position 0, given it can jump either `a` steps forward or `b` steps backward. The challenge is to compute the sum of these counts for all values from 0 to `m`, considering the constraints that the frog cannot jump outside the interval [0, x] for each x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. This simplifies the problem by reducing it to analyzing positions in terms of this gcd.\n2. **Transformed Problem**: By dividing both `a` and `b` by their gcd, we transform the problem into one where the new values are coprime. This allows us to use properties of coprime numbers to determine reachable positions.\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: For coprime values `a'` and `b'`, the threshold `T'` is calculated as `a' + b' - 1`. Beyond this threshold, all positions can be reached.\n4. **Summing Contributions**: We compute contributions from positions below the threshold and those above separately. For positions above the threshold, we use arithmetic series to efficiently compute their contributions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        m = int(input[idx])\n        a = int(input[idx+1])\n        b = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        d = math.gcd(a, b)\n        a_prime = a // d\n        b_prime = b // d\n        \n        if d == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        \n        T_prime = a_prime + b_prime - 1\n        max_t = m // d\n        \n        # Precompute reachable positions up to T_prime in transformed space\n        # Using BFS\n        reachable = set()\n        from collections import deque\n        queue = deque()\n        queue.append(0)\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add(0)\n        while queue:\n            current = queue.popleft()\n            if current > T_prime:\n                continue\n            # Add a_prime\n            next_pos = current + a_prime\n            if next_pos <= T_prime and next_pos not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_pos)\n                queue.append(next_pos)\n            # Subtract b_prime\n            next_pos = current - b_prime\n            if next_pos >= 0 and next_pos <= T_prime and next_pos not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_pos)\n                queue.append(next_pos)\n        # Now, visited contains all reachable positions in transformed space up to T_prime\n        # Compute sum_part1: for t in visited, which are <= T_prime\n        sum_part1 = 0\n        for t in visited:\n            if t * d <= m:\n                count = m - t * d + 1\n                sum_part1 += count\n        \n        # Compute sum_part2: for t >= T_prime + 1 and t*d <= m\n        start_t = T_prime + 1\n        end_t = max_t\n        if start_t <= end_t:\n            n_terms = end_t - start_t + 1\n            first_term = (m + 1) - d * start_t\n            last_term = (m + 1) - d * end_t\n            sum_part2 = (first_term + last_term) * n_terms // 2\n        else:\n            sum_part2 = 0\n        \n        total = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **GCD Calculation**: The gcd of `a` and `b` determines the step size for reachable positions.\n2. **Transformed Values**: Dividing `a` and `b` by their gcd simplifies the problem to working with coprime values.\n3. **BFS for Reachable Positions**: Using BFS, we determine all reachable positions up to the threshold `T'` in the transformed problem.\n4. **Sum Contributions**: We calculate contributions from positions below and above the threshold separately, using arithmetic series for efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle large values of `m` efficiently by leveraging mathematical properties and avoiding brute-force methods.",
