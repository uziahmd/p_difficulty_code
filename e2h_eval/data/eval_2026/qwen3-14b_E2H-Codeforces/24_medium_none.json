She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, Luba has n tabs open, indexed 1 to n. The mouse is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs except those from l to r inclusive. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to do this. Each second, she can move left or right (but within the current a and b, which are the min and max of the unclosed tabs) or close tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\nHmm. The challenge is figuring out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize time.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial state. Initially, all tabs are open, so a=1, b=n. But as she closes tabs, a and b change. However, since the problem requires that in the end, only [l, r] remains, we need to close all tabs outside that range.\n\nSo, what's the minimal steps needed? Let's consider possible scenarios.\n\nLet me think about the steps required. The key is that closing tabs can be done in one action, but you have to be positioned correctly. So for example, if she can close all tabs to the left of some position, that would take one second. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut how to get to the correct positions to perform these closes?\n\nLet's think about the required closes. The tabs that need to be closed are those less than l and those greater than r.\n\nSo, there are two possible operations: closing the left part (tabs < l) and closing the right part (tabs > r). But to do that, she needs to be at the correct position.\n\nFor example, to close all tabs to the left of l, she must be at position l. Because closing to the left of the current position would close [a, i-1]. So if she is at position l, then closing left would close up to l-1. Similarly, to close the right part, she needs to be at position r, then close right, which would close from r+1 to b.\n\nBut maybe there are other ways. For example, if she closes the left first, then the a becomes l, and then she can close the right part. Or vice versa.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal steps to reach the positions where she can perform these closes, plus the steps needed to move between them.\n\nLet me consider the different cases.\n\nCase 1: The current position is already in the [l, r] range. Then, she may not need to move. But she needs to close the left and right parts.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, suppose l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, she can close the left (tabs <2) by moving to position 2, then close left. Then move to position 4, close right. But how many steps?\n\nWait, let's take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → Output is 5.\n\nIn that case, the steps were:\n\nMove to 2 (from 3, which takes 1 sec), close left (1 sec). Then move to 3 (1 sec?), then to 4 (another sec?), then close right (another sec). Total steps: 1 (move) + 1 (close) + 2 moves (from 2 to 3 to 4) + 1 close = 5 steps. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the steps involve moving to the correct positions to perform the closes.\n\nSo the general approach is to determine whether she needs to close the left and/or the right parts. Let's think about the four possibilities:\n\n1. Close left and close right.\n2. Only close left.\n3. Only close right.\n4. Do nothing (if l <= pos <= r and no tabs outside need to be closed).\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nFirst, check if the current [l, r] is already the entire set. Like in the third sample input where l=1, r=5, n=5. Then no steps are needed.\n\nSo, first, check if l == 1 and r == n. Then answer is 0.\n\nElse, we need to close some tabs.\n\nNow, for the cases where she needs to close left and/or right.\n\nLet me think about the required positions.\n\nIf she needs to close the left part (tabs < l), then she must be at position l. Because when she closes left, it closes all tabs from a to i-1. So, if she is at l, then closing left would close all tabs from a (which is initially 1) up to l-1. But after that, the new a is l. Similarly for closing the right part, she needs to be at r, then close right.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nIf she needs to close left and right:\n\n- Move to l (from current position), then close left (cost: movement steps + 1).\n- Then, move to r (from l's position, which is now l) and close right (cost: movement steps + 1).\n\nBut the movement steps from pos to l, then from l to r.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can first move to r, then close right, then move to l, then close left. Which might be better?\n\nBut in some cases, the order could affect the movement steps. For example, if l is to the left of r, then moving to l first, then to r would require moving from l to r. But if she moves to r first, then to l, that's more steps.\n\nSo the minimal steps would be to do the left and right closes in an order that minimizes movement steps.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps is to move to the leftmost point (l) first, then to the right (r), or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to do it in a single movement.\n\nBut let's think about the steps required.\n\nLet me think of the scenario where both left and right need to be closed.\n\nThe total steps would be:\n\nTime to reach the position where you can close left (l) + 1 (for closing) + time to reach the position where you can close right (r) + 1 (for closing).\n\nBut the movement between the two positions is part of that.\n\nSo, for example, if the initial pos is at x. Then moving from x to l takes |x - l| steps. Then moving from l to r takes |l - r| steps. Then adding 2 for the two closes. So total steps is |x - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Like, if you can close both left and right from the same position?\n\nNo, because to close left, you have to be at l. To close right, you have to be at r. Unless there's another way. Wait, no. Because when you close left, you can close all tabs to the left of your current position. So if you are at position l, closing left would close all tabs before l. Then, after that, the a becomes l. Then, if you are at position l, you can move to r (which is to the right of l), and then close right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can close the left and right in one step if you are at l and r is to the right. Wait, but you can't close both in one step. You need to close left first, then move to r and close right.\n\nSo, the total steps would be:\n\nMovement steps to reach l (from pos) + 1 (close left) + movement steps from l to r (which is r - l steps) + 1 (close right). Total steps: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut what if you first move to r, then close right, then move to l and close left? That would be |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 steps. Which could be better or worse than the previous option.\n\nSo which is better depends on pos, l, and r.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps between the two options is the minimal between (|pos - l| + (r - l) + 2) and (|pos - r| + (r - l) + 2). Wait, but (r - l) is same in both cases. So the difference is between |pos - l| and |pos - r|. So the minimal of the two would be to choose which direction to go first.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think of the case where l is to the left of r, and pos is somewhere in between.\n\nFor example, if pos is between l and r. Then, moving to l would take (pos - l) steps. Then moving to r would take (r - l) steps. Alternatively, moving to r would take (r - pos) steps, then moving to l would take (r - l) steps. So the total movement steps would be (pos - l) + (r - l) vs (r - pos) + (r - l). Which is better depends on whether pos is closer to l or r.\n\nBut in any case, the minimal steps would be the minimal between the two options. But perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps for the case where both left and right need to be closed is (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2 (closes). But that's the same as (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to combine steps. For example, if the pos is already at l, then moving to l takes 0 steps. Then moving to r takes (r - l) steps. Then two closes. So total steps is (r - l) + 2.\n\nAlternatively, if pos is already at r, then moving to r takes 0 steps, then moving to l takes (r - l) steps. Then two closes. Same steps.\n\nBut what if pos is in between l and r? Let's say pos is in the middle. Then moving to l takes (pos - l) steps, then moving to r takes (r - l) steps. So total movement steps is (pos - l) + (r - l). Then add 2 for the closes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to do it with fewer steps. For example, if she can close left and right in some other way.\n\nWait, but after closing left, the a is l. So if you are at position l, and then you can move to r (since the a is l, and the b is n (before closing the right part). So movement is allowed from l to r. So the movement steps between l and r is (r - l) steps.\n\nSo the total steps for both closes is (steps to reach l) + (steps from l to r) + 2.\n\nBut what if she can close both in a different order? Like, if she can close right first, then close left. But that would require moving to r first, then moving to l. So steps to reach r, then steps from r to l, then 2 closes. Which is |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2. Which may be better or worse than the previous option.\n\nSo the minimal steps for the case where both left and right need to be closed is the minimum between (steps to reach l + (r - l) + 2) and (steps to reach r + (r - l) + 2). Which is equivalent to min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut wait, (steps to reach l) is |pos - l|, and steps to reach r is |pos - r|. So the minimal between the two options is min(|pos - l| + (r - l) + 2, |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2) = (r - l) + 2 + min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|).\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let's think about the case where pos is already in the [l, r] range. For example, pos is between l and r. Then, the minimal between |pos - l| and |pos - r| is the distance to the closer end.\n\nBut what if she can close both left and right in a single movement?\n\nNo, because she can't close both in one step. She needs to perform two separate close operations. So the minimal steps would be the steps to reach the first position, then the steps to reach the second, plus two closes.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way. For example, if she can close the left and right in a way that requires less movement.\n\nWait, but she can't close both left and right unless she is at the correct positions.\n\nSo, the minimal steps for the case when both left and right need to be closed is:\n\nmin( (steps to l) + (steps from l to r) + 2, (steps to r) + (steps from r to l) + 2 )\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nmin( |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2, |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 )\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut what if there's a way to do it with fewer steps? For example, if she can close both in one movement? Probably not.\n\nNow, let's think about the case where only left needs to be closed (i.e., r = n). Then, she needs to close left. So she needs to move to l, and then close left. How many steps?\n\nThe steps would be |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBut wait, if she is already at l, then it's 1 step (close left). If she is at l, but the left part is already closed? No, because in this case, the left part is the tabs < l. So she needs to be at l to close them.\n\nSimilarly, if only the right needs to be closed (l = 1), then she needs to move to r and close right. Steps: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFirst, determine whether the left part (tabs < l) needs to be closed. That is, if l > 1. Similarly, whether the right part (tabs > r) needs to be closed, which is if r < n.\n\nSo, for each case:\n\nCase 1: Both left and right need to be closed.\n\nCase 2: Only left needs to be closed.\n\nCase 3: Only right needs to be closed.\n\nCase 4: No closes needed (l=1 and r=n).\n\nSo, how to handle each case.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, check if l == 1 and r == n. Then output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if l > 1 and r < n: both need to be closed.\n\nElse, if l > 1: only left.\n\nElse if r < n: only right.\n\nSo, for the case where both need to be closed:\n\nCompute the minimal steps between moving to l first, then to r, or moving to r first then to l.\n\nBut how?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the minimal steps is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nWait, but why? Because moving to l takes |pos - l| steps, then moving from l to r is (r - l) steps. Then two closes. So total steps is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSimilarly, moving to r first takes |pos - r| steps, then moving to l takes (r - l) steps, then two closes. So total is |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo the minimal between these two options is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut wait, the (r - l) is the same in both cases, so the min between |pos - l| and |pos - r| is the minimal of the two.\n\nBut perhaps there is a better way. For example, if the pos is between l and r, then moving to l is (pos - l) steps, moving to r is (r - l) steps. So total movement steps is (pos - l) + (r - l) = (r - l) + (pos - l). But if pos is in between l and r, then (r - l) is fixed. So the minimal steps would be to choose the closest of l or r.\n\nBut in this case, the minimal steps for the movement part is the minimal of the two options.\n\nSo, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the total steps would be:\n\nmin( |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2, |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 )\n\nWhich can be written as (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut let's test this with the first sample input.\n\nSample 1: n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nHere, l is 2, r is 4. So both left (tabs <2) and right (tabs>4) need to be closed.\n\nSo, for this case, (r - l) is 2. min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) is min(1, 1) = 1. So total steps is 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which matches the sample. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is '6 3 1 3'. So l=1, r=3. So the right part is tabs >3 (i.e., 4,5,6). So in this case, only the right needs to be closed. So steps are |pos - r| + 1. pos is 3, r is 3. So steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input: 5 2 1 5. So l=1, r=5. So no steps needed. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (tabs <2) and right (tabs>3). So l=2, r=3. So steps would be (r-l) = 1, min( |1-2|, |1-3| ) = 1. So total steps 1 + 2 + 1 = 4?\n\nLet me think:\n\nSteps:\n\nMove to l (2) from pos 1: 1 step. Then close left (tabs <2, which is tab 1). Then move to r (3) which is 1 step. Then close right (tabs >3, which are 4 and 5). So total steps: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 steps. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: if pos is already at l. So, for example, pos=2, l=2, r=4. Then steps to close left is 1 (close left), steps to move to r (4) is 2 steps, then close right (1 step). So total steps 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. Which is (r - l) + 2 + min(...). Here, r - l is 2, min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) is min(0, 2) = 0. So total steps 2 + 2 + 0 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to work for this case.\n\nNow, for the case where only left needs to be closed. For example, l=2, r=5 (n=5). So the right part is already included (r=5). So only need to close tabs <2. So steps are |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBut what if the pos is already at l? Then steps is 1.\n\nAnother example: pos is 1, l=2. So steps is |1-2| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Which would be move to 2 (1 step) and close left (1 step). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, if only right needs to be closed, then steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: l = 1, r = n. Output 0.\n\nEdge case 2: l = 1, but r < n. So need to close right. Steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nEdge case 3: r = n, but l > 1. Need to close left. Steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nEdge case 4: l = r. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3. Then, need to close all except tab 3. So need to close left (tabs 1,2) and right (tabs 4,5). So steps would be same as when both left and right are closed. So (r - l) is 0, min(...) is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) = 0. So total steps is 0 + 2 + 0 = 2 steps. Which would be moving to l (3) (steps 0), close left (1 step), then move to r (same as l) (steps 0), close right (1 step). Total 2 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=1 and r=n. So output is 0.\n\nAnother case: when pos is already in the correct position. For example, pos is l and r is n. So need to close left (tabs < l, which is none, since l=1). So no steps. Or if l=2, r=5, pos=2. Then need to close left (tabs <2) and right (tabs>5, which is none). So only need to close left. Steps is |pos - l| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo, putting all this together.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if l > 1 and r < n: both left and right need to be closed.\n\nElse, check if l > 1 (only left) or r < n (only right).\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nCompute:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    ans = 0\n\nelse:\n\n    left_close_needed = (l > 1)\n\n    right_close_needed = (r < n)\n\n    if left_close_needed and right_close_needed:\n\n        # compute steps for both\n\n        steps = (r - l) + 2 + min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\n    elif left_close_needed:\n\n        # only left\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_close_needed:\n\n        # only right\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # impossible, since l and r are not 1 and n. But perhaps when l=1 and r <n, etc.\n\n        # but in that case, the code would have handled it in the above conditions.\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r <n? Then, left_close_needed is false (since l=1), but right_close_needed is true. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if l>1 and r =n, steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input 2: input is 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. So right_close_needed is true (r=3 < 6). So steps is |3 - 3| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input is 6 3 2 4. So both left and right needed. steps is (4-2) + 2 + min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) → 2 + 2 + 1 → 5. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: the third input is 5 2 1 5. So l=1, r=5. So output is 0.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r <n. For example, n=5, l=1, r=3. Then, the right part (tabs 4 and 5) need to be closed. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut what if pos is already at r? Then steps is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=3. So steps is |5 - 3| + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 steps. How?\n\nMove from 5 to 3 (takes 2 steps), then close right (tabs 4 and 5). So steps: 2 + 1 = 3. Correct.\n\nBut what about the movement steps? Because when you are at 3, you can close the right. So yes.\n\nAnother case: when l=2, r=5 (n=5). So need to close left (tabs <2). So steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBut what if pos is 1, l=2. Steps is |1-2| + 1 = 2 steps. Move to 2 (1 step), then close left (1 step). Correct.\n\nSo, the code logic seems solid.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r <n? For example, n=5, l=1, r=3. Then, steps is |pos - r| + 1. But what if the pos is already at r? Then steps is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when l=1 and r= n. Then output 0.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r =n? For example, n=5, l=1, r=5. Then output 0.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nThe code needs to read four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nThen, check if l == 1 and r == n. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, compute left_close_needed and right_close_needed.\n\nBut wait, in the case where l=1, but r is less than n. So, left_close_needed is false (because l=1, no tabs to the left of l). But right_close_needed is true.\n\nSimilarly, if r =n, then right_close_needed is false.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_close_needed = (l > 1)\n\n    right_close_needed = (r < n)\n\n    if left_close_needed and right_close_needed:\n\n        steps = (r - l) + 2 + min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\n    elif left_close_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_close_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # This is impossible, because if l ==1 and r ==n is already handled. So in this else, either left or right is needed.\n\n        # Wait, for example, if l=1 and r <n. Then left_close_needed is false, right_close_needed is true.\n\n        # Or if l>1 and r =n: left_close_needed is true, right is false.\n\n        # So this else case is not possible. So perhaps the code can proceed.\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r =n? That's handled in the first condition.\n\nBut what about if l=1 and r <n? Then left_close_needed is false, right_close_needed is true. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when l=1, r <n, and pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 5 2 1 3. So n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3. So need to close right. steps is |2 - 3| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Let's see:\n\nMove from 2 to 3 (1 step), then close right (tabs 4 and 5). Total steps 2. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=3. steps is |5 -3| + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 steps. Which is moving from 5 to 3 (2 steps), then close right (1 step). Correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the case where l is 1, r is n-1. So need to close right. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut let's check the sample input 2: input is 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. So steps is |3 - 3| + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the third example: 5 2 1 5. So output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when l is 3, r is 5, n=5, pos=3. So need to close left (tabs <3). So steps is |3-3| +1 = 1. Which is correct: close left (tabs 1 and 2) by being at 3 and closing left.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=5, n=5, pos=1. Steps is |1 -3| +1 = 2 +1 =3. Steps: move from 1 to 3 (2 steps), close left (1 step). Total 3 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=5, n=5, pos=4. Steps is |4-3| +1 = 1 +1 = 2 steps. So move to 3 (1 step), close left (1 step). Correct.\n\nBut what about when the pos is already to the right of l? For example, pos=4, l=3. So moving to l is 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead the input line. Wait, the input is given as a single line with four integers. But looking at the sample input, the first example input is ['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5'] — but that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is the only line of input. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo the input is a single line with four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is only one line. So perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code should process a single line.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut this seems to be three test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases, but the actual code should read one line per test case. However, the problem says that the input is the only line of input. So perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement's sample, but according to the problem description, the code should read a single line of input.\n\nBut looking back, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers ... \n\nTherefore, the code should read four integers from a single line.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three lines. Which suggests that perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code reads one line per test case. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Therefore, the code should read four integers from a single line.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided three lines. But that's probably a formatting error. So the code should read four integers from input, e.g., for the first sample input, the input is \"6 3 2 4\".\n\nThus, the code will read the input line, split into four integers, process them, and output the answer.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into n, pos, l, r.\n\nThen compute as discussed.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_needed = l > 1\n\n    right_needed = r < n\n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n        steps = (r - l) + 2 + min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\n    elif left_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # This is impossible since l and r are not 1 and n. But for example, if l=1 and r <n, then right_needed is True.\n\n        # Or if l>1 and r =n, then left_needed is True.\n\n        # So this else case can't happen.\n\n        steps = 0  # Not sure, but perhaps not needed.\n\n    print(steps)\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r <n? Then left_needed is False, right_needed is True. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test the code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: input is 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. So left_needed = True (2>1), right_needed = True (4<6). So steps is (4-2) + 2 + min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) → 2 + 2 + 1 → 5. Correct.\n\nSample 2: input 6 3 1 3. l=1, r=3. So left_needed is False (1 is not >1), right_needed is True (3 <6). steps is |3-3| +1 → 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nSample 3: input 5 2 1 5. l=1, r=5. So the first condition is true (l==1 and r==n) → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So left_needed is True, right_needed is True. steps is (3-2) + 2 + min( |1-2|, |1-3| ) → 1 + 2 + 1 =4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3. So right_needed is True (r=3 <5). steps is |3-3| +1 = 1. Which is correct (close right).\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=3. steps is |5-3| +1 = 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3. So l=3, r=3. So l is not 1, r is not 5. So left_needed is True (3>1?), yes. right_needed is True (3 <5). So steps is (3-3) + 2 + min( |3-3|, |3-3| ) → 0 + 2 + 0 = 2. Which is correct: move to l (no steps), close left (tabs <3). Then move to r (no steps), close right (tabs >3). So total 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r <n, but pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 +1 =1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=5, n=5. So right_needed is false (r=5 ==n). left_needed is True (2>1). steps is |pos - l| +1. For example, pos=2: 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the Python code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs except those within a specified range [l, r]. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of movements and closing operations based on the current position of the mouse cursor and the tabs that need to be closed.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no actions are needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Determine Closing Needs**: Check if tabs to the left of l (if l > 1) or to the right of r (if r < n) need to be closed.\n3. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - **Both Left and Right Closes Needed**: Calculate the steps required to move to the closest end of the range [l, r], then close both sides.\n   - **Only Left Close Needed**: Calculate the steps to move to l and close the left side.\n   - **Only Right Close Needed**: Calculate the steps to move to r and close the right side.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needed = l > 1\n    right_needed = r < n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n        steps = (r - l) + 2 + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))\n    elif left_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        steps = 0  # This case should not occur given the initial check\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] is already the entire set of tabs, no operations are needed.\n- **Closing Tabs**: Depending on whether tabs need to be closed on the left, right, or both sides, we compute the minimum steps required:\n  - **Both Sides**: Move to the nearest end of the range [l, r], then close both sides. The steps include moving to the nearest end, moving to the other end, and two closing operations.\n  - **Single Side**: Directly move to the respective end (l or r) and perform one closing operation.\n\nThis approach ensures that we minimize the number of movements and operations by leveraging the closest positions for closing tabs efficiently.",
