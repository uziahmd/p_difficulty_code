A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts each can make, given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (bottles of drink), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, first, calculate how much total drink they have. That's k multiplied by l. Then, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, because each of the n friends needs nl per toast. So total drink divided by (n * nl) gives the maximum possible toasts based on drink.\n\nThen for the lime slices: each lime is cut into d slices, so total slices are c * d. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices are needed. So total slices divided by n gives the maximum toasts based on limes.\n\nFor the salt: total is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So p divided by (n * np) gives the maximum toasts based on salt.\n\nThe answer is the minimum of those three values, since all three resources are required. But also, since each toast is made by all friends, the number of toasts can't exceed any of these three limits.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l\ntotal_drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\ntotal_lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the total_drink was 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So per toast, each of the n friends has nl. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. So for the first example, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. Total drink is 20. 20 / 9 is 2.222..., so floor to 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the code should compute these three values and take the minimum.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead the input line as integers. Then compute each of the three components.\n\nBut wait, what if any of the denominators are zero? No, the problem says that all inputs are positive integers. So division is okay.\n\nBut in Python, integer division with // truncates towards negative infinity, but since all values are positive, it's okay.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. n * nl = 3*3=9. 20//9 = 2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = 10 * 8 = 80. divided by n=3 → 80//3=26. But wait, the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nWait, each toast requires a slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. So total slices is c*d. So the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n. For the first sample, 10*8=80 slices. Divided by 3 friends per toast → 80//3 is 26. But the sample says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". Wait why? Because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, there's n slices needed. So for example, if there are 80 slices, and each toast uses 3 slices (since n=3), then the number of toasts is 80//3 = 26. But the sample says that the limes are enough for ",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, so we need to calculate how many toasts can be made based on each resource and then take the minimum of these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Total Drink Calculation**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. Determine how many toasts can be made based on the drink by dividing the total drink by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n2. **Lime Slices Calculation**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime. Determine how many toasts can be made based on the lime slices by dividing the total slices by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Salt Calculation**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the available salt by dividing the total grams of salt by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n4. **Determine Minimum**: The answer is the minimum value among the toasts possible from each of the three resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\ntoast_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink is calculated as `k * l`. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink, so the number of toasts possible from the drink is `total_drink // (n * nl)`.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend), so the number of toasts possible from the limes is `total_lime_slices // n`.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total amount of salt is `p` grams. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt, so the number of toasts possible from the salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n- **Result**: The minimum value among the toasts possible from each resource gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all resources are sufficient.",
