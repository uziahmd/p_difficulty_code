A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible value based on the constraints from each resource.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for each toast, each friend uses these amounts. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl, because each of the n friends has nl. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend needs one slice), and n * np grams of salt.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of drink available: k * l. Then, how many toasts can be made based on drink? It's (total_drink) // (n * nl). Because each toast requires n * nl ml.\n\n2. Calculate total lime slices: c * d. Each toast needs n slices. So total toasts possible from limes is (c * d) // n.\n\n3. For salt: total salt is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So possible toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nWait, yes. Because each toast requires all three resources. So the maximum number of toasts possible is the minimum of the three possible values calculated from each resource.\n\nBut wait, let me check the example given.\n\nIn the first example input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4 *5 =20 ml. Each toast requires 3 *3 =9 ml (since nl is 3). Wait wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. For example, in the first sample, per toast, 3 *3 =9 ml. Total drink is 20. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the note's explanation.\n\nYes. Then the drink allows 2 toasts.\n\nLimes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices (since n=3). 80 /3 is 26.666... floor is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, wait, what's the problem here?\n\nWait the note says that in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nAh, because the note says that the limes are enough for 10 *8=80 toasts. Wait, but according to my calculation, each toast requires n slices, which is 3. So 80 slices would allow 80 /3 =26.666, which is 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Oh, that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. So for the first sample, 3 friends per toast, so 3 slices per toast. The total slices available is 10 *8=80. So 80 /3 is 26.666, so 26 toasts. However, according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's a contradiction. So where is my mistake here?\n\nWait looking back at the note:\n\nIn the first sample, the note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 20 ml of drink, which is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10*8=80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100/1=100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2",
