The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has their own sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they get.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find what move each player makes. Then determine who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how the moves are determined. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus's move, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo for each round, we can compute the moves, then check who wins. But for n up to 2e9, checking each round is O(n), which is way too slow. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be computed once and then multiplied.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the possible cycles. Since the moves for each player repeat every m and k steps respectively, the combined pattern of their moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because LCM(m, k) is the least common multiple of m and k. So after LCM(m, k) rounds, the sequence of move pairs will repeat.\n\nSo the idea is: find the number of rounds in one full cycle (let's call it cycle_length = LCM(m, k)), then compute how many full cycles there are in n rounds, and then the remaining rounds.\n\nFor each full cycle, we can precompute how many times Nikephoros loses (countA) and Polycarpus loses (countB). Then multiply those counts by the number of full cycles. Then process the remaining rounds (n % cycle_length) in a straightforward way.\n\nThis approach would reduce the problem to O(cycle_length) time, which is acceptable because m and k are up to 1000, so their LCM can be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000 is 1e6, but LCM could be up to that). So even for 1e6, it's manageable.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n2. Compute cycle_length = LCM(m, k). How to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So need to compute GCD first.\n\n3. For each round in 0 to cycle_length - 1, compute the moves for A and B, determine who wins, and accumulate the counts for a full cycle.\n\n4. Then, total_cycles = n // cycle_length, and remainder_rounds = n % cycle_length.\n\n5. The total counts would be total_cycles * countA and total_cycles * countB, plus the counts from the first remainder_rounds rounds.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute the counts for the remainder_rounds?\n\nYes. So for the remainder_rounds, I can loop from 0 to remainder_rounds-1, compute each move pair, and add to the counts.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the LCM and GCD. Let's think about that.\n\nImplementing GCD in Python can be done with math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's fine. However, to compute LCM, we can do:\n\nlcm = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n\nBut need to handle cases where m or k is zero? No, since per the input constraints, m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B strings.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute gcd(m, k), then lcm = m * k // gcd.\n\nThen, for the full cycles:\n\nCompute how many full cycles there are: total_cycles = n // lcm.\n\nThen, for each full cycle, we have countA and countB.\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds, which is rem = n % lcm, we process each of the rem rounds.\n\nSo, the key part is to compute for each possible round in 0..lcm-1, what the outcome is.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nFor each i in 0 to lcm-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen determine who wins.\n\nSo, for each such i, we can compute the outcome.\n\nSo, for the full cycle, we can precompute the countA and countB for the entire cycle.\n\nOnce we have that, multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, we process each of them.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\ndef calculate_spots(n, A, B):\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM\n\n    from math import gcd\n\n    g = gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // g\n\n    # compute the counts for one full cycle\n\n    cycle_a = 0\n\n    cycle_b = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        # determine outcome\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B gets a spot\n\n            cycle_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A gets a spot\n\n            cycle_a +=1\n\n    # total_cycles = n // lcm\n\n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n\n    rem = n % lcm\n\n    # total for full cycles\n\n    total_a = total_cycles * cycle_a\n\n    total_b = total_cycles * cycle_b\n\n    # process rem rounds\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            total_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_a +=1\n\n    return total_a, total_b\n\nWait, but in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is RPS (m=3), B is RSPP (k=4). LCM(3,4) is 12. So for each cycle of 12 rounds, compute the counts.\n\nBut the sample input has n=7 rounds. So total_cycles is 0, rem=7. So process 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the example explanation, the output is 3 and 2.\n\nLet me check.\n\nIn the example, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → A's move is P, B's move is S. Wait, what's the sequence?\n\nWait, the first sample input is:\n\nn=7, A is \"RPS\" (so m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4).\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds:\n\nRound 0 (assuming 0-based index):\n\ni=0 → A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw.\n\ni=1 → A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S. P vs S: S beats P. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So total_a increases by 1.\n\nWait, the sample explanation says:\n\nRound 1: R-R (draw). Then P vs S (second round?), which would be Nikephoros's P vs Polycarpus's S. According to the rules, scissors (S) beats paper (P), so Nikephoros loses. So in the code, the code checks if a is P and b is S. Then the condition (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R') → no. Because a is P and b is S. So the condition is (a is P and b is S) → which is not in any of the three cases. Wait, the code's condition is checking when A wins. So if a beats b, then B gets a spot (since A wins, B loses). So in this case, a is P, b is S. S beats P. So B wins, so A loses. So the code would check if the condition is true. Let's see:\n\nThe code says:\n\nif a == b: continue.\n\nElse, if (a beats b) → then B gets a spot. Else, A gets a spot.\n\nSo for a = P, b = S: what's the condition?\n\nThe condition for A winning is:\n\n(a is R and b is S) → yes, R beats S.\n\nOr (a is S and b is P) → S beats P.\n\nOr (a is P and b is R) → P beats R.\n\nSo in the case where a is P and b is S: none of these conditions are met. So the code would go to the else clause, which is B wins. So in this case, A loses, so total_a increases by 1.\n\nWhich is correct. So in the sample's second round (i=1?), the code adds 1 to total_a.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the first round (probably i=0) is a draw. Then the second round (i=1) is P vs S. Nikephoros (A) loses, so his count increases by 1. Then third round (i=2) is S vs P. So A's move is S, B's move is P. S beats P → A wins. So B loses. So total_b increases by 1. Then i=3: A's move is R (since 3%3 is 0, so A[0] is R). B's move is 3%4=3 → B[3] is P. R vs P: P beats R. So B wins. So A loses → total_a increases by 1. Then i=4: A's move is 4%3=1 → P. B's move is 4%4=0 → R. P vs R: P beats R. A wins → B loses. So total_b increases by 1. i=5: A is 5%3=2 → S. B is 5%4=1 → S. Draw. i=6: A is 6%3=0 → R. B is 6%4=2 → P. R vs P → P beats R. B wins. So A loses. total_a increases by 1. So for the 7 rounds, total_a is 3 (from rounds 1, 3, 6?), and total_b is 2 (rounds 2 and 4).\n\nSo the code would compute that correctly. So the code seems to be correct.\n\nNow, what about the sample input where n=5, A is RRRRRR (length 6?), B is R. Then the output is 0 0. Because all rounds are draws.\n\nBut let's see. For each round, A's move is R, B's move is R. So all draws. So the code would return 0 and 0.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about when n is larger than the LCM?\n\nFor example, say n is 12 + 5. Then total_cycles is 1, and rem is 5. So the code would compute the counts for the full cycle once, and then the first 5 rounds of the next cycle.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python. Now, considering that for n up to 2e9, and LCM up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1e3, LCM can be up to 1e3*1e3=1e6). So for the worst case, the code would process 1e6 rounds for the full cycle, and then up to 1e6 rounds for the remainder. Which is acceptable for Python's speed.\n\nBut wait, for m and k up to 1000, the LCM could be up to 1000*1000 = 1,000,000. So for each test case, the code would process 1e6 steps for the full cycle, and another 1e6 steps for the remainder. So for each test case, O(2e6) steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the inputs. Let's see the input format.\n\nThe first line is n. Then the second line is the sequence A, third line is B.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is read as follows: the first line is n, then the second line is A, then third line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 7, then A is RPS (length 3), B is RSPP (length 4). So the code should read n as integer, then read the next two lines as A and B.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read:\n\nimport sys, math\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nB = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut need to be careful with possible leading/trailing whitespaces, but the problem says that the input lines are the sequences, so probably they are read correctly.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the code as outlined.\n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, like 2e9, the code would still run as the loops are O(1e6) steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the function.\n\nBut wait, what if the LCM is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // gcd_val\n    # Compute counts for one full cycle\n    cycle_a = 0\n    cycle_b = 0\n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        # Determine winner\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            # A wins, B gets a spot\n            cycle_b += 1\n        else:\n            # B wins, A gets a spot\n            cycle_a += 1\n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n    rem = n % lcm\n    total_a = total_cycles * cycle_a\n    total_b = total_cycles * cycle_b\n    # Process remaining rounds\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            total_a += 1\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first example's output is 3 2. Let's see what the code would compute.\n\nFor the first sample:\n\nn=7, A is RPS (m=3), B is RSPP (k=4). LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nSo for the first 12 rounds, the code computes cycle_a and cycle_b. Then total_cycles is 7//12=0, rem=7.\n\nSo the code processes 7 rounds.\n\nWhich is exactly the example's case. So the code should compute the correct values.\n\nAnother test case is the second example, input:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is 'RRRRRRRR' (length 8?), B is 'R' (length 1). LCM(8,1) is 8. For each of the 8 rounds, all moves are R vs R. So cycle_a and cycle_b are 0. Then n=5, total_cycles is 5//8=0, rem=5. So processing 5 rounds, all draws. So total_a and total_b are 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: when m=1 and k=1. For example, A is R, B is S. Then for each round, A's move is R, B's move is S. So A wins, B gets a spot. So for n=1, output is 0 1. For n=2, output is 0 2.\n\nAnother case: A is R, B is P. Then B wins, so A gets a spot. So for n=1, output is 1 0.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about when the LCM is large, but n is small?\n\nLike m=1000, k=1000. LCM is 1000. So for n=1000, the code will process the full cycle once, and rem is 0.\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves.

The moves repeat every `m` rounds for Nikephoros and every `k` rounds for Polycarpus.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds, where LCM is the least common multiple of the lengths of the two sequences.\n3. **Precompute Outcomes**: Calculate the number of losses for each player over one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds.\n4. **Scale Up**: Use the precomputed results for full cycles and handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute the LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // gcd_val\n    \n    cycle_a = 0\n    cycle_b = 0\n    \n    # Calculate the number of losses in one full cycle\n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n           (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n           (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # A wins, B gets a spot\n            cycle_b += 1\n        else:\n            # B wins, A gets a spot\n            cycle_a += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n    rem = n % lcm\n    \n    total_a = total_cycles * cycle_a\n    total_b = total_cycles * cycle_b\n    \n    # Process the remaining rounds\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n           (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n           (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read, including the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the sequences is computed to determine the cycle length after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round within one LCM cycle, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome of each round is recorded. This helps in determining the number of losses for each player in one full cycle.\n4. **Scaling Results**: The number of full cycles within the total number of rounds is calculated, and the losses from these cycles are scaled accordingly.\n5. **Remaining Rounds**: Any remaining rounds after accounting for full cycles are processed individually to determine the final counts of losses.\n\nThis approach efficiently reduces the problem complexity by leveraging the periodicity of the sequences, ensuring that even very large values of `n` can be handled within feasible time limits.",
