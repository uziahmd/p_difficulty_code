The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round, they use their own sequences cyclically. The key here is to simulate the rounds efficiently because n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big for a straightforward simulation.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to model their moves for each round. Since their sequences repeat cyclically, the moves for each player are determined by their respective sequence's length. For example, Nikephoros's move in round i (0-based or 1-based?) depends on i mod m, where m is the length of his sequence A. Similarly for Polycarpus with his sequence B and length k.\n\nBut simulating each of the n rounds directly is impossible for large n. So we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the possible cycles. The combined sequence of moves for both players would repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so their moves will start repeating.\n\nSo the idea is to compute the number of full cycles of LCM(m, k) rounds in n rounds, and then compute the number of losses in one cycle, multiply by the number of full cycles, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, let's confirm that. Let me see: For each round, the moves are determined by (i mod m) for A and (i mod k) for B. The pattern of (a_i, b_i) pairs will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. So yes, the entire sequence of rounds can be divided into cycles of length LCM(m, k). So if we can compute the number of losses in one cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles, and then handle the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n\n2. For each round in the cycle (from 0 to cycle_length - 1), determine the moves of A and B, check who wins, and count the losses for each player.\n\n3. The total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % cycle_length.\n\n5. The total losses for each player would be total_cycles * (losses in one cycle) + losses in the first rem rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how do we compute the losses in one cycle and the first rem rounds?\n\nThe problem is that for each round in the cycle, we need to know the moves of A and B. For that, for each round index i (starting from 0?), we can compute a_i = A[i % m], and b_i = B[i % k].\n\nBut for cycle_length, since it's LCM(m, k), the total number of rounds in a cycle is LCM(m, k). So for each i from 0 to cycle_length-1, we can compute the moves and check the outcome.\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000 is 1e6, but LCM is up to that). For example, if m=1000 and k=1000, then LCM is 1000 if they are same, but if they are coprime, like 1000 and 999, then LCM is 999000. So for 1e6, even if n is 2e9, the cycle_length is manageable. Because 2e9 / 1e6 is 2e3, which is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the number of losses per cycle (for each of the cycle_length rounds).\n\n- Then calculate how many full cycles there are and multiply by the per-cycle counts.\n\n- Then process the remaining rounds (rem) by checking the first rem rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how do we compute the per-cycle counts?\n\nLet me think about the steps in code:\n\nFirst, compute m and k as the lengths of A and B.\n\nCompute LCM(m, k). To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So need to compute GCD first.\n\nThen, for each round in 0 to cycle_length - 1:\n\n- a_move = A[round % m]\n\n- b_move = B[round % k]\n\nCheck who wins, and increment the counts for each player accordingly.\n\nOnce we have the counts for one cycle (total_a_loss, total_b_loss), then:\n\nfull_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nremaining_rounds = n % cycle_length\n\nThen, the total_a = full_cycles * total_a_loss + count_remaining_a (similar for b).\n\nNow, for the remaining_rounds, we need to process the first 'remaining_rounds' rounds of the cycle. But how? Well, for each i in 0 to remaining_rounds - 1, compute the moves and check the outcome. However, if remaining_rounds is up to cycle_length, which is up to 1e6, then for n up to 2e9, this is acceptable. Because 1e6 operations are manageable.\n\nSo the overall time complexity is O(cycle_length), which is O(1e6) in worst case, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nBut first, let's think about the functions needed.\n\nImplementing GCD: Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which we have here. So for m and k, compute GCD, then LCM.\n\nBut what about when m or k is zero? No, the constraints say that m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B as strings.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute cycle_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each round in 0 to cycle_length - 1, the a_move and b_move, and compute the number of times each player loses in this cycle.\n\nOnce that's done, compute full_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\nremaining_rounds = n % cycle_length.\n\nThen, the total_a_loss = full_cycles * per_cycle_a_loss + count_remaining_a_loss.\n\nSame for b.\n\nNow, how to compute the per_cycle_a_loss and per_cycle_b_loss.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to cycle_length-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen, determine who wins.\n\nFor each such pair, we can check:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nelse:\n\nif a beats b: then Nikephoros (A) wins, so Polycarpus (B) gets a loss (so B's count increases by 1).\n\nElse: B wins, so Nikephoros (A) gets a loss (A's count increases by 1).\n\nSo, for each round, we can compute whether a or b loses.\n\nSo, the function to check who wins.\n\nHow to model the winning conditions.\n\nWe can have a helper function, like:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # a wins\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # b wins\n\nSo, for each pair (a, b), if the return is 1, then B loses (so Nikephoros's count increases by 1?), wait no:\n\nWait, Nikephoros is A. So if A wins, then B is the loser. So Nikephoros's red spots are the number of times he lost. So when A loses, Nikephoros gets a red spot. So:\n\nif the result is 1 (A wins), then B loses, so Polycarpus's count (the second number) increases by 1.\n\nif the result is -1 (B wins), then Nikephoros (A) loses, so his count (first number) increases by 1.\n\nSo during the per_cycle processing, for each round, we check the winner and increment the counts accordingly.\n\nSo, for the per_cycle_a_loss and per_cycle_b_loss variables, we can initialize them to 0, then for each i in 0 to cycle_length -1:\n\ncompute a and b moves.\n\nif the result is 1 (A wins): then B loses, so per_cycle_b_loss +=1\n\nif the result is -1 (B wins): then A loses, so per_cycle_a_loss +=1\n\nif 0: nothing.\n\nOnce that is done, then for the full_cycles, multiply per_cycle_a_loss and per_cycle_b_loss by full_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds, we need to process the first rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1) and compute the same way.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        while b:\n\n            a, b = b, a % b\n\n        return a\n\n    # compute LCM\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // g\n\n    # Now, compute per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b\n\n    per_cycle_a = 0\n\n    per_cycle_b = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        # determine winner\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            per_cycle_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            per_cycle_a +=1\n\n    # Now compute full_cycles and rem\n\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n\n    rem = n % lcm\n\n    # Now compute the total for the full cycles\n\n    total_a = full_cycles * per_cycle_a\n\n    total_b = full_cycles * per_cycle_b\n\n    # Now compute the rem rounds\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            total_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            total_a +=1\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's test this code.\n\nSample input:\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nSo for each of the 12 rounds, compute the per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b.\n\nLet me simulate that.\n\nBut perhaps the code would compute that correctly.\n\nIn the first sample, the output is 3 2.\n\nLet me see:\n\nn is 7. LCM(3,4) is 12. So full_cycles is 0, rem=7.\n\nSo the code would process the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to the example explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → A (P) beats B (S)? Wait, the sample says that in the first sample, the rounds are:\n\nLooking at the note:\n\nIn the first sample, the game went like this:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses. Wait, how?\n\nWait, the sample says:\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses? Wait, P (paper) vs S (scissors). Scissors beats paper. So B's move is S, which beats A's P. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So in that round, total_a increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the first sample, Nikephoros has 3 losses and Polycarpus 2.\n\nBut let's check the code's calculation for the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct. Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps I should check the code's logic for the first example.\n\nBut let me think about the code's processing of the first 7 rounds.\n\nFor each i from 0 to 6 (since rem is 7).\n\ni ranges from 0 to 6 (7 rounds).\n\nFor each i:\n\na_move is A[i % 3], B[i %4].\n\nLet me list each round:\n\nRound 0 (i=0):\n\nA: 0%3=0 → 'R'\n\nB: 0%4=0 → 'R' → draw. No change.\n\nRound 1 (i=1):\n\nA:1%3=1 → 'P'\n\nB:1%4=1 → 'S'\n\nP vs S: S beats P. So B wins. So A loses. total_a +=1.\n\nRound 2 (i=2):\n\nA: 2%3=2 → 'S'\n\nB: 2%4=2 → 'P'\n\nS vs P: S beats P. A wins. B loses. So total_b +=1.\n\nRound 3 (i=3):\n\nA:3%3=0 → 'R'\n\nB:3%4=3 → 'P'\n\nR vs P: P beats R. B wins. A loses. total_a +=1.\n\nRound 4 (i=4):\n\nA:4%3=1 → 'P'\n\nB:4%4=0 → 'R'\n\nP vs R: P beats R. A wins. B loses. total_b +=1.\n\nRound 5 (i=5):\n\nA:5%3=2 → 'S'\n\nB:5%4=1 → 'S'\n\nDraw. No change.\n\nRound 6 (i=6):\n\nA:6%3=0 → 'R'\n\nB:6%4=2 → 'P'\n\nR vs P: B wins. A loses. total_a +=1.\n\nSo after these 7 rounds:\n\ntotal_a is 1 (from i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) → total 3.\n\ntotal_b is 1 (i=2) + 1 (i=4) → total 2. Which matches the sample output. So the code would produce 3 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct for that case.\n\nAnother test case is when n is 5, and A is RRRRRR (length 6?), B is R (length 1). So the sample input given in the example is:\n\nSample input 2:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput is 0 0.\n\nWait, the input is:\n\nSecond example input is:\n\n['5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR', '0 0']\n\nWait, the input is:\n\nn=5, A is RRRRRRRR (length 8?), B is R (length 1). So for all rounds, both play R. All draws. So output 0 0.\n\nSo code would compute LCM(8,1) = 8. full_cycles = 5//8 = 0, rem=5. Then process 5 rounds. For each round, A's move is R, B's move is R. So no changes. So output 0 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about cases where the LCM is smaller than n?\n\nAnother example: Let's say n=12, m=3, k=4. So LCM is 12. So full_cycles = 1, rem=0. So the per_cycle counts are computed once. So the code would multiply by 1 and add 0.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the sequences are longer than n?\n\nLike, n=2, m=3, k=3. Then LCM is 3. So full_cycles = 0, rem=2. Process 2 rounds.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. But let's check for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. So A's move is R, B's move is S. R beats S. So A wins, B loses. So output is 0 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1, A is 'S', B is 'R'. S loses to R. So A loses, so output is 1 0.\n\nSo code would handle that.\n\nNow, the code uses math.gcd, but in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. However, in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, the code uses math.gcd. Wait, in the code above, the code has:\n\ng = math.gcd(m, k)\n\nBut the code also defines a gcd function. Wait, no. Looking back, the code in the outline:\n\nOriginal code outline:\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        while b:\n\n            a, b = b, a % b\n\n        return a\n\n    # compute LCM\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n\nWait, no. Wait in the code outline I wrote earlier, the code uses math.gcd. But in the code, the code has a gcd function. Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nNo, in the code outline I wrote earlier, the code uses math.gcd. But the code may not have imported math. Oh right, in the code, we need to import math.\n\nWait, the code outline as written earlier includes:\n\nimport math\n\nBut in the code, the code uses math.gcd. So the code would need to import math.\n\nBut in the code outline I wrote earlier, the code is:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    ...\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // g\n\nBut in the code, the code uses math.gcd, which is correct.\n\nBut in Python 3, math.gcd returns the correct value for positive integers.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, in the code, the code reads the input. However, in the sample input, the first line is the n, then the second line is A, third line is B. But in the example given, the input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWhich is probably a mistake in the way the input is presented. But in reality, the input is:\n\nFirst line: n.\n\nSecond line: A.\n\nThird line: B.\n\nSo in the first sample input, the first line is 7, second line is RPS, third line is RSPP.\n\nSo the code reads n, then A, then B.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, considering the code, the only thing left is to handle the cases where m or k is 0. But according to the problem statement, m and k are at least 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut let me check the code again for the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nm=3, k=4.\n\nlcm is 12.\n\nfull_cycles is 7//12=0, rem=7.\n\nSo the code loops over rem=7 rounds, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nAnother test case: when n is equal to LCM(m, k). For example, n=12, then full_cycles=1, rem=0. So the code adds per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b once.\n\nThus, code is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, for very large numbers, the code is efficient enough. Because even for m and k up to 1000, the LCM is up to 1e6, and the code runs in O(1e6) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNeed to import math.\n\nBut in the code, the code uses math.gcd. However, in some versions, math.gcd may not be available. But in Python 3.5+, it's available.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // g\n\n    per_cycle_a = 0\n\n    per_cycle_b = 0\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            per_cycle_b += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            per_cycle_a += 1\n\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n\n    rem = n % lcm\n\n    total_a = full_cycles * per_cycle_a\n\n    total_b = full_cycles * per_cycle_b\n\n    # process rem rounds\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            total_b += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_a += 1\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the code, for reading the input, sometimes the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, since the problem says that the input is given as per the description. Also, the code uses strip() for A and B, which removes any leading/trailing whitespace. But according to the problem statement, the input is given as sequences of characters, so the code is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSample Output: 3 2.\n\nWhich is handled correctly.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput is 0 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, A='R', B='S' → output is 0 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='S', B='R' → output 1 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when LCM is larger than n?\n\nYes, handled correctly.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after they play n rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when n is very large (up to 2·10^9).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Patterns**: Both players use cyclic sequences for their moves. The key insight is that the sequence of moves for both players will repeat every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to break down the problem into smaller cycles.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This determines the length of one complete cycle of moves.\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: For each round within one cycle, determine the outcome of the game and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Compute how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds (n) and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // g\n    \n    per_cycle_a = 0\n    per_cycle_b = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            per_cycle_b += 1\n        else:\n            per_cycle_a += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    rem = n % lcm\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * per_cycle_a\n    total_b = full_cycles * per_cycle_b\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the cycle length.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within the cycle length, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcomes are recorded.\n4. **Full Cycles Handling**: The number of full cycles is calculated, and the losses from one cycle are multiplied by the number of full cycles.\n5. **Remaining Rounds**: The remaining rounds after the full cycles are processed individually to account for any leftover rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large values of n by leveraging the repeating nature of the sequences, thus reducing the complexity from O(n) to O(LCM(m, k)), which is feasible given the constraints.",
