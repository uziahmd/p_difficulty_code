In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The answer is the minimum number of tiles required to achieve either of these.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. So the first thing is to parse those three tiles.\n\nThe output is the minimum number of draws needed. Let's think about the possible cases.\n\nFor the current three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to get either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n2. If not, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how to check for existing mentsu?\n\nFor a triplet: all three tiles must be same. So check if all three are same. For example, '9m 9m 9m' would be a triplet.\n\nFor a sequence: they must be three consecutive numbers in the same suit. Like 1s, 2s, 3s. But the order doesn't matter. So the three tiles must have same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence. So for example, 2s, 3s, 1s would be a sequence.\n\nSo first, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases where the current three tiles can be extended into a triplet or sequence with minimal additions.\n\nCase 1: Can form a triplet by adding one or two tiles. For example, if there are two same tiles, then adding one more would make a triplet. So if the three tiles have two same, then the answer could be 1. Or if there are two pairs, like two 1s and two 2s? Wait, no. Wait, the initial three tiles. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then to form a triplet, you can add another 1m (so 1 tile needed) or add another 2m (but that would require two more tiles, since you need three of same). Wait, no. For triplet, you need three same. So if there are two same tiles, then you need to add one more. So for example, if the current count is two of a kind, then adding one gives a triplet. So for the current three tiles, if there are two same, then the minimal is 1. But if there are none, then maybe you need to add three tiles (but that's probably not the minimal case).\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, the current three tiles might have two different suits. So perhaps it's better to try to form a triplet by adding tiles. But maybe forming a sequence is easier.\n\nAlternatively, for the triplet scenario, the current three tiles may have some counts. Let's think about the counts of each tile. For example, suppose the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then the counts are 2 for 1m and 1 for 2m. To form a triplet, we can either add one more 1m (so total of 3) or add two more 2m. So the minimal is 1. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, the minimal number of tiles needed is (3 - max_count) where max_count is the maximum number of same tiles in the current set. For example, if the current set has two same tiles, then 3-2=1. If there's only one of a tile, then 3-1=2. But maybe that's not the case. Because for example, if the three tiles are all different, but same suit, then maybe forming a triplet requires adding two tiles of one type. But perhaps that's not the best way. However, for the triplet case, the minimal is 3 - max_count. So for example, if there are two same tiles, then 1. If there's one, then 2. If there are three same, then 0.\n\nBut the triplet is only possible if the three tiles are same. So for the current three tiles, if they are not already a triplet, then the minimal number of tiles to add for triplet is 3 - max_count, but only if the max_count is for the same suit. Wait, no. Because for triplet, the three tiles must be same. So for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Then the max_count is 1 for each. So to form a triplet, you need to add two tiles of any one of them. But that's not possible. Because you can't form a triplet unless you have three same. So the minimal would be 2 (if you pick one of the suits and add two more). But that's not the case. For example, the three tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Then to form a triplet, you need to add two more of any one. So the minimal is 2. But maybe there's a better way via sequences.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, the minimal number of tiles needed is (3 - count) for the most frequent tile. But that's only if you can form a triplet. So for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1p, 2m. Then the max count is 1 for 1m and 1p, and 1 for 2m. So the minimal for triplet is 2 (adding two more of any one of them). But maybe that's not the minimal.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps forming a sequence would be better.\n\nSo the approach is to check for both possibilities: triplet and sequence. For each, compute the minimal tiles needed, and take the minimum between them.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, compute for both possibilities:\n\nFor the triplet possibility: what is the minimal number of tiles needed to form a triplet. That is, the current counts of each tile. For example, if the three tiles are [a, a, b], then the max count is 2. So need 1 more tile to make triplet of a. So the minimal is 1. But if the three tiles are [a, b, c], then the max count is 1. So need 2 more tiles.\n\nFor the sequence possibility: what is the minimal number of tiles needed to form a sequence. How to calculate that?\n\nFor the sequence, the three tiles must be in the same suit, and their numbers must be consecutive. So first, check if all three tiles are in the same suit. If not, then forming a sequence would require adding tiles. But maybe we can choose to form a sequence in one of the suits.\n\nWait, but the three tiles may have different suits. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3p. Then to form a sequence, you need to have three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for example, you could add 3m (so that you have 1m, 2m, 3m). That would require adding one tile. Alternatively, you could add 1p, 2p, but that would require adding two tiles. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the idea is: for the sequence possibility, we need to check for each possible suit (m, p, s) whether the tiles can be arranged into a sequence with some additions.\n\nBut since the original three tiles may not be all in the same suit, but perhaps some of them are. So for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3s. Then to form a sequence, you can either:\n\n- Take the 1m and 2m, and add 3m (so one tile added).\n\nOr take the 3s and add 1s and 2s (two tiles added). So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the approach is to consider for each suit, how many tiles are present in that suit. Then, for that suit, check if the numbers can form a sequence with some additions.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For each suit, collect the numbers of the tiles in that suit. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3s, then for suit m, we have [1, 2]. For suit s, we have [3]. For other suits, nothing.\n\nNow, for each suit that has at least one tile, we can consider the possibility of forming a sequence in that suit.\n\nSo for each suit:\n\nCollect the numbers in that suit. For example, if the suit is m, and the numbers are [1, 2].\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to make a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWell, the existing numbers in the suit can be sorted. Let's say we have a list of numbers sorted, say, sorted_nums.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of three consecutive numbers, and see how many tiles are missing.\n\nFor example, sorted_nums = [1, 2]. The possible sequences could be [1,2,3] (needs 1 tile added), or [0,1,2] (but 0 is invalid), or [2,3,4] (needs 2 tiles). So the minimal here is 1.\n\nAnother example: sorted_nums = [2, 5]. Then possible sequences could be [2,3,4] (needs 2 tiles), [3,4,5] (needs 2), [5,6,7] (needs 2). So the minimal is 2. Or maybe [2,5, something] can't form a sequence. So the minimal is 2.\n\nAnother example: sorted_nums = [1, 3]. Then possible sequences are [1,2,3] (needs 1 tile), or [3,4,5] (needs 2), etc. So minimal is 1.\n\nSo for the numbers in a suit, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a consecutive triplet.\n\nHow to compute that?\n\nOne approach is to generate all possible triplets of consecutive numbers (like x, x+1, x+2), and for each, check how many of the existing numbers are present. Then the required tiles is 3 minus the count of existing numbers in that triplet. Then take the minimal over all possible triplets.\n\nBut since the numbers can be from 1-9, there are limited possibilities. For example, possible x ranges from 1 to 7 (since x+2 can't exceed 9).\n\nSo for a given list of numbers in a suit, we can check all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers, and find the minimal required additions.\n\nBut how to handle when there are multiple numbers in the suit?\n\nFor example, if the numbers are [1, 2, 3], then the required is 0.\n\nIf the numbers are [1, 2, 4], then the possible sequences are [1,2,3] (needs 1 tile), [2,3,4] (needs 1 tile), [3,4,5] (needs 2 tiles), etc. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo the approach for a suit is:\n\nGenerate all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers (from 1-2-3 up to 7-8-9). For each such sequence, check how many numbers are present in the current list of numbers for that suit. The required tiles is 3 - count. The minimal required for that suit is the minimal of these values across all possible sequences.\n\nBut if there are no numbers in the suit, then we can't form a sequence. For example, if the suit has zero tiles, then we need to add three tiles. But that's probably not optimal.\n\nSo for the sequence possibility, we need to check for each suit (m, p, s) that has at least one tile. For each such suit, compute the minimal required tiles to form a sequence in that suit. Then the overall minimal is the minimal among all these possibilities.\n\nSo combining all possibilities:\n\nThe minimal number of tiles to form a sequence is the minimal among all the possible options for each suit.\n\nOnce we compute the minimal for triplet and the minimal for sequence, the answer is the minimum between the two.\n\nSo the overall steps for the problem are:\n\nGiven three tiles:\n\nCheck if they already form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the minimal number of tiles needed for triplet (triplet_min) and for sequence (sequence_min). The answer is min(triplet_min, sequence_min).\n\nSo now, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, let's process the three tiles.\n\nEach tile is a string of two characters: the first is the number, the second is the suit.\n\nLet's represent the tiles as a list of tuples (number, suit). For example, '1s' becomes (1, 's').\n\nFirst, check if the three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nCheck for triplet: all three have same number and suit.\n\nCheck for sequence: same suit, and numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo for the three tiles, check if they are all same (triplet) or same suit and sorted numbers are consecutive (sequence).\n\nIf either is true, return 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, compute triplet_min and sequence_min.\n\nFor triplet_min:\n\nWe need to count the frequencies of each tile. For example, if the three tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m], then the frequencies are {1m:2, 2m:1}.\n\nThe maximum frequency is 2. So triplet_min is 3 - max_freq. Because we need to add (3 - max_freq) tiles to get three of the same.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple tiles with same count. For example, if the three tiles are [1m, 1p, 1s]. Then max_freq is 1. So triplet_min is 2. Which is correct, since we need to add two of the same tile.\n\nYes.\n\nSo triplet_min = 3 - max_freq.\n\nBut wait, what if there are two different tiles with same count. For example, [1m, 1m, 2p, 2p] — but wait, no, in our case, the original three tiles. So for example, three tiles could be [1m, 1m, 2p]. The max_freq is 2. triplet_min is 1. So adding one 1m.\n\nSo yes, triplet_min is 3 - max_freq.\n\nSo for the triplet part, compute the frequencies of the tiles. For example, count how many times each tile appears. Then find the maximum count. Then triplet_min is 3 - max_count.\n\nBut wait, the original three tiles may have duplicates. For example, if the three tiles are [1m, 1m, 1m], then triplet_min is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo that's the triplet_min.\n\nFor the sequence_min:\n\nWe need to look for each suit, and see what's the minimal number of tiles needed to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nSo first, group the tiles by suit. For each suit, collect the numbers present.\n\nFor example, if the tiles are [1m, 2m, 3s], then for suit m, numbers are [1, 2], for suit s, numbers are [3].\n\nThen, for each suit that has at least one tile, compute the minimal number of tiles needed to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nFor each suit, let's collect the numbers in a sorted list. Then, for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers (x, x+1, x+2), compute how many of these numbers are already present. The required is 3 - count. The minimal required for that suit is the minimal of these across all possible sequences.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences for that suit.\n\nFor example, if the sorted numbers in the suit are [1, 2], then possible sequences are:\n\n[1,2,3] → need 1.\n\n[2,3,4] → need 2.\n\n[3,4,5] → need 3.\n\nBut also, sequences like [0,1,2] are invalid because numbers start from 1.\n\nSo for the suit, the possible sequences are from x=1 to x=7 (since x+2 can't be more than 9).\n\nSo for each x in 1..7, check the sequence x, x+1, x+2.\n\nFor each such sequence, count how many numbers are in the current list of numbers in that suit.\n\nThe minimal required for the suit is the minimal (3 - count) over all possible sequences.\n\nIf the suit has less than two numbers, then for example, if there is only one number, then for any sequence that includes that number, you need to add two more. For example, if the numbers are [1], then for the sequence [1,2,3], need 2 tiles. For [0,1,2], invalid. So the minimal is 2.\n\nBut what if the suit has two numbers, say [1, 3]. Then possible sequences could be [1,2,3] (needs 1), [2,3,4] (needs 2), [3,4,5] (needs 2). So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, for a suit, the minimal required is the minimal (3 - count) over all possible sequences. If there are no possible sequences (like if the suit has no numbers?), but in that case, we can't form a sequence in that suit. So for the suit, we ignore it.\n\nSo the algorithm for sequence_min is:\n\nInitialize sequence_min to a large value (like infinity).\n\nFor each suit in m, p, s:\n\n   collect the numbers in that suit (from the original three tiles)\n\n   if the count of numbers in the suit is zero, skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      sorted_numbers = sorted list of numbers in the suit.\n\n      for x in 1 to 7:\n\n          target_sequence = [x, x+1, x+2]\n\n          count = number of elements in sorted_numbers that are in target_sequence.\n\n          required = 3 - count\n\n          if required < current sequence_min:\n\n              update sequence_min.\n\nSo for each suit, compute the minimal required for sequences in that suit, and take the overall minimum.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the suit has three numbers that are not consecutive. Like [1, 2, 4]. Then for x=1, target is [1,2,3], count is 2 → required 1. For x=2, target is [2,3,4], count is 2 → required 1. For x=3, [3,4,5], count is 1 → required 2. So the minimal required is 1.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nOnce we have the sequence_min and triplet_min, the answer is the minimum between the two.\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nFirst, read the three tiles. Let's say input is given as three strings, like the sample input:\n\nFor example, the first sample input is ['1s 2s 3s'] → the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s.\n\nSo, the code needs to read three strings from input. Wait, the input is given as a single line with three strings separated by spaces. For example, the sample input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nWait, no. Wait, the input is given as a single line containing three strings. So the actual input is something like:\n\n\"1s 2s 3s\" (the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s)\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSo for example, the input is like:\n\n1s 2s 3s\n\nSo the code needs to read three strings from input, split by whitespace.\n\nIn Python, the code can read the input as:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nBut for the sample input, the input is given as three separate examples. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's probably not the actual input. The actual input is three strings, e.g., for the first case, the input is \"1s 2s 3s\".\n\nBut the sample output is ['0', '0', '1'], which corresponds to three test cases. So the code is supposed to read three separate test cases, each with three tiles. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe input is three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. So for each test case, the input is three tiles.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the user provided three different inputs. But the actual input is one line per test case. But the problem says that the input is three strings. So perhaps the code is supposed to read three tiles as input, and output the answer for that case.\n\nWait, the sample input and output are given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nBut that seems to be three test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is three strings. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. But in the sample input, there are three test cases. So perhaps the problem statement's sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual input format. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSo the input is one line, with three strings. So for example, the first sample input is:\n\n1s 2s 3s\n\nWhich is a single line with three strings. The sample output is 0. The second input is 9m 9m 9m → output 0. Third input is 3p 9m 2p → output 1.\n\nBut the sample input in the problem is written as a list of three inputs. But that's probably just an example of the three test cases. So the actual code should read one line, split into three tiles.\n\nSo the code will read input as:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nThen, process those three tiles.\n\nSo, code structure:\n\nRead the three tiles as a list.\n\nProcess them.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFirst, check if the three tiles form a mentsu (triplet or sequence).\n\nIf yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute triplet_min and sequence_min, then output min(triplet_min, sequence_min).\n\nSo, how to check for existing mentsu.\n\nFirst, for triplet:\n\nCheck if all three tiles are the same. So for example, tile1 == tile2 == tile3.\n\nBut tiles are stored as (number, suit). So for the three tiles, check if all three have same number and suit.\n\nFor sequence:\n\nCheck if all three are same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, check if their suits are same, and when sorted, the numbers are consecutive. For example, numbers are [1,2,3], [2,3,4], etc.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # tiles is a list of three (num, suit) tuples.\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    # check same suit\n\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    # same suit, check numbers.\n\n    nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles])\n\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n\nSo, if this returns True, then the current tiles form a mentsu.\n\nIf not, proceed.\n\nNow, for triplet_min:\n\nWe can count the frequencies of each tile. For example, using a Counter.\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounts = Counter(tiles)\n\nmax_count = max(counts.values())\n\ntriplet_min = 3 - max_count\n\nBut wait, the tiles are represented as (num, suit) tuples. So when we create the Counter, each tile is considered as a separate entry. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m, then counts will be {(1m): 2, (2m): 1}, and max_count is 2. triplet_min is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo triplet_min is 3 - max_count.\n\nNow, for sequence_min:\n\nWe need to process each suit, collect the numbers in that suit, and compute the minimal required.\n\nSo:\n\nsuit_numbers = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor num, suit in tiles:\n\n    suit_numbers[suit].append(num)\n\nThen, for each suit in suit_numbers:\n\nsorted_nums = sorted(suit_numbers[suit])\n\nThen, for x in 1 to 7:\n\ntarget sequence is x, x+1, x+2.\n\ncount how many of the numbers in sorted_nums are in this sequence.\n\nrequired = 3 - count.\n\nSo for example, sorted_nums is [1,2], for x=1, the sequence is 1,2,3. count is 2 → required 1.\n\nWe need to find the minimal required across all possible x for this suit.\n\nSo for each suit, compute the minimal required, and then take the overall minimal across all suits.\n\nSo, code:\n\nsequence_min = infinity\n\nfor suit in suit_numbers:\n\n    nums = sorted(suit_numbers[suit])\n\n    # for this suit, compute the minimal required\n\n    current_min = infinity\n\n    for x in range(1, 8):  # 1 to 7 inclusive\n\n        target = [x, x+1, x+2]\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for n in nums:\n\n            if n in target:\n\n                count +=1\n\n        required = 3 - count\n\n        if required < current_min:\n\n            current_min = required\n\n    if current_min < sequence_min:\n\n        sequence_min = current_min\n\nBut what if the suit has less than 3 numbers? Like, for example, if the suit has one number. Then, for any x, the count is 1 if the number is in the target sequence. So required is 2. But for example, if the suit has one number, say 5. Then the possible sequences could be 3,4,5 (count 1 → required 2), or 4,5,6 (count 1 → required 2), etc. So the minimal required is 2.\n\nBut if the suit has two numbers, say 1 and 3. Then, for x=1, target is 1,2,3. count is 2 → required 1. Which is better.\n\nSo the code above correctly captures this.\n\nOnce we have the sequence_min, the answer is min(triplet_min, sequence_min).\n\nBut what if the suit has no numbers? Well, in that case, it's not in suit_numbers. So we skip.\n\nBut what if there are no suits with any numbers? Well, that's impossible, since the original three tiles are processed into suit_numbers. So for example, if all three tiles are in different suits, then each suit has one number.\n\nSo, for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, for each suit, the numbers are [1], [2], [3]. For each suit, the minimal required for that suit is 2. So the overall sequence_min is 2. Then triplet_min is 3 - 1 = 2. So the answer is min(2, 2) → 2.\n\nSo the code would output 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, adding two tiles to form a triplet (like adding two 1m's, making 3 in total). Or adding two tiles to form a sequence in any suit.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the third example from the sample input:\n\nInput: 3p 9m 2p → tiles are [3p, 9m, 2p]\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu:\n\nTriplet: no. All three are different.\n\nSequence: check if same suit. The suits are p, m, p. So no. So not a sequence.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nCompute triplet_min:\n\ncounts are: 3p:1, 9m:1, 2p:1. max_count is 1. triplet_min = 3-1 = 2.\n\nsequence_min:\n\nsuit_numbers:\n\nfor p: [3, 2] → sorted [2,3]\n\nfor m: [9]\n\nfor each suit:\n\nfor suit p:\n\nsorted nums [2,3]\n\nfor x from 1 to 7:\n\nx=1: target 1,2,3 → count is 2 (2 and 3) → required 1.\n\nx=2: target 2,3,4 → count is 2 → required 1.\n\nx=3: target 3,4,5 → count 1 → required 2.\n\nothers would have higher required.\n\nso current_min for suit p is 1.\n\nfor suit m: nums [9]. For any x:\n\nx=7: target 7,8,9 → count 1 → required 2.\n\nso current_min for suit m is 2.\n\nso overall sequence_min is 1.\n\nso the answer is min(2, 1) → 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would return 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the third sample input.\n\nAnother example: input is 3p 9m 2p. The code computes sequence_min as 1 (for suit p), so the answer is 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the following steps:\n\nRead the three tiles as strings, split into parts.\n\nConvert each tile into (number, suit) tuples.\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute triplet_min and sequence_min.\n\nReturn the minimum between them.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut first, the code must read input. So:\n\ntiles_input = input().split()\n\ntiles = []\n\nfor t in tiles_input:\n\n    num = int(t[0])\n\n    suit = t[1]\n\n    tiles.append( (num, suit) )\n\nThen, check if is_mentsu.\n\nImplement is_mentsu function.\n\nNow, code for is_mentsu.\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # tiles is a list of three tuples (num, suit)\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles])\n\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n\nYes.\n\nIf this returns True, then output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute triplet_min and sequence_min.\n\nFor triplet_min:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounts = Counter(tiles)\n\nmax_count = max(counts.values())\n\ntriplet_min = 3 - max_count\n\nFor sequence_min:\n\nimport collections\n\nsuit_numbers = collections.defaultdict(list)\n\nfor num, suit in tiles:\n\n    suit_numbers[suit].append(num)\n\nsequence_min = float('inf')\n\nfor suit in suit_numbers:\n\n    nums = sorted(suit_numbers[suit])\n\n    current_min = float('inf')\n\n    for x in range(1, 8):  # x from 1 to 7 inclusive\n\n        target = {x, x+1, x+2}\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for n in nums:\n\n            if n in target:\n\n                count += 1\n\n        required = 3 - count\n\n        if required < current_min:\n\n            current_min = required\n\n    if current_min < sequence_min:\n\n        sequence_min = current_min\n\nThen, answer is min(triplet_min, sequence_min).\n\nBut what if there are no suits (unlikely, since there are three tiles)? No, since suit_numbers will have at least one suit.\n\nBut in case of no suits (which is not possible), sequence_min remains infinity. But that can't happen.\n\nSo the code proceeds.\n\nNow, code:\n\nPutting all together:\n\nRead the input, process, check for mentsu, else compute the min.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter, defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    tiles_input = input().split()\n    tiles = []\n    for t in tiles_input:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suit = t[1]\n        tiles.append( (num, suit) )\n    \n    # Check if already has mentsu\n    if is_mentsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Compute triplet_min\n    counts = Counter(tiles)\n    max_count = max(counts.values())\n    triplet_min = 3 - max_count\n    \n    # Compute sequence_min\n    suit_numbers = defaultdict(list)\n    for num, suit in tiles:\n        suit_numbers[suit].append(num)\n    \n    sequence_min = float('inf')\n    for suit in suit_numbers:\n        nums = sorted(suit_numbers[suit])\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for x in range(1, 8):  # x from 1 to 7\n            target = {x, x+1, x+2}\n            count = 0\n            for n in nums:\n                if n in target:\n                    count += 1\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < current_min:\n                current_min = required\n        if current_min < sequence_min:\n            sequence_min = current_min\n    \n    answer = min(triplet_min, sequence_min)\n    print(answer)\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return True\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n        return False\n    nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles])\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, the 'tiles' is a list of tuples. So for example, the first tile is (1, 's'), etc. Comparing tuples in Python compares element-wise, so (1, 's') == (1, 's') is True, which is correct.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample input: 1s 2s 3s → tiles are [(1, 's'), (2, 's'), (3, 's')]\n\nis_mentsu checks:\n\ntiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]? No. Then check suits: all same. nums sorted is [1,2,3]. Check if 2 is 1+1 and 3 is 2+1 → yes. So returns True. So output 0.\n\nSample input 2: 9m 9m 9m → triplet, returns 0.\n\nThird input: 3p 9m 2p → tiles are [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]\n\nis_mentsu: triplet? No. Suits are p, m, p → not same. So returns false.\n\ntriplet_min: counts are {(3p):1, (9m):1, (2p):1} → max_count is 1 → triplet_min is 2.\n\nsequence_min:\n\nsuit_numbers:\n\nfor p: [3, 2] → sorted [2,3]\n\nfor m: [9]\n\nprocessing suit p:\n\nfor x in 1-7:\n\nx=1 → target {1,2,3} → count is 2 (2 and 3) → required 1.\n\ncurrent_min for suit p is 1.\n\nso sequence_min is 1. answer is min(2, 1) → 1. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1m 1m 2m → triplet_min is 1. sequence_min?\n\nsuit_numbers for m is [1,1,2]. sorted [1,1,2].\n\nfor x in 1-7:\n\nx=1 → target {1,2,3} → count is 2 (two 1s and one 2) → count is 3? Wait, the numbers in the suit are [1, 1, 2]. So for target {1,2,3}, each of the numbers 1, 1, 2 are in the target. So count is 3. required is 0. So sequence_min would be 0. So the answer is min(1, 0) → 0. Which is correct, because the tiles can form a sequence (1, 2, 3) by adding one tile (3m). Wait, no. Wait, the current tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. So in the suit m, the numbers are [1,1,2].",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid meld (either a triplet or a sequence) in a game similar to Mahjong. The solution involves checking if the current tiles already form a valid meld and, if not, calculating the minimum number of tiles required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Meld**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence.\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: If the tiles do not form a valid meld, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet by considering the frequency of each tile.\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: For each suit (manzu, pinzu, souzu), determine the minimum number of tiles needed to form a sequence by checking all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers within that suit.\n4. **Determine Minimum**: Compare the minimum tiles required for forming a triplet and a sequence, and return the smaller value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter, defaultdict\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n        return True\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n        return False\n    nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles])\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n\ndef main():\n    tiles_input = input().split()\n    tiles = []\n    for t in tiles_input:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suit = t[1]\n        tiles.append((num, suit))\n    \n    if is_mentsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Calculate triplet_min\n    counts = Counter(tiles)\n    max_count = max(counts.values())\n    triplet_min = 3 - max_count\n    \n    # Calculate sequence_min\n    suit_numbers = defaultdict(list)\n    for num, suit in tiles:\n        suit_numbers[suit].append(num)\n    \n    sequence_min = float('inf')\n    for suit in suit_numbers:\n        nums = sorted(suit_numbers[suit])\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for x in range(1, 8):  # x from 1 to 7 inclusive\n            target = {x, x+1, x+2}\n            count = 0\n            for n in nums:\n                if n in target:\n                    count += 1\n            required = 3 - count\n            if required < current_min:\n                current_min = required\n        if current_min < sequence_min:\n            sequence_min = current_min\n    \n    answer = min(triplet_min, sequence_min)\n    print(answer)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Check for Existing Meld**: The function `is_mentsu` checks if the three tiles form a valid triplet or sequence by comparing their values and suits.\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: Using the `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each tile. The minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet is determined by the difference between 3 and the maximum frequency of any single tile.\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: For each suit, we check all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers. For each sequence, we count how many of the existing tiles can form part of that sequence and determine the minimum additional tiles needed.\n4. **Determine Minimum**: The final result is the minimum value between the tiles needed to form a triplet and those needed to form a sequence.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible ways to form a valid meld and ensures the minimum number of tiles are drawn, providing an optimal solution.",
