Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letters. So all the cells on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must be the same. But wait, the problem says that both diagonals have all letters the same. So, for example, all cells on the main diagonal must be the same character, and all cells on the anti-diagonal must be the same. Also, the two diagonals might have different characters? Wait no, wait the problem says that all other squares (not on diagonals) have the same letter different from the diagonals. So the diagonals can have two different letters? Or do they have to be the same?\n\nWait the first condition says: on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same. So each diagonal must have all same letters. But the two diagonals can have different letters? For example, the main diagonal is all 'a's and the anti-diagonal is all 'b's. But then the other squares must have a different letter than both. Wait, but the second condition says that all other squares have the same letter, which is different from the letters on the diagonals. Oh, so the diagonals must have the same letter? Because the other squares must have a different letter than the diagonals. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nSo the other squares must have a single letter, which is different from the letters on the diagonals. But what if the two diagonals have different letters? Like, suppose the main diagonal is 'a's and the anti-diagonal is 'b's. Then the other squares must have a letter that's different from both. But that's possible. However, the problem says that the letters on the diagonals must be same. Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares ... contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nSo the first part says that each diagonal has all same letters. But the two diagonals can have different letters. However, the other squares must have a letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Wait, but if the two diagonals have different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. But that's possible only if the two diagonals have the same letter. Because suppose the diagonals have different letters. Let's say diagonal 1 is 'a's and diagonal 2 is 'b's. Then the other squares must have a letter that is different from both 'a' and 'b'. But then, the other squares must all be same. But that's possible. But how does that fit with the problem's example?\n\nWait let's look at the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2 is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe output is YES.\n\nLet me think. For n=3, the diagonals are positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) and (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So for the first diagonal, the letters are w, s, w. Wait, but that's not all same. Wait the first line is 'wsw', so (0,0) is 'w', (0,1) is 's', (0,2) is 'w'. The second line is 'sws', so (1,0) is 's', (1,1) is 'w', (1,2) is 's'. Third line is 'wsw' again. So the main diagonal is (0,0) = w, (1,1) = w, (2,2) = w. The anti-diagonal is (0,2) = w, (1,1) = w, (2,0) = w. So both diagonals are all 'w's. Then the other squares are the ones not on diagonals. For example, (0,1) is 's', (1,0) is 's', (1,2) is 's', (2,1) is 's'. All of them are 's's, which is different from the diagonals. So that's why the output is YES.\n\nBut in this case, the two diagonals are same. So perhaps the problem requires that the two diagonals have the same letter. Because otherwise, the other squares would have to be different from both. But how can that be possible? Let's see. Suppose the main diagonal is all 'a's, and the anti-diagonal is all 'b's. Then the other squares must be same and different from both. So the other squares must be some letter c, which is not a or b. But in that case, the code would have to check that all non-diagonal squares are same and different from both a and b. But how would that work? Because the problem says \"the letters on the diagonals\" — but if there are two different letters on the diagonals, then the other squares must be different from both. But the problem statement says that the other squares must have same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. So if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. But that's possible. However, the problem's sample input 2 shows that the diagonals have the same letters. So maybe the problem requires that both diagonals have same letters. Because otherwise, the other squares must be different from both. But perhaps that's allowed. However, the problem's description may not require that the two diagonals have same letters. So how to approach this?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nAh, the wording here is important. The first part says that both diagonals have all letters same. So each diagonal is uniform. But the two diagonals may have different letters. However, the other squares must have same letter, which is different from the letters on the diagonals. So the other squares must be different from both letters of the diagonals. So if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be a third letter, different from both. But that's possible. However, in practice, how would that work?\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that the two diagonals have the same letter. Because otherwise, the other squares need to be different from both. For example, if the two diagonals have different letters, then the other squares must be same and different from both. But that's possible. However, in that case, the problem's sample input 2 has the same letters on both diagonals.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nSo the steps needed are:\n\n1. Check that all cells on the main diagonal are the same. Let's call this char1.\n\n2. Check that all cells on the anti-diagonal are the same. Let's call this char2.\n\n3. Check that all non-diagonal cells are the same, and that this char (char3) is different from both char1 and char2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the other squares must be different from the letters on the diagonals. So if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. So, char3 must not be equal to char1 or char2.\n\nBut how can we check that? For example, if char1 is 'a' and char2 is 'b', then char3 must not be 'a' or 'b'.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCheck that:\n\n- All main diagonal cells are same (char1).\n\n- All anti-diagonal cells are same (char2).\n\n- All non-diagonal cells are same (char3).\n\n- char3 != char1 and char3 != char2.\n\nBut also, what about the overlapping cell? For example, in the case of odd n, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So, for example, when n is 3, the center cell (1,1) is on both diagonals. So, in that case, the main diagonal and anti-diagonal must have same char. Because for the main diagonal, all cells are same, and for the anti-diagonal, all cells are same. So, since the center cell is part of both, then char1 must be equal to char2. Because for example, the main diagonal has all char1, and the anti-diagonal has all char2. But the center cell is part of both. So, char1 must equal char2. Otherwise, the center cell would be both char1 and char2, which is impossible unless they are same.\n\nAh! That's an important point. Because for the center cell, it's part of both diagonals. Therefore, the main diagonal's char (char1) must be same as the anti-diagonal's char (char2). Because that cell is part of both. So, for example, if the main diagonal has all 'a's, and the anti-diagonal has all 'b's, then the center cell (which is part of both) would have to be 'a' and 'b', which is impossible. Hence, char1 must equal char2. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same character. Thus, the problem's first condition is that both diagonals have the same letters (so char1 and char2 are same) and the other squares have same letter different from that.\n\nSo this simplifies the problem. Because the two diagonals must have same letters. Because the overlapping cell is part of both. Therefore, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, check that all cells on the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are same. Because the overlapping cell must be same for both. So, for example, for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, their characters must be same. So, for example, in the code, we can collect all the cells on both diagonals and check that they are all same. Because the overlapping cell is part of both. So, for example, for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, all their cells must be same. So, for example, in the sample input 2, the diagonals are all 'w's. So that's correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck that all cells on the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are same. Let's call this char_d.\n\nThen check that all non-diagonal cells are same and different from char_d.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nif i == j or i + j == n - 1: it's part of the diagonals. So all these cells must be same.\n\nElse: they must be same and different from the diagonal's char.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCollect all the diagonal cells (both diagonals) and check that they are all same.\n\nThen collect all non-diagonal cells and check that they are all same and different from the diagonal's char.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the grid as a list of strings.\n\nCheck for all cells in the diagonals:\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for j in 0..n-1:\n\n      if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n          check if all these cells are same.\n\nOnce that is done, collect the non-diagonal cells and check that they are all same and different from the diagonal's char.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal's char?\n\nWell, the first cell (0,0) is part of the diagonal. So the diagonal's char is grid[0][0]. But we need to check that all the diagonal cells are same as this.\n\nBut for example, if the grid is:\n\nx o o o x\n\no x o x o\n\no o x o o\n\no x o x o\n\nx o o o x\n\nThen the diagonals are all x's. So the code can take the first diagonal cell's value and check that all others are same.\n\nBut in code, how to do that?\n\nSo first, collect all the diagonal cells. For each cell (i,j) where i ==j or i +j ==n-1. Then check that all of them are same as the first one (say, the (0,0) cell). But wait, what if the first cell is part of both diagonals? Well, for example, in the case of n=3, (0,0) is part of the main diagonal, and (0,2) is part of the anti-diagonal. But the (1,1) cell is part of both. So, the first cell (0,0) is part of the main diagonal. So, the code can check that all the diagonal cells (both diagonals) are same as the first cell (0,0).\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, collect all the diagonal cells and check that they are all the same. For example, collect all the characters in the diagonals, and check that they are all same.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nif i ==j or i +j == n-1: add to a list.\n\nThen check that all elements in this list are same.\n\nOnce that is done, collect all non-diagonal cells and check that they are all same and different from the diagonal's char.\n\nSo for example, in code:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif all characters in diagonal_chars are same, and all characters in non_diagonal_chars are same, and the non_diagonal_char is different from diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to check that all characters in diagonal_chars are same. For example, if the list is empty? No, because n is at least 3. For n=3, the diagonals have 3+3-1=5 cells (since the center cell is counted once). For example, for n=3, the main diagonal has 3 cells, the anti-diagonal has 3 cells, but the center cell is in both. So total number of diagonal cells is 3 + 3 -1 =5. So the diagonal_chars list will have length 2n-1. For n=3, 5 elements. So it's not empty.\n\nSo, once we have the diagonal_chars list, check that all elements are same as the first element. For example:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1: return NO.\n\nSimilarly for non_diagonal_chars: check that all elements are same as first element. Also, check that the first element of non_diagonal_chars is different from the first element of diagonal_chars.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? For example, n=1? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 3. So no, for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are (n^2 - (2n-1)) = 9 -5 =4 cells. So for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So the non_diagonal_chars list is not empty.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the grid as a list of strings.\n\nCollect diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\nCheck that all diagonal characters are same.\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal characters are same.\n\nCheck that the non-diagonal character is different from diagonal character.\n\nIf all conditions met, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nThe input is given as first line is n, then n lines of n letters.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the input comes from stdin. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read n as int(input()), then read n lines, each line being input().strip().\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen collect the diagonal and non-diagonal chars.\n\nBut for each cell (i,j), we can loop through all i and j.\n\nSo:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if len(set(non_diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if diagonal_chars[0] != non_diagonal_chars[0]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? But for n >=3, the non_diagonal_chars is not empty. For n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut let's check for n=3, the total cells is 9. The diagonals have 2*3-1=5 cells. So non-diagonal is 4 cells.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nBut what about when the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut what about when the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, no. So the code is okay.\n\nBut let's test with sample input 2.\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid is:\n\nrow 0: 'wsw'\n\nrow 1: 'sws'\n\nrow 2: 'wsw'\n\ndiagonal_chars: cells (0,0) = 'w'; (0,1) is not diagonal. (0,2) is part of anti-diagonal. (i=0, j=0: yes. i=0, j=2: 0+2=2 = 3-1=2, yes. So for i=0, j=0 and j=2. Then for i=1, j=1 (i==j, yes). Also, i=1, j=1: i+j=2, yes. So for i=1, j=1 is part of both. For i=2, j=0: i +j = 2, yes. j=2: i=2, j=2: yes.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars are:\n\n(0,0) 'w', (0,2) 'w'; (1,1) 'w'; (2,0) 'w'; (2,2) 'w'. So the diagonal_chars list is ['w', 'w', 'w', 'w', 'w'] → all same.\n\nnon_diagonal_chars are the other cells: (0,1) 's', (1,0) 's', (1,2) 's', (2,1) 's'. So all same, and different from 'w'. So code returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input is the third example:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nrow0: x p x\n\nrow1: p x p\n\nrow2: x p e\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0) x; (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x; (2,2) e. Wait, (2,2) is i=2, j=2 → i==j → yes. So the diagonal_chars includes (2,2) which is 'e'.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars would be:\n\nx (0,0), x (0,2), x (1,1), x (2,0), e (2,2). So the set of diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2. So the code returns NO. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case is the first sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ncells (i,j) where i==j or i +j = 4 (since n=5, n-1=4).\n\nSo for i=0, j=0 (i==j) → x. j=4 (i +j = 4) → x.\n\ni=1, j=1 → x; j=3 → x.\n\ni=2, j=2 → x; j=2 (i=2, j=2 → i==j. i +j =4 → 2+2=4? No, 4 is 4. So yes. So (2,2) is part of both diagonals. So for i=2, j=2 is included once.\n\ni=3: j=3 → x; j=1 → x.\n\ni=4: j=4 → x; j=0 → x.\n\nSo the diagonal characters are:\n\nLooking at all cells:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,4) x.\n\n(1,1) x, (1,3) x.\n\n(2,2) x.\n\n(3,1) x, (3,3) x.\n\n(4,0) x, (4,4) x.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars is [x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x] ?\n\nWait for n=5, the number of diagonal cells is 2*5 -1 =9. So 9 elements. Let me count:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 and j=4 → 2 cells.\n\ni=1: j=1 and j=3 → 2 cells.\n\ni=2: j=2 → 1 cell.\n\ni=3: j=1 and j=3 → 2 cells.\n\ni=4: j=0 and j=4 → 2 cells.\n\nTotal is 2+2+1+2+2=9 cells. All of them are x except for (2,2)? Wait in row 2, the third character (j=2) is x? Let me check the input:\n\nRow 2 is 'soxoo' → indexes 0-4. So row 2 is s o x o o. So j=2 is x. So yes, (2,2) is x. So all the diagonal cells are x. So diagonal_chars is all x. Then the non-diagonal cells.\n\nLooking at row 0: the non-diagonal cells are j=1, 2, 3. Because (0,0) and (0,4) are diagonals. So for row 0, the non-diagonal cells are o, o, o.\n\nRow 1: (i=1, j=0) is o (non-diagonal?), because i=1, j=0 → i +j = 1, not 4. So yes. For row 1, the non-diagonal cells are j=0, 2, 4. Because j=1 and 3 are diagonals. So row 1: o, o, o.\n\nRow 2: the non-diagonal cells are j=0,1,3,4. Because (i=2, j=0: i +j = 2, not 4. j=1: i +j=3. j=2 is diagonal. j=3: 2+3=5 !=4. j=4: 2+4=6. So non-diagonal cells. So row 2: s, o, o, o. Wait, row 2 is 'soxoo' → indexes 0: s, 1: o, 2: x, 3: o, 4: o. So non-diagonal cells are s, o, o, o. So for row 2, the non-diagonal cells are s, o, o, o.\n\nSo the non_diagonal_chars would include s, which is different from x. So the non_diagonal_chars would have elements like o, o, o, o, o, o, o, s, etc. So the set of non_diagonal_chars would include both o and s. Hence, the code would detect that len(set(...)) !=1 and output NO. Which matches the sample input's first case.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case is the second sample input, which returns YES.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about cases where the non-diagonal cells are same, but same as the diagonal?\n\nLike:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen the diagonals are all a's, and the non-diagonal cells are a's. So the code checks that non_diagonal_chars is same, but the diagonal and non-diagonal are same. So the code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are a's, non-diagonal are b's. So code returns YES.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in code, for the diagonal_chars and non_diagonal_chars, we need to collect all the characters.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then read n lines.\n\nThen, for each i and j, check if i ==j or i +j ==n-1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = []\nnon_diagonal = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check diagonals\nif len(set(diagonal)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check non-diagonal\n    if len(set(non_diagonal)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        # Check if non-diagonal is different from diagonal\n        if diagonal[0] != non_diagonal[0]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal is empty? Well, for n >=3, it's not.\n\nBut let's see for n=3, the non_diagonal has 4 elements.\n\nBut what if the grid is such that all non-diagonal cells are same, but same as the diagonal. For example, n=3, all cells are 'a's. Then the code would check that the non-diagonal is same (yes), but diagonal[0] == non_diagonal[0], so output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me check the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe diagonal is all x's. The non-diagonal includes s, which is different. So the non_diagonal has elements like o, o, o, o, etc., but also s. So len(set(non_diagonal)) would be 2 (o and s). So the code would print NO. Which is correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ndiagonal is all w's. non_diagonal is all s's. So code returns YES.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiagonal is x, x, x, x, e. So len(set(diagonal)) is 2. So code returns NO.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=3, all diagonals are a, non-diagonal are b. Output YES.\n\nCase 2: n=3, diagonals are a, non-diagonal are a. Output NO.\n\nCase 3: diagonals are a, non-diagonal are b and c. So len(set(non_diagonal)) is 2. Output NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have all same, but non-diagonal has some other same, but same as diagonal. Output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=5, diagonals are a, non-diagonal are b. Output YES.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are a, non-diagonal are a. Output NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are a, non-diagonal are b and c. Output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code is written. Now, check for possible errors.\n\nWhat if the grid is empty? No, n is at least 3.\n\nAnother possible error: when the non_diagonal is empty. But for n=3, it's 4 elements.\n\nAnother possible error: when the diagonal has all same, but non_diagonal is empty. But no.\n\nAnother possible error: when the non_diagonal is not empty, but the code checks len(set(...)) !=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The grid must have all letters on both diagonals the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Collection**: Separate the characters of the grid into two lists: one for the characters on the diagonals and another for the characters not on the diagonals.\n3. **Validation Checks**:\n   - Check if all characters on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Check if all characters not on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Ensure that the characters on the diagonals are different from the characters not on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = []\nnon_diagonal = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if len(set(non_diagonal)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if diagonal[0] != non_diagonal[0]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Separating Characters**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal or anti-diagonal), it is added to the `diagonal` list; otherwise, it is added to the `non_diagonal` list.\n3. **Checking Uniformity**:\n   - Using a set, we check if all characters in the `diagonal` list are the same. If they are not, the answer is \"NO\".\n   - Similarly, we check if all characters in the `non_diagonal` list are the same. If they are not, the answer is \"NO\".\n   - Finally, we ensure that the character on the diagonals is different from the character in the non-diagonal cells. If all conditions are met, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations to ensure uniformity and correctness, ensuring the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
