Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So Valera needs to check if the letters on his square paper form an 'X' according to specific rules. Let me think about what those rules are.\n\nThe problem says that the paper forms an 'X' if two conditions are met. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to check all the cells on the two diagonals. Let me think about how to identify those cells. For a square of size n x n (where n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). But wait, since n is odd, the two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So that cell is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo for the first condition: all cells on both diagonals must be the same. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that on both diagonals, all letters are the same. So the entire main diagonal must be the same letter, and the entire anti-diagonal must be the same letter. But also, the two diagonals' letters must be the same? Or can they be different? Wait the problem says that all other squares (non-diagonal) have the same letter different from the diagonals. So the diagonals must have the same letter? Or can they be different?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So each diagonal's letters are the same. But what about between the two diagonals? For example, suppose the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'y'. Then, the other squares must be some other letter, say 'z', different from both. But then the problem says that the letters on the diagonals must be the same? Or is it allowed for the two diagonals to have different letters?\n\nWait, the problem says that the other squares (non-diagonal) must have the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. So the diagonals must have the same letter. Because if the two diagonals had different letters, then the other squares would have to be different from both. But the problem says that the other squares have the same letter different from the letters on the diagonals. So that implies that the diagonals must have the same letter. Because otherwise, the other squares would have to be different from both, but maybe that's allowed? Wait no, because the problem says that the other squares have the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. So that implies that the diagonals are all the same letter. Because if the two diagonals have different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. But that's possible only if the two diagonals have the same letter. Wait no, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the main diagonal is all 'a', and the anti-diagonal is all 'b'. Then, the other squares must be a letter that is different from both 'a' and 'b'. So for example, if the other squares are all 'c', then that would satisfy the condition. But the problem says that the other squares have the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. So in this case, the diagonals have two different letters, but the other squares are a third letter. But according to the problem statement, is that acceptable?\n\nWait the problem says: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nSo the letters on the diagonals could be different. But the other squares must be different from the letters on the diagonals. Wait, but if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. So for example, if the diagonals have 'a' and 'b', then the other squares must be something else, say 'c', which is different from both. But in that case, the problem's condition is satisfied. However, the problem says that the diagonals must have all letters the same. Wait no, the problem says that on both diagonals all letters are the same. So for the main diagonal, all letters are same (say 'a'), and for the anti-diagonal, all letters are same (say 'b'). But then, the other squares must have a letter different from the letters on the diagonals. But that would require that the other squares are different from both 'a' and 'b'. However, the problem says that the other squares have the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. So that's possible. But then, the problem's example input includes a case where the answer is 'YES'.\n\nWait looking at the sample input:\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) = w, (1,1) = w, (2,2) = w. So all 'w's.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,2) = w, (1,1) = w, (2,0) = w. All 'w's. So the diagonals are all same letters. The other squares are the ones not on the diagonals. Let's see:\n\nFor row 0: positions (0,1) is s. Row 1: (1,0) is s and (1,2) is s. Row 2: (2,1) is s. So all non-diagonal squares are 's'. Which is different from the diagonals (w). So this is valid, so output is YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut suppose another case where the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'a'. Then the other squares are all 'b' (different from 'a'). That would be valid. Also, if the main diagonal is all 'a', anti-diagonal all 'b', and other squares are 'c' (different from a and b), then that would also satisfy the conditions. But according to the problem's description, is that allowed?\n\nWait the problem says that the letters on the diagonals must all be same (for each diagonal). But the two diagonals can have different letters. But the other squares must have same letter different from the letters on the diagonals. But in that case, the other squares must be different from both letters. So that's allowed. However, the problem's description says that the letters on the diagonals must be same. But perhaps that's not the case. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nAh! The first condition is that on both diagonals, all letters are the same. So that means that each diagonal has all same letters. But the two diagonals can have different letters. However, the second condition says that the other squares have same letter different from the letters on the diagonals. Wait, but if the two diagonals have different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. So for example, if the main diagonal is all 'a', the anti-diagonal all 'b', then the other squares must be all 'c' (different from both a and b). But according to the problem's condition, that's allowed. However, in that case, the problem's first condition is met (each diagonal has same letters) and the second condition is met (other squares have same letter different from the diagonals).\n\nBut then, in that case, the answer would be YES. However, perhaps the problem requires that the two diagonals have the same letter. Because the problem says that the other squares must be different from the letters on the diagonals. If the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. But the problem says that the other squares have same letter different from the letters on the diagonals. So that's allowed.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's intention is that the diagonals are the same. Let me check the sample input again.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe output is NO. Let's see why.\n\nLooking at the diagonals. The main diagonal is (0,0) = x, (1,1) = x, (2,2) = x, (3,3) = x, (4,4) = x. So all x's. The anti-diagonal is (0,4) = x, (1,3) = x, (2,2) = x, (3,1) = x, (4,0) = x. So all x's. So both diagonals are x. Now the other squares should be same letter, different from x. Let's look at the other squares. For example, row 0, column 1 is o. Row 0, column 2 is o. Row 0, column 3 is o. Row 1, column 0 is o. Row 1, column 2 is x (but that's on the diagonal?), no. Wait for row 1, column 0: (1,0) is o. The main diagonal is (i,i), and the anti-diagonal is (i, n-1 -i). So for n=5, the anti-diagonal for (i,j) is j = 4 - i. So for row 1, column 3 is (1,3) which is part of the anti-diagonal. So for the cell (1,0), is that on a diagonal? Let's see: for i=1, j=0. Is j = i (main diagonal)? No. Is j = 4 - i? 4 -1 = 3. So no. So (1,0) is not on any diagonal. So the other squares should be same letter. But looking at the first sample input, the first line is xooox. So positions (0,0) is x, (0,1) is o, (0,2) is o, (0,3) is o, (0,4) is x. So the non-diagonal cells here are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3). Those are o's. Then, looking at row 1: oxoxo. So positions (1,0) is o, (1,1) is x (diagonal), (1,2) is o, (1,3) is x (anti-diagonal?), yes. (1,3) is part of anti-diagonal. So (1,0) is o, (1,2) is o. Then row 2 is soxoo. So (2,0) is s. Which is not on a diagonal. So that's a problem. Because the other squares must be same letter. But here, in row 2, column 0 is s. Which is different from o. So the other squares are not all same. Hence, the output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem requires that all non-diagonal cells are same letter, different from the diagonals. But the diagonals themselves can have different letters? Or not?\n\nWait, in the first sample input, the diagonals are same letters. So maybe the problem requires that the two diagonals are same letters. Because if the two diagonals are different, then the other squares need to be different from both. But in that case, the problem's sample would have allowed that.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the first condition is that on both diagonals all letters are same. So each diagonal is same, but the two diagonals can be different. However, the second condition says that the other squares are same letter different from the letters on the diagonals. So if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'a', the anti-diagonal is all 'b', and other squares are all 'c' (different from a and b), then that would satisfy the conditions. But in that case, the code would return YES.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nSo the steps needed are:\n\n1. Check that all cells on the main diagonal are the same.\n\n2. Check that all cells on the anti-diagonal are the same.\n\n3. Check that the main diagonal's character is the same as the anti-diagonal's character? Or not?\n\nWait, no. Because if the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b', then the other squares must be same letter different from both 'a' and 'b'. So the code would have to check that the main and anti-diagonal's letters are same? Or not?\n\nWait the problem says that the other squares must be same letter different from the letters on the diagonals. So if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. So for example, if the diagonals have 'a' and 'b', then the other squares must be a letter that is not 'a' or 'b'. But the problem says that the other squares have the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. So the other squares must be same letter, and that letter must be different from all letters on the diagonals. Which in this case, if the diagonals have two different letters, then the other squares must be a letter different from both.\n\nBut how can the other squares be different from both? Well, if the two diagonals have different letters, then the other squares must be a third letter. So that's possible. But then, the problem's condition is satisfied.\n\nBut then, the code would need to check that all the non-diagonal cells are same, and that their letter is different from both the main and anti-diagonal letters.\n\nBut how do we check that? Because the main and anti-diagonal may have different letters.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's intention is that the two diagonals have the same letter. Because in the sample input 2, the two diagonals are same. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nValera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:\n\non both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;\n\nall other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\nAh, the problem says that the other squares must be different from the letters on the diagonals. So the letters on the diagonals are a single letter? Or can they be two letters?\n\nWait, the first condition says that on both diagonals all letters are the same. So, for example, the main diagonal is all 'a', and the anti-diagonal is all 'a' as well. Then the other squares must be same letter different from 'a'. But if the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b', then the other squares must be same letter different from both 'a' and 'b'.\n\nBut the problem says that the other squares must be same letter different from the letters on the diagonals. So the letters on the diagonals may be multiple letters, but the other squares must be different from all of them.\n\nBut how can that be? For example, if the diagonals are 'a' and 'b', then the other squares must be same letter different from both. So the code must check that all non-diagonal cells are same, and that their value is not equal to the main diagonal's value and also not equal to the anti-diagonal's value.\n\nBut then, how to proceed?\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Check that all main diagonal cells are same (call this char1).\n\n- Check that all anti-diagonal cells are same (call this char2).\n\n- Check that all non-diagonal cells are same (call this char3).\n\n- Check that char3 is different from char1 and char2.\n\nBut then, if char1 != char2, then char3 must be different from both. But if char1 == char2, then char3 must be different from that.\n\nSo in this case, the code needs to check:\n\nIf all main diagonal is same, all anti-diagonal is same, and all non-diagonal is same, and the non-diagonal's char is different from both main and anti's chars.\n\nBut then, what if the main and anti are same? Then, the non-diagonal's char must be different from that.\n\nSo the code would need to:\n\nCollect all the characters on the main diagonal. Check that they are all same. Collect all the characters on the anti-diagonal. Check that they are all same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters. Check that they are all same. And then check that the non-diagonal's char is different from both the main and anti's chars.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal characters?\n\nBut for that, we need to iterate through all cells, and check if they are on the main or anti-diagonal. If not, then check their value.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFirst, read the grid.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck for all cells in main diagonal: same character.\n\nCheck for all cells in anti-diagonal: same character.\n\nCheck for all other cells: same character, and that this character is different from both main and anti-diagonal characters.\n\nBut how to handle the overlapping cell (the center cell) which is part of both diagonals. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking the main and anti-diagonal, that cell is included in both. But when checking the non-diagonal cells, that cell is not considered.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\n1. Read n, then read the grid as a list of lists.\n\n2. Check the main diagonal: for each i from 0 to n-1, check grid[i][i]. All of them must be same.\n\n   Let's call this main_char.\n\n3. Check the anti-diagonal: for each i from 0 to n-1, check grid[i][n-1 -i]. All of them must be same.\n\n   Let's call this anti_char.\n\n4. Now, check all other cells (non-diagonal). For each cell (i,j), if it's not on the main or anti-diagonal, check if it's same as other_char. Also, collect other_char.\n\n   But how to collect other_char? Well, first, we can collect all non-diagonal cells, check if they are all same, and then check if that same value is different from main_char and anti_char.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's on a diagonal.\n\nElse: not.\n\nSo for all cells not on either diagonal, check their value.\n\nSo:\n\nCollect all the non-diagonal cells. Let's get the first non-diagonal cell's value as other_char. Then check that all others are same as that.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 3*3 - 3 (diagonals) = 6. Wait, for n=3, each diagonal has 3 cells, but the center cell is in both. So total unique diagonal cells is 3 + 3 -1 = 5. So non-diagonal is 9-5=4 cells. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nOnce we have the main_char and anti_char, we need to check all non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut first, we need to make sure that main_char and anti_char are correct.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCheck main diagonal: all same. If not, return NO.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal: all same. If not, return NO.\n\nThen collect all non-diagonal cells. Check that they are all same. Also, check that their value is not equal to main_char and not equal to anti_char.\n\nBut wait, what if main_char and anti_char are same? Then, the non-diagonal cells must be different from that.\n\nFor example, if main_char and anti_char are same (say, 'a'), then non-diagonal cells must be same and different from 'a'.\n\nSo the code:\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal cells are same, and that their value is not equal to main_char and not equal to anti_char.\n\nBut if main_char and anti_char are same, then the check is that non-diagonal is different from that.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nOnce main_char and anti_char are determined, then:\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal cells are same (call this other_char).\n\nCheck that other_char != main_char and other_char != anti_char.\n\nBut what if main_char != anti_char? Then, other_char must be different from both.\n\nBut if main_char and anti_char are same, then other_char must be different from that.\n\nSo that's the way.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet's think about code.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut for easier access, perhaps convert each line into a list of characters.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\ngrid = [list(input().strip()) for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, check main diagonal.\n\nmain_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n   if grid[i][i] != main_char:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n       exit()\n\nSimilarly for anti-diagonal.\n\nanti_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n   if grid[i][n-1 -i] != anti_char:\n\n       print(\"NO\")\n\n       exit()\n\nThen, check all non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut how to check that all non-diagonal cells are same and different from main_char and anti_char.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if it is not on the main or anti-diagonal, then check if it's same as other_char.\n\nBut how to find other_char?\n\nWe can collect all non-diagonal cells, check that they are all same, and then check against main and anti.\n\nBut for code:\n\nWe can collect all non-diagonal cells into a list. Then, check that all elements in the list are same. Then check if that value is different from main_char and anti_char.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can check as we go.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nother_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            continue\n\n        # this is a non-diagonal cell\n\n        if other_char is None:\n\n            other_char = grid[i][j]\n\n        else:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != other_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\n# After checking all non-diagonal cells, check if other_char is different from main_char and anti_char.\n\nif other_char == main_char or other_char == anti_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, there are 3*3 - (number of diagonal cells) = 9 - 5 = 4 cells. So for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut what if the non-diagonal cells are empty? Well, no. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut in code, for the case where there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is >=3. So no problem.\n\nSo putting all together.\n\nBut let's think about some test cases.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ngrid:\n\nrow 0: ['w','s','w']\n\nrow 1: ['s','w','s']\n\nrow 2: ['w','s','w']\n\nmain diagonal: (0,0) = w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w. So main_char is w.\n\nanti-diagonal: (0,2) = w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w. So anti_char is w.\n\nNow, non-diagonal cells are:\n\ncells where i != j and i +j != 2 (since n=3, n-1=2).\n\nLooking at each cell:\n\ni=0, j=0: on main diagonal.\n\ni=0, j=1: i +j = 1 != 2. So not on any diagonal. So check.\n\ni=0, j=2: on anti-diagonal.\n\ni=1, j=0: i+j=1 != 2. Not on any diagonal.\n\ni=1, j=1: on both diagonals.\n\ni=1, j=2: i +j = 3, which is 3-1=2? Wait for n=3, i +j == n-1 is 2.\n\ni=1, j=2: 1+2=3 != 2. So no. So (1,2) is not on any diagonal.\n\nWait for i=1, j=2: i +j = 3, which is n=3. So 3-1 = 2. So i +j = 3 is not equal to 2. So no. So (1,2) is not on any diagonal.\n\nSo for the non-diagonal cells:\n\ncells (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nThese are the four cells.\n\nEach of them is 's' in the sample. So other_char is 's'.\n\nCheck if other_char != main_char (w) and other_char != anti_char (w). Yes. So output YES.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input: the third input is:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid is:\n\nrow0: x p x\n\nrow1: p x p\n\nrow2: x p e\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\n(0,0) = x, (1,1) =x, (2,2) =e. So the main diagonal is not all same. So during the check, when i=2, j=2, grid[2][2] is e, which is not same as main_char (x). So the code would print NO.\n\nSo that sample's output is NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\na a a\n\nThen, main diagonal is all a. anti-diagonal is all a. non-diagonal cells are all a. So other_char is a. Then, check if other_char is different from main_char (a) and anti_char (a). It's not, so output NO.\n\nSo the code would return NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\na b a\n\nb a b\n\na b a\n\nMain diagonal: a, a, a. anti-diagonal: a, a, a. non-diagonal cells: (0,1) is b, (1,0) is b, (1,2) is b, (2,1) is b. other_char is b. Check if b != a and b != a. Yes. So output YES.\n\nSo code would return YES.\n\nAnother test case where main and anti are different:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\na b a\n\nb c b\n\na b a\n\nMain diagonal: a, c, a. So main_char is a? No. Because for i=1, j=1 is c. So during the main diagonal check, the first element is a. Then for i=1, grid[1][1] is c != a. So code returns NO. So that's invalid.\n\nBut suppose the main diagonal is all a, anti-diagonal all b. And non-diagonal cells are all c.\n\nSo for example:\n\nn=3:\n\na c b\n\nc a c\n\nb c a\n\nWait, let's check the diagonals.\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=a, (1,1)=a, (2,2)=a. So main_char is a.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,2)=b, (1,1)=a, (2,0)=b. So anti-diagonal has b, a, b. So during the check for anti-diagonal, the first element is b. Then for i=1, grid[1][n-1 -i] is grid[1][1] = a, which is not equal to b. So code returns NO.\n\nSo that's invalid.\n\nSo to have anti-diagonal all same, let's think of:\n\nn=3:\n\na c a\n\nc b c\n\na c a\n\nMain diagonal is a, b, a. So during check, main_char is a. Then for i=1, grid[1][1] is b != a. So code returns NO.\n\nSo how to create a case where main and anti are different.\n\nLet me think of a 5x5 grid where main diagonal is all 'a', anti-diagonal all 'b', and other cells all 'c'.\n\nBut how to arrange that.\n\nFor example, in a 5x5 grid:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j: a.\n\nif i +j ==4: b.\n\nElse: c.\n\nBut for the center cell (i=2, j=2): i==j and i +j =4. So that cell is on both diagonals. So it's a, but also must be b. Which is impossible. So this is not possible. Therefore, in any square with odd n, the two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So for that cell to be part of both diagonals, it must be same as main_char and same as anti_char. So main_char must equal anti_char.\n\nAh! So that's a critical point. Because the center cell is part of both diagonals. Therefore, the main_char and anti_char must be same. Because the center cell is part of both diagonals. So for example, in the case of n=5, the center cell is (2,2). It is part of the main diagonal (i==j) and the anti-diagonal (i +j = 4). So for the main diagonal to be all same, and the anti-diagonal to be all same, the center cell must be same for both. Hence, main_char and anti_char must be same.\n\nAh! So this is a key insight. Because the center cell is part of both diagonals, so the main_char and anti_char must be same. So the code can assume that main_char and anti_char are same. Therefore, the code can check that the main and anti diagonals are same, and that the non-diagonal cells are same and different from that.\n\nSo this changes the approach. Because the center cell is part of both diagonals, so the main_char and anti_char must be same. Therefore, in the code, after checking that the main diagonal is all same, and the anti-diagonal is all same, we can check whether the center cell (which is part of both) is same for both. But since the code checks that the main diagonal is same and the anti-diagonal is same, the center cell is part of both. So the main_char and anti_char must be same. Because the center cell is part of both.\n\nLet me explain:\n\nSuppose main_char is 'a' (so all main diagonal cells are 'a'), and anti_char is 'b' (so all anti-diagonal cells are 'b'). The center cell is on both diagonals. So for the main diagonal, the center cell is 'a', and for the anti-diagonal, it is 'b'. So this would imply that a = b. Therefore, main_char must be same as anti_char.\n\nTherefore, in the code, after checking that the main and anti-diagonals are all same, the main_char and anti_char must be same. Because the center cell is part of both.\n\nSo this implies that in the code, after checking that main and anti diagonals are same, the main_char and anti_char are same. Therefore, the code can proceed by checking that the non-diagonal cells are same and different from main_char (which equals anti_char).\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCheck main diagonal is all same (main_char).\n\nCheck anti-diagonal is all same (anti_char).\n\nCheck that the center cell (grid[n//2][n//2]) is same as main_char and same as anti_char. But since the center cell is part of both diagonals, the code already ensures that. Because the main diagonal is all same (so center cell is main_char), and the anti-diagonal is all same (so center cell is anti_char). Therefore, main_char must be equal to anti_char.\n\nSo the code can proceed to check that the non-diagonal cells are same and different from main_char.\n\nSo the code can now be simplified as:\n\nAfter checking that main and anti diagonals are same, the main_char and anti_char are same. Therefore, the other_char must be different from that.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nCheck main diagonal is all same (main_char).\n\nCheck anti-diagonal is all same (anti_char).\n\nCheck that the main_char equals anti_char (but this is automatically true because the center cell is part of both, so main_char and anti_char must be same).\n\nBut perhaps, in code, the main_char and anti_char could be different. How?\n\nFor example, suppose n=3. The main diagonal is [a, b, c], but that's not possible because the code checks that all main diagonal cells are same. So main_char is a, and during the check, when i=1, grid[1][1] is b, which is not equal to a. So the code would have already printed NO.\n\nSo the code can safely assume that after checking the main and anti diagonals, main_char and anti_char are same.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed to check that the non-diagonal cells are same and different from main_char.\n\nThus, the code can be modified as:\n\nOnce the main and anti diagonals are checked, then check the non-diagonal cells. All of them must be same, and that same value must be different from main_char.\n\nSo in code:\n\nOnce main_char and anti_char are determined (and they are same), then check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead grid.\n\nCheck main diagonal.\n\nCheck anti-diagonal.\n\nCheck non-diagonal cells.\n\nCheck that non-diagonal cells are all same and different from main_char.\n\nSo this simplifies the code.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input 2, main_char and anti_char are both 'w'. The non-diagonal cells are 's', which is different. So output YES.\n\nAnother example where main and anti are same, but non-diagonal cells are same as main_char. Then output NO.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's think about code implementation.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid as list of lists.\n\nCheck main diagonal.\n\nmain_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    if grid[i][i] != main_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nCheck anti-diagonal.\n\nanti_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    if grid[i][n-1 -i] != anti_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nNow, check that main_char == anti_char? Well, since the center cell is part of both, the main_char must be same as anti_char. But how?\n\nBecause the center cell is (n//2, n//2). For example, n=5, center is (2,2). For the main diagonal, it's grid[2][2] = main_char. For the anti-diagonal, grid[2][n-1 -2] = grid[2][5-1 -2] = grid[2][2], which is same as main_char. So anti_char must be same as main_char. Because during the anti-diagonal check, the center cell is part of the anti-diagonal and must be equal to anti_char. But since the center cell is grid[2][2], which is main_char, anti_char must be same as main_char. Therefore, the code can assume that main_char == anti_char.\n\nBut in code, perhaps during the anti-diagonal check, the code could have set anti_char to be different from main_char. How?\n\nOnly if the center cell is not same as main_char. But the code checks the main diagonal first. The center cell is part of the main diagonal. So during the main diagonal check, the code ensures that all main diagonal cells are same. Therefore, the center cell is main_char. Then, during the anti-diagonal check, the code checks that all anti-diagonal cells are same. Since the center cell is part of the anti-diagonal, the anti_char must be same as main_char. Therefore, the code can safely proceed.\n\nSo code can proceed to check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nNow, check non-diagonal cells.\n\nother_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            continue\n\n        if other_char is None:\n\n            other_char = grid[i][j]\n\n        else:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != other_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit()\n\nif other_char == main_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3, and for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input 1:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow ",
