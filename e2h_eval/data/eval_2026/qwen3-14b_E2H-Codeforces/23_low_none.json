            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to have at least one mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence). The input is three tiles, and we need to determine how many more tiles she needs to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each given set of three tiles, we need to check if they already form a mentsu. If not, figure out the minimal draws required to make one.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: The existing three tiles already form a mentsu. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: They don't. Then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that after adding, there's a mentsu.\n\nSo for each input, we need to check all possibilities of forming a triplet or sequence, considering adding some tiles.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nLet me break it down. Let's first check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about the possible ways to form a mentsu with the existing tiles plus some new ones.\n\nFor example, for a triplet: we need three identical tiles. Suppose the existing tiles have two of the same. Then adding one more would make a triplet. Or if there's one, then adding two more. But maybe there are multiple possibilities here.\n\nFor sequences: sequences require three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for example, if the existing tiles have two consecutive numbers in the same suit, adding another one that fits. Like if you have 1s and 2s, adding 3s would make a sequence. Or if you have 2s and 3s, adding 1s. Or if you have 1s and 3s, adding 2s.\n\nBut since the initial hand has three tiles, perhaps there are different possibilities. Let's think about all possible ways to form a triplet or sequence with the existing tiles plus some added tiles.\n\nBut since we can add any number of tiles, but want the minimum, we need to find the minimal steps.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. How?\n\nFor triplet: all three are same. For example, 9m, 9m, 9m.\n\nFor sequence: check if they are three consecutive numbers in same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But order doesn't matter.\n\nSo for the initial check, we can check if the three tiles form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nIf they do, return 0.\n\nElse, proceed to calculate the minimal draws.\n\nNow, for cases where the initial three don't form a mentsu, what's the minimal steps needed?\n\nWe need to consider all possibilities of forming a triplet or sequence, and find the minimal steps required.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios for forming a triplet:\n\nCase A: There are two tiles of the same type. Then, adding one tile of that type would form a triplet. So the minimal steps here would be 1.\n\nBut if there are three different types, then maybe we need to add two tiles of one type. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then to form a triplet, you need to add two tiles of the same type as one of them. For example, adding two 1m's would give three 1m's. So steps needed is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. But in this case, the minimal steps would be 2.\n\nAnother case: suppose there are two pairs. Like two 1m and two 2p. Wait, no, the initial three tiles. For example, if the three are 1m, 1m, 2p. Then to form a triplet, you can add one 1m (so total three) or add two 2p's. So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo for triplet possibilities, the minimal steps would be based on the counts of each tile.\n\nSimilarly for sequences.\n\nNow, for sequences, the idea is that we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for example, if the current tiles have two numbers in the same suit, but not consecutive, or one number, etc.\n\nBut how to find the minimal steps required to form a sequence.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then, adding 3s would form a sequence of 1-2-3. But that requires adding one tile. Alternatively, if we have 1s, 3s, 4s. Then adding 2s would form 1-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu) in her hand. The solution involves checking if the current set of three tiles already forms a valid mentsu and, if not, calculating the minimal additional tiles required to form one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence. If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Count Tile Frequencies**: For each tile type, count how many times it appears. This helps in determining the number of additional tiles needed to form a triplet.\n3. **Check for Possible Triplets**: If there are at least two tiles of the same type, we can form a triplet by adding one more tile. If there is only one tile of any type, we might need to add two more tiles to form a triplet.\n4. **Check for Possible Sequences**: For sequences, check if the numbers on the tiles can be part of a consecutive sequence in the same suit. Determine the minimal number of tiles needed to complete such a sequence.\n5. **Determine Minimum Draws**: Evaluate all possible ways to form a triplet or sequence and determine the minimum number of tiles required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef is_triplet(tiles):\n    return len(set(tiles)) == 1\n\ndef is_sequence(tiles):\n    # Check if all suits are the same\n    if len(set(tile[1] for tile in tiles)) != 1:\n        return False\n    # Extract numbers and sort\n    nums = sorted(int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles)\n    # Check if they form a sequence\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[0] + 2\n\ndef min_draws(tiles):\n    # Check if already has a mentsu\n    if is_triplet(tiles) or is_sequence(tiles):\n        return 0\n    \n    # Count frequency of each tile\n    cnt = Counter(tiles)\n    max_count = max(cnt.values())\n    \n    # For triplet possibility\n    if max_count >= 2:\n        # Need 1 more tile to make triplet\n        triplet_draws = 1\n    else:\n        # Need 2 more tiles to make triplet\n        triplet_draws = 2\n    \n    # Now check for sequence possibility\n    # Group by suit\n    suits = {}\n    for tile in tiles:\n        suit = tile[1]\n        if suit not in suits:\n            suits[suit] = []\n        suits[suit].append(int(tile[0]))\n    \n    min_seq_draws = float('inf')\n    for suit, nums in suits.items():\n        # Sort the numbers\n        nums_sorted = sorted(nums)\n        # Try to find the minimal draws to form a sequence\n        # Check all possible sequences that can include these numbers\n        # We need three consecutive numbers\n        # So for each number, check possible sequences\n        # Let's consider all possible sequences that can be formed with existing nums\n        # Find the minimal number of tiles to add\n        \n        # Generate all possible sequences that can be formed with the existing numbers\n        # For example, if we have [1, 2], then need 3 (draw 1)\n        # If we have [1, 3], need 2 (draw 1)\n        # If we have [2, 3], need 1 (draw 1)\n        # If we have [1], then need 2 and 3 (draw 2)\n        # etc.\n        \n        # Create a set of existing numbers\n        existing = set(nums_sorted)\n        # Check all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers\n        # Find the minimal number of tiles needed to complete any such sequence\n        for i in range(1, 8):\n            # Check sequences starting at i\n            seq = [i, i+1, i+2]\n            # Count how many are missing\n            missing = 0\n            for num in seq:\n                if num not in existing:\n                    missing += 1\n            if missing < min_seq_draws:\n                min_seq_draws = missing\n        # Also check sequences that may be extended by existing numbers\n        # For example, if existing has 3 and 4, then 2,3,4 is a possible sequence\n        # But we already check i=2 above\n        # So the loop covers all possibilities\n    # Now, the minimal draws for sequence is min_seq_draws\n    # But we need to check if there's any possible sequence\n    # If no possible sequence, then min_seq_draws remains infinity, which won't be considered\n    # So compare triplet_draws and min_seq_draws\n    # But if min_seq_draws is still infinity, that means no possible sequence can be formed with the existing numbers, so we can ignore it\n    # So the minimal between triplet_draws and min_seq_draws (if applicable)\n    result = min(triplet_draws, min_seq_draws)\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split input into individual test cases\n    test_cases = input.splitlines()\n    for case in test_cases:\n        tiles = case.strip().split()\n        # Process each case\n        res = min_draws(tiles)\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Check Existing Mentsu**: The functions `is_triplet` and `is_sequence` check if the current tiles form a valid triplet or sequence.\n2. **Frequency Counting**: Using `Counter`, we count occurrences of each tile to determine the number of additional tiles needed for a triplet.\n3. **Sequence Evaluation**: By grouping tiles by their suit and checking possible sequences, we determine the minimal tiles needed to complete a sequence.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum number of tiles required to form either a triplet or sequence is computed and returned for each test case.",
