Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). But since n is odd, these two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So that cell is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo for all cells in the diagonals, they must be the same. Let's say the diagonal character is 'd'. Then, all other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same, say 'o', and d != o.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check all cells on the two diagonals. They must all be the same character. Let's call this char_d.\n\n2. Check all other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same character, char_o, and char_d != char_o.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, I need to iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, determine if it's on either diagonal. If it is, check if it's equal to char_d. If not, check if it's equal to char_o.\n\nBut how to find char_d and char_o?\n\nFirst, collect all the characters from the diagonals. All of them must be the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters, which must all be the same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Iterate through all cells. For each cell (i,j):\n\n   if i == j or i + j == n - 1 → it's on a diagonal.\n\n   else → non-diagonal.\n\nSo first, collect all diagonal characters. Check if they are all the same. Then collect all non-diagonal characters. Check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal characters? Well, n is at least 3. For example, n=3: the diagonals have 3 cells each, but the center is overlapping. So total diagonal cells are 2*3 -1 =5 (since the center is counted once). The non-diagonal cells are 9-5=4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So for any n ≥3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCheck that all diagonal cells are same. Then check that all non-diagonal are same and different from diagonal.\n\nSo how to code this.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is n followed by n lines, each with n characters.\n\nSo in Python, read n, then read n lines, each line being a string.\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nCheck if it's on the diagonal. So for i in 0..n-1, j in 0..n-1.\n\nSo for each cell, check if i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nSo collect all the diagonal characters. Let's collect them into a set. If the length of the set is not 1, then it's invalid. Also, collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If the length of that set is not 1, invalid. Also, check that the two sets are different.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the diagonal is 'x' and non-diagonal is 'o', then the sets are {'x'}, {'o'}, which are different. So that's okay.\n\nBut if the diagonal is 'x' and non-diagonal is also 'x', then the sets are same. Which is invalid.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCollect all diagonal characters into diag_chars. Check that all are same. Then collect non-diag into non_diag_chars. Check that all same. Then check that diag_chars[0] != non_diag_chars[0].\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think. For each cell in the grid:\n\nLoop over i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   loop over j from 0 to n-1:\n\n      if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n          add to diag_chars\n\n      else:\n\n          add to non_diag_chars\n\nOnce collected, check:\n\nif len(set(diag_chars)) != 1 → return NO\n\nif len(set(non_diag_chars)) != 1 → return NO\n\nif diag_chars[0] ==",
