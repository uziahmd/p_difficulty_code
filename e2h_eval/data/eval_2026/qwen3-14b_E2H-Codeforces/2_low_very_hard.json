Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping cells? Since n is odd, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell (1,1) is part of both diagonals. So when checking the diagonals, we need to make sure that all cells in both diagonals are the same. But since the center cell is part of both, the diagonals must all have the same character. So, for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti-diagonal has 'x', then that's okay. But if one of them has a different character, then it's invalid.\n\nSo step 1: Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n\nStep 2: Check that all elements not on either diagonal are the same. Let's call this character 'o', and ensure that 'o' != 'd'.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through the grid.\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nIf i == j or i + j == n - 1 → it's on a diagonal.\n\nElse → it's not.\n\nSo, first, collect all the characters on the diagonals and check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. Check if n is odd (but input says n is given as odd, so maybe no need to check).\n\n3. For all cells, check if they are on a diagonal. Collect the characters of the diagonals and the others.\n\nBut perhaps, for the diagonals, we can check all positions. Let's collect all the characters in the diagonals. Then check if all of them are the same. Similarly for the non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut for the non-diagonal cells, they must all be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Collect all diagonal characters into a set. If the size of the set is not 1, then return NO.\n\n- Collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If the size is not 1, return NO.\n\n- Then check if the two sets are different. If they are the same, return NO. Else, return YES.\n\nWait, but the diagonal's set is a single element, and the non-diagonal's set is also a single element. So, for example, if the diagonal is 'x' and the non-diagonal is 'o', then it's okay. But if they are same, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCheck that all diagonals have same character (d).\n\nCheck that all non-diagonals have same character (o).\n\nCheck that d != o.\n\nIf all three conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, how to collect the characters.\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            add to diagonal_chars\n\n        else:\n\n            add to non_diagonal_chars\n\nBut for n=5, the diagonals are positions where i==j or i+j=4 (since n-1 is 4). So for example, (0,0), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,4). Wait, but (2,2) is the center. So in this case, the diagonals are the main and anti-diagonal. So for each cell, if it's on either of those two lines, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut for the diagonals, perhaps we can collect all",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all cells on both diagonals of the square must contain the same letter, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter, which is different from the letter on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: Collect all characters from both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Ensure all these characters are the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Collect all characters that are not on either of the diagonals. Ensure all these characters are the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n4. **Validation**: If both sets of characters meet the criteria, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    nd_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n    if d_char != nd_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Collecting Characters**: We iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals, its character is added to `diagonal_chars`; otherwise, it is added to `non_diagonal_chars`.\n3. **Validation Checks**: \n   - Check if all characters in `diagonal_chars` are the same (i.e., the set size is 1).\n   - Check if all characters in `non_diagonal_chars` are the same (i.e., the set size is 1).\n   - Ensure that the characters in `diagonal_chars` and `non_diagonal_chars` are different.\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the above checks, print \"YES\" if all conditions are satisfied, otherwise print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations to ensure all characters on the diagonals and non-diagonal cells are uniform and distinct, respectively. The complexity is O(n^2), which is efficient given the constraints.",
