При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an overlapping error. The overlap must be such that the end of the first s overlaps with the start of the second s, and the overlapping part has a positive length but less than the length of s. Also, the case where the two s's are completely overlapped (so t is exactly s) or just concatenated normally (like s + s) are not considered errors. So, we need to check if there's a possible s such that t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s with some positive overlap less than len(s).\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if such an s exists. If yes, output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the merged string t must be formed by two copies of s overlapping. Let me think about the structure of t. Let's say the original two messages are s and s. When they are merged with an overlap of k characters, then the total length of t would be len(s) + len(s) - k. So len(t) = 2*len(s) -k. Since k must be between 1 and len(s)-1 (inclusive), then:\n\nLet me denote len(t) as L. Then for some possible s length m, we have L = 2m -k, where 1 <=k < m. Rearranging, k = 2m - L. But since k must be at least 1 and less than m, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2m - L < m\n\nLet me solve for m.\n\nFrom 2m - L ≥ 1 → 2m ≥ L +1 → m ≥ (L+1)/2.\n\nFrom 2m - L < m → 2m - L < m → m < L → m must be less than L.\n\nBut m is the length of s. Also, since the original two messages are merged with overlap, the length of t must be less than 2m (since k is positive). So, L = 2m -k → since k ≥1, L ≤ 2m-1. Also, since k < m → 2m - L < m → L > m. So combining these, m must satisfy m > L - m → m > L/2. Wait, maybe I should re-express the inequalities.\n\nLet me think again. Let me consider possible values of m (the length of s). For each possible m, we can check if there exists a k such that the conditions hold.\n\nBut since L = 2m -k, and k must be between 1 and m-1 (inclusive), then:\n\nk = 2m - L must be in [1, m-1].\n\nSo:\n\n1 ≤ 2m - L ≤ m-1.\n\nLet me rearrange these inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality:\n\n2m - L ≥ 1 → 2m ≥ L +1 → m ≥ (L+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality:\n\n2m - L ≤ m-1 → 2m - L ≤ m -1 → m ≤ L -1.\n\nSo combining both, m must be in the range [(L+1)/2, L-1].\n\nBut m must also be such that the original string t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s with overlap k = 2m - L.\n\nSo for each possible m in that range, we can check if there exists a possible s of length m such that when you take the first s (of length m) and the second s (also of length m), their overlapping part (of length k) matches.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the merged string t is formed by overlapping two copies of s. Then, the first part of t is s, and the second part is s, but overlapping by k characters. So, the first m characters of t are s, and the last m characters of t are also s. However, the overlapping part must match. For example, the last k characters of the first s must equal the first k characters of the second s.\n\nBut since the entire t is formed by overlapping, the entire t must be equal to s concatenated with s, but with the overlapping part merged. So, the entire t is s + s[k:], where k is the overlap length.\n\nAlternatively, the first s is of length m, and the second s starts at position m -k. So, the t is s + s[k:].\n\nBut how can I check for this?\n\nAnother way: For a candidate m, the possible k is 2m - L. Because L = 2m -k → k = 2m - L. So for each m in the range [(L+1)/2, L-1], compute k = 2m - L. Then check if k is between 1 and m-1 (which it should be because of the way m was chosen). Then, check if the first m characters of t (s_candidate) and the last m characters of t (which is s_candidate again) have an overlap of k characters.\n\nWait, no. Because the merged string t is formed by overlapping two s's. So the first s is the first m characters of t, and the second s is the last m characters of t. But the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s and the first k characters of the second s. Therefore, these two parts must be equal.\n\nSo for a candidate m, the k is 2m - L. Then, the first s_candidate is t[0...m-1], and the second s_candidate is t[L - m ... L-1]. Then, the last k characters of the first s_candidate must be equal to the first k characters of the second s_candidate.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor each possible m in the range [(L+1)/2, L-1], compute k = 2m - L. Check if k is between 1 and m-1 (should be, but perhaps due to integer division, maybe need to check). Then check whether the first m characters (s1) and the last m characters (s2) of t have the property that s1[-k:] == s2[:k]. Also, since s1 and s2 must be the same (because they are both s), we can check if s1 equals s2. Because if the overlapping part matches, and the entire s1 and s2 are the same, then that would imply that the overlapping is correct.\n\nWait, no. Because if the overlapping part is correct, but s1 and s2 are different? No. Because the overlapping is done between two copies of s. So s1 must be s, and s2 must be s. Therefore, s1 must equal s2. So, for the candidate m, we can check if the first m characters equals the last m characters. But that's only possible if the entire string is made up of two copies of s overlapping. Wait, but the entire t is the merged string. So for example, if s is 'abab', and the overlap is 2, then t is 'abab' merged with 'abab' with overlap 2. The merged string would be 'ababab' (since the last 2 letters of the first s are 'ab', which overlaps with the first 2 letters of the second s. So the merged string is 'abab' + 'ab' → 'ababab'.\n\nBut in this case, the first m (4) characters are 'abab', and the last m (4) characters are 'abab' (since the merged string is length 6, so the last four are positions 2-5: 'abab'). So yes, they are the same. So checking if the first m characters equals the last m characters would be necessary.\n\nBut wait, in the example where the merged string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (from the first sample input), the original s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). The merged string length is 2*11 -k, where k is 1. So the length is 22-1=21. So for this case, L=21. Then m is 11. Let's check the range for m. (L+1)/2 is (21+1)/2 = 11. So m must be between 11 and 20 (since L-1 is 20). So m=11 is in that range. Then k= 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. Which is between 1 and 10 (m-1=10). Then check if the first m=11 characters (abrakadabra) and the last m=11 characters (abrakadabra) are equal. Well, the merged string is abrakadabraabrakadabra (but with overlapping of 1 character). Wait, the actual merged string is abrakadabrabrakadabra. Let's see: the original two s's are 'abrakadabra' and 'abrakadabra'. When overlapping by 1 character, the merged string is the first s (abrakadabra) plus the second s's substring starting from index 1. So the merged string is abrakadabra + rakadabra → which is abrakadabrabrakadabra. The length is 11 + 10 = 21. The first m=11 characters are abrakadabra. The last m=11 characters are brakadabra? Or wait, the merged string is 21 characters long. The last 11 characters would be positions 10 to 20. Let me check:\n\nOriginal merged string is abrakadabrabrakadabra. Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nOriginal s is abrakadabra (11 letters). The merged string is s + s[1:]. So the merged string is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. So the last 11 letters would be s[1:] + s[1: ... ? Wait, no. The merged string is s concatenated with s[1:], which is s's first character followed by the rest. Wait, no. The first s is 11 letters, and the second s starts overlapping by 1 character. So the merged string is s's first 11 letters, then the second s's letters starting from position 1. So the merged string is s[0..10] + s[1..10]. So the total is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. The last 11 letters would be s[1..10] (10 letters) plus the last letter of the second s. Wait, no. The merged string is s[0] + s[1..10] (from first s) and then s[1..10] (from second s)? No, that's not right. Wait, the first s is s, then the second s overlaps by 1 character. So the merged string is s[0...m-1] (the first s) and then the second s starts at position m -k = m -1. So the second s starts at position m -k = 11 -1 = 10. So the merged string is the first s (positions 0-10) and the second s starts at position 10, so the merged string is positions 0-10 (first s) and positions 10-20 (second s). So the entire merged string is positions 0-20. The last m=11 characters are positions 10-20. Which is the second s. So the first m characters is s, the last m characters is s. Therefore, they must be equal. So checking if the first m characters equals the last m characters would be a necessary condition.\n\nSo, for each candidate m, compute k = 2m - L. Then check if k is between 1 and m-1. Then check if the first m characters equals the last m characters. If so, then return s as the first m characters.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple m's? For example, in the sample input 'acacacaca' (which is the second example). Let's see. The output is 'acaca' (length 5). Let's compute L = 9. For m to be in [(9+1)/2, 9-1] → 5 ≤ m ≤8. So possible m's are 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor m=5: k = 2*5 -9 = 1. So check if first 5 chars (acaca) and last 5 chars (cacaca?) Let's see the input is 'acacacaca' (length 9). The first 5 is 'acaca', the last 5 is 'cacaca'? Wait, the string is indexes 0-8. Last 5 is positions 4-8: 'c a c a c a'? Wait, original string is 'a c a c a c a c a' (positions 0-8). For m=5, the first 5 is positions 0-4: a c a c a. The last 5 is positions 4-8: a c a c a? Wait, positions 4 is 'a', then 5 is 'c', 6 is 'a', 7 is 'c', 8 is 'a'. So the last 5 is 'acaca', which is same as first 5. So yes. Then check if the overlapping part is correct. The k is 1. So the last k (1) characters of the first s (which is 'a') must equal the first k (1) characters of the second s (which is 'a'). So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is YES and 'acaca'.\n\nSo the approach is: iterate over all possible m in the range [(L+1)/2, L-1], and for each, check if the first m characters equals the last m characters. If yes, then check if the overlapping part (k = 2m - L) is valid (which it is because of the way m is selected). Then return that s.\n\nBut why do we need to check the overlapping part? Because even if the first m and last m characters are same, maybe the overlapping part doesn't match. Wait, but if the first m and last m characters are same, then the overlapping part would match. Because the first m is s, the last m is s. So the overlapping part is the last k characters of s (since the first s is s, and the second s is s). So the last k of s must equal the first k of s. Which is true because the entire s is same. So if the first m and last m characters are same, then s is that string, and the overlapping part will match. Because the overlapping part is between the end of the first s and the start of the second s. Since both are s, their overlapping parts must match. So, checking if first m and last m characters are same is sufficient?\n\nWait, no. Let me think of a counterexample. Suppose s is 'ababa', and the merged string is formed by overlapping with k=2. So the merged string would be 'ababa' + 'aba' → 'abababa' (length 7). So L is 7. For this case, m is len(s) = 5. Let's check the conditions. For L=7, m must be between (7+1)/2=4 and 6. So m=5 is allowed. k=2*5-7=3. Wait, but k must be less than m (5). 3 is less than 5. So yes. Now, the first m=5 characters are 'ababa', the last m=5 characters are 'babab'? Let's see the merged string is 'abababa' (positions 0-6). Last 5 characters are positions 2-6: 'ababa' (positions 2: 'a', 3: 'b', 4: 'a', 5: 'b', 6: 'a'). So first m is 'ababa', last m is 'ababa'. So they are same. So according to our approach, this would be considered valid. But the overlapping k is 3. The first s is 'ababa', the second s is 'ababa'. The overlapping part is last 3 of first s (aba) and first 3 of second s (aba). Which is correct. So in this case, the check passes.\n\nAnother example: suppose the merged string is 'abcabca' (length 7). Let's say m is 4. Then k is 2*4-7=1. So check if first 4 is 'abca' and last 4 is 'abca'? The merged string is 'abcabca'. The first 4 is 'abca', the last 4 is 'bcabca'? No, the length is 7. Last 4 is positions 3-6: 'abca'. So yes. Then the overlapping k is 1. The last 1 character of first s is 'a', and the first 1 of the second s is 'a'. So correct. So the approach works here.\n\nBut what if the first m and last m are same, but the overlapping part is not correct? How can that happen?\n\nWait, if the first m and last m are same, then the entire string is s concatenated with s[k:], where k is 2m-L. But since the first m is s, and the last m is s, then the overlapping part (the last k of s and first k of s) must be same. Because the first s is s, and the second s is s. So the overlapping part is the last k of s and first k of s. But since s is same, that part must be same. So if the first m and last m are same, then the overlapping part is automatically correct. Therefore, checking that the first m and last m are same is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm can be:\n\nFor the given t, compute its length L.\n\nFor m in the range from ceil(L/2) to L-1 (inclusive):\n\n   if 2m - L is between 1 and m-1 (which it should be because of the way m is chosen):\n\n      check if the first m characters equals the last m characters.\n\n      if yes, then return YES and the first m characters as s.\n\nIf none of the m's work, return NO.\n\nBut wait, for m in the range [(L+1)/2, L-1], because m must be >= (L+1)/2. Let me think for example, when L is even. Let's say L=4. Then (L+1)/2 is 2.5, so m starts from 3 (since m must be integer). For example, if L is 4, m can be 3. Then k = 2*3 -4 = 2. Which is between 1 and 2 (since m-1 is 2). So yes.\n\nSo for each possible m in the range from ceil((L+1)/2) to L-1, inclusive. Wait, but how to calculate the starting m? Let me think. The condition is m ≥ (L+1)/2. Since m must be an integer, the starting value is floor((L+1)/2) if (L+1)/2 is not integer, but perhaps more accurately, m starts from the ceiling of (L+1)/2 ?\n\nWait, for example, L=5. (L+1)/2 = 3. So m starts from 3. For L=6, (L+1)/2 is 3.5, so m starts from 4?\n\nWait, the original condition is m ≥ (L+1)/2. So for m to be integer, the minimal m is ceil( (L+1)/2 ). Let me check:\n\nFor example, L=5 → (L+1)/2 = 3 → m starts from 3.\n\nFor L=6 → (L+1)/2 is 3.5 → m must be ≥3.5 → m starts from 4.\n\nYes. So the starting m is ceil( (L+1)/2 ). But since (L+1)/2 can be written as (L+1 +1)//2 ?\n\nWait, in Python, to compute the ceiling of (L+1)/2, we can do (L+1 +1)//2 ?\n\nWait, for example, when (L+1) is even:\n\nSay L+1 is 6 → 6/2=3 → ceil(3) is 3. (L+1 +1)//2 would be (6+1)//2 = 7//2=3.5 floored to 3. Wait, no. Wait, (L+1) is even. Let me think of L as 5, then L+1 is 6. So (L+1)/2 is 3. So ceil( (L+1)/2 ) is 3. Which is (L+1 +1)//2 ?\n\nNo. Let me think of how to compute the ceiling of a division. For integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be computed as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo for (L+1)/2, the ceiling is ((L+1) + 2 -1 ) // 2 → (L+2) // 2.\n\nWait, for example, L=5: (5+1)/2 = 3 → ceil is 3. (L+2) is 7 → 7//2 is 3.5 floored to 3. Correct.\n\nFor L=6: (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4. (L+2) is 8 → 8//2 is 4. Correct.\n\nYes. So the starting m is (L+2)//2.\n\nSo the range for m is from m_start = (L+2)//2 to m_end = L-1, inclusive.\n\nSo for each m in that range, check if the first m characters equals the last m characters. If any of them does, then output YES and that s.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause if the first m and last m characters are same, then that implies that the merged string is formed by overlapping two copies of s (the first m characters) with k = 2m - L. And since k is between 1 and m-1, it's a valid overlap.\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nCompute L = len(t).\n\nIf L is 1, then it's impossible (since two messages can't be merged with overlap, since m must be at least (1+1)/2 = 1, but m must be <= L-1 = 0. So no possible m. So output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nLoop m from m_start to m_end:\n\n   m_start = (L + 2) // 2\n\n   m_end = L-1\n\n   for m in range(m_start, m_end + 1):\n\n      if m is such that 2m - L is between 1 and m-1:\n\n         (But since m is in the range derived from the condition, this should be always true.)\n\n         Check if t[0:m] == t[-m:]\n\n         if yes:\n\n             then output YES and t[0:m]\n\nOnce found, return.\n\nIf no such m is found, output NO.\n\nBut why check for 2m - L being between 1 and m-1? Because m is chosen in the range [(L+1)/2, L-1], but perhaps for some cases, even with that, 2m - L could be outside the required range. Let me check for example:\n\nTake L=4. m_start = (4+2)//2 = 3. m_end = 3. So m=3.\n\nk = 2*3 -4 = 2. Which is between 1 and 3-1=2. So yes, valid.\n\nAnother example: L=5. m_start is (5+2)//2 = 3.5 floored? Wait, (5+2) is 7, divided by 2 is 3.5, but in integer division in Python, 7//2 is 3. So m_start is 3. For m=3, k= 2*3 -5=1. Which is between 1 and 2 (m-1=2). Valid.\n\nAnother example: L=6. m_start is (6+2)//2= 8//2=4. m_end is 5.\n\nFor m=4: k= 8-6=2. m-1 is 3. 2 is between 1 and 3. Valid.\n\nFor m=5: k= 10-6=4. m-1 is 4. So k=4 is equal to m-1. Which is allowed (since the problem says that the overlapping length must be positive and less than the length of the message. So k must be < m. So 4 <5, yes. So valid.\n\nSo in all cases, for m in the range m_start to m_end, the k is valid.\n\nThus, in code, we can loop m from m_start to m_end, and for each m, check if the first m and last m characters are same. If any of them is, return YES and that s.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → length is 21. So m_start = (21+2)//2 = 23//2=11. m_end is 20. So m ranges from 11 to 20. For m=11, check if first 11 and last 11 characters are same. The first 11 is 'abrakadabra', the last 11 is the string from position 21-11=10 to end. Let's see the original string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (assuming that's the input). The last 11 characters would be 'abrakadabra' (since the merged string is two copies of s with overlap 1). So yes. Thus, returns YES and s=abrakadabra.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' (length 9). m_start is (9+2)//2 = 11//2=5. m ranges from 5 to 8. For m=5, the first 5 is 'acaca', last 5 is 'acaca' (positions 4-8). So yes. So output YES and 'acaca'.\n\nSample Input 3: 'abcabc' (length 6). m_start is (6+2)//2=4. m ranges from 4 to 5. For m=4: check if first 4 is 'abca' and last 4 is 'bca'... no. For m=5: first 5 is 'abcab', last 5 is 'bcabc' → not same. So no. Hence output NO.\n\nSample Input 4: 'abababab' (length 8). m_start is (8+2)//2=5. m ranges from 5 to 7. Let's check m=5: first 5 is 'ababa', last 5 is 'babab'? The string is 'abababab'. Last 5 is positions 3-7: 'ababa'? Let me see:\n\nIndices 0-7:\n\n0:a, 1:b, 2:a, 3:b, 4:a, 5:b, 6:a, 7:b.\n\nFor m=5, first 5 is 0-4: a b a b a. Last 5 is 3-7: b a b a b. Which is 'babab' → not same as first 5. So no. m=6: check first 6 is 'ababab' and last 6 is 'ababab'? The last 6 is positions 2-7: a b a b a b → yes. So for m=6, check if first 6 and last 6 are same. Yes. Then k=2*6 -8 = 4. Which is between 1 and 5 (6-1=5). So yes. Then the answer is 'ababab' (the first 6 characters). But the sample output says 'ababab' is the answer. But the sample output for this input is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nWait, but the sample input for this case is 'abababab' (the fourth example in the input list). The output is 'YES\\nababab'.\n\nYes, which is correct. So for m=6, the first 6 characters is 'ababab', and the last 6 is 'ababab' (positions 2-7: 'ababab'). So yes. So the code would return that.\n\nAnother example: the sample input 'tatbt' outputs 'NO'. Let's see. Length is 5. m_start is (5+2)//2=3.5 floored to 3? Wait, (5+2) is 7, divided by 2 is 3.5 → integer division in Python gives 3. So m ranges from 3 to 4 (since m_end is 5-1=4). For m=3: check if first 3 is 'tat' and last 3 is 'tbt' → no. For m=4: check first 4 is 'tatb' and last 4 is 'atbt' → no. So output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase when t is exactly s + s (without overlap). For example, t is 'aaaaa' with length 4. Wait, no. Let's take t as 'abab', which is 'ab' + 'ab'. Then len(t) is 4. For this case, the code should output NO because it's considered as normal concatenation, not an error. Let's see. L=4. m_start is (4+2)//2=3. m ranges from 3 to 3. For m=3: check if first 3 is 'aba' and last 3 is 'bab' → no. So output NO. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: t is s + s with overlap of k= m-1. For example, s is 'abc', and the overlap is 2. Then the merged string is 'abc' + 'c' → 'abcc'. So len(t) is 4. L=4. m_start is (4+2)//2=3. m=3. k=2*3 -4 = 2. Which is m-1=2. So valid. Check if first 3 is 'abc' and last 3 is 'bcc'? No. Wait, the merged string is 'abcc'. The last 3 characters are 'bcc'. Which is not same as first 3. So code would not find it. But in reality, the merged string is formed by overlapping two 'abc's with k=2. So the first s is 'abc', the second s is 'abc'. Overlapping 2 characters: the last 2 of first s is 'bc', which must match the first 2 of the second s 'ab'? No, that's not the case. Wait, the overlap is between the end of first s and the start of the second s. So the last 2 of first s is 'bc', and the first 2 of the second s is 'ab'? Which are not same. So this is invalid. So the code correctly does not return it. So perhaps this case is invalid. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother example: s is 'abab', and merged with overlap k=2. So the merged string is 'abab' + 'ab' → 'ababab' (length 6). So len(t)=6. For this case, m is len(s)=4. Let's check. L=6. m_start = (6+2)//2=4. m_end=5. So m can be 4 or 5.\n\nFor m=4: check first 4 is 'abab', last 4 is 'baba'? The merged string is 'ababab' (positions 0-5). Last 4 is positions 2-5: 'abab'. Which is same as first 4. So code would return YES and s=abab. Which is correct. Because the merged string is formed by overlapping two 'abab's with k=2. The last 2 of first s is 'ab', which matches the first 2 of the second s 'ab'.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code would find this case.\n\nNow, code implementation:\n\nIn Python, read the input string t.\n\nCompute L = len(t). If L < 2, then output NO. Because for example, if L=1, no possible m. For L=2, m_start = (2+2)//2=2, m_end=1. So no possible m.\n\nElse:\n\nfor m in range( (L+2)//2 , L ):\n\nWait, in Python, the range is exclusive on the upper end. So need to loop from m_start to m_end inclusive. So:\n\nfor m in range( m_start, m_end +1 )\n\nSo:\n\nm_start = (L + 2) // 2\n\nm_end = L-1\n\nfor m in range(m_start, m_end + 1):\n\n   if len(t) >= m:\n\n      first_part = t[0:m]\n\n      last_part = t[-m:]\n\n      if first_part == last_part:\n\n          print(\"YES\")\n\n          print(first_part)\n\n          exit()\n\nAfter checking all m, if none found, print \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, for m to be valid, the length of t must be at least m. But since m ranges up to L-1, and L is the length of t, then m can be up to L-1, which is okay. For example, for L=5, m can be 3,4. For m=4, t[-4:] is the last 4 characters.\n\nSo code:\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nL = len(t)\n\nif L < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    m_start = (L + 2) // 2\n\n    m_end = L -1\n\n    for m in range(m_start, m_end +1):\n\n        if m > L:\n\n            continue  # but since m_end is L-1, this can't happen.\n\n        first_part = t[:m]\n\n        last_part = t[-m:]\n\n        if first_part == last_part:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n            print(first_part)\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about cases where m is such that the first_part and last_part are same, but the overlapping k is zero? No, because the code ensures that m is in the range that makes k=2m -L between 1 and m-1.\n\nBut in code, we don't check that. However, the way m is chosen ensures that k is between 1 and m-1. For example, m >= (L+1)/2 → 2m >= L+1 → 2m - L >= 1. And since m <= L-1 → 2m - L <= 2(L-1) - L = L-2. Since m-1 is L-1 -1 = L-2. So 2m -L <= L-2 = m-1 (since m = L-1 → 2m - L = 2(L-1) - L = L-2 = m-1). So yes, for all m in the range, k is between 1 and m-1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input 'abcabc' (third example). Its length is 6. m_start is (6+2)//2=4. m_end=5.\n\nFor m=4: first_part is 'abca', last_part is t[-4:] which is 'babc' → not same. For m=5: first_part is 'abcab', last_part is t[-5:] which is 'bcabc' → not same. So output NO. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' (length 8). m_start is (8+2)//2 = 5. m_end=7.\n\nCheck m=5: first_part is 'ababa', last_part is t[-5:] which is 'babab' → not same.\n\nm=6: first_part is 'ababab', last_part is t[-6:] → t is 'abababab', so last 6 is 'ababab' (positions 2-7). So yes. So returns YES and 'ababab'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is 'acacacaca' (length 9). m_start is (9+2)//2 = 5.5 → 5.5 is 5.5, but in Python (9+2) is 11, divided by 2 is 5.5 → integer division gives 5. So m ranges from 5 to 8.\n\nFor m=5: first_part is 'acaca', last_part is t[-5:] which is 'acaca' → yes. So returns YES.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple possible m's? For example, if the string is 'aaaaa' (length 5",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an overlapping error. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second message, with the overlap length being positive and less than the length of the message.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Overlap**: If the original message `s` is merged with itself with an overlap of `k` characters, the resulting string `t` will have a length of `2 * len(s) - k`. Here, `k` must be between 1 and `len(s) - 1`.\n2. **Determine Valid Lengths**: For a given string `t` of length `L`, we need to check possible lengths `m` for `s` such that `m` ranges from `(L + 2) // 2` to `L - 1`. This range ensures that the overlap `k = 2 * m - L` is valid.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each valid length `m`, check if the first `m` characters of `t` match the last `m` characters of `t`. If they do, it implies that `t` could be formed by overlapping two messages of length `m`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nL = len(t)\n\nif L < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    m_start = (L + 2) // 2\n    m_end = L - 1\n    for m in range(m_start, m_end + 1):\n        first_part = t[:m]\n        last_part = t[-m:]\n        if first_part == last_part:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(first_part)\n            found = True\n            break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input string `t` and determine its length `L`.\n2. **Edge Case Check**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, immediately print \"NO\" since it's impossible to form such a string with an overlap.\n3. **Range Calculation**: Calculate the valid range of possible lengths `m` for the original message `s`. This range is derived from ensuring the overlap `k` is valid.\n4. **Overlap Check**: For each valid length `m`, check if the first `m` characters match the last `m` characters of `t`. If a match is found, print \"YES\" followed by the matched substring as the possible original message `s`.\n5. **Result Determination**: If no valid length `m` is found, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths for the original message `s` and ensures correctness by leveraging string slicing and comparison.",
