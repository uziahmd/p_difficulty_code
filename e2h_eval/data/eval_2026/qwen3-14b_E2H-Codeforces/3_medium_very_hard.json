Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum radius d that the lanterns need to have so that the entire street of length l is illuminated. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. Each lantern at position ai can light up points within distance d. So, the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on [0, l] is within d of at least one lantern.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, the key idea is probably to look for the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would require the largest d.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would be a candidate. Similarly for the end of the street. Because if the first lantern is at position a1, then the area from 0 to a1 - d must be covered. Wait, no. Wait, the lantern's coverage is from ai -d to ai +d. But since the street is from 0 to l, we have to make sure that all points in [0, l] are covered.\n\nSo, for example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the leftmost part of the street (from 0 to a1) must be covered. The maximum distance here would be a1 - 0, but since the lantern can cover up to d, then the leftmost point (0) needs to be within d of some lantern. So if the first lantern is at a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 must be <= d. Similarly for the end.\n\nWait, but maybe the first lantern is not at 0. For instance, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 3. So the lantern's coverage would start at 3 - d. To cover 0, 3 -d must be <= 0. Which implies that d >= 3. But that's only if there's no other lantern before it. So, the initial step is to sort the lantern positions.\n\nSo the steps I think are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance between the first lantern and 0. That's (a[0] - 0). The required d for this part is a[0], because the lantern's coverage needs to reach 0. So the maximum of (a[0] - 0) and (l - a[-1]) would be candidates.\n3. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns is important. For example, if two lanterns are at positions x and y (x < y), then the middle of the gap is at (x + y)/2. The distance from x to this middle is (y -x)/2. So the required d for this gap is (y -x)/2. Because the lanterns' coverage must overlap enough to cover the entire gap. So for each consecutive pair, we calculate (current - previous)/2, and take the maximum of these values.\n4. The answer is the maximum between the first part (distance from start to first lantern, and from last lantern to end) and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSort the array of lanterns. Then:\n\nmax_d = max( (a[0] - 0), (l - a[-1]) )\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n   gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   current_max_gap = gap / 2\n\n   if current_max_gap > max_d:\n\n       max_d = current_max_gap\n\nThen return max_d.\n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nLet me think. Suppose there's a gap between two lanterns. The worst case is the middle of the gap. Because that point is farthest from both lanterns. So the required d for that gap is half the gap. So the maximum of all those would be the required d.\n\nYes. And for the ends, the first lantern's left side and the last lantern's right side. For example, if the first lantern is at position a[0], then the leftmost point is 0. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0], so the d needs to be at least a[0] to cover 0. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: All lanterns are at 0. Then, the first part is 0, but the end is l - 0 = l. So the answer would be l. Because the lanterns can't cover beyond 0, so the entire street needs to be covered by the lanterns. Wait, but if all lanterns are at 0, then their coverage is from 0 -d to 0 +d. But since the street is from 0 to l, the coverage for the right side is up to d. So to cover the entire street, d must be at least l. Because the lanterns can't cover beyond their positions. So yes, the code would take l - a[-1] as l - 0 = l, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1. Then, the lantern is at some position a. Then, the maximum between a and (l -a) is the required d. Because the lantern's coverage must reach from 0 to l. So for example, if a is 5, l is 10. Then the left part is 5, the right part is 5. So d is 5. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother example: the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCheck the first part: a[0] is 0. So 0 - 0 is zero. The last part is 15 -15 = 0. Then, check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2=1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5, which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 5\n\npositions 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. \n\nFirst part: 2 - 0 = 2. Last part: 5 -5=0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3 → 3/2 = 1.5. So the maximum is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm works for the samples.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as the maximum between a[0] and (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through the sorted list, for each consecutive pair, compute the gap, divide by 2, and compare to max_d.\n\nFinally, output the max_d.\n\nNow, what about if there are multiple lanterns at the same position? For example, if two lanterns are at the same position. Then the gap between them is zero, so (gap/2) is zero. So it doesn't affect the max_d. So that's handled correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=0. Wait, but according to the input constraints, l is at least 1. So no, l is ≥1. So no problem.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nIn Python, read the input. For each test case.\n\nBut the input is given as two lines per test case? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l.\n\nThe next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo for the sample input, the first example is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen the second example is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo the code should read multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user provided two examples, but in the actual problem, perhaps the input is one test case. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then the next line. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. Wait, but the sample shows two inputs. Wait, perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then the next line. So maybe the code should read one test case. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. Wait, perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... \n\nThe next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps in the problem, the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, no. The sample input shows two test cases, but in the problem description, the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. Maybe the problem is that the user provided two examples, but the actual code needs to read one test case. Or perhaps the code needs to read multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as follows. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... \n\nThe next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nLooking at the sample input given in the problem:\n\nSample input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSample output:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nAh, so the sample input is two test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases. But how? Because the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then the next line. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how many test cases are there? The problem says that the code should read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the input format is given for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code should read until EOF, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut the problem statement's input section says that the first line contains n and l, then the next line contains the ai. So perhaps the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the user included two test cases in the sample input, but the actual code is supposed to process one. But that's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... \n\nThe next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the input is for one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the sample input includes multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to read one. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user provided two test cases as examples, but the code is supposed to read one. But how to know?\n\nWait, looking at the problem's note: the sample input shows two test cases, but the output has two corresponding outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all test cases from the input.\n\nBut how to read them? Because in programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. But the problem statement's input description is ambiguous. However, looking at the problem's original source, perhaps it's from Codeforces. Let me check the original problem.\n\nWait, the problem is \"Vanya and Lanterns\" which is a Codeforces problem. Let me check the original problem's input description.\n\nOriginal problem's input:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one. However, in the problem's sample input, the first line is the first test case's input, then the second line is the second test case's input. But how does that work?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is for the first test case, the second line is for the second test case. But that's not possible. Because for each test case, there are two lines. So the sample input is:\n\nFor example, the first test case's input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen the second test case's input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo the sample input is two test cases, each with two lines. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines for each test case. Therefore, the code should read all test cases. But how to know how many test cases there are? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes the code must read until EOF. So perhaps the code should read all test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is for the first test case, the next line is for the first test case's ai. Then the next line is for the second test case's n and l, then the next line for its ai.\n\nTherefore, the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. But given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input may have only one test case. However, the user's sample shows two. So perhaps the code must read multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all lines until EOF, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to do that in Python? Well, in Python, we can read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs, and process each pair.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows two. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as two separate test cases, and the output has two answers. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all test cases.\n\nBut how? Well, perhaps the code should read all lines, and for each pair of lines, process them as a test case.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competitions, when the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then the next line, but the sample shows multiple test cases, it's possible that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, in the original problem statement, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows two. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input's formatting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list of two test cases, but the actual code should process one. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user provided the input as two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to read one. However, the sample output shows two outputs, which implies that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking at the problem's original source (if I remember correctly), the problem is from Codeforces Round 336 (Div 2), problem C. Let me check.\n\nUpon checking, the original problem's input is indeed a single test case. The sample input shows two test cases, but that's just for the example. So perhaps the code should read a single test case.\n\nBut then why does the sample input show two test cases? Because the problem's sample input shows two different test cases and their outputs. So the code should process one test case, but the sample shows two. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case, but the sample input has two test cases. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case, and the sample input is two test cases. But that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is given as multiple test cases, and the code must read all of them. But how to know? Well, in the problem's original statement, the input is described as for a single test case. So perhaps the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut given that the sample input has two test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, and the problem's input is multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to proceed? Well, looking at the code's expected output. For example, in the sample input, the output is two lines. So the code should generate two outputs. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code should read all test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nThus, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, reading from stdin can be done via sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nSo, the code can read all lines, and process them in pairs. For example, for each i in 0, 2, 4, etc., take lines[i] and lines[i+1] as the n, l and the ai.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's proceed.\n\nSo, for example, the code could do something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n    n, l = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    # process and output\n\nBut this would work for the sample input, where there are two test cases, each with two lines.\n\nBut what if the number of lines is odd? Well, perhaps the problem ensures that the input is correct, with even number of lines.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input has two test cases, each with two lines, this approach would work.\n\nSo, assuming that the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nOnce the code reads the a array, sorts it, and computes the maximum d as discussed.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nSort the array a.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen, iterate through the sorted array, for each consecutive pair, compute the difference, divide by 2, and compare to max_d.\n\nThen, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 0? No, the constraints say n ≥ 1.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nHandle the case when n is 0? No, since n ≥ 1.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen, for i from 1 to n-1:\n\n   gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   current = gap / 2.0\n\n   if current > max_d:\n\n       max_d = current\n\nThen, output max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? No, since n ≥ 1.\n\nSo, code:\n\nNow, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nAfter sorting, the list is [0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]\n\na[0] is 0, l - a[-1] is 15 -15 = 0. So initial max_d is 0.\n\nThen, the gaps between consecutive elements:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d becomes 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nSo the final max_d is 2.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: second test case.\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. After sorting, [2,5].\n\na[0] is 2, l - a[-1] is 5-5=0. So initial max_d is 2.\n\nThen, the gap between 5 and 2 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d remains 2. So output is 2.0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, for each test case, after processing, print the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to format it? For example, in Python, using print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d)).\n\nBut need to make sure that even if the number is integer, it's printed with 10 decimals. Like 2.0000000000.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut what about when the max_d is something like 2.5, which is exactly representable as a float? Well, in Python, when printing, using the format string with .10f will show 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut for cases where the value is not exactly representable, like 0.1, but the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, so using floating point calculations should be sufficient.\n\nNow, code:\n\nPutting all together:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        n, l = map(int, lines[i].split())\n        a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n        a.sort()\n        max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n        for j in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[j] - a[j-1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, what if there's an error in the input lines? Like, if there's an odd number of lines? Well, the problem says that the input is correct, so perhaps we don't need to handle that.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample input lines:\n\nLine 0: '7 15'\n\nLine 1: '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'\n\nLine 2: '2 5'\n\nLine 3: '2 5'\n\nProcessing i=0:\n\nn=7, l=15.\n\na = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] → sorted to [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen, for j from 1 to 6:\n\nj=1: a[1]-a[0] =3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5\n\nj=2: 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nj=3: 7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nj=4: 9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nj=5: 14-9=5 → 2.5 → max_d is now 2.5.\n\nj=6: 15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nSo output is 2.5000000000.\n\nThen, i=2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na is [2,5]. sorted.\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.\n\nThen j=1: 5-2=3 → 1.5 → no change. So output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, what about some other test cases?\n\nTest case where n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then:\n\nmax_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. So output is 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case where n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then:\n\nmax_d is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0.\n\nThen gaps between 0 and 5: 5/2 = 2.5. Between 5 and 10: 5/2=2.5. So max_d is 2.5. So output is 2.5.\n\nAnother case where lanterns are not covering the ends. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[1, 9]. Then:\n\nmax_d is max(1, 10-9=1) → 1. Then the gap between 1 and 9 is 8 → 4. So max_d is 4. So output 4.0.\n\nWhich makes sense. The middle of the gap is at 5. The distance from 1 is 4, and from 9 is 4. So d must be 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[1, 3, 7]. Then:\n\nsorted a is [1,3,7].\n\nmax_d is max(1, 10-7=3) → 3.\n\ngaps between 1 and 3 is 2 → 1.0. Between 3 and 7 is 4 → 2.0. So max_d remains 3. So answer is 3.0.\n\nWhich is correct. Because the end of the street is 10, and the last lantern is at 7. The distance from 7 to 10 is 3. So d must be at least 3. So the answer is 3.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is written as per the above.\n\nBut in the code, the loop is for i in range(0, len(lines), 2). But what if the input has more than two lines? Like, for example, three test cases. But the code would process each pair of lines as a test case. So for example, lines 0 and 1, then lines 2 and 3, then lines 4 and 5, etc.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 1e-9. So using floating point calculations is acceptable.\n\nIn Python, using floating points with division is okay. However, when dealing with very large numbers, but since the problem allows for up to 1e9 for l, but in Python, floating points have enough precision for that.\n\nBut for example, if the maximum gap is something like 1e9, then dividing by 2 would be 5e8, which is exactly representable as a float. So no problem.\n\nBut for cases where the numbers are not exact, like when the gap is an odd number, like 3, then dividing by 2 gives 1.5, which is exactly representable. So the code should be okay.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ that lanterns must have to ensure the entire street of length $ l $ is illuminated. The key insight is to consider both the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius $ d $.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap divided by two will be the required radius to cover the midpoint of that gap, which is the farthest point from either lantern in that segment.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius $ d $ is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the endpoints and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        n, l = map(int, lines[i].split())\n        a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n        a.sort()\n        max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n        for j in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[j] - a[j-1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n2. **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Distance Check**: The initial check ensures that the ends of the street are covered by considering the distance from the first lantern to the start and the last lantern to the end.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted list of lantern positions, we calculate the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The midpoint of the largest gap determines the necessary radius to cover that segment.\n5. **Precision Handling**: The result is formatted to 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required to illuminate the entire street, considering both the gaps between lanterns and the edges of the street.",
