Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. The key idea is probably to find the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns and then determine the required radius based on that. But wait, because the lanterns can be placed anywhere, including overlapping. Also, we need to consider the ends of the street.\n\nLet me think. For example, if there's a gap between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance between them would be divided by two, right? Because the optimal way to cover that gap would be to have each lantern cover half of the gap. But maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose two lanterns are placed at positions a and b, where a < b. The distance between them is (b - a). The middle point between them is at (a + b)/2. The maximum distance from either lantern to this middle point is (b - a)/2. So for that gap, the required radius would be (b - a)/2. But if the lanterns are placed in such a way that their coverage areas overlap, then that's okay.\n\nBut also, we need to check the ends of the street. Like, the first lantern might not be at 0. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly for the end of the street (l) and the last lantern.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in ascending order.\n2. Check the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The required d must be at least that distance.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). The required d must be at least that distance.\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum of (distance / 2) would be the required d for covering that gap.\n5. The overall answer is the maximum among all these values: the first part (start to first lantern), the last part (last lantern to end), and the max (distance between consecutive lanterns)/2.\n\nWait, yes. Because for the gaps between consecutive lanterns, the worst case is the maximum gap. For that gap, the required radius is half of it, since the two lanterns can each cover half of the gap. But if the gap is larger than twice the radius, then there will be a point in between that isn't covered. So the minimal radius is the maximum of all those (gap/2) values.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions. Then:\n\n- initial distance is a[0] - 0. So d must be at least this.\n- final distance is l - a[-1]. d must be at least this.\n- for each i from 1 to n-1, compute a[i] - a[i-1], divide by 2. Take the maximum of these.\n\nThe answer is the maximum of all these three values.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1. Then, the initial distance is a[0], and the final distance is l - a[0]. The maximum between these two would be the required d. Because the lantern's coverage needs to reach both ends.\n\nYes. So that case is covered.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the initial and final distances, then the max of the consecutive gaps divided by two. Then take the maximum of all these three.\n\nSo let's test with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they become 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nInitial distance is 0 - 0 = 0. Final distance is 15 - 15 = 0. Then the consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 1.5\n\n5-3 = 2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 5\n\npositions 2 and 5. Sorted as 2,5.\n\nInitial distance is 2 - 0 = 2. Final distance is 5 -5 = 0. The consecutive gap is 5-2=3 → 1.5. So the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: if n=1, l=10, a is 5. Then initial distance is 5, final distance is 5. Max is 5. So d=5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a is 0 and 10. Then initial is 0, final is 0. The gap between them is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So answer is 5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a is 0 and 8. Then initial is 0, final is 2. The gap is 8-0=8, divided by 2 is 4. So the maximum between 2 and 4 is 4. So answer is 4.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm seems solid.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial distance: a[0] - 0. But wait, no. Wait, the first lantern's position is a[0], but the start of the street is 0. So the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. But if the lantern is at 0, then this distance is zero. So the required d must be at least that.\n\nSimilarly for the end.\n\nThen, for the consecutive gaps, compute the difference between a[i] and a[i-1], divide by 2. Take the maximum of these.\n\nThen, the answer is the maximum between the initial, the final, and the max gap.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them.\n\nCompute initial = a[0] - 0.0 ?\n\nWait, but if the first lantern is at 0, then initial is 0. So the required d is 0 for that part.\n\nBut for example, if the first lantern is at 3, then initial is 3. So d must be at least 3 to cover the start of the street.\n\nSimilarly for the end.\n\nSo code:\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n == 0: ... but n >=1 according to input constraints.\n\nSo:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\ninitial = sorted_a[0] - 0.0\n\nfinal = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\ncurrent_max = max(initial, final, max_gap / 2.0)\n\nWait, but the max_gap is the maximum of the consecutive differences. Then dividing by 2.0 gives the required d for that gap. So the maximum of all those is the max_gap / 2.0.\n\nBut for example, if the max_gap is 5, then 5/2 is 2.5. Which is the required d.\n\nSo the answer is the maximum between initial, final, and (max_gap / 2).\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCompute initial, final, max_gap.\n\nThen the answer is the maximum of initial, final, (max_gap / 2).\n\nBut wait, what if the max_gap is between two lanterns, but the initial or final is larger?\n\nLike, suppose initial is 3, final is 4, and max_gap is 5. Then the answer is max(3,4, 5/2) = max(3,4, 2.5) → 4. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you read the input, for example, the first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo after sorted, it's [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nSo initial is 0 - 0 = 0.0.\n\nfinal is 15 - 15 = 0.0.\n\nmax_gap is 14 -9 =5. So 5/2 = 2.5. So the answer is 2.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: if the lanterns are at 0 and 5, l is 5. Then initial is 0, final is 0. The gap is 5, so 5/2 = 2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nBut if l is 10, and the lanterns are at 0 and 5. Then initial is 0, final is 5. So the answer is max(5, 5/2) → 5. So the d must be 5. Because the end of the street is 10, and the lantern is at 5. So the distance from 5 to 10 is 5, so d must be at least 5. So the code would return that.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i.\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nCompute initial = sorted_a[0] - 0.0 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial distance is sorted_a[0] - 0.0? Or 0.0 - sorted_a[0]? No. Because if the lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 3. So the initial distance is sorted_a[0] - 0.0. Because sorted_a[0] is the first lantern's position. So the distance from 0 to that lantern is sorted_a[0] - 0. But if the lantern is at 0, then it's zero. So yes.\n\nBut wait, if the lantern is at 0, then the initial distance is zero. So the required d is zero for that part.\n\nBut for example, if the first lantern is at 3, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 3. So the lantern's coverage must reach 0, which requires that d is at least 3. Because the lantern's coverage is up to d distance. So the lantern at 3 can cover from 3 -d to 3 +d. To cover 0, 3 -d <=0 → d >=3. So yes, initial is sorted_a[0] - 0.0.\n\nSimilarly for the end: l - sorted_a[-1]. Because the lantern is at sorted_a[-1], and the end is l. So the distance from the lantern to the end is l - sorted_a[-1]. So d must be at least that.\n\nSo code:\n\ninitial = sorted_a[0]\n\nfinal = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nthen, answer is max( initial, final, max_gap / 2 )\n\nBut wait, initial is sorted_a[0] - 0? Or is it 0 - sorted_a[0]?\n\nNo, sorted_a[0] is the position of the first lantern. The distance from 0 to that lantern is sorted_a[0] - 0. So initial = sorted_a[0] - 0.0. But if the lantern is at 0, then initial is 0. So yes.\n\nBut in code, sorted_a[0] is the first lantern's position. So initial = sorted_a[0] - 0.0 ?\n\nWait, no. For example, if the lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 3. So the initial distance is 3. So yes, initial is sorted_a[0] - 0.0.\n\nBut in code, sorted_a[0] is a number. So initial = sorted_a[0] - 0.0 is the same as sorted_a[0].\n\nWait, 0.0 is just a float. So for example, if sorted_a[0] is 0, then initial is 0.0. But if the lantern is at 3, then initial is 3.0.\n\nSo in code:\n\ninitial = sorted_a[0]\n\nBut wait, no. Because the first lantern's position is sorted_a[0], and the distance from 0 to that lantern is sorted_a[0] - 0. So yes, initial = sorted_a[0] - 0.0. Which is same as sorted_a[0].\n\nBut in code, if the first lantern is at 0, then initial is 0. So that's correct.\n\nSo code:\n\ninitial = sorted_a[0]\n\nfinal = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\nBut wait, what if the lantern is at 0, and the street is of length l. Then the initial is 0, and the final is l - sorted_a[-1]. So for example, if the lanterns are at 0 and 5, and l is 10. Then initial is 0, final is 5. So the answer would be max(0,5, (5/2)) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nThen, the maximum between initial, final, and max_gap / 2.0.\n\nSo in code:\n\nmax_d = max( initial, final, max_gap / 2.0 )\n\nBut wait, in the case where the initial is 3, final is 4, and the max_gap is 5. Then max_gap / 2 is 2.5. So the maximum is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut what about when n is 1?\n\nFor example, n=1, l=10, a is [5]. Then sorted_a is [5]. initial is 5, final is 5. max_gap is 0 (since there are no consecutive elements). So the max_d is max(5,5, 0/2) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo code for max_gap:\n\nif n == 1:\n\n   max_gap = 0.0\n\nelse:\n\n   compute the max_gap between consecutive elements.\n\nSo in code:\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nSo for n=1, the loop doesn't run, and max_gap remains 0.0.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nIn Python, the input is read from stdin. The first line contains two integers, n and l. The next line contains n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, but the user provided two test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the input is given as multiple lines. For example, for the first test case, the input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAnd for the second test case:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user has given two test cases. But for the code, the code should process one test case per run. So the code should read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is typically one test case.\n\nSo the code should read the first line as n and l, then the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is properly read. For example, sometimes, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nOnce the list is read, sort it.\n\nThen compute initial, final, max_gap.\n\nThen compute the maximum between initial, final, and max_gap / 2.0.\n\nBut wait, initial is sorted_a[0], but what if the lantern is at 0? Then initial is zero. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the variables are:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\ninitial = sorted_a[0]\n\nfinal = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nmax_d = max( initial, final, max_gap / 2.0 )\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but initial is sorted_a[0], which is an integer, but in Python, when you do max, it's comparing integers and floats. But that's okay.\n\nBut what if the initial is 0.0, and the max_gap is 5.0, etc.?\n\nBut the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nsorted_a is [2,5]\n\ninitial = 2.0\n\nfinal is 5 -5 = 0.0\n\nmax_gap is 5-2 =3.0\n\nso max_d is max(2.0, 0.0, 3.0/2) → max(2, 0, 1.5) → 2.0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. initial is 5, final is 5, max_gap is 0. So max_d is max(5,5, 0) →5.0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. initial is 0, final is 0, max_gap is 10. So max_d is max(0, 0, 5) →5.0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. initial is 0, final is 0, max_gap is 5. So max_d is 5/2 = 2.5. Which is correct. Because the middle gap is 5 between 0 and 5, and between 5 and 10. So the required d is 2.5.\n\nBut what if the lanterns are at 0 and 10, and l is 10. Then the initial is 0, final is 0, max_gap is 10. So d is 5.0. Which covers from 0-5 to 0+5 (so 0-5 and 5-10, which covers the entire street.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to print the answer with 10 decimal digits. So in Python, format it as a float with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut what about when the maximum is an integer? Like 2.0, which should be printed as 2.0000000000.\n\nSo using the format string with .10f would work.\n\nBut in Python, when you do that, it will show 10 decimal digits. So the code would be:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut in Python, the code may have issues with floating point precision. For example, if the actual value is 2.5, but due to floating point inaccuracies, it's stored as something like 2.499999999999999... or 2.500000000000000... ?\n\nBut since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, using floating points should be okay. But in Python, when dealing with numbers that can be represented exactly as floats (like 2.5), it's okay. However, for numbers that can't be represented exactly, like 0.1, there might be some issues. However, since the problem allows for 1e-9 error, using floating points is acceptable.\n\nBut in the code, the calculation is done with integers and divisions. So for example, if the max_gap is even, then dividing by 2.0 will give an exact value. Otherwise, it's a float.\n\nBut in Python, when you do division with /, it returns a float. So the code is okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin. Let me write the code.\n\nSo:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    initial = a[0]\n    final = l - a[-1]\n    max_gap = 0.0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    max_d = max(initial, final, max_gap / 2.0)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if the initial is 0.0? For example, when the first lantern is at 0. Then initial is 0.0. But in the code, initial is a[0], which is an integer. So when you do max(initial, ...), but initial is an integer, and other values are floats. But in Python, comparing integers and floats is okay.\n\nBut when you compute max_d, the code is correct.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\ninitial is 0, final is 15 -15 = 0. max_gap is 5 (from 9 to 14). So max_gap / 2.0 is 2.5. So the max is 2.5. So output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]. initial is 2, final is 0. max_gap is 3. So 3/2=1.5. max(2, 0, 1.5) → 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. initial is 5, final is 5. max_gap is 0. So max(5,5,0) →5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. initial is 0, final is 0. max_gap is 5. So max(0, 0, 5/2) → 2.5. So output is 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about if the lanterns are at positions 0 and 3, and l is 5. Then initial is 0, final is 5-3=2. The max_gap is 3. So the max between 0, 2, 3/2=1.5 → 2. So the answer is 2.0. Which is correct. Because the lantern at 3 must cover up to 5, which is 2 units away. So d=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut what about when the lanterns are not in order? Well, the code sorts them, so that's handled.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=0. But according to the input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then initial is 0, final is 1-0=1. So max_d is max(0, 1, 0) →1.0. Which is correct. The lantern is at 0, so the radius must be 1 to cover the entire street (from 0 to 1).\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[1]. Then initial is 1, final is 0. So max is 1.0. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs the answer. The code is as above.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nBut the code reads two lines, which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can light up a distance `d` around its position. The solution involves analyzing the positions of the lanterns and calculating the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, as well as the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Initial and Final Distances**: Compute the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Determine Maximum Gap Between Consecutive Lanterns**: Iterate through the sorted lantern positions to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The required radius for this gap is half of this maximum gap.\n4. **Compute Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius required is the maximum value among the initial distance, final distance, and half of the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    initial = a[0]\n    final = l - a[-1]\n    max_gap = 0.0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    max_d = max(initial, final, max_gap / 2.0)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in easily determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Initial and Final Distances**: These are the distances from the start and end of the street to the nearest lanterns, which directly influence the required radius.\n- **Maximum Gap Calculation**: The largest gap between consecutive lanterns determines the worst-case scenario where the radius needs to cover half of this gap to ensure full coverage.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is derived by taking the maximum of the initial distance, final distance, and half of the maximum gap, ensuring all parts of the street are illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n), where n is the number of lanterns. This ensures the solution is optimal and handles all edge cases effectively.",
