    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what instability is. It's the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, when I remove one element, I want the new max and min of the remaining elements to have the smallest possible difference.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be: for each element in the array, remove it, compute the max and min of the remaining elements, calculate their difference, and find the minimum among all these differences. But wait, if the array is large (like up to 1e5 elements), this approach would be O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible. For n=1e5, that would be 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo, I need a smarter way. Let's think about the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). When we remove one element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nIf the element we remove is the current maximum, then the new max would be the second maximum. Similarly, if we remove the current minimum, the new min would be the second minimum. If we remove some other element, the max and min remain the same as the original array's max and min. Wait, but that's only if the original max and min are not removed. So, for example, if the array has multiple instances of the max or min, removing one of them might not affect the overall max or min.\n\nSo, here's an idea: the optimal choice is to remove either the first occurrence of the max, the first occurrence of the min, or maybe some other element. But how do I find the best option?\n\nLet me think. The minimal instability after removing one element can be achieved by either:\n\n1. Removing the maximum element. Then the new instability is (second_max - min).\n2. Removing the minimum element. Then the new instability is (max - second_min).\n3. Or, if there are multiple maxima or minima, maybe removing one of them doesn't change the max or min. For example, if there are two max elements, removing one of them leaves the other as the max. So in that case, the instability would be (max - min) if the original array's max and min are still present.\n\nBut wait, if the original array has multiple max elements, then removing one of them doesn't change the max. Similarly for min. So, in that case, the instability remains the same as the original array. However, if the original array has only one max and one min, then removing either of them would change the instability.\n\nSo, the key is to find the minimum between:\n\n- The original instability minus the case where we remove the max or min, but that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between:\n\n- (max of the array after removing the first occurrence of the max) - (min of the array after removing the first occurrence of the max)\n- (max of the array after removing the first occurrence of the min) - (min of the array after removing the first occurrence of the min)\n- Or, if there are multiple max or min, maybe even other possibilities.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal instability is achieved by either removing the max, removing the min, or removing some other element. However, if the array has more than one max or more than one min, then removing any of them would leave the max or min unchanged. So, for example, if the array has multiple max elements, then removing one of them would leave the rest. Thus, the instability would be (original_max - original_min), which is the same as before. But if you remove a non-max and non-min element, the instability remains the same. Therefore, in that case, the minimal instability is the original instability, but if you can remove the max or min, you can get a better value.\n\nSo, the minimal instability would be the minimum between:\n\nCase 1: Remove the max. Then the new instability is (second_max - original_min).\n\nCase 2: Remove the min. Then the new instability is (original_max - second_min).\n\nCase 3: Remove some other element. Then the instability is (original_max - original_min), but only if there are multiple max and/or min elements. Otherwise, if there's only one max and one min, then removing any other element leaves the max and min unchanged, so instability is same as original.\n\nBut how do I compute the second_max and second_min?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal instability after removing one element can be found by considering the following possibilities:\n\n- If the array has all elements the same, then removing any element gives instability 0.\n\nOtherwise, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\na) The instability after removing the first occurrence of the maximum element.\n\nb) The instability after removing the first occurrence of the minimum element.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple maxima? Like, say the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. The original instability is 7-1=6. If I remove the 7, the instability is 3-1=2. If I remove one of the 3s, then the instability is 7-1=6. So, in this case, the best is to remove the max. So, the answer is min between (case a and case b).\n\nBut how to compute the case a and case b?\n\nFor case a: when you remove the max element. The new max is the second maximum. But what is the second maximum? Well, if there are multiple max elements, like in [3, 3, 7], removing one of the 3's would not affect the max. But if you remove the max (7), then the new max is 3.\n\nWait, but in the case of the array [1, 3, 3, 7], the max is 7. So, when you remove it, the new array is [1,3,3], so max is 3, min is 1. Instability is 2.\n\nIn this case, the second_max is 3. So, for case a, the instability is (second_max - original_min).\n\nSimilarly, for case b, the instability is (original_max - second_min).\n\nSo, the idea is to compute the original max and min, then compute the second_max and second_min, but how?\n\nWait, but how to compute the second_max and second_min?\n\nAlternatively, if we sort the array, then the original max is the last element, the original min is the first. Then, if we remove the max, the new max is the previous element. But that's only if there is only one occurrence of the max. However, if there are multiple max elements, then the new max is the same as the original. For example, sorted array [1,3,3,7,7]. Original max is 7. If we remove one 7, the new max is 7. So the instability is (7 - min) which is same as original.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find the second maximum and second minimum in the array, but considering that there could be duplicates.\n\nBut how can I compute that?\n\nAnother approach: For the original array, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between:\n\n- (the max of the array after removing one element) minus (the min of the array after removing one element).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think: the max and min of the array after removing one element can be determined based on whether the element removed was the original max, original min, or something else.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios:\n\nSuppose the original array has max M and min m.\n\nIf I remove an element that is not M or m, then the new array's max is still M, and the new array's min is still m. So the instability is M - m.\n\nIf I remove the element M, then the new array's max is the second maximum, and the new min is m. So the instability is (second_max - m).\n\nIf I remove the element m, then the new array's min is the second min, and the max is M. So the instability is (M - second_min).\n\nTherefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n- (M - m) (if there are multiple Ms or multiple ms, because then removing one of them doesn't change the max or min, so the instability remains M - m. But if there's only one M and one m, then removing one of them would change the instability to either (second_max - m) or (M - second_min), which could be better than M - m.)\n\nWait, but in the case where there are multiple Ms and/or ms, then removing one of them won't change the max or min. So, the instability would remain M - m. However, if there are multiple Ms and/or ms, then there's a possibility that removing another element (not M or m) would leave the instability as M - m. So, the minimal instability is the minimum between (M - m) and (second_max - m) and (M - second_min).\n\nBut how to compute second_max and second_min?\n\nBut what if the array has multiple max elements? For example, array [1, 3, 3, 7, 7]. Then, the original max is 7. If we remove one of the 7s, the new max is still 7. So, the instability is 7 - 1 = 6, same as before. However, if we remove the 1 (the min), then the new min is 3, and the instability is 7 - 3 = 4. Which is better than the original instability of 6. So, in that case, the minimal instability would be min(6, 4, ...).\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCompute the original max and min.\n\nCompute the second_max, which is the maximum value in the array excluding the original max. However, if there are multiple max elements, then the second_max is the same as the original max. For example, in [3, 3, 7], the original max is 7. If we remove it, the second_max is 3. But if we have [3, 3, 7, 7], the original max is 7. If we remove one of them, the second_max is 7.\n\nSo, how to compute the second_max?\n\nOne way is to find the maximum value that is less than the original max. But if there are multiple max elements, then the second_max is the same as the original max. So, for example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], then the original max is 7. The second_max is 3. If the array is [7, 7, 7], the original max is 7, and the second_max is 7.\n\nSo, to compute the second_max, we can iterate through the array and find the maximum value that is not equal to the original max. If there are no such elements (i.e., all elements are the same as the original max), then the second_max is the same as the original max.\n\nSimilarly for the second_min.\n\nWait, but how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the original max is M. The second_max is the maximum value in the array when we exclude all instances of M. However, if there are no elements left after excluding all M's, then the second_max is undefined. But in that case, the array is all M's, so when you remove one element, the array is all M's except one, so the instability is zero. So, for example, if the array is [M, M, M], then removing any element gives [M, M], instability is zero.\n\nSo, for the case of second_max, if the array has more than one occurrence of M, then the second_max is M. Otherwise, it's the maximum of the array excluding that one occurrence of M.\n\nSo, how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nOriginal array a.\n\nCompute M = max(a), m = min(a).\n\nCompute the count of M in the array. If count >=2, then when we remove one M, the new max is still M. So, the instability after removing one M is M - min_new. But min_new is the original min, since we didn't remove it. So, in this case, the instability after removing M is M - m (since the new array has min m and max M). But if the array has multiple M's, then removing one of them doesn't change the max, so the instability is same as original. But that's not helpful. However, in this case, the minimal instability could be achieved by removing the min, or some other element.\n\nWait, but this suggests that the initial approach of considering cases where we remove the max or min may not be sufficient. Because, for example, if there are multiple max elements and multiple min elements, then removing any of them would leave the instability the same as original. But maybe there's another element that can be removed to make the instability smaller.\n\nBut that's not possible. Because, if the array has multiple max and min elements, then the original instability is M - m. If you remove any element that's not max or min, the instability is still M - m. If you remove a max, the instability is M - m (because there are other max elements). Similarly for removing a min. So, the minimal instability in this case is M - m. Unless there's a way to reduce it by removing a max and a min, but since we can only remove one element, that's not possible.\n\nSo, the minimal instability in this case is M - m. However, if there's a scenario where removing a max (when there are multiple max) and also there's a way to get a lower instability, but I don't think so.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n- The original instability (if there are multiple max and/or min elements, so removing any element doesn't change the instability)\n\n- The instability after removing one max (which is (second_max - m))\n\n- The instability after removing one min (which is (M - second_min))\n\nBut how to compute second_max and second_min?\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute M and m.\n\n2. Compute the second_max: which is the maximum value in the array if we remove one occurrence of M. How?\n\nWell, if the array has more than one occurrence of M, then the second_max is M. Because after removing one M, there are others left. But if the array has exactly one occurrence of M, then the second_max is the maximum of the array excluding that M.\n\nSimilarly for the second_min.\n\nSo, to compute second_max:\n\ncount_M = number of times M appears in the array.\n\nif count_M > 1:\n\n   second_max_candidate = M\n\nelse:\n\n   second_max_candidate = max of the array after removing the first occurrence of M.\n\nSimilarly for second_min.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For the case where count_M is 1, then the second_max_candidate is the maximum of the array without that M. So, for example, the array is [1, 3, 7, 3]. The M is 7, count is 1. So, the array without 7 is [1,3,3], max is 3. So, second_max_candidate is 3.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly?\n\nAn efficient way would be to find the maximum value in the array excluding the first occurrence of M. However, in practice, for a large array, this can be done by iterating through the array once, keeping track of the max, but skipping the first occurrence of M.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of M? Well, we can loop through the array once and find the first occurrence of M, then loop again, skipping that index, and find the max.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, that's acceptable.\n\nSame for the second_min.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute M = max(a), m = min(a).\n\ncount_M = number of times M appears in a.\n\ncount_m = number of times m appears in a.\n\nCompute second_max_candidate:\n\nif count_M > 1:\n\n   second_max_candidate = M\n\nelse:\n\n   find the maximum value in the array excluding one occurrence of M (i.e., the first occurrence).\n\nSimilarly for second_min_candidate:\n\nif count_m > 1:\n\n   second_min_candidate = m\n\nelse:\n\n   find the minimum value in the array excluding one occurrence of m.\n\nOnce we have second_max_candidate and second_min_candidate, the options are:\n\nOption 1: remove a max element. Then the instability is (second_max_candidate - m).\n\nOption 2: remove a min element. Then the instability is (M - second_min_candidate).\n\nOption 3: the original instability (M - m) if there are multiple max and/or min elements, but in this case, when you remove any other element, the instability remains M - m. But this is only better than options 1 and 2 if it's smaller than both.\n\nWait, but in this case, the original instability (M - m) is the same as the instability when you remove any element that's not the max or min. So, the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n- (second_max_candidate - m)\n\n- (M - second_min_candidate)\n\n- (M - m) if there are multiple max or multiple min.\n\nWait, but when there are multiple max or multiple min, then removing an element that's not max or min gives the original instability (M - m). So, the minimal instability is the minimum between the original (M - m) and the options 1 and 2.\n\nWait, but if there are multiple max and multiple min, then the original instability is M - m. However, if you remove a max (which is possible, since there are multiple), then the instability is (second_max_candidate - m). But since there are multiple max, the second_max_candidate is M. So the instability is M - m. So, same as original. Similarly for removing a min. So, in that case, options 1 and 2 would give the same as original. So, the minimal instability is the minimum between original and options 1 and 2. But in that case, it's the same as original.\n\nBut when there are multiple max or multiple min, then the minimal instability is the minimum between (original instability) and (options 1 and 2). But since options 1 and 2 are the same as original, the minimal is original. So, in this case, the answer is the minimum between (original instability) and (option1 and option2), which is the same as original. So, the minimal instability would be min(original, option1, option2). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal instability is the minimum between (option1, option2, original_instability). But when there are multiple max and/or min, the original_instability is the same as option1 and option2. So, the minimal is the same.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nCompute the original_instability = M - m.\n\nCompute option1 = (second_max_candidate - m).\n\nCompute option2 = (M - second_min_candidate).\n\nThen, the minimal instability is min(original_instability, option1, option2).\n\nWait, no. Because original_instability is M - m. But when you remove a max, the instability is option1. But when there are multiple max, then option1 is (M - m). So, the original_instability is same as option1. So, the min between original and option1 is same as original. However, if there are multiple max and multiple min, then the option1 and option2 are same as original, and the minimal is original.\n\nBut in other cases, for example, if there's only one max and one min. Then, the original_instability is M - m. But when you remove the max, the instability is option1 (which is (second_max_candidate - m)), which could be less than original. Similarly for option2.\n\nSo, the correct minimal is min(option1, option2, original_instability)?\n\nWait, no. Because the original_instability is the instability if you remove an element that is not the max or min. But if there's only one max and one min, then removing any other element would leave the max and min as before. So, the instability is original_instability. But if you can get a lower instability by removing the max or min, then the answer is the minimum between option1, option2, and original_instability.\n\nBut in this case, original_instability is the same as the instability when you remove any other element. So, the minimal is min(original_instability, option1, option2).\n\nYes. So, the overall answer is the minimum of the three values.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute M, m, original_instability.\n\nCompute second_max_candidate and second_min_candidate.\n\nCompute option1 = second_max_candidate - m.\n\nCompute option2 = M - second_min_candidate.\n\nThe answer is min(original_instability, option1, option2).\n\nWait, but why is the original_instability considered here? Because in some cases, removing an element that's not the max or min would leave the instability as original_instability, which could be better than option1 and option2. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], original_instability is 3. If you remove 2, the instability is 4 - 1 = 3. If you remove 4, the instability is 3 - 1 = 2. If you remove 1, the instability is 4 - 2 = 2. So, the minimal is 2, which is min(3, 2, 2) = 2. So the code would compute option1 (second_max_candidate - m) and option2 (M - second_min_candidate). Let's see:\n\nOriginal M =4, m=1. count_M is 1, count_m is 1.\n\nsecond_max_candidate is max of array without 4, which is 3. So option1 is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nsecond_min_candidate is min of array without 1, which is 2. So option2 is 4 - 2 = 2.\n\noriginal_instability is 3. So the answer is min(3, 2, 2) = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 3, 3, 7]. original_instability is 6. M=7, m=1. count_M is 1, count_m is 1.\n\nsecond_max_candidate is max of array without 7: [1,3,3] → 3. option1 = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nsecond_min_candidate is min of array without 1 → [3,3,7] → 3. option2 = 7 - 3 = 4. original_instability is 6. So min(6, 2, 4) → 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 1, 1, 1]. original_instability is 0. count_M = 4, count_m =4. So, second_max_candidate is 1, second_min_candidate is 1. option1 is 1 - 1 = 0. option2 is 1 - 1 = 0. original_instability is 0. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 100000]. original_instability is 99999. count_M is 1, count_m is 1. option1: remove the max (100000), then the array is [1], so instability is 0. option2: remove the min (1), array is [100000], instability 0. original_instability is 99999. So the answer is min(99999, 0, 0) = 0. Correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems to work.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute second_max_candidate and second_min_candidate correctly.\n\nLet's think about how to compute second_max_candidate.\n\nWe need to find the maximum value in the array after removing one occurrence of the maximum value. So, for example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], then after removing one occurrence of 7, the array becomes [1,3,3], max is 3.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nApproach:\n\nFind the maximum value in the array (M). Then, iterate through the array and find the maximum value that is not equal to M. If there are no such elements (all elements are M), then the second_max_candidate is M. Otherwise, it's the maximum of the elements that are not M.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because if there are multiple M's, but we are allowed to remove one of them. So, the array after removing one M would have other M's. So, the max of the array after removing one M is still M. So, the second_max_candidate is M.\n\nBut if there is only one M, then the array after removing it is the array without that M, and the max is the second_max_candidate.\n\nSo, the way to compute second_max_candidate is:\n\nif count_M > 1:\n\n   second_max_candidate = M\n\nelse:\n\n   second_max_candidate = max of array without the first occurrence of M.\n\nSimilarly for second_min_candidate.\n\nSo, how to compute this?\n\nLet's code this step by step.\n\nFirst, find M and m.\n\nThen, count the number of times M appears in the array.\n\nThen, for the case where count_M is 1:\n\nWe need to find the max of the array after removing one occurrence of M. How to do this?\n\nWe can loop through the array, and find the first occurrence of M. Then, create a new array that excludes that element, and compute the max. However, for large arrays (n=1e5), creating a new array would be O(n) time and space, which is acceptable? Well, for Python, even with n=1e5, it's manageable. But perhaps we can do it more efficiently.\n\nAlternative approach: iterate through the array once, keeping track of the maximum value, but skip the first occurrence of M.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef find_second_max(a, M):\n    first_occurrence_found = False\n    max_val = -infinity\n    for num in a:\n        if num == M and not first_occurrence_found:\n            first_occurrence_found = True\n            continue\n        if num > max_val:\n            max_val = num\n    return max_val\n\nWait, but what if the array has multiple M's, but in this case, the count_M is 1, so this code will skip the first occurrence of M (which is the only occurrence), and compute the max of the rest of the array.\n\nYes. That would work. So, for example, if the array is [1, 3, 7, 3], M is 7, count is 1. The code skips the first occurrence of 7 (the third element), and computes the max of [1,3,3], which is 3. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for the second_min_candidate.\n\nSo, the code for finding second_max_candidate:\n\nif count_M > 1:\n\n   second_max_candidate = M\n\nelse:\n\n   find the max of the array after removing the first occurrence of M.\n\nSame for second_min_candidate.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array as list of integers.\n\nCompute M = max(a)\n\nm = min(a)\n\ncount_M = a.count(M)\n\ncount_m = a.count(m)\n\nNow, compute second_max_candidate:\n\nif count_M > 1:\n\n   second_max_candidate = M\n\nelse:\n\n   # find the max of the array after removing the first occurrence of M.\n\n   # find the first occurrence of M.\n\n   first_M_index = a.index(M)\n\n   # create a new array without that element?\n\n   # but for efficiency, perhaps compute the max while skipping the first occurrence.\n\n   max_val = -infinity\n\n   for i in range(len(a)):\n\n       if i == first_M_index:\n\n           continue\n\n       if a[i] > max_val:\n\n           max_val = a[i]\n\n   second_max_candidate = max_val\n\nSimilarly for second_min_candidate.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, the code may be slow if we have to loop through the array twice. However, given that n is up to 1e5, and the code is O(n) for each of these steps, it's acceptable.\n\nOnce we have the second_max_candidate and second_min_candidate, compute:\n\noption1 = second_max_candidate - m\n\noption2 = M - second_min_candidate\n\noriginal_instability = M - m\n\nanswer = min(original_instability, option1, option2)\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the original_instability is not considered. For example, when the array has multiple max and/or min, but the original_instability is M - m, and when you remove an element that's not max or min, the instability is same as original. So, the answer is the minimum between the original_instability, option1, option2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test this with the example where the array has multiple max and min.\n\nExample: array [1, 1, 7, 7]. original_instability is 6. count_M is 2, count_m is 2.\n\nSo, second_max_candidate is M (7), since count_M >1. So option1 is 7 - m (1) = 6.\n\nsecond_min_candidate is m (1), since count_m >1. So option2 is M (7) - 1 = 6. original_instability is 6. So answer is min(6, 6, 6) → 6. But if we remove one of the 7's, the array is [1,1,7], instability is 7-1=6. If we remove one of the 1's, the array is [1,7,7], instability is 7-1=6. So the answer is indeed 6, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 3, 3, 7]. original_instability is 6. count_M is 1, count_m is 1. So, option1 is 3 -1 =2. option2 is 7 - 3 =4. original_instability is 6. answer is min(6, 2, 4) → 2.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 1, 1, 7]. original_instability is 6. count_M is 1, count_m is 3.\n\nSo, second_max_candidate is M (7) only if count_M >1? No, count_M is 1. So, we need to compute the max after removing the first occurrence of M (7). The array after removal is [1,1,1], max is 1. So option1 is 1 - m (1) → 0. option2 is M (7) - second_min_candidate. What is second_min_candidate?\n\ncount_m is 3. So, since count_m >1, second_min_candidate is m (1). So option2 is 7 -1 =6. original_instability is 6. So answer is min(6, 0, 6) → 0. Which is correct. Because if you remove the max (7), the array is [1,1,1], instability 0.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where n=2. For example, input is 2, 1 100000. Then, removing either element gives instability 0. Which is handled correctly. Because:\n\nM = 100000, m = 1. count_M is 1, count_m is 1.\n\nsecond_max_candidate is the max after removing M (so array is [1], max is 1. option1 is 1 - 1 =0. second_min_candidate is the min after removing m (array is [100000], min is 100000. option2 is 100000 - 100000 =0. original_instability is 99999. answer is min(99999, 0, 0) → 0.\n\nAnother edge case: all elements are same. For example, n=5, [5,5,5,5,5]. Then M =5, m=5. original_instability is 0. count_M is 5>1. So, second_max_candidate is 5, option1 is 5-5=0. same for option2. answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: array has multiple max, but only one min. For example, [1, 7,7,7]. original_instability is 6. count_M=3, count_m=1. So, second_max_candidate is 7 (since count_M>1). option1 is 7 - m =6. second_min_candidate is the min after removing the first occurrence of m (which is 1). So the array after removal is [7,7,7]. min is 7. So option2 is 7 -7=0. So answer is min(6, 6, 0) → 0. Which is correct, because removing the min (1) gives array [7,7,7], instability 0.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplement in Python:\n\nRead n, then read the array.\n\nCompute M = max(a), m = min(a).\n\ncount_M = a.count(M)\n\ncount_m = a.count(m)\n\nThen, compute second_max_candidate:\n\nif count_M > 1:\n\n   second_max_candidate = M\n\nelse:\n\n   find the first occurrence of M, then compute the max of the array excluding that element.\n\nSimilarly for second_min_candidate.\n\nBut in Python, for large arrays, the a.count(M) could be O(n), but since we need to do it once, it's acceptable.\n\nBut for the case where count_M is 1, how to find the first occurrence of M? Using a.index(M), which is O(n). Then, for the second_max_candidate, we have to loop through the array and skip that index.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, that's acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut what if the array is [M, M, ...], then a.count(M) is n, and the code for second_max_candidate is M.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the second_max_candidate:\n\ndef get_second_max(a, M):\n    if a.count(M) > 1:\n        return M\n    else:\n        first_index = a.index(M)\n        max_val = -float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(a)):\n            if i == first_index:\n                continue\n            if a[i] > max_val:\n                max_val = a[i]\n        return max_val\n\nSimilarly for get_second_min.\n\nBut for the get_second_min function:\n\ndef get_second_min(a, m):\n    if a.count(m) > 1:\n        return m\n    else:\n        first_index = a.index(m)\n        min_val = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(a)):\n            if i == first_index:\n                continue\n            if a[i] < min_val:\n                min_val = a[i]\n        return min_val\n\nBut in Python, for large n, these loops may take some time, but for n=1e5, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nRead n.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nif n == 1:\n\n   ... but n >=2 according to input constraints.\n\nSo, proceed.\n\nCompute M = max(a), m = min(a).\n\nThen compute:\n\nif count_M is the number of times M appears in a.\n\nSimilarly for count_m.\n\nThen compute second_max_candidate and second_min_candidate.\n\nThen compute option1 and option2.\n\noriginal_instability = M - m\n\nanswer = min(original_instability, option1, option2)\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and we remove 5, then the new array is [1,2,3,4], instability is 3. Or if we remove 1, the instability is 4. But according to our code:\n\noriginal_instability is 4.\n\ncount_M is 1, count_m is 1.\n\nsecond_max_candidate is max of array without 5 → 4. option1 = 4 - 1 = 3.\n\nsecond_min_candidate is min of array without 1 → 2. option2 is 5 - 2 =3. answer is min(4,3,3) → 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut in Python, for the functions, perhaps we can inline them.\n\nBut for the case of count_M = 1, how to find the first occurrence?\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nM = max(a)\nm = min(a)\n\ncount_M = a.count(M)\ncount_m = a.count(m)\n\n# Compute second_max_candidate\nif count_M > 1:\n    second_max_candidate = M\nelse:\n    first_index = a.index(M)\n    max_val = -float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        if i == first_index:\n            continue\n        if a[i] > max_val:\n            max_val = a[i]\n    second_max_candidate = max_val\n\n# Compute second_min_candidate\nif count_m > 1:\n    second_min_candidate = m\nelse:\n    first_index = a.index(m)\n    min_val = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        if i == first_index:\n            continue\n        if a[i] < min_val:\n            min_val = a[i]\n    second_min_candidate = min_val\n\noption1 = second_max_candidate - m\noption2 = M - second_min_candidate\noriginal_instability = M - m\n\nresult = min(original_instability, option1, option2)\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what if the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element.
