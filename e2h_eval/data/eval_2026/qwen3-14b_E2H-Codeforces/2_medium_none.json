Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. Let me think about the requirements.\n\nSo, the problem says that the paper forms an X if two conditions are satisfied. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to check the diagonals. The main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All the cells in these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping cells? Like, in a square with odd length, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the center is part of both. So when checking the diagonals, all cells in both diagonals must be the same. So the main diagonal and anti-diagonal must all have the same character. But since they overlap at the center, that's already covered.\n\nSo first step: collect all the characters in the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then check that all the other cells are the same and different from that.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonals?\n\nFor a square of size n x n, the main diagonal is positions (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1. The anti-diagonal is positions (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut for each cell in the grid, we need to check whether it is on either of the diagonals. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. Or on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n-1. So for each cell, if it's on either of those, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check that all the diagonal cells (both diagonals) have the same character. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n\n2. Check that all the non-diagonal cells have the same character, say 'o_char', and that o_char != d_char.\n\nSo, how to do that?\n\nFirst, iterate through all cells. For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal. Collect all the diagonal characters and check they are the same. Then collect all non-diagonal characters and check they are same and different.\n\nBut maybe there's a more efficient way. Let's think.\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal cell (0,0) and check that all other diagonal cells are same as it. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. Wait, but the diagonals are overlapping in the middle. So for example, if the main diagonal has all same characters, and the anti-diagonal also has all same characters, but maybe the two diagonals have different characters. So that's not allowed. So the first step is to check that all the cells in both diagonals are same. So for example, for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, all their cells must be same as each other.\n\nSo perhaps collect all the cells in the diagonals into a set. If the size of the set is 1, then all are same. But then, the same applies for the non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think. For each cell (i, j) in the grid:\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's part of the diagonals.\n\nElse: it's part of the non-diagonals.\n\nSo first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's collect them into a set. If the size is not 1, then it's invalid. Then, collect all the non-diagonal characters into another set. If that set's size is not 1, invalid. Also, check that the two sets are different.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the diagonals have all same characters, and the non-diagonals have all same but same as diagonals. Then it's invalid. Because the non-diagonals must be different.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCheck that:\n\n- All diagonal cells are same (d_char).\n\n- All non-diagonal cells are same (o_char).\n\n- d_char != o_char.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read the grid. For each row, read the string.\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j):\n\nCheck if it's on a diagonal.\n\nSo, for the first part, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's collect them into a set. If the set has more than one element, return NO.\n\nThen, collect all non-diagonal characters into another set. If that set has more than one element, return NO.\n\nThen, check if the two sets are different. If they are same, return NO. Else, return YES.\n\nBut wait, what if the non-diagonal set is empty? Well, for n >=3, and odd. For example, n=3. The diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the center. So total diagonal cells: 3 + 3 -1 =5. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal is 4 cells. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So for n=3, yes.\n\nBut for n=1? Well, the input constraints say n is at least 3, so no problem.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\nCollect all the diagonal characters (i==j or i +j ==n-1). Check that all are same.\n\nCollect all non-diagonal characters. Check that all are same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo, how to collect them.\n\nLet me think. For each cell (i, j):\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for j in 0..n-1:\n\n       if i == j or i +j == n-1:\n\n           add to diag_chars\n\n       else:\n\n           add to other_chars\n\nThen, check:\n\nif len(set(diag_chars)) != 1 → no\n\nelse:\n\n   d_char = diag_chars[0]\n\n   if len(set(other_chars)) != 1 → no\n\n   else:\n\n       o_char = other_chars[0]\n\n       if d_char != o_char → yes else no\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, other_chars is 4 elements. For n=5, total cells is 25. Diagonals: 5 +5 -1 =9. Other is 16. So no problem.\n\nSo, that's the approach.\n\nNow, implement that in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nThe input is given as first line n, then n lines of strings.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, the code needs to read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings. Wait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as first line n, then n lines of letters.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings. But in reality, when the code is run, the input comes from stdin. So for example, for the first case, the input would be:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]. But that's probably just for the example. The actual code should read from stdin.\n\nSo, the code should read n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. Let's store them as a list of lists, or just process them as strings.\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j), check if it's on a diagonal.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndiag_chars = []\n\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diag_chars)) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        if diag_chars[0] != other_chars[0]:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? For example, when n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, other_chars is 4 elements. So no problem.\n\nBut what if all the non-diagonal cells are same, but same as the diagonal? Then it's invalid.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLet me see the grid:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → positions (0,0) is x (diagonal), (0,4) is x (anti-diagonal). The other positions (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are o's. But for row 0, j=0 and j=4 are diagonals. For row 1: o x o x o → positions (1,1) is x (main diagonal), (1,3) is x (anti-diagonal). The others are o's. Row 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is x (main diagonal), (2, 2) is also on anti-diagonal (since 2+2 =4, n-1 is 4 (n=5). So yes. So the diagonals here have x's. But in row 2, the first cell is s. Which is not on any diagonal. So for the other_chars, we have the s, etc.\n\nWait, for row 2, j=0: i=2, j=0. i + j = 2 + 0 = 2. n-1 is 4. So 2 !=4. So it's not on anti-diagonal. And i !=j. So it's part of other_chars. So in this case, the other_chars includes s, which is different from x. So the other_chars would have s, o, o, etc. So the other_chars would have multiple characters. So the first sample input would have other_chars with different characters. Hence, output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w → (0,0) is diagonal, (0,2) is anti-diagonal. So for row 0, the first and last are w. The middle is s (non-diagonal).\n\nRow 1: s w s → (1,1) is diagonal. The other positions are s and s. So for row 1, (1,0) is s, which is non-diagonal. (1,2) is s, non-diagonal. So the non-diagonal here are s and s.\n\nRow 2: w s w → same as row 0.\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w; (1,1) w; (2,0) w? Wait no. For i=2, j=0: i +j =2+0=2. n is 3, so n-1=2. So yes, i +j =2. So that's anti-diagonal. So (2,0) is part of anti-diagonal. Similarly, (0,2) is part of anti-diagonal. So the diagonals are:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So (0,0) is w, (1,1) is w, (2,2) is w. Anti-diagonal: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). Those are w, w, w. So all diagonals are w. The other chars are s, s, s, s. So other_chars is four s's. So the code would return YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input is 3:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x → diagonals are (0,0) x, (0,2) x. Middle is p (non-diagonal).\n\nRow 1: p x p → (1,1) x. Others are p and p (non-diagonal).\n\nRow 2: x p e → (2,0) is x (anti-diagonal?), because i=2, j=0. i +j = 2+0=2, n-1 is 2 (n=3). So yes. So (2,0) is anti-diagonal. (2,2) is e, which is part of main diagonal? i=2, j=2. So yes. So main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So (2,2) is e. So the main diagonal has x, x, e. So the diag_chars would be x, x, x (from main diagonal), and anti-diagonal (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x. So the diag_chars is [x, x, x, x, x, x, e]? Wait, wait for the code:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in 3x3 grid:\n\ncells on diagonals are:\n\ni=0, j=0 → yes.\n\ni=0, j=2 → yes.\n\ni=1, j=1 → yes.\n\ni=2, j=0 → yes.\n\ni=2, j=2 → yes.\n\nSo the diagonals have 5 cells. So in the third sample, the main diagonal is (0,0) x, (1,1) x, (2,2) e. The anti-diagonal is (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x. So the diag_chars includes x, x, e, x, x, x, x? Wait, no. For all cells that are on either diagonal. So for each cell:\n\ni=0, j=0 → main diagonal → added to diag_chars.\n\ni=0, j=1 → not on any diagonal → added to other.\n\ni=0, j=2 → anti-diagonal → added to diag.\n\ni=1, j=0 → i +j =1+0=1 !=2 (n-1=2). i !=j. So added to other.\n\ni=1, j=1 → main and anti → diag.\n\ni=1, j=2 → i +j =3 → n-1 is 2. No. So other.\n\ni=2, j=0 → anti → diag.\n\ni=2, j=1 → other.\n\ni=2, j=2 → main → diag.\n\nSo diag_chars is [x, x, x, x, e] ?\n\nWait, for (i,j) in (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So five elements. So in the third sample, the diag_chars would be:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So the set of diag_chars is {x, e} → len is 2. So the code would check that len(set(diag_chars)) is 1? No. So returns NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all diagonals are same, and non-diagonals are same but same as diagonals. For example, n=3:\n\nall cells are x. Then, diag_chars is x, and other_chars is x. So the code would check that the other_chars is same, but then check if d_char != o_char. Since they are same, returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are x, others are y. Then returns YES.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have some other letters. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal is x, anti-diagonal is x. But one of the non-diagonal is y and another is z. Then other_chars would have multiple elements, so returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nIn Python, the code can read from stdin. The first line is n. Then, read n lines, each line being a string.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading from stdin, the input may have leading/trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So each line is exactly n characters long.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead n from input. Then read n lines, stripping any whitespace (but probably, the input lines are correctly formatted).\n\nBut in practice, when reading via input(), the trailing newline is stripped. So, for example:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut need to make sure that each line is exactly n characters. However, according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nOnce the grid is read, proceed to collect the diag_chars and other_chars.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check diagonals\nif len(set(diag_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check others\n    if len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if diag_chars[0] != other_chars[0]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? For example, when n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe diag_chars would include:\n\nFor each cell on diagonals:\n\nRow 0: x (0,0), x (0,4)\n\nRow 1: o (1,1) ? Wait, no. Let's look at the grid:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x.\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x.\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → (2,2) is x. Also, i + j for (2, 2) is 4 (n-1 is 4). So yes. Also, for (2, 2) is main diagonal.\n\nRow 3: o x o x o → (3,1) is x? No, for i=3, j=1. i + j = 4. So yes. So (3,1) is part of anti-diagonal. Also, (3,3) is x (main diagonal). But for i=3, j=3 is main diagonal.\n\nRow 4: x o o o x → (4,0) is x (anti-diagonal), (4,4) is x (main diagonal).\n\nSo diag_chars would have:\n\nx, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x? Wait, let's count:\n\nEach cell on the diagonals. For n=5, there are 5 +5 -1 =9 cells (since the center is counted in both).\n\nSo for each cell:\n\n(0,0) x → diag.\n\n(0,4) x → diag.\n\n(1,1) x → diag.\n\n(1,3) x → diag.\n\n(2,2) x → diag.\n\n(3,1) x → diag.\n\n(3,3) x → diag.\n\n(4,0) x → diag.\n\n(4,4) x → diag.\n\nWait, that's 9 cells. All x. So diag_chars is all x. So len(set(diag_chars)) is 1. Then other_chars is all the other cells. For example, row 0: positions (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are o, o, o. Row 1: (1,0) is o, (1,2) is o. Row 2: (2,0) is s, (2,1) is o, (2,3) is o, (2,4) is o. Row 3: (3,0) is o, (3,2) is o, (3,4) is o. Row 4: (4,1) is o, (4,2) is o, (4,3) is o.\n\nSo other_chars has s and o. So len(set(other_chars)) is 2. So the code would print NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe diag_chars would be:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w, (1,1) w, (2,0) w, (2,2) w. So all w. other_chars are:\n\n(0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So all s. So code returns YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiag_chars:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So the set is {x, e} → len 2 → returns NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all x. Then diag_chars is all x, other_chars is all x. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are x, others are y. Then returns YES.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code is written. Let me write it properly.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions.
