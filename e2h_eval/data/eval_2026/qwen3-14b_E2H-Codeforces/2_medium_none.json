Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X or not. The conditions are that both diagonals have the same letters, and all other squares have the same letter different from the diagonals. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me think about the structure of the X. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left. All the cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Then, all the other cells (not on either diagonal) must be the same, but different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check all cells on both diagonals. They should all be the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check all other cells (non-diagonal) to be the same, and different from 'd'.\n\nHow to approach this in code?\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n, then n lines of strings. So for each test case, we can read n, then read n strings, each of length n.\n\nLet me think about the steps for each test case:\n\n- For each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n   - if it's on either diagonal, check if it's equal to the diagonal character.\n   - else, check if it's equal to the non-diagonal character, which must be different from the diagonal one.\n\nBut how to find the diagonal characters? Well, the first diagonal is where i == j. The second diagonal is where i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, check if it's on either of these.\n\nSo, first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are the same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple diagonal characters? Like, suppose the first diagonal has some letters, and the second diagonal has others. So for example, if the first diagonal is all 'x' and the second is all 'x', then that's okay. But if the first is 'x' and the second is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the first step is to check that all diagonal cells (both diagonals) are the same. Then check that all non-diagonal cells are same and different from that.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read n and the grid.\n\n- Collect all the diagonal characters (both diagonals). Let's collect them into a set. If the size of this set is not 1, then it's invalid. Also, check that all non-diagonal characters are same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nWait, but how to collect the diagonal characters. For each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's a diagonal cell. So collect all those characters. Then check that they are all the same. Let's say that the diagonal_char is the first character in that set. Then all others must be same as that.\n\nBut maybe there are no diagonal cells? No, since n is at least 3, and odd. For example, n=3: the center cell is part of both diagonals. So the diagonals will have overlapping cells.\n\nOnce the diagonals are checked, then check the non-diagonal cells. Collect all non-diagonal characters. Check that they are all same, and different from the diagonal_char.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. For the grid, collect all diagonal characters. Check if they are all same. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Collect all non-diagonal characters. Check if they are all same and different from the diagonal character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think. For each row in the grid:\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n      if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n          add to diagonal_chars\n\n      else:\n\n          add to non_diagonal_chars\n\nOnce we have these two sets, check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1 → NO\n\nelse:\n\n   diagonal_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n\n   if len(set(non_diagonal_chars)) != 1 → NO\n\n   else:\n\n      non_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n\n      if non_char == diagonal_char → NO\n\n      else → YES\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal characters? For example, when n=1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center is part of both diagonals. The other cells are non-diagonal. So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 3*3 - 3*2 + 1 (since the center is counted twice). Wait, the number of diagonal cells is 2n - 1 (since each diagonal has n elements, but they overlap at the center). So for n=3, 2*3-1=5 cells. So non-diagonal is 9-5=4 cells.\n\nSo, in code, for each cell, check if it's on either diagonal. Then collect the characters.\n\nBut in code, how to process this?\n\nIn Python, for each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string. Let's store it as a list of lists, or just process each line as a string.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1 → NO\n\nelse:\n\n   d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n\n   if len(set(non_diagonal_chars)) != 1 → NO\n\n   else:\n\n      nd_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n\n      if nd_char == d_char → NO\n\n      else → YES\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, since n is >=3, for example n=3, the non-diagonal has 4 elements. So no problem.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, n=1, but according to the input constraints, n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's test against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nLet's check the diagonals. For each cell (i,j):\n\ni=0, j=0 → yes (i=j). Also i +j =0 → yes. So diagonal.\n\ni=0, j=4 → i +j =4, which is n-1 (5-1=4). So yes.\n\nSimilarly for other cells.\n\nBut looking at row 2, column 0: i=2, j=0. i + j = 2+0=2. n-1 is 4. So not. So this cell is not on the diagonal. What's the value? s. So in the non-diagonal chars.\n\nBut the diagonal chars are:\n\nLooking at the first row, first column (x), then (0,4) is x. Then (1,1) is x, (1,3) is x. (2,2) is x. (3,1) is x, (3,3) is x. (4,0) is x, (4,4) is x. So the diagonal characters are all x's? Wait, but in row 2, column 2 is x. So the diagonals are all x's. But the non-diagonal chars include the 's' in row 2, column 0. So the non_diagonal_chars would have 's' and others. So the non-diagonal characters are not all same. Hence output is NO. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe grid is:\n\nrow 0: w s w\n\nrow 1: s w s\n\nrow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) → w, (0,2) → w. (1,1) → w. (2,0) → w, (2,2) → w. So all diagonals are w. Then non-diagonal cells are:\n\ncells (0,1) → s, (1,0) → s, (1,2) → s, (2,1) → s. So non-diagonal chars are all s. Which is different from w. So output YES. Which matches sample.\n\nThird example input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nrow 0: x p x\n\nrow 1: p x p\n\nrow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals: (0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So the diagonals have x, x, x, x, e. So the set of diagonal chars is {x, e} → length 2. So invalid. So output NO. Which matches sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are same, non-diagonal same but same as diagonals. For example:\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nxxx\n\nThen diagonals are all x. Non-diagonal are all x. So the non-diagonal is same as diagonal. So output is NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are all x, non-diagonal are all y. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have different letters. Like, first diagonal is x, second is y. So the set of diagonal chars has size 2. Output NO.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]. But in reality, the input is read from stdin. So for the code, the input is read via input() function, or via sys.stdin.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings, but in practice, when the code is run, the input comes from standard input.\n\nSo for the code, the code must read n, then read n lines.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nBut in Python, for example, for the first sample input, the first line is 5, then the next 5 lines are the rows.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, process grid.\n\nBut need to make sure that each line is exactly n characters. But according to the problem statement, it's given that each line has n letters.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nNow, collect diagonal_chars and non_diagonal_chars.\n\nSo:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n    if len(set(non_diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        nd_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut what if there are no non_diagonal_chars? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut for n=3, there are 9 - 5 = 4 non-diagonal chars. So the code is okay.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but according to the problem statement, n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, grid as per the first example. The diagonal_chars would be all x's except for the cell (2,2) which is x? Wait, in the sample input, the third row is 'soxoo' → row 2 (assuming 0-based) is 'soxoo'. So for i=2, j=2, it's 'x'. So the diagonals are all x. But the non_diagonal_chars includes the 's' in (2,0) and others. So the non_diagonal_chars will have s, o, etc. So the code would check that the non_diagonal_chars are all same? No. So the code returns NO.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ndiagonal_chars: positions (0,0)=w, (0,2)=w; (1,1)=w; (2,0)=w, (2,2)=w. So all w. non_diagonal_chars are (0,1)=s, (1,0)=s, (1,2)=s, (2,1)=s. So all s. So output YES.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiagonal_chars: (0,0)=x, (0,2)=x; (1,1)=x; (2,0)=x, (2,2)=e. So the diagonal_chars set is {x, e} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all x. Then diagonals are x, non-diagonal are x. So the code would check that non_diagonal is same, but same as diagonal → output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are x, non-diagonal are y. Output YES.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of strings, but for the code, it's read from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead n as int(input()), then read n lines with input().strip().\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a list, but in practice, the code reads from stdin. So the code should be written as:\n\nRead n, then read n lines.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n    if len(set(non_diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        nd_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal characters. So no problem.\n\nBut what if n=1? Well, the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nBut let's think about another case where the non_diagonal_chars is empty. But that's impossible for n >=3.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input 3:\n\nSample input 3 is:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nSo for diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0 → x.\n\ni=0, j=2 → x.\n\ni=1, j=1 → x.\n\ni=2, j=0 → x.\n\ni=2, j=2 → e.\n\nSo diagonal_chars = [x, x, x, x, e]. The set is {x, e} → len 2 → print NO. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case where the diagonals have different letters. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case where diagonals are same, but non-diagonal has different letters. For example:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nThen diagonals are a, a, a, a, a. non-diagonal is b, a, a, b. Wait, let's see:\n\nFor each cell:\n\ni=0, j=0 → diagonal (a)\n\ni=0, j=1 → non-diagonal (b)\n\ni=0, j=2 → diagonal (a)\n\ni=1, j=0 → non-diagonal (a)\n\ni=1, j=1 → diagonal (b)\n\ni=1, j=2 → non-diagonal (a)\n\ni=2, j=0 → diagonal (a)\n\ni=2, j=1 → non-diagonal (a)\n\ni=2, j=2 → diagonal (a)\n\nSo the non_diagonal_chars are [b, a, a, a]. So the set is {a, b} → len 2 → print NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same but different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Character Collection**: Separate the characters into two groups: those on the diagonals and those not on the diagonals.\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Check if all characters on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Check if all characters not on the diagonals are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n    if len(set(non_diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        nd_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings, each representing a row of the grid.\n2. **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Characters**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal where row index equals column index or anti-diagonal where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`), it is added to the `diagonal_chars` list. Otherwise, it is added to the `non_diagonal_chars` list.\n3. **Validation Checks**:\n   - **Diagonal Check**: Convert the `diagonal_chars` list to a set. If the set size is not 1, it means there are different characters on the diagonals, so the result is \"NO\".\n   - **Non-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, convert `non_diagonal_chars` to a set. If the set size is not 1, the result is \"NO\". Additionally, check if the non-diagonal character is different from the diagonal character. If they are the same, the result is \"NO\"; otherwise, it is \"YES\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the required conditions using set operations, which are optimal for checking uniqueness. The overall complexity is O(n^2) due to iterating through the grid, which is efficient given the constraints.",
