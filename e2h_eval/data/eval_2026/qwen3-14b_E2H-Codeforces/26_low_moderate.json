Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality must hold: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe we can find a way to simplify that.\n\nWait, the problem says x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So the order of the sides is such that x is between A and B, y is between B and C (but since B ≤ y, and y ≤ C), and z is between C and D. Also, the problem states that x ≤ B ≤ y, so x ≤ y. And since y ≤ C ≤ z, then y ≤ z. So the three sides are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z. Wait, no. Because x can be up to B, and y starts from B. So for example, if x is B and y is B, then x equals y. But in general, x can be up to B, and y starts at B. So the order is x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. Therefore, x can be less than or equal to y. But since y is at least B and x is at most B, then x ≤ y. Similarly, y ≤ C ≤ z, so y ≤ z. So the three sides are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z. Therefore, for the triangle to be non-degenerate, the sum of x + y must be greater than z. Because in a triangle with sides a ≤ b ≤ c, the condition is a + b > c. Because if that holds, then automatically a + c > b (since c ≥ b) and b + c > a (since c ≥ a). So the main condition here is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where:\n\nA ≤ x ≤ B,\n\nB ≤ y ≤ C,\n\nC ≤ z ≤ D,\n\nand x ≤ y ≤ z (since x ≤ B ≤ y and y ≤ C ≤ z, so x ≤ y ≤ z),\n\nand x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since the constraints are large (up to 5e5), we need an O(1) or O(n) approach per test case, or something that can compute the counts quickly.\n\nFirst, let's think about the ranges for each variable.\n\nx can be in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D].\n\nBut since x <= y <= z, but x can be up to B and y starts at B. So x can be up to B and y can be as low as B. So for x and y, x can be less than or equal to y. For example, if x is B and y is B, then x = y. So for all possible x and y in their ranges, we have x ≤ y.\n\nBut since y can be up to C, and z is from C to D, then z is at least C, which is >= y. So z >= y. Therefore, for any triple (x, y, z) in the ranges, we have x ≤ y ≤ z. Therefore, the triangle condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem is to count the number of (x, y, z) in their respective ranges where x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z, but that would be O(B * C * D), which is way too slow for the given constraints (since B and C can be up to 5e5, and D up to 5e5).\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about fixing x and y first, then find the number of z's that satisfy z < x + y and z >= C (since z is in [C, D]).\n\nWait, for each x and y, the possible z's must be in [C, D], and also z < x + y. But since z must be >= C, the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nBut since z must be at least C, and also at least y (since z >= y?), wait no. Because z is in [C, D], and y is in [B, C]. So y can be up to C, and z starts at C. So z >= y only if y <= C. Which it is. So z >= C >= y (since y <= C). So z >= y. So for a fixed x and y",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy specific constraints based on given values $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$. The constraints are such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$, and the triangle must be non-degenerate, meaning the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$, we know $x \\leq y \\leq z$. For a triangle to be non-degenerate, the critical condition is $x + y > z$.\n2. **Efficient Range Calculation**: Instead of iterating through all possible values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can optimize by fixing $x$ and $y$ and calculating the valid range of $z$ values that satisfy $x + y > z$.\n3. **Counting Valid $z$ Values**: For each valid pair $(x, y)$, the valid $z$ values must lie in the range $[C, \\min(D, x + y - 1)]$. This range can be efficiently calculated using prefix sums or direct arithmetic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        A = int(input[idx])\n        B = int(input[idx+1])\n        C = int(input[idx+2])\n        D = int(input[idx+3])\n        idx += 4\n        \n        total = 0\n        \n        # Precompute the count of z for each possible range\n        # For each x in [A, B], and y in [B, C]\n        # We need to find for each (x, y), the number of z in [C, D] where z < x + y\n        # Since z >= C, the valid z's are from C to min(D, x + y -
