    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. The key here is that there might be multiple possible correct answers, but we just need to find any one that's valid.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to figure out which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. Let's think about the properties of prefixes and suffixes.\n\nFor example, the original string s has certain prefixes and suffixes. For instance, the longest prefix is the entire string except the last character (but wait, no: the problem says that the given strings are all improper prefixes and suffixes. So the prefixes are of lengths from 1 to n-1, same for suffixes. So for a string of length n, the proper prefixes are s[0..i] for i from 0 to n-2 (assuming 0-based), and proper suffixes are s[i..n-1] for i from 1 to n-1.\n\nBut since the input gives all of these, but mixed up, we need to figure out which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nNow, the main idea is that the original string s must have exactly one prefix of each length from 1 to n-1, and same for suffixes. But since the input gives two strings for each length (since for each length l, there's one prefix and one suffix, but the input lists them all mixed up), we need to find which of the strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nBut how do we determine that?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the example given. For the first example input, the output is SPPSPSPS. The original string is ababa. Let's check the prefixes and suffixes:\n\nThe prefixes of length 1 to 4 are:\nlength 1: 'a'\nlength 2: 'ab'\nlength 3: 'aba'\nlength 4: 'abab'\n\nThe suffixes of length 1 to 4 are:\nlength 1: 'a'\nlength 2: 'ba'\nlength 3: 'aba'\nlength 4: 'baba'\n\nSo the input strings are: ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba. Let's see:\n\nThe input has two strings of each length. For example, for length 1: two 'a's. For length 2: 'ba' and 'ab'. For length 3: 'aba' and 'aba'? Or maybe other combinations. Wait in the first example input, the input is:\n\nn=5, then the next lines are:\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nSo the input strings are:\n\nLength 1: 'a', 'a' (two of them)\n\nLength 2: 'ba', 'ab' (two)\n\nLength 3: 'aba', 'aba' (two?)\n\nWait, no. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the input:\n\nThe input lines are:\n\nba (length 2)\n\na (length 1)\n\nabab (length 4)\n\na (length 1)\n\naba (length 3)\n\nbaba (length 4)\n\nab (length 2)\n\naba (length 3)\n\nSo for each length from 1 to 4 (since n=5):\n\nLength 1: two 'a's.\n\nLength 2: 'ba' and 'ab'.\n\nLength 3: 'aba' and 'aba' (so two same strings).\n\nLength 4: 'abab' and 'baba'.\n\nSo the original string is ababa. The prefixes of length 1 is 'a', length 2 is 'ab', length 3 is 'aba', length 4 is 'abab'. The suffixes are of length 1: 'a', length 2: 'ba', length 3: 'aba', length 4: 'baba'.\n\nSo in the input, for each length, there are two strings. For example, for length 3, the two strings are 'aba' and 'aba'. So in this case, one of them is the prefix (of length 3) and the other is the suffix (of length 3). But since they are the same, how do you tell? Well, in this case, the original string's prefix of length 3 is 'aba' and the suffix of length 3 is also 'aba'. So both are present in the input. So the problem says that the answer can be any that is consistent with some possible original string.\n\nSo how do we find the correct assignment of P and S?\n\nAn approach could be to find the original string s. Once we know s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we find s?\n\nWell, the original string s must have all the prefixes and suffixes given. So for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be present in the input. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) must be present. Also, the original string s must be such that for each of the input strings, they are either a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how to find s? Because the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes, but we don't know which is which.\n\nLet me think. For example, the original string s must have as its prefix of length n-1 a string that is present in the input. Similarly, the suffix of length n-1 is also present in the input. So perhaps the way to find s is to take the longest possible prefix (length n-1) and the longest possible suffix (length n-1) and combine them. But how?\n\nWait, for example, if we have two strings of length n-1. One is the prefix of s, and the other is the suffix of s. So the original string s would be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character (which is the first character of the suffix of length n-1?), or something like that. Wait, no. For example, if the prefix of length n-1 is P, and the suffix of length n-1 is S, then the original string s must be P + c, where c is the last character of s. But also, the suffix of length n-1 is S = s[1...n], so S is the string s without the first character. Therefore, the original string s is equal to P concatenated with the last character of S. Because S is the suffix of length n-1, which is s[1...n], so the original string is s[0] + S. But the prefix of length n-1 is P = s[0...n-2]. So combining these, the original string s is P + (last character of S). But since S is a suffix of length n-1, its length is n-1. So the original string s is P concatenated with the last character of S. But also, since S is the suffix of s, which is s[1..n], then the original string s is equal to the first character (s[0]) followed by S. So the first character of s is the first character of P, and the last character of s is the last character of S.\n\nBut how can we find s? Let's take the two strings of length n-1. One is the prefix, the other is the suffix. So the original string s would be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. But how do we know which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nAlternatively, for each pair of strings of length n-1, we can try to construct s as follows: suppose that one of them is the prefix (say, p) and the other is the suffix (say, s). Then the original string would be p + (last character of s). But also, the suffix of length n-1 is s, which is the original string without the first character. So the original string should be equal to the first character of p (since p is the prefix of length n-1) followed by s. Therefore, the original string would be p[0] + s. But also, the original string is p + (last character of s). Therefore, comparing these two expressions:\n\np + (last character of s) = p[0] + s ?\n\nWait, p is of length n-1. So p[0] + s is of length 1 + (n-1) = n. Which matches the length. Let's check for example. Suppose p is the prefix of length n-1, and s is the suffix of length n-1. Then the original string s is p + c, where c is the last character of the original string. Also, the suffix of length n-1 is the original string minus the first character, which is s. So the original string is p + c, and the suffix is (p + c)[1:] = p[1:] + c. So s = p[1:] + c. But since the original string is p + c, then the suffix of length n-1 is p[1:] + c. But according to the assumption, the suffix is s. So the s (the suffix string) is p[1:] + c. But the original string is p + c. Therefore, the original string can be written as p + (s[-1]). Because the suffix is s, which is p[1:] + c. Therefore, the last character of the suffix is c. So the original string is p + s[-1].\n\nSo the original string can be constructed by taking the prefix of length n-1 (p) and appending the last character of the suffix of length n-1 (s). But how do we know which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nWell, for each pair of strings of length n-1, we can try to construct s as p + s_suffix[-1], and then check if this s is consistent with all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input may have multiple possibilities, this approach might be feasible.\n\nBut considering that n is up to 100, and the number of possibilities for the pair of length n-1 strings is small (since there are exactly two strings of that length), this seems manageable.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Find all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each possible combination (each of the two being the prefix and the other being the suffix), generate a candidate s.\n\n   For example, for the first string (call it a) and the second (call it b):\n\n   - Assume a is the prefix of length n-1, and b is the suffix of length n-1. Then the original string would be a + b[-1].\n\n   - Then, check if this candidate s has all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes.\n\n   If yes, then proceed to assign P and S to each input string.\n\nBut how to check if the candidate s is valid?\n\nOnce we have a candidate s, we can generate all its prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1. Then, check that the input strings exactly match this set (with multiplicity, since for each length there are two strings, one prefix and one suffix).\n\nBut how to do that? Because the input strings may have duplicates. For example, in the second sample input, the input for n=3 is:\n\na, aa, aa, a.\n\nThe original string is 'aaa'. Its prefixes of length 1: 'a'; length 2: 'aa'. Suffixes of length 1: 'a'; length 2: 'aa'. So the input has two 'a's (for length 1) and two 'aa's (for length 2). So the candidate s would be 'aaa', and when generating all prefixes and suffixes, we need to collect all of them and compare with the input.\n\nBut the problem is that the input is given in arbitrary order. So for the candidate s, we need to generate all its prefixes and suffixes (each of lengths 1 to n-1), collect them into a list, and check that the multiset of input strings matches this.\n\nBut how to check that? For example, for the candidate s, generate for each length l (from 1 to n-1) the prefix and the suffix. Then, collect all these 2*(n-1) strings, and compare with the input list (after sorting? Or using a frequency count?).\n\nBut since the input is given in arbitrary order, but for each length l, there are exactly two strings (one prefix, one suffix), the candidate s must have for each l, exactly the two strings (prefix and suffix) present in the input.\n\nSo for the candidate s, for each length l, we can generate the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l. Then, check that these two strings are present in the input, with the correct counts.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for the candidate s, collect all the prefixes and suffixes, and then check that the input list is a permutation of this collection.\n\nBut since the input list has exactly 2n-2 elements, which is the same as the number of prefixes and suffixes of the candidate s, then if the multiset of the candidate's prefixes and suffixes matches the input's multiset, then the candidate is valid.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor each possible candidate s (generated from the two strings of length n-1):\n\n   Generate all prefixes and suffixes of s (for lengths 1 to n-1).\n\n   Collect all of them into a list.\n\n   Sort this list and compare with the sorted input list.\n\n   If they match, then this candidate s is valid.\n\nOnce we find a valid s, we can proceed to assign P and S to each input string.\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (for some length l) or a suffix of s (for some length l). Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S. However, since each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of s, this will work.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the first sample, the string 'a' is both a prefix (length 1) and a suffix (length 1). But in that case, since the input has two 'a's (for length 1), one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. So when processing each input string, we need to check if it's a prefix or suffix, but since there are two entries, we have to make sure that for each length, exactly one is marked as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\nBut how to do that? Because when checking each input string, we can't just check if it's a prefix, because for example, the same string may be both a prefix and a suffix. However, in the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for the correct candidate s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of s. So for each input string, it must be a prefix of some length l, or a suffix of some length l.\n\nBut when building the answer, for each input string, we need to decide whether it is a prefix or suffix. However, for some strings, they may be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, the string 'a' in the first sample. How to decide which one is which?\n\nBut since the input has exactly two strings for each length, and for each length, one is prefix and one is suffix. So for a given input string, if it is both a prefix and a suffix, but for different lengths, then we have to assign it as prefix or suffix accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that? Well, once we have the correct s, for each input string, we can check for all possible lengths l (from 1 to n-1) whether the string is the prefix of length l or the suffix of length l. Once found, assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to avoid conflicts? For example, suppose an input string is a prefix of length l and also a suffix of length m. How to choose which one to assign?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there exists at least one way to assign P and S. So for each input string, there must be exactly one possible assignment (for example, if it is a prefix of length l, then in the correct s, it must be a prefix, and not a suffix of any length, or if it is both, but in the correct assignment, it's assigned as prefix or suffix accordingly).\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nPerhaps for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then assign P. Otherwise, assign S. But how to ensure that for each length, exactly one P and one S is assigned.\n\nBut since the input is valid, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. So for example, for the two strings of length l, one is the prefix of s, the other is the suffix of s. So when checking each input string, if it's a prefix of s, then assign P, else assign S. However, this approach may not work if a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, if a string is the prefix of length l and also the suffix of length m (different from l). But in that case, the input has two entries for the same string (for different lengths). But how?\n\nWait, for example, consider s = 'aaaaa' (n=5). The prefix of length 2 is 'aa', and the suffix of length 3 is 'aaa'. But the input may have a string 'aa' (which is a prefix of length 2) and another string 'aa' (which is a suffix of length 2). In that case, for the input strings, both 'aa's would be present. So for each of these, one is a prefix (length 2), the other is a suffix (length 2). So when checking for each input string, we need to determine which one is which.\n\nBut how?\n\nIf we process all input strings, and for each, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then assign P. Else, assign S. However, for the case where a string is a prefix of s and also a suffix of s, how to choose?\n\nBut since the input is valid, for each input string, there must be exactly one occurrence as a prefix or a suffix. For example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, but for different lengths, then in the input, there are two instances of that string. Each of them must be assigned as prefix or suffix accordingly. But how to determine which one is which.\n\nBut perhaps, for each input string, we can find all possible l where it is a prefix or suffix, and then assign accordingly. However, this could be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, once we have the correct s, for each input string, check for all possible l (from 1 to n-1) whether it is the prefix of length l. If yes, then assign P. If not, check if it is the suffix of length l. Assign S. But how to ensure that this works.\n\nBut for the correct s, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of s. So for each input string, there is at least one l where it is a prefix or suffix. So for each input string, we can check for all l from 1 to n-1, and find the first occurrence where it is a prefix. Assign P. If not, check for suffix.\n\nBut perhaps, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, this may not work if the string is a suffix but not a prefix. But since the input is valid, this approach should work.\n\nBut how to check if the string is a prefix of s? For example, for a given input string, check if it equals s[0:l], where l is the length of the input string. Similarly for suffix: check if it equals s[-l:].\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with the string). If yes, assign 'P'. Otherwise, assign 'S'.\n\nBut wait, what if the string is a suffix but not a prefix? Then it will be assigned 'S', which is correct. But what if the string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the first sample input, the string 'a' is a prefix of length 1 and a suffix of length 1. But in the input, there are two 'a's. For each of them, when checking, they would be considered as a prefix (since s starts with 'a'). So both would be assigned 'P', which is wrong. But that's impossible, since for each length l, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. So for the two 'a's in the input (both of length 1), one is the prefix, and the other is the suffix. But according to the above approach, both would be considered as prefixes, leading to two 'P's, which is invalid.\n\nSo this approach would fail in such cases. Therefore, we need a better way to assign P and S for each input string.\n\nAlternative idea: For each input string, determine for which lengths l it can be a prefix or suffix. Then, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings (of that length) is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo for example, for the two strings of length l, one is the prefix of s (of length l), and the other is the suffix of s (of length l). So for each length l, we can find the prefix and the suffix.\n\nOnce we have that, for each input string, we can check which length it is, and whether it is the prefix or the suffix for that length.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each length l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   Get the prefix of length l: pre_l.\n\n   Get the suffix of length l: suf_l.\n\n   Now, among the input strings, there are exactly two strings of length l. One is pre_l, the other is suf_l.\n\nSo for each input string, we can check for its length l, and see if it's equal to pre_l or suf_l. Then assign accordingly.\n\nThis way, for each input string, we can determine whether it's a prefix or suffix.\n\nBut how to find pre_l and suf_l for each l?\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each l from 1 to n-1, pre_l is s[:l], and suf_l is s[-l:].\n\nSo for each input string, we can check its length l. Then, compare it to pre_l and suf_l. If it equals pre_l, then assign 'P'; else, assign 'S'.\n\nThis approach would work because for each length l, the input has exactly two strings: one is pre_l, the other is suf_l. So for each input string of length l, it's either pre_l or suf_l.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, the two 'a's are of length 1. For l=1, pre_l is 'a' and suf_l is 'a'. So both input strings are 'a' and thus, for each of them, how do we assign P or S? Because both are pre_l and suf_l. But according to the problem statement, the answer can be any valid assignment. So for the two 'a's, one can be assigned P and the other S. However, how to choose which one?\n\nBut in the sample input, the correct answer is SPPSPSPS. Looking at the first input string, which is 'ba' (length 2). The correct assignment for that is S (suffix). Then the second input string is 'a' (length 1), which is assigned S (so the first 'a' is S, and the second 'a' is P? Or vice versa? Well, the sample output is SPPSPSPS. Let's see:\n\nThe input strings are:\n\nOriginal input for first example:\n\n['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n\nThe output is SPPSPSPS.\n\nSo the first input string (ba) is S (suffix). The second input string (a) is P. The third (abab) is P. Fourth (a) is S. Fifth (aba) is P. Sixth (baba) is S. Seventh (ab) is P. Eighth (aba) is S.\n\nSo for the two 'a's (second and fourth input strings), the second is assigned P (prefix) and the fourth is assigned S (suffix). So how does that fit with the pre_l and suf_l for l=1?\n\npre_l is 'a' (prefix of length 1), and suf_l is 'a' (suffix of length 1). So both input strings are 'a', and for each of them, they are either pre_l or suf_l. So how to assign which is which?\n\nIn this case, the code would need to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to decide which one?\n\nThe problem allows any valid assignment. So the code can assign for each length l, the first occurrence of the pre_l as P, and the other as S. But how to track that?\n\nBut perhaps, for each length l, we can collect all input strings of that length. Then, for each such group, we can check which one is the prefix and which is the suffix, and assign accordingly.\n\nSo for each length l, we can:\n\n   get pre_l and suf_l.\n\n   collect all input strings of length l.\n\n   for each of these strings, if it is equal to pre_l, assign P. else assign S.\n\nBut since there are exactly two strings of length l, and exactly one is pre_l and the other is suf_l, this would work.\n\nSo, for example, for l=1, pre_l and suf_l are both 'a'. So both input strings are 'a', and the code would assign P to one and S to the other. But how to choose which one?\n\nIn this case, the code can assign P to the first occurrence of the pre_l in the input, and S to the other. But how to track that?\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps the code can process the input strings in order, and for each length l, when processing the input strings, check if it's the pre_l. If it is, assign P, else assign S. However, in the case where both are the same (like 'a' for l=1), then the first occurrence would be assigned P, and the second would be assigned S. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nOnce we have the correct s:\n\n   For each input string in order:\n\n      l = len(string)\n\n      pre_l = s[:l]\n\n      suf_l = s[-l:]\n\n      if string == pre_l:\n\n          assign 'P'\n\n      else:\n\n          assign 'S'\n\nBut this would work even if the string is equal to suf_l. Because for the two input strings of length l, one is pre_l and the other is suf_l. So when processing the first occurrence, it would be compared to pre_l. If it's equal to pre_l, assign P. The second occurrence would be compared to pre_l again. If it's equal to pre_l, then it's the same as the first, but since the input has two strings of same length, and one is pre_l and the other is suf_l, then the second occurrence would be the same as pre_l (if both are same as pre_l and suf_l). But in that case, how to assign?\n\nWait, but in that case, the code would assign 'P' to both. Which would be invalid, since for that length l, there should be exactly one P and one S.\n\nAh, this is a problem. So in the case where pre_l and suf_l are the same (like for l=1 in the first example), the code would assign 'P' to both input strings of that length. Which would be incorrect.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nIn such cases, we need to assign one as P and the other as S, but how?\n\nThe problem is that when the pre_l and suf_l are the same, the code can't distinguish between them based on the string itself. So for the two input strings of that length, both are equal to pre_l and suf_l. So how to assign which is P and which is S?\n\nIn this case, the code needs to assign one of them as P and the other as S, regardless of their content. Since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose arbitrarily. For example, for the first occurrence of the string of that length, assign P, and the second occurrence assign S.\n\nBut how to track that in the code?\n\nWe can, for each length l, collect all input strings of that length, and then for each of them, assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second. However, this would require grouping the input strings by their length and then processing them.\n\nBut how to do that in code.\n\nLet me think. For example, for each input string, we can process them in order. For each length l, we can keep a counter of how many times we have processed strings of that length. For example:\n\nInitialize a dictionary that maps each length to the count of how many strings of that length have been processed so far. Initially, all counts are zero.\n\nThen, for each input string:\n\n   l = len(string)\n\n   count = current count for l.\n\n   if count == 0:\n\n       check if the string is pre_l. If yes, assign P. else assign S.\n\n   else:\n\n       if count == 1:\n\n           assign S (since the first was assigned P, the second must be S).\n\nBut this approach would only work if the first string of length l is pre_l and the second is suf_l. However, if the first string is the suf_l and the second is pre_l, then this approach would assign S to the first and P to the second, which is also correct.\n\nBut how to know which is which?\n\nAlternatively, for each length l, we can note that there are exactly two strings. For each of them, exactly one is pre_l and the other is suf_l. So for each length l, we can check which of the two input strings is pre_l and which is suf_l. Then, assign P to the pre_l and S to the suf_l.\n\nBut how to find which of the two input strings is pre_l and which is suf_l.\n\nFor example, for l=1, the two input strings are both 'a'. So pre_l is 'a', and suf_l is 'a'. So both are pre_l and suf_l. So for the two input strings, one is pre_l and the other is suf_l. So how to choose which one to assign P and which to assign S?\n\nIn this case, it doesn't matter. We can assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second. So in code, for each length l, we can collect the two input strings. Then, check which one is pre_l. Since both are pre_l, but we need to assign one as P and the other as S. So for example, the first one is assigned P and the second is S.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAn alternative approach:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each length l, collect all the input strings of that length. For each such group, check which of the two strings is the prefix (pre_l) and which is the suffix (suf_l). Then, for each string in the group, if it is pre_l, assign P; else assign S.\n\nBut in the case where both are equal to pre_l (and also to suf_l), then both are pre_l and suf_l. So for the group, both are pre_l and suf_l. But in reality, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So how to differentiate?\n\nIn this case, the code can assign P to one and S to the other. But since both are the same, it's arbitrary. So for the group, the first string is assigned P, and the second S. But how to know which one is which?\n\nWait, the code can check if the string is equal to pre_l. Since pre_l is the prefix of length l, and suf_l is the suffix of length l. So for the group, one of the two strings is pre_l (and the other is suf_l). But when pre_l and suf_l are the same, both are equal to the same string. So in this case, the code can't differentiate between them. However, since the input is valid, it's guaranteed that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is the prefix and the other is the suffix. But when they are the same, it's possible that both are the same. So how can we assign P and S?\n\nBut the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each length l, collect the two input strings. For each of them, check if they are equal to pre_l. If one is, assign P, and the other must be S.\n\nBut in the case where both are equal to pre_l, then it's impossible? No, because the pre_l and suf_l are the same. So both are the same. So for the two input strings of length l, both are pre_l and suf_l. So in this case, we can assign one as P and one as S. So for example, for the first occurrence, assign P, the second assign S.\n\nSo the code can process the input strings in order, and for each length l, the first occurrence of the input string is assigned P if it's pre_l, otherwise S. The second occurrence is assigned the opposite.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe for each length l, we can track how many times we've processed strings of that length. So:\n\nWe can create a dictionary called count_per_length, which keeps track of how many times we've processed strings of each length.\n\nThen, for each input string in order:\n\n   l = len(string)\n\n   current_count = count_per_length.get(l, 0)\n\n   if current_count == 0:\n\n       if string == pre_l:\n\n           assign 'P'\n\n       else:\n\n           assign 'S'\n\n       count_per_length[l] = 1\n\n   else:\n\n       # current_count is 1, so this is the second occurrence\n\n       # if the first occurrence was assigned 'P', then this one must be 'S' and vice versa?\n\n       # But how to know what the first was?\n\n       # This approach is not sufficient, because we don't track what was assigned before.\n\nSo this approach won't work.\n\nAlternative idea: For each length l, precompute the pre_l and suf_l. Then, for each input string of that length, check if it is pre_l or suf_l. For the group of two strings of length l, one is pre_l and the other is suf_l. So for each input string in the group, if it is pre_l, assign P, else assign S.\n\nBut in the case where both are pre_l and suf_l, then both are equal to pre_l and suf_l. So for the two strings, the code will assign P to both, which is invalid.\n\nBut this is not possible. Because pre_l and suf_l are the same, which implies that the prefix of length l is the same as the suffix of length l. Which means that the original string s has the same prefix and suffix of length l. Which is allowed.\n\nBut how to assign P and S to the two strings of that length. Well, in this case, the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S, regardless of their content.\n\nSo perhaps, for each length l, we can check if the two input strings are the same. If they are, then assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second. Else, assign P to the one that matches pre_l and S to the other.\n\nSo how to implement this.\n\nIn code:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined, for each input string, we can process them in order. For each input string, we check its length l. We can collect all input strings of length l in a list. For example, for each l, we can store the list of strings of that length. Then, for each l, we can check if the two strings are the same. If they are, assign P to the first and S to the second. Else, for the two strings, one is pre_l and the other is suf_l. Assign P to the one that is pre_l, and S to the other.\n\nBut how to do this during the processing of the input strings in order.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of the input strings, for each string, we can check if it is the pre_l. If yes, assign P. Else assign S. But in the case where the two strings are the same, this would assign P to both, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the problem is that the code would assign P to both, but we need to assign one P and one S.\n\nThus, the approach of checking if the string is pre_l and assigning P is not sufficient. It works when the two strings are different, but not when they are the same.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nMaybe, for each length l, after collecting the two strings, we can check if they are the same. If they are, then we can assign P to the first occurrence and S to the second. Otherwise, assign P to the one that matches pre_l and S to the other.\n\nSo the code would need to process the input strings in groups of their lengths. For example, for each length l, process the two strings of that length, and assign P/S accordingly.\n\nBut how to do this in code, given that the input strings are provided in arbitrary order.\n\nLet me think. Here's an approach:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct string `s` from the given input and then classifying each input string as either a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate String**: The candidate string `s` can be derived by considering the two strings of length `n-1` from the input. These strings could be either the longest prefix or the longest suffix of `s`. By combining these two strings appropriately, we can generate potential candidates for `s`.\n2. **Validate Candidate String**: For each candidate string, check if all given input strings are valid prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n3. **Classify Input Strings**: Once the correct candidate string `s` is identified, classify each input string as a prefix or suffix based on its match with the corresponding prefixes and suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all combinations of the two candidates for prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Construct possible s\n            s_candidate = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Now check if all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate\n            # Generate all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate\n            all_prefixes_suffixes = []\n            for l in range(1, n):\n                all_prefixes_suffixes.append(s_candidate[:l])\n                all_prefixes_suffixes.append(s_candidate[-l:])\n            # Now compare with the input strings\n            # Sort both lists and check if they are equal\n            input_sorted = sorted(strings)\n            generated_sorted = sorted(all_prefixes_suffixes)\n            if input_sorted == generated_sorted:\n                # Found the correct s_candidate\n                # Now assign P/S to each input string\n                result = []\n                # Precompute for each length the prefix and suffix\n                pre_suffix_map = {}\n                for l in range(1, n):\n                    pre = s_candidate[:l]\n                    suf = s_candidate[-l:]\n                    pre_suffix_map[l] = (pre, suf)\n                # Process each input string in order\n                # For each length, track how many times we have processed it\n                count_per_length = {}\n                for s in strings:\n                    l = len(s)\n                    if l not in count_per_length:\n                        count_per_length[l] = 0\n                    current_count = count_per_length[l]\n                    if current_count == 0:\n                        # first occurrence\n                        pre, suf = pre_suffix_map[l]\n                        if s == pre:\n                            result.append('P')\n                        else:\n                            result.append('S')\n                        count_per_length[l] += 1\n                    else:\n                        # second occurrence\n                        pre, suf = pre_suffix_map[l]\n                        if s == pre:\n                            result.append('S')\n                        else:\n                            result.append('P')\n                        count_per_length[l] += 1\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify Candidate String**: The code identifies the two strings of length `n-1` from the input.
