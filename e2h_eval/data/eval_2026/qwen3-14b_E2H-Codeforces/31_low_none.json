Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that are within -x to x. The new cards he finds must also be within that range. \n\nSo first, I need to calculate the sum of the current found cards. Let's call that sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call that target T = -S. \n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of integers (each between -x and x) that sum up to T. But since each card can be any integer in that range, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think about this. Let's take the absolute value of T. Because if T is positive, we need to add positive numbers, and if it's negative, we need to add negative numbers. But since the problem allows us to choose any numbers, the minimal number of cards would depend on how much each card can contribute towards the target.\n\nFor example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then each card can contribute at most 2. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(5 / 2) = 3 (since 2+2+1=5). Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Wait, no. Because each card can contribute up to x. So for T, the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| divided by x. But wait, let me check.\n\nSuppose T is 5 and x is 2. The maximum per card is 2. So 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, which rounds up to 3. Which would be 2+2+1. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut what if T is 4 and x is 2? Then 4/2 is exactly 2, so two cards. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 3, x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, so 2 cards. Which would be 2 + 1. So that works.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards needed is ceil(|T| / x). But wait, what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed. But in that case, the original sum is already zero, so the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the given cards.\n2. Compute T = -S. If T is zero, return 0.\n3. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach T, which is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, how?\n\nWait, but the problem allows using any combination of numbers. For example, if T is 5 and x is 3. Then 5 can be achieved with two cards: 3 + 2. So 5 / 3 is 1.666..., which rounds up to 2. So that works. So the formula seems correct.\n\nBut why does that work? Because each card can contribute at most x. So the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of (|T| / x). Because if you have k cards, each contributing up to x, the maximum possible sum is k*x. So to reach |T|, you need k such that k*x >= |T|. The minimal k is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCalculate the sum of the given numbers. Let's call it sum_current.\n\nIf sum_current is zero, the answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute T = -sum_current. Then compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, for example, if T is 3 and x is 2. Then |T| is 3. Divided by x (2) gives 1.5, ceil is 2. Which is correct. So yes.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and x, then the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_current = sum of the list.\n\nif sum_current == 0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   T = -sum_current\n\n   required = abs(T)\n\n   min_cards = ceil( required / x )\n\nBut wait, how to compute ceil in Python?\n\nIn Python, we can compute it as (required + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBecause for example, 3 + 2-1 =4, divided by 2 is 2. Which is correct. For 4, 4 +2-1 =5, divided by 2 is 2.5 floored to 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So that's the way to compute it.\n\nBut let's test some examples.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nSample ",
