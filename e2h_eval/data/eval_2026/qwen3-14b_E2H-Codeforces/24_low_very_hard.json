She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nSo, Luba has n tabs open, numbered 1 to n from left to right. The mouse is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs except those from l to r inclusive. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to do this. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but within the current a and b, which are the min and max of the unclosed tabs), or close all tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is figuring out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to get to the desired state with the least time.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. First, check if the current tabs already satisfy the condition. Like, if l=1 and r=n, then nothing needs to be done. So the answer is 0. Also, if the current position is already in the [l, r] range, maybe some steps can be saved.\n\nBut the main thing is that she needs to close tabs outside of [l, r]. So, the tabs to the left of l and to the right of r must be closed. But how?\n\nThe key here is that closing tabs can be done in one second, but only if the cursor is positioned correctly. For example, to close all tabs to the left of the current position, you need to be at a position where there are tabs to the left. But once you close them, the a (minimum index) increases. Similarly for closing tabs to the right.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when you close tabs, a and b are updated. So, for example, if you close all tabs to the left of the current position, then the new a becomes the current position. Because after closing those tabs, the remaining tabs start from the current position. Similarly, if you close all tabs to the right, then the new b becomes the current position.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal steps to reach a state where all tabs outside [l, r] are closed. Let's think about the possible cases.\n\nFirst, determine whether the current position is inside the target range [l, r]. If it's not, then perhaps she needs to move to a position where she can close tabs.\n\nBut how do we model the steps? It seems like a BFS problem, where each state is defined by the current position, and the current a and b. However, since n is up to 100, maybe the state space isn't too big. But considering that a and b can vary, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the optimal steps by considering the necessary actions. Let's think about the two required operations: closing the left part (tabs < l) and closing the right part (tabs > r).\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nCase 1: The current position is already in [l, r]. Then, she can close the left and right parts. But to do that, she needs to be at positions where she can close them. For example, to close the left part (tabs < l), she needs to be at position l. Because closing all tabs to the left of l would leave the tabs from l onwards. Similarly, to close the right part, she needs to be at position r. So, the steps would be:\n\n- Move to l (if not already there)\n- Close left (which closes all tabs to the left of l)\n- Then move to r (from l, which takes (r - l) steps)\n- Close right (all tabs to the right of r)\n\nBut wait, what if l is 2 and r is 4? Suppose she's at position 3. Then, she can close the left part by moving to position 2, then close left (but that would close tabs to the left of 2, which is tab 1). Then, she can move to 4, and close right (tabs 5 and beyond). So the steps would be:\n\nTime to move to l (from pos) + 1 (for closing left) + time to move from l to r (steps) + 1 (for closing right).\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, if she can close both left and right in one step. Wait, no. Because if she is in the [l, r] range, she can't close left or right unless she is at the edge. For instance, if she is at position l, she can close all tabs to the left (which is the tabs before l). Then, after that, the a becomes l. Then, she can move to r, and close all tabs to the right (tabs after r). So that's two operations.\n\nBut maybe there's another approach. Like, if she can close the left and right in some other order, but I",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified range [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The solution involves calculating the optimal sequence of moves and operations to achieve this goal efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the current range [l, r] already includes all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no actions are needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Position Analysis**: Determine if the current position `pos` is within the target range [l, r]. If it is, we can directly proceed to close the tabs outside this range.\n3. **Closing Tabs**: \n   - **Left Tabs**: To close all tabs to the left of `l`, Luba must move to position `l` and then perform a close operation.\n   - **Right Tabs**: To close all tabs to the right of `r`, Luba must move to position `r` and then perform a close operation.\n4. **Movement Calculation**: Calculate the time required to move from the current position to the positions `l` and `r` respectively, and sum these times along with the operations to close the tabs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Determine if the current position is inside the target range\n    if pos < l:\n        # Need to move to l, then close left\n        steps = (l - pos) + 1\n        # Then move to r and close right\n        steps += (r - l) + 1\n    elif pos > r:\n        # Need to move to r, then close right\n        steps = (pos - r) + 1\n        # Then move to l and close left\n        steps += (r - l) + 1\n    else:\n        # pos is within [l, r]\n        # Need to close left and right\n        # Close left: move to l, then close\n        steps_left = (pos - l) + 1\n        # Close right: move to r, then close\n        steps_right = (r - pos) + 1\n        steps = steps_left + steps_right\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] covers all tabs, no operations are needed.\n- **Position Handling**: Depending on whether the current position is left of `l`, right of `r`, or within the range, different movement strategies are applied.\n- **Steps Calculation**: The steps required to move to the necessary positions and perform the close operations are summed up to get the total minimum seconds required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimal steps by focusing on the necessary movements and operations to close the tabs outside the desired range.",
