    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo, what does that mean for the order of characters? Well, since I can swap 0s and 1s, and 1s and 2s, but not 0s and 2s. So maybe the 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s, but 0s can't move past 2s. Wait, but if I can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, then maybe 0s can end up before 2s through some sequence of swaps? Like, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2. Then I can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1,0,2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, wait, that's not allowed. Oh right, you can't swap 0 and 2. So in that case, the 0 can't pass through the 2. So the relative order between 0s and 2s depends on their original positions, but the 1s can be moved around between them.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s. So, for example, a 0 can come before any 1s that are to its right, but 0s can't move past 2s. Similarly, 2s can't move past 0s. But 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s. So perhaps the overall structure is that all 0s come before 1s, which come before 2s, but with some exceptions?\n\nWait, no. Because if you have a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. So the 0 can't move past the 2. But if there's a 0, then some 1s, then a 2, then the 1s can be moved around. For example, suppose the string is \"02\". We can't swap them. But if it's \"012\", then we can move the 1 to the left of the 0? No, because the 0 and 1 can be swapped. Wait, the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So in the string \"012\", the 0 and 1 can be swapped to get \"102\". Then the 1 and 2 can be swapped to get \"120\". But the 0 can't move past the 2. So the 0 can't go to the end here. So the 0 can be moved past 1s, but not past 2s. Similarly, 2s can be moved past 1s, but not past 0s.\n\nSo the conclusion is that 0s can be arranged in any order among themselves, but they can't cross 2s. Similarly, 2s can't cross 0s. However, 1s can be moved around both 0s and 2s. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think: since 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s, then 1s can be moved anywhere. For example, if there's a 0 followed by a 1, you can swap them. If there's a 1 followed by a 2, you can swap them. So 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. So the 1s can be placed anywhere, but the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. So the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string is fixed. Because you can't swap them. So for example, if in the original string there is a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, all 0s that were before that 2 in the original string must remain before the 2. Similarly, any 2 that was before a 0 in the original string must remain before the 0.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Because 0s and 2s can't be swapped. So their relative order is fixed. So the positions of 0s and 2s in the original string determine their positions in the final string. However, the 1s can be rearranged freely among the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nSo the problem reduces to grouping the 0s and 2s in their original order, and inserting the 1s in between wherever possible. But how exactly?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original string is \"20\". Since we can't swap 2 and 0, the final string is \"20\", which is the same as the input. Which matches the sample input's third case.\n\nAnother example: input is \"100210\" which gives output \"001120\". Let's see. The original string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'. The 0s and 2s in the original string are in positions 2,3,4 (characters 0,0,2). So the 0s and 2s in the original string are in order 0,0,2. So in the final string, the 0s and 2s must appear in this order. But the 1s can be moved around. So the original string has 1, then 0,0,2, then 1, then 0. The 1s can be moved. So the final string should have the 0s and 2s in their original order (but possibly with 1s inserted between them). So for the sample input, the output is \"001120\". Let's check that. The 0s and 2s in the output are 0,0,2,0. Wait, but the original string had 0,0,2, and then another 0. So the original 0s and 2s are in positions 2,3,4 (the 0,0,2) and then position 6 (the 0). So the original order of 0s and 2s is 0,0,2,0. So the output must preserve that order. So the 0s and 2s in the output must be in the same order as in the original string. Therefore, the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. But the 1s can be placed between them.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- The relative order of 0s and 2s must remain the same as in the original string. But the 1s can be placed anywhere else. But how?\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved around. So the idea is that between any two 0s and 2s (in their original order), we can arrange the 1s. For example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then between them, we can insert any number of 1s. Also, the 1s can be placed before all the 0s, or after all the 2s, or in between any 0 and 2.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s optimally. Since the goal is to make the lex smallest string, we want as many 0s as possible to be as early as possible, and 1s and 2s to be arranged in such a way.\n\nBut considering that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order, but the 1s can be moved around. So the problem becomes: arrange all the 1s in the positions where they can be inserted between the 0s and 2s. For example, the 1s can be placed in any positions that are not between 0 and 2 in the original string.\n\nWait, but how to model this. Let me think of the original string as consisting of a sequence of 0s and 2s, with some 1s interspersed. But the 0s and 2s can't be reordered, so their positions are fixed. So, for example, suppose the original string has a sequence of 0s and 2s like [0, 0, 2, 0], then in the final string, these must appear in that order. The 1s can be placed in between any of these elements, or before the first element, or after the last element.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- Collect all the 0s and 2s in the original order. Let's call this list 'fixed_chars'.\n\n- Collect all the 1s in a separate list 'ones'.\n\nThen, the task is to insert the 1s into the 'fixed_chars' in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to do that? Because inserting the 1s into the fixed_chars in between the elements. For example, the 1s can be placed in any positions between the fixed elements, but since the fixed elements are in order, inserting the 1s in between.\n\nBut the lex smallest would be achieved by inserting all the 1s as early as possible. Wait, but inserting them in the earliest possible positions. For example, between the 0s and 2s, but since 1s are larger than 0s but smaller than 2s, inserting them in between 0s and 2s would make sense.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be inserted anywhere. For example, between two 0s, between a 0 and a 2, between a 2 and a 0 (but that's not possible since in the fixed_chars, the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So if in the original string, there is a 0 followed by a 2, then in the fixed_chars, that's the case. But inserting 1s between them would be allowed. Also, inserting 1s before the first element, or after the last element.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s. Since the 1s are all the same, inserting them all at the earliest possible positions would be better. For example, if the fixed_chars is [0, 0, 2, 0], then inserting all 1s before the first element (if possible) would be better. But how?\n\nBut the 1s can be inserted in any positions. For instance, inserting a 1 before the first 0 would make the string start with 1, but that's worse than starting with 0. So that's not optimal. So inserting 1s after the 0s and before the 2s would be better. Because 0 is smaller than 1, which is smaller than 2.\n\nSo the idea is that between two consecutive elements in fixed_chars, we can insert some 1s. For example, between two elements a and b in fixed_chars, if a is 0 and b is 2, then inserting 1s between them is allowed, and that's better than having the 1s elsewhere.\n\nBut how to arrange the insertion points. Let's think of the fixed_chars as a sequence of elements. For each position between elements, we can choose to insert some 1s. But since all 1s are the same, inserting them as early as possible would be better.\n\nWait, but when inserting 1s between elements, the earliest possible positions would be the ones where inserting them would contribute to the lex smallest string.\n\nFor example, between two elements a and b in fixed_chars, inserting 1s there would be better than inserting them after the entire sequence. Because if a is 0 and b is 2, inserting 1s between them would make the string have 0...1...2, which is better than 0...2...1 (since 1 is less than 2).\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s. Since inserting the 1s in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed without violating the order of fixed_chars.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be placed in any of the possible insertion points. The insertion points are:\n\n- Before the first element of fixed_chars.\n\n- Between elements i and i+1 of fixed_chars.\n\n- After the last element of fixed_chars.\n\nBut the best way to arrange the 1s is to insert them in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed. However, inserting them before the first element would add 1s before the first 0 or 2. But that's worse than inserting them after the 0s. Because 0 is smaller than 1. For example, if the first element is 0, inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So that's not good.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is to insert the 1s in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed without causing the lex order to be worse. How?\n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a sequence. The 1s can be inserted in any of the insertion points. The insertion points can be considered as positions where inserting 1s would be allowed. For example, between two elements a and b in fixed_chars, inserting 1s there is allowed. But how to choose where to insert the 1s.\n\nThe idea is that inserting 1s as far to the left as possible, but only where inserting them would not cause them to be after a smaller character. For example, inserting 1s before the first element of fixed_chars is not good if that element is 0, since 1 is larger than 0. But inserting them after the first element (if the first element is 0) would be better.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the insertion points. For each insertion point, we can decide whether inserting 1s there is better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nBut since all 1s are the same, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s as far left as possible. But where is that possible?\n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a sequence. The 1s can be inserted between the elements, but the insertion positions are determined by the existing elements. Let's take an example. Suppose fixed_chars is [0, 2]. The possible insertion points are:\n\n- Before 0.\n\n- Between 0 and 2.\n\n- After 2.\n\nWe can insert 1s in any of these positions. The lex smallest would be to insert them in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not make the string worse.\n\nFor example, inserting all 1s between 0 and 2 would give us 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than inserting them after 2 (which would result in 0,2 followed by 1s). Because 0 < 1 < 2. So inserting the 1s between the 0 and 2 is better.\n\nBut inserting them before the 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So the best option is to insert the 1s between 0 and 2.\n\nAnother example: fixed_chars is [0,0,2,0]. The insertion points are:\n\n- before first 0\n\n- between first and second 0\n\n- between second 0 and 2\n\n- between 2 and 0\n\n- after last 0.\n\nSo inserting 1s between the 0s (like between first and second 0) would not be helpful, since inserting 1s there would make the string have 0, 1, 0, etc. But since 1 is larger than 0, inserting them between 0s would not help. However, inserting them between 0 and 2 would be better. Also, inserting them between 2 and 0 would be worse, since 2 is larger than 1, but inserting 1s between 2 and 0 would allow 2 to be followed by 1s, which is better than 2 followed by 0. Because 1 is smaller than 2. But wait, the 0 comes after the 2 in the fixed_chars. So inserting 1s between the 2 and 0 would make the string have 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is better than 2 followed by 0, because 1 is smaller than 2. But the 0 is after the 2 in the fixed_chars. So inserting 1s between them is allowed.\n\nSo for the fixed_chars [0,0,2,0], the optimal way to insert the 1s would be to put as many as possible in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not make the string worse.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each insertion point (between elements of fixed_chars, including before the first and after the last), determine whether inserting a 1 here would be beneficial.\n\nBut how to find the optimal insertion points. Since the 1s can be inserted anywhere, but we want the lex smallest string, we can think of inserting all 1s into the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not be worse than inserting them later.\n\nBut how to model that.\n\nAn alternative approach: the lex smallest string is achieved by having as many 0s as possible as early as possible, then 1s, then 2s. However, the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So the 0s and 2s are fixed, but the 1s can be placed in between them. So the idea is that between any two consecutive elements in fixed_chars, we can insert the 1s. But to make the lex smallest, we should insert the 1s in the earliest positions where inserting them would not conflict with the order.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since the 1s can be placed between any two elements in the fixed_chars sequence, but the fixed_chars sequence is ordered as per the original string. So for example, between any two elements a and b in fixed_chars, if a is 0 and b is 2, then inserting 1s between them would be better than inserting them after the 2. Because inserting 1s between them would give 0...1...2, which is better than 0...2...1. Similarly, between a 0 and a 0, inserting 1s would not be helpful (since 0 is smaller than 1, but inserting 1s after the 0s would be better than before the 0s. Wait, inserting 1s between two 0s would make the string have 0,1,0. Which is worse than 0,0,1. Because the first occurrence of 1 is later. So inserting the 1s after the 0s would be better.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible insertion point that allows them to be placed after the 0s and before the 2s.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAnother approach: the 1s can be placed anywhere, but the lex smallest string is obtained when the 1s are placed in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed. However, inserting them in the earliest positions where inserting them doesn't cause them to be after a smaller character.\n\nWait, but the 1s are larger than 0s but smaller than 2s. So inserting 1s after all 0s and before any 2s would be optimal. For example, if the fixed_chars is [0,0,2,0], then inserting all 1s between the 0s and 2, and between the 2 and 0. But in that case, inserting them between the 0s and 2 would be better than inserting them between the 2 and 0. Because inserting between 0 and 2 would have 0s followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than 0s followed by 2 followed by 1s (since 1 is smaller than 2). However, inserting between 2 and 0 would allow the 1s to be before the 0, but that would be worse than inserting them before the 2.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe the insertion points can be considered as follows: for each pair of consecutive elements in fixed_chars, we can check whether inserting 1s here would be better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nBut how to find the best insertion points for all 1s.\n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a list of elements. We can imagine that the 1s can be inserted in any of the gaps between the elements (including before the first and after the last). The problem is to distribute the 1s into these gaps in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nSince all 1s are the same, the optimal way is to insert as many as possible into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them will not cause the string to be worse.\n\nFor example, consider the gaps in order. For each gap, we can decide whether inserting 1s here is better than inserting them in later gaps.\n\nThe key is that inserting 1s into a gap earlier than another will have a higher priority if the gap is a better place to put them. How to compare the gaps?\n\nEach gap is between two elements (or before the first, or after the last). Let's think about the effect of inserting a 1 into a gap. The gap is between a and b (where a is the previous element and b is the next element, or a is None for the first gap, or b is None for the last gap).\n\nFor example, inserting a 1 into the gap between a and b. The value of a is either the previous element in fixed_chars or None (for the first gap), and similarly for b.\n\nThe decision to insert 1s into this gap is better than inserting them into a later gap if the current gap allows the 1s to be placed in a position that contributes to a smaller lex order.\n\nFor example, inserting 1s into the first gap (before the first element) is bad if the first element is 0, because inserting 1s there would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So we don't want to insert 1s here.\n\nSimilarly, inserting into a gap between a and b where a is 0 and b is 2 is better than inserting into a gap between a and b where a is 2 and b is 0. Because inserting into the first case allows the 1s to be between 0 and 2, which is better than inserting them after the 2 (which would be worse than inserting them between 0 and 2).\n\nSo the idea is to find all the gaps where inserting 1s is beneficial, and insert them into the earliest possible gaps.\n\nBut how to find the order of gaps in which inserting the 1s would be optimal.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- For each gap in the fixed_chars (including before the first and after the last), determine the \"priority\" of inserting 1s into that gap. The priority is based on the lex order impact of inserting a 1 into that gap.\n\nThe priority can be determined by comparing the gap's position. For example, inserting into a gap that is as early as possible, but only if the gap is a good place for 1s.\n\nBut how to compare two gaps. For example, inserting into a gap between a and b (gap1) versus inserting into a gap between c and d (gap2). Which one is better?\n\nThe answer depends on the characters a and b, and c and d. For example, inserting into a gap between 0 and 2 is better than inserting into a gap between 2 and 0. Because inserting 1s between 0 and 2 gives a better lex order.\n\nSo, the priority of a gap is determined by the following:\n\n- If the gap is before the first element, and the first element is 0, then inserting 1s here is worse than inserting after the first element.\n\n- If the gap is between a and b, where a is 0 and b is 2, then inserting here is better than inserting into a gap between 2 and 0.\n\nSo, to find the optimal insertion points, we can process the gaps in order and for each gap, decide whether inserting the 1s here is better than inserting them in other gaps.\n\nBut how to model this. Here's an idea: the optimal way to insert the 1s is to insert them into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not be worse than inserting them later. For example, we can iterate through the gaps in order, and for each gap, insert as many 1s as possible into it, provided that inserting them here is better than inserting them into later gaps.\n\nBut how to determine whether inserting into the current gap is better than inserting into later gaps.\n\nLet me think of the following: the best possible place to insert a 1 is in the earliest gap where inserting it would not cause it to be after a smaller character. For example, inserting 1s into the earliest possible gap where the previous character is <= 1 and the next character is >=1. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s can be placed in any gaps, but the earliest gaps that are \"safe\" to insert them. For example, inserting them into the earliest gaps where the gap is between a 0 and a 2 (so that the 1s are between them), or between a 0 and nothing (so inserting them after the 0s), or between nothing and a 2 (inserting them before the 2s), or between 0 and 0 (inserting them between the 0s, but that would be worse than inserting after the 0s).\n\nWait, inserting between two 0s would create 0,1,0. Which is worse than 0,0,1. So inserting the 1s after the 0s (i.e., in the next gap) would be better.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gaps that are between a character that is <=1 and a character that is >=1. But how to find those gaps.\n\nAnother approach: the 1s can be placed in the gaps where inserting them would not create a lex larger string. For example, inserting 1s into the earliest possible gaps that are between a 0 and a 2, or between a 0 and nothing (i.e., after the last 0 in the fixed_chars), or between nothing and a 2 (i.e., before the first 2 in the fixed_chars), etc.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s should be inserted into the earliest gaps where inserting them would not be preceded by a character larger than 1, and followed by a character smaller than 1. Because that would allow the 1s to be placed in a position that is better.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nLet me think of the following. For each gap, the priority for inserting 1s is determined by the following:\n\n- If the gap is before the first element of fixed_chars, then inserting 1s here would be bad if the first element is 0 (since 1>0), but okay if the first element is 2 (since 1<2). So inserting here is only beneficial if the first element is 2.\n\nSimilarly, for gaps between elements a and b:\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 2, inserting 1s here is good.\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 0, inserting 1s here would be worse than inserting them after the 0s.\n\n- If a is 2 and b is 0, inserting 1s here would be better than inserting them after the 2s (since inserting between 2 and 0 would allow 2, then 1, then 0, which is better than 2 followed by 0 and then 1s).\n\nBut how to compare different gaps.\n\nMaybe the correct way is to find all the gaps where inserting 1s would be beneficial, and then insert them in the earliest such gap.\n\nBut how to find the earliest such gap.\n\nAnother idea: the 1s can be inserted in the gaps in the order of their positions. For each gap, we can decide whether inserting 1s into this gap is better than not inserting them here. Once we decide to insert them here, we insert all remaining 1s into this gap.\n\nWait, but how to decide which gap is the best to insert the 1s. For example, between two 0s, inserting 1s would be worse than inserting them after the 0s. So the earliest gap where inserting the 1s is beneficial is the first gap that is either:\n\n- before the first element, and the first element is 2.\n\n- between a 0 and a 2.\n\n- between a 0 and nothing (i.e., after the last element is 0).\n\n- between nothing and a 2 (i.e., before the first 2).\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to think about it: since the 1s can be moved anywhere, the optimal arrangement would be to have all the 1s placed in the positions where they are as early as possible, but not before any 0s that are in the fixed_chars. Because inserting a 1 before a 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0.\n\nSo the earliest possible positions for the 1s are:\n\n- After all the 0s that are before the first 2 in the fixed_chars.\n\n- Between any 0 and 2 in the fixed_chars.\n\n- Before any 2s that are not preceded by 0s.\n\nWait, perhaps the best way is to collect all the 1s and insert them into the earliest possible positions where they are allowed. For example:\n\nWe can imagine that the fixed_chars is a sequence of 0s and 2s. We want to insert the 1s into the sequence in such a way that they are placed as early as possible, but not before any 0s that are in the fixed_chars. Because inserting them before a 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0.\n\nSo, the first possible position to insert the 1s is after the first 0 in the fixed_chars, but before any 2s. But how to find this.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s can be inserted in between any two elements in the fixed_chars, but the earliest possible insertion point is the first gap that is after a 0 and before a 2.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a list. For example, fixed_chars = [0, 0, 2, 0].\n\nThe 1s can be inserted in the following gaps:\n\ngap 0: before 0.\n\ngap 1: between first 0 and second 0.\n\ngap 2: between second 0 and 2.\n\ngap 3: between 2 and 0.\n\ngap 4: after 0.\n\nNow, for each of these gaps, inserting the 1s would be better or worse. Let's evaluate:\n\ngap 0: inserting 1s here would be worse than inserting after the 0s.\n\ngap 1: inserting 1s here would lead to 0,1,0, which is worse than 0,0,1.\n\ngap 2: inserting here leads to 0,0,1,2,0. Which is better than inserting after the 2.\n\ngap 3: inserting here leads to 0,0,2,1,0. Which is better than inserting after the 2.\n\ngap 4: inserting here leads to 0,0,2,0,1. Which is worse than inserting in gap 2 or 3.\n\nSo the best gaps are gap 2 and gap 3. Between them, inserting in gap 2 is better than gap 3 because the 1s are placed before the 2.\n\nSo the optimal is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gaps that are between a 0 and a 2, or between a 0 and nothing, or between nothing and a 2.\n\nBut how to find the earliest such gaps.\n\nAnother approach: the 1s can be inserted into any of the gaps between the elements of fixed_chars. To make the lex smallest string, we want to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not be worse than inserting them later. For example, inserting them into the earliest gap that is between a 0 and a 2, or between a 0 and nothing, or between nothing and a 2.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a sequence. We can iterate through the gaps and for each gap, determine whether inserting a 1 here is better than inserting it in any subsequent gaps.\n\nFor example, for each gap, we can compare the current gap with the next gaps. If the current gap is a better place to insert the 1s, then we insert them here.\n\nThe question is: what makes a gap better than another?\n\nA gap is better than another if inserting a 1 into this gap would result in a lex smaller string than inserting into the other gap.\n\nFor example, inserting into gap A (between 0 and 2) is better than inserting into gap B (between 2 and 0). Because inserting into gap A would have the 1 between 0 and 2, which is better than inserting into gap B, which would have 1 between 2 and 0.\n\nBut how to compare two gaps in general.\n\nLet's define for each gap, the \"value\" of the gap as the minimal character that would be affected by inserting a 1 here. For example, inserting into a gap before a 2 (like between nothing and 2) would allow the 1 to be placed before the 2, which is better than inserting after the 2.\n\nSo, the idea is that the best gaps are those where inserting the 1s would allow them to be placed before a 2, or after a 0.\n\nThus, we can prioritize the gaps in the following order:\n\n- Any gap that is before a 2 and after a 0 (i.e., between 0 and 2).\n\n- Any gap that is before a 2 and after nothing (i.e., before the first 2 in fixed_chars).\n\n- Any gap that is after a 0 and before nothing (i.e., after the last 0 in fixed_chars).\n\n- Any gap that is between 2 and 0 (inserting 1s between them).\n\n- Any gap that is after a 2 and before nothing (i.e., after the last 2 in fixed_chars).\n\n- Any gap that is before a 0 and after nothing (i.e., before the first 0 in fixed_chars).\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps the following approach can work:\n\nThe 1s can be inserted into the gaps in the order of their occurrence, but only if inserting them into this gap is better than inserting them into later gaps. For example:\n\nWe iterate through the gaps from left to right. For each gap, we decide whether inserting the 1s into this gap is better than inserting them into any later gaps. If yes, we insert all remaining 1s into this gap and break.\n\nHow to determine whether inserting into this gap is better than any later gaps.\n\nFor example, if the current gap is between a and b, then inserting a 1 here would be better than inserting it into any later gap if the following condition holds: the current gap's insertion point is such that inserting a 1 here would produce a lex smaller string than inserting it into any later gap.\n\nTo compare two gaps, say gap i and gap j (i < j), we can imagine inserting a single 1 into gap i and into gap j. The one that produces the lex smaller string is the better gap.\n\nBut how to compare them.\n\nFor example, inserting a 1 into gap i (between a and b) and into gap j (between c and d).\n\nIf inserting into gap i results in a string that is lex smaller than inserting into gap j, then gap i is better.\n\nBut how to compare these two scenarios.\n\nLet me think of the string as being built from the fixed_chars and the 1s. When inserting a 1 into a gap, the position of the 1 in the string is determined by the gap's position. For example, inserting a 1 into an earlier gap will make it appear earlier in the string.\n\nSo, inserting a 1 into an earlier gap is better than inserting it into a later gap, because it appears earlier in the string. Unless the earlier gap is not a good place for the 1.\n\nFor example, inserting into gap i (before the first element) which is a 0 would make the string start with 1, which is worse than inserting into gap j which is between a 0 and a 2.\n\nBut if the earlier gap is not a good place, we should skip it and look for the next gap.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n1. Split the original string into two parts: the fixed_chars (all 0s and 2s, in their original order), and the ones (all 1s).\n\n2. Generate a list of gaps, which are the positions between the fixed_chars elements (including before the first and after the last).\n\n3. For each gap in order (from left to right), determine whether inserting the 1s into this gap would be better than inserting them into any subsequent gaps. If yes, insert all remaining 1s into this gap and break.\n\nBut how to determine if inserting into this gap is better than any subsequent gaps.\n\nThe key is that inserting into an earlier gap is better than inserting into a later gap, provided that inserting into the earlier gap is not worse than inserting into the later gap.\n\nBut how to compare the two.\n\nFor example, consider inserting into gap i and inserting into gap j (i < j). Inserting into gap i would place the 1s earlier in the string, which is better, unless inserting into gap i would cause the 1s to be after a larger character than inserting into gap j.\n\nFor example, inserting into gap i which is between 2 and 0 (so the 1s would be between 2 and 0), whereas inserting into gap j",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. The key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's remains fixed, but '1's can be freely rearranged among them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Characters**: Split the input string into two parts: one containing all '0's and '2's (in their original order) and another containing all '1's.\n2. **Determine Insertion Points**: Identify the gaps where '1's can be inserted. These gaps are before the first character, between each pair of characters, and after the last character in the sequence of '0's and '2's.\n3. **Insert '1's Optimally**: Insert all '1's into the earliest possible gaps where they contribute to the lexicographically smallest result. Specifically, prioritize inserting '1's between '0' and '2' or after all '0's and before any '2's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            fixed.append(c)\n    \n    # Now, insert the ones into the fixed list\n    # Determine the insertion points\n    # We need to find the earliest positions where inserting 1s is beneficial\n    \n    # Create a list of insertion points (indices)\n    # The insertion points are from 0 to len(fixed)\n    # For each position i, we can insert ones before fixed[i]\n    # We want to insert all the ones into the earliest possible position that is optimal\n    \n    # The optimal place is the first gap where inserting 1s will not be worse than later\n    # The best way is to insert all ones into the first gap that is either:\n    # - between a 0 and a 2\n    # - after all 0s and before any 2s\n    # - before the first 2\n    \n    # So we iterate through the fixed list and find the first occurrence where a 2 appears after some 0s\n    # Then insert all ones before the first 2, if any\n    \n    # If there are no 2s, then insert all ones after the last 0\n    # If there are no 0s, insert all ones before the first 2\n    \n    # Let's find the earliest position to insert the ones\n    insert_pos = len(fixed)\n    \n    # Check if there are any 0s and 2s\n    has_zero = False\n    has_two = False\n    for c in fixed:\n        if c == '0':\n            has_zero = True\n        elif c == '2':\n            has_two = True\n        if has_zero and has_two:\n            break\n    \n    if has_zero and has_two:\n        # Find the first occurrence of '2' after some '0's\n        for i in range(len(fixed)):\n            if fixed[i] == '2':\n                # Check if there is a '0' before this position\n                if any(c == '0' for c in fixed[:i]):\n                    insert_pos = i\n                    break\n    elif has_zero:\n        # All are 0s, insert after all 0s\n        insert_pos = len(fixed)\n    elif has_two:\n        # All are 2s, insert before the first 2\n        insert_pos = 0\n    \n    # Now, insert the ones at the determined position\n    result = fixed[:insert_pos] + ones + fixed[insert_pos:]\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and process each test case\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split the input into individual test cases\n    # Assuming that the input is given as a list of strings separated by commas\n    # For example: ['100210', '11222121', '20']\n    test_cases = input_str.strip(\"[]\").split(\", \")\n    for case in test_cases:\n        s = case.strip(\"'\")\n        print(minimum_ternary_string(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Separate Characters**: The input string is split into two lists: `fixed` for '0's and '2's, and `ones` for '1's.\n- **Determine Insertion Points**: The algorithm identifies the optimal position to insert all '1's by checking for the first occurrence of '2' after some '0's.
