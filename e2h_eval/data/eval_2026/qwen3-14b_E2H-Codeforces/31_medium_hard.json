Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any number of cards from -x to x. \n\nSo, first, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let me think about how to achieve that with the least number of cards.\n\nEach new card can contribute a value between -x and x. The question is, what's the minimal number of cards needed to reach a sum of -S. \n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the sum is -1 + 1 + 2 = 2. So we need to add -2. Since x is 2, we can do that with one card. So the answer is 1. \n\nIn the second example, the sum is -2 + -2 = -4. So we need to add 4. Since x is 3, each card can contribute up to 3. So two cards: 3 + 1 = 4. But wait, the maximum per card is 3. So two cards: 3 and 1? Or maybe 2 and 2? Either way, two cards. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards needed to reach a target sum of -S, where each card can contribute between -x and x. But since we want the minimal number of cards, we need to maximize the contribution per card. \n\nLet me think: For the target sum T (which is -S), what is the minimal number of cards needed? \n\nEach card can contribute at most x. So the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| / x. But wait, if T is positive, then each card can contribute up to x. So for example, if T is 4 and x is 3, then 4 / 3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2. Which matches the second example.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Well, since we can use negative numbers. But the absolute value is what matters. Because if T is negative, then we can use cards with negative values. For example, T is -5, x is 3. Then we need to get sum of -5. So using two cards: -3 and -2. So that's two cards. Which is ceil(5/3) = 2. So regardless of the sign of T, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if |T| is not zero. \n\nWait, but what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed. So the answer is zero. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards. \n2. The target sum for the new cards is T = -S. \n3. If T is zero, return 0. \n4. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x ). \n\nBut wait, let me test this with the examples. \n\nFirst example: sum is 2. T is -2. So |T| is 2. x is 2. 2/2 = 1 → ceil(1) is 1. Correct.\n\nSecond example: sum is -4. T is 4. |T| is 4. x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose T is 5, x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666 → ceil is 2. Which would be 3 + 2 = 5. So two cards. Correct.\n\nAnother case: T is 3, x is 3 → 1 card.\n\nWhat about T is 0? Then 0 cards.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 1, x is 1? Then 1/1 = 1 → 1 card. Correct.\n\nBut what if T is 1, x is 2? Then 1/2 is 0.5 → ceil is 1. So one card. Which is correct, since you can use a 1.\n\nSo yes, the formula seems to hold. \n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the absolute value of the sum of the found cards, then computing ceil( (abs_sum) / x ), but only if the sum is not zero. Otherwise, zero.\n\nWait, but what if the sum is zero? Then the answer is zero. So the steps are:\n\nCalculate the sum S of the given cards. If S is zero, then output 0. Else, compute T = -S. Then compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x ). \n\nBut how do we compute ceil( |T| / x ) in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, for integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be computed as (a + b -1) // b. \n\nFor example, 4 /3 → (4 +3-1) //3 = 6//3=2. Which is correct. \n\nSo for |T| divided by x, we can compute it as (abs_T + x -1) // x.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead n and x. Read the list of numbers. Compute sum_S = sum of the list. \n\nIf sum_S is zero, output 0. Else, compute abs_T = abs(-sum_S) → which is same as abs(sum_S). Then compute (abs_T + x -1) // x. \n\nWait, because T is -sum_S. So |T| is |sum_S|. So yes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nsum_S = sum of the list.\n\nif sum_S == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_T = abs(sum_S)\n\n    min_cards = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but let me check the second example. \n\nIn the second example input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. So sum_S is -4. So abs_T is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1) //3 → 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: sum is 2, x is 2 → (2 + 2-1)//2 → 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: sum is 5, x is 3 → (5 +3-1)/3 →7//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x is 3 → (3 +3-1)/3 →5//3=1. Correct.\n\nWhat if sum is 0? Then output 0. \n\nSo that's the approach. \n\nSo the code would be straightforward. \n\nNow, let's check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So abs_T is 2. x is 2. (2+2-1)//2 = 3//2=1 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. abs_T is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2 → correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where sum is zero: output 0. \n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x is 1 → 1 card. \n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x is 2 → 1 card. \n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x is 2 → (3 +2-1)/2 →4/2=2. Which is correct (2 cards: 2 +1).\n\nBut wait, the maximum allowed per card is x. So for x=2, each card can be up to 2. So 2 +1 is allowed. But 1 is allowed. So yes, two cards. \n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 5 → 1 card. \n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and x. Then read list. Compute sum_S. If sum_S is zero, output 0. Else compute (abs(sum_S) +x -1) //x.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead input: first line is two integers n and x. Second line is n integers.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. The first line has n and x. The second line has n numbers.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead from stdin. For example, in code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_S = sum(nums)\n\nif sum_S == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_T = abs(sum_S)\n\n    min_cards = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but what about when x is zero? No, according to the input constraints, x is at least 1. Because the input says x is between 1 and 1000. So no division by zero here.\n\nYes. So this code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2. So (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1 → correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4 → abs is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is zero. For example, input 1 5 0 → sum is 0 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x is 5 → 1.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 6, x is 5 → (6 +5-1)/5 → 10/5=2. Which is correct (5 +1).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the newly found ones) equals zero. The numbers on the cards can range from -x to x, where x is a given maximum absolute value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum for the new cards must be the negative of the current sum to achieve an overall sum of zero.\n3. **Compute Minimum Cards Needed**: If the current sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value x. This is efficiently computed using integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_S = sum(nums)\nif sum_S == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_T = abs(sum_S)\n    min_cards = (abs_T + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on a card). The second line contains `n` integers representing the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards. If this sum is zero, immediately return 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Target Sum Calculation**: If the sum is not zero, compute the absolute value of this sum, which gives the magnitude of the target sum needed from the new cards.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, the formula `(abs_T + x - 1) // x` efficiently computes the ceiling of the division of `abs_T` by `x`, ensuring the minimum number of cards required to reach the target sum.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of cards needed with optimal time complexity, leveraging integer arithmetic for precision and performance.",
