При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem statement first.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have resulted from an error where two identical messages were merged. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap has to be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part must be of positive length but less than the length of the message. Also, the case where they are completely overlapping (like the entire message) is not considered an error. Similarly, just appending one after another (like s + s) is not considered an error.\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if it could be formed by merging two identical messages s with such an overlap. If yes, output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the original string t must be formed by taking two copies of s, overlapping them by some k characters, where 0 < k < len(s). So, the total length of t would be len(s) + len(s) - k. Which means that len(t) = 2 * len(s) - k. But since k can vary, we need to find possible s such that there exists a k where this holds.\n\nBut how to find possible s?\n\nLet me think: For t to be formed by overlapping two copies of s, the length of t must be 2 * len(s) - k, where k is between 1 and len(s)-1. Let's rearrange this equation:\n\nlen(t) = 2L - k, where L is len(s). Since k is between 1 and L-1, substituting gives:\n\nlen(t) = 2L - k → len(t) must be between 2L - (L-1) = L + 1 and 2L - 1. So:\n\nL + 1 ≤ len(t) ≤ 2L - 1.\n\nBut since len(t) is fixed, we can express L in terms of len(t). Let me think for possible L values.\n\nLet me denote the length of t as n. Then:\n\nn = 2L - k → k = 2L - n.\n\nBut since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - n ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities for L.\n\nFirst inequality:\n\n2L - n ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ n + 1 → L ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality:\n\n2L -n ≤ L -1 → 2L -n ≤ L -1 → L ≤ n -1.\n\nSo combining these, L must be in the range:\n\nceil( (n+1)/2 ) ≤ L ≤ n-1.\n\nWait, because L has to be an integer. So for each possible L in that range, we can check if there exists a k (which is 2L -n) such that the overlap works.\n\nBut also, since k must be between 1 and L-1, then for each L in that range, we can compute k = 2L -n and check if it's between 1 and L-1.\n\nBut since L is chosen such that (n+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ n-1, then for k = 2L -n:\n\nFor example, when L is (n+1)/2, then k = 2*(n+1)/2 -n = n+1 -n = 1. Which is valid. And for L = n-1, k = 2(n-1) -n = 2n -2 -n = n-2. Which must be less than L-1 = n-2. So k = n-2 equals L-1. Wait, but the problem says that the overlapping length must be less than the length of the message. So k must be less than L. Because L is the length of s, which is the message. So the overlapping length k must be between 1 and L-1.\n\nIn the case of L = n-1, k = n-2. Since L is n-1, then L-1 = n-2. So k is equal to L-1. Which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nSo for each possible L in the range ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1, inclusive, we can check if the following holds:\n\nThe first part of the string t (of length L) and the second part (of length L) must overlap by k characters, where k is 2L -n. And the overlapping part must be the same.\n\nWait, how does that work? Let me think. When two copies of s are merged with an overlap of k characters, the resulting string is s + s[k:]. So the total length is len(s) + len(s) -k = 2L -k. Which is n.\n\nSo for the given t, we can check for each possible L (as discussed) if there exists a k such that:\n\nt starts with s, and ends with s[k:]. So, the first L characters of t is s, and the last L characters of t is s. But overlapping by k. So, the first L characters of t is s. Then, the last L characters of t must be s, but the first (L -k) characters of the second s would be overlapping with the last k characters of the first s.\n\nAlternatively, the way to check is: take the first L characters as s, and check if the last L -k characters of t match the first L -k characters of s. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIf the original two s's are merged with an overlap of k characters, then the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:]. So the merged string's length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n.\n\nSo for the merged string t, the first L characters are s, and the next (L -k) characters are s[k:].\n\nBut since the merged string is t, then the entire string must be s followed by s[k:]. Therefore, the first L characters are s, and the last (L -k) characters of t must be s[k:].\n\nBut how do I find k?\n\nWell, for a given L, k = 2L -n. Because n = 2L -k → k = 2L -n.\n\nSo for each possible L in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1], compute k = 2L -n. Then check if k is between 1 and L-1. Wait, but according to earlier analysis, since L is in that range, k will be between 1 and L-1. Let me confirm.\n\nLet me take L as being in [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1].\n\nFor example, when L is (n+1)/2, then k = 2L -n = 2*(n+1)/2 -n = n+1 -n = 1. Which is 1, which is valid.\n\nWhen L is n-1, then k = 2*(n-1) -n = 2n -2 -n = n-2. Since L = n-1, then L-1 = n-2. So k = L-1, which is allowed.\n\nSo for all L in that range, k is between 1 and L-1. Therefore, for each L in that range, we can compute k and check if the first L characters (s_candidate) and the last L characters of t (which should be s_candidate as well) have an overlapping of k characters.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother way: For the merged string t, the first L characters are s_candidate. Then, the remaining part of t (from position L onwards) should be s_candidate[k:]. So the entire t should be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut the length of t is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. Which is correct.\n\nTherefore, for a given L, we can take s_candidate as the first L characters of t. Then check if the rest of the string (from index L onwards) equals s_candidate[k:]. Also, we need to make sure that the overlapping part (the last k characters of s_candidate) equals the first k characters of s_candidate. Because when you merge the two s_candidates, the overlapping part is the same. Wait, no. The overlapping is that the end of the first s_candidate overlaps with the beginning of the second s_candidate. So the last k characters of the first s_candidate must be equal to the first k characters of the second s_candidate. Since both are s_candidate, that means the last k characters of s_candidate must equal the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nSo, for the candidate s_candidate (the first L characters of t), we need to check that:\n\nt starts with s_candidate (which it does, by construction), and that the part after the first L characters (t[L:]) is equal to s_candidate[k:]. Also, the overlapping part (the last k characters of s_candidate) must equal the first k characters of s_candidate. Wait, but since the second s_candidate is being overlapped with the first, the overlapping part is the first k characters of the second s_candidate (since the first s_candidate's last k characters are overlapping with the second's first k). Therefore, the first k characters of s_candidate must be equal to the last k characters of s_candidate. Because the second s_candidate is the same as the first.\n\nSo, for the candidate s_candidate, we need to check that the first k characters of s_candidate equals the last k characters of s_candidate. Also, the rest of the string after the first L characters must be s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut since the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], then t must be equal to that. So, the entire string t must be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo, for a given L, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute k = 2L -n.\n\n2. Check if k is between 1 and L-1. Well, according to previous analysis, since L is in the correct range, this will be true.\n\n3. Take s_candidate as t[:L].\n\n4. Check if t ends with s_candidate[k:]. That is, the substring starting from position L must be equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut also, the overlapping part (the last k characters of s_candidate) must match the first k characters of s_candidate. Wait, but since the second s_candidate is the same as the first, the overlapping part is the first k characters of the second s_candidate. Which is the same as the first k characters of s_candidate. So the last k characters of the first s_candidate must equal the first k characters of s_candidate. Which is equivalent to checking that the first k characters of s_candidate equal the last k characters of s_candidate.\n\nSo, for example, if s_candidate is 'abcab', and k is 2, then the last 2 characters of s_candidate are 'ab', and the first 2 are 'ab' — so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, for the candidate s_candidate, we need to check two things:\n\n- The part after the first L characters (t[L:]) is equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\n- The first k characters of s_candidate are equal to the last k characters of s_candidate.\n\nWait, but perhaps the first condition already implies the second? Let me think.\n\nBecause the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. So the entire t is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:]. Therefore, the first L characters are s_candidate. Then, the next part is s_candidate[k:]. So the entire t is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut the length of t is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. Which is correct.\n\nBut for that to be the case, the part t[L:] must be equal to s_candidate[k:]. So if that's true, then the entire t is constructed correctly. However, this may not ensure that the overlapping part is correct. Wait, but the overlapping part is handled by the way the s_candidate is constructed. Because when you merge two s_candidates, overlapping by k, the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. So the overlapping part is that the last k characters of the first s_candidate are the same as the first k characters of the second s_candidate. Which is the same as the first k of s_candidate. Therefore, the last k characters of s_candidate must be the same as the first k of s_candidate.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Because if t is built as s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], then the overlapping part is automatically correct. Because the first s_candidate is s_candidate, and the second is s_candidate. So when you merge them with k overlapping, the overlapping part is the last k of the first and first k of the second. Which are same as the first k of s_candidate. Therefore, the last k of s_candidate must be same as first k of s_candidate.\n\nBut how do we check that? Because if the t is built as s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], then the overlapping part is correct. So, if we check that t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], then that would imply that the overlapping part is correct. Because the way that the merged string is built requires that the overlapping part is the same. Therefore, perhaps checking that t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] is sufficient.\n\nBut how can we check that? Because for a given L, s_candidate is t[:L], and the rest of the string is t[L:]. So we can check if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf that's true, then the entire t is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], which implies that the overlapping part is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the check is only to verify that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut why? Because in that case, the merged string would be s_candidate followed by s_candidate[k:], which implies that the overlapping part is correct.\n\nYes. For example, suppose s_candidate is 'ababa' and k=2. Then s_candidate[k:] is 'aba'. So the merged string is 'ababa' + 'aba' = 'ababaaba', which is length 5 + 3 = 8. Now, the overlapping part is 2 characters. The first s_candidate ends with 'ba', and the second s_candidate starts with 'ab'? Wait, no. Wait, the merged string is formed by overlapping the end of the first s_candidate with the start of the second. So the first s_candidate is 'ababa', and the second s_candidate is 'ababa'. Overlapping by k=2, the last 2 characters of the first s_candidate are 'ba', and the first 2 characters of the second are 'ab'. These are not the same, so the overlapping would not be possible. But according to our check, t would be 'ababa' + 'aba' (s_candidate[k:] is 'aba'). So the merged string would be 'ababaaba'.\n\nBut in reality, the overlapping part is supposed to be the same. So why would this check pass?\n\nAh, here's the problem. The check that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:] may not ensure that the overlapping part is correct. Because the way the merged string is built is by overlapping the end of the first s_candidate with the start of the second. Therefore, the last k characters of the first s_candidate must equal the first k characters of the second s_candidate. Which is the same as the first k characters of s_candidate. So, the last k characters of s_candidate must equal the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nBut if we only check that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:], then that doesn't check this condition. Because for example, in the scenario above, if the s_candidate is 'ababa' and k=2, then s_candidate[k:] is 'aba'. So the merged string would be 'ababa' + 'aba' = 'ababaaba' which is length 8. However, the overlapping part is 2 characters. The first s_candidate ends with 'ba', and the second starts with 'ab' — which are not the same. Therefore, this would not be a valid merge. But according to the check t[L:] == s_candidate[k:], which is 'aba' == 'aba' — which is true. So the check passes, but the actual overlapping is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that my previous reasoning was wrong. Therefore, there's a mistake here.\n\nSo what's wrong here? How can the check t[L:] == s_candidate[k:] pass even though the overlapping part is invalid?\n\nBecause the merged string is formed by overlapping the first s_candidate with the second s_candidate. The merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], which is correct only if the overlapping part is correct. But how?\n\nWait, the merged string is formed by overlapping the end of the first s_candidate with the start of the second. Therefore, the first s_candidate is of length L. The second s_candidate is of length L. The overlapping part is k characters. So the merged string is of length L + L -k = 2L -k. But in this case, the merged string is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:], which is exactly that length. But for that to be possible, the overlapping part must be the same. Therefore, the last k characters of s_candidate must equal the first k characters of s_candidate. Otherwise, the two parts wouldn't merge properly.\n\nBut in the example above, the check t[L:] == s_candidate[k:] is true, but the overlapping part is not. So how can that be?\n\nBecause in the example, the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], which is 'ababa' + 'aba' = 'ababaaba', which is the same as the original t. However, the overlapping part is not correct. So how is this possible?\n\nAh! Because the overlapping part is not checked. So the check that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:] is necessary but not sufficient. Because even if that holds, the overlapping part may not be correct. Therefore, we need to check both that the t[L:] equals s_candidate[k:], and that the last k characters of s_candidate are the same as the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nSo, the correct conditions are:\n\n1. t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]\n\n2. s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]\n\nSo both conditions must be satisfied.\n\nBut why? Because the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s_candidate (which is s_candidate[-k:]) and the first k of the second s_candidate (which is s_candidate[:k]). They must be equal.\n\nSo, in the example above, the first condition holds (t[L:] equals s_candidate[k:]), but the second condition does not (s_candidate[-k:] is 'ba', and s_candidate[:k] is 'ab'), so the check would fail.\n\nThus, the algorithm needs to check both conditions.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nFor each possible L in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1], compute k = 2L -n.\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and L-1. But according to earlier analysis, since L is in that range, k will be in that range.\n\nThen:\n\nTake s_candidate = t[:L].\n\nCheck two things:\n\n- s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]\n\n- t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]\n\nIf both are true, then this s_candidate is a valid solution.\n\nOnce we find such an L and s_candidate, we can output YES and the s_candidate.\n\nNow, the question is: How to iterate through possible L values?\n\nLet me think about the possible L values. For example, for the input 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the first sample input. The output is 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. Let's see:\n\nOriginal t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which has length 19. Let's check for L = 11. Then n = 19.\n\nk = 2*11 -19 = 22-19=3. So k=3. Check if 1<=3 <=10 (yes).\n\ns_candidate is t[:11] = 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck s_candidate[-3:] is 'bra' and s_candidate[:3] is 'abr' — which are not equal. Wait, but the sample output says that this is a valid case. Wait, this suggests that my approach is wrong. Or perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — but the output is 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. Let me check the example again.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (the first example input). The output is YES and 'abrakadabra'.\n\nLet me compute n for that input. Let's count the letters. The string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\n\"abrakadabra\" is 11 letters. Then the input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" — which is \"abrakadabra\" followed by \"abrakadabra\" but overlapping. Let me see the sample explanation says that for example, merging two 'abrakadabra's with overlap of 1 character gives \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" (the first example input?), or with 4 characters. Wait, the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters. Let me check:\n\nOriginal s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). When merged with overlap of 1, the merged string is s + s[1:] → length 11 + 10 = 21. But the input is 19 letters. Hmm. Wait the sample input says that the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is length 19. Let me count:\n\nLet me write the string: a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me check the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input 1 is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — the output is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Let's compute n = len(t) = 19. For L = 11, k = 2*11 -19 = 3. So k=3.\n\ns_candidate is t[:11] = 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck if the last 3 characters of s_candidate are equal to the first 3. The last three letters of 'abrakadabra' are 'bra'. The first three are 'abr' — not equal. But according to the sample, this is a valid case. So there's a contradiction here. Which means that my approach is wrong.\n\nHmm. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample input says that the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the result of merging two 'abrakadabra's with an overlap. Let me think about how that could happen.\n\nOriginal two messages are 'abrakadabra' (s). Suppose they are merged with an overlap of k=1. Then the merged string is s + s[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → which is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — which is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. But the sample input is 19 letters. So perhaps the overlap is 4?\n\nLet me think. Let me calculate for L = 11, k= 2*11 -n = 22 -19 = 3. So k=3. Then the merged string would be s + s[3:] → len(s) + (len(s) -k) = 11 + 8 = 19. Which matches the sample input. So the merged string is s + s[3:].\n\nWhat is s[3:]? s is 'abrakadabra' → s[3:] is 'akadabra' (assuming indexes start at 0). So the merged string would be 'abrakadabra' + 'akadabra' → let me see:\n\nOriginal s: a b r a k a d a b r a (positions 0-10)\n\ns[3:] is from index 3: a k a d a b r a → wait, no. Wait the original s is 'abrakadabra' which is 11 letters. Let me write it out:\n\nIndices 0-10:\n\n0:a, 1:b, 2:r, 3:a, 4:k, 5:a, 6:d, 7:a, 8:b, 9:r, 10:a.\n\nSo s[3:] is 'akadabra' (from index 3 to 10: a, k, a, d, a, b, r, a → 8 letters). So the merged string is 'abrakadabra' + 'akadabra' → which is:\n\nabrakadabraakadabra → let me count the letters. The first part is 11 letters, the second is 8 → total 19. Which matches the sample input.\n\nBut in this case, the overlapping part is k=3. So the last 3 letters of the first s_candidate (s) is 'bra' (indices 8,9,10: b, r, a?), wait no. Wait the first s_candidate is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). The last 3 letters are positions 8,9,10: b, r, a. The first 3 letters of s_candidate are a, b, r. So 'bra' vs 'abr' — not equal. So according to my previous conditions, this would not be valid. But according to the sample input, this is a valid case. Which indicates that my logic is wrong.\n\nSo where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Oh no! The overlapping part is between the end of the first message and the beginning of the second message. So when you merge the two messages, the end of the first message (length k) must match the beginning of the second message (length k). But the second message is s, so its beginning is the first k letters of s. Therefore, the last k letters of the first message (which is s) must match the first k letters of the second message (which is also s). Therefore, the last k letters of s must be equal to the first k letters of s. But in this example, the last 3 letters of s are 'bra' and the first 3 are 'abr' — which are not equal. But according to the sample input, this is a valid case.\n\nWait, this suggests that my understanding of the problem is wrong. What's going on here?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that during the error, the two messages are merged by overlapping. The end of the first message is merged with the beginning of the second. The overlapping must be such that the overlapping parts are the same. So, the last k characters of the first message must be equal to the first k characters of the second message. Since the two messages are the same (s), this implies that the last k characters of s must be equal to the first k characters of s.\n\nBut according to the example, this is not happening. So why is this considered valid?\n\nWait, the sample input says that the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the result of merging two 'abrakadabra's. Let me check what the merged string would look like with an overlap of k=3.\n\nOriginal two messages: s = 'abrakadabra' and s again. Overlap of 3.\n\nThe merged string is the first s, then the second s with the first 3 letters removed. So the merged string is s + s[3:].\n\nWhich would be:\n\ns is abrakadabra (11 letters). s[3:] is akadabra (8 letters). So merged string is 11 + 8 = 19 letters. Let's write it out:\n\nabrakadabra akadabra → combining:\n\nabrakadabraakadabra → let's check the overlapping part. The first s ends with 'bra' (last 3 letters) and the second s starts with 'aka' (first 3 letters of s[3:] is 'a', 'k', 'a' — wait no. Wait the second message is s, but we are taking s[3:] — which is the second message's letters starting from index 3. But the second message is s. So the first 3 letters of the second message are 'abr', but in the merged string, we are taking s[3:] of the second message. So the overlapping part between the first message and the second message is the last 3 letters of the first message (which is 'bra') and the first 3 letters of the second message (which is 'abr'). These are not equal. So why is this considered a valid case?\n\nThis seems to contradict the problem statement. But according to the sample input, this is a valid case. So where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! Oh wait, no. The overlapping is done during transmission. The two messages are sent consecutively, and during transmission, they are merged by overlapping. The overlapping part is the end of the first message and the beginning of the second. So the overlapping part must be the same. Therefore, the last k letters of the first message must be equal to the first k letters of the second message. Since the two messages are the same, this means that the last k letters of s must be equal to the first k letters of s. So in the example, this would require that the last 3 letters of s are 'abr' (the first 3 letters of s). But the last 3 letters of s are 'bra' — which is not equal to 'abr'.\n\nSo why is the sample input considered valid? There must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nLet me look at the sample explanation again. The first example input says that the first example is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the result of merging two 'abrakadabra's. Let me think about how that could happen.\n\nWait perhaps the overlap is not 3, but something else. Let me think about the merged string.\n\nThe sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let's write it out as a string. Let me count the letters:\n\nLet me see: 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. The sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — which is 19 letters. Let me split it into parts.\n\nThe first part is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), then the next part is 'brakadabra' (10 letters). Wait, but that would be 21 letters. No. Alternatively, perhaps the merged string is 'abrakadabra' followed by 'brakadabra' — which is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. But the sample input is 19 letters. So perhaps the overlap is larger.\n\nLet me think: the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'. Let me split it into parts. Let me count the letters:\n\nLet me write the string:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → that's 21 letters. Wait no. Let me count:\n\nOriginal 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. Then adding another 'abrakadabra' would be 22 letters. But the sample input is shorter. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is:\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → that's 21 letters. Wait, but the sample input says that the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — which is 19 letters. Let me check again.\n\nWait the sample input for the first example is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let me count the letters:\n\nLet me split it:\n\nabrakadabra (11 letters) + brakadabra (10 letters) → total 21 letters. But the sample input says that the output is 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. So according to the problem statement, the input is the merged string. But according to the sample input, the merged string is 19 letters. So perhaps my calculation is wrong.\n\nWait the sample input for the first case is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let me count the letters:\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nabrakadabra (11 letters) + brakadabra (10 letters) = 21 letters. But that's not 19. Hmm. Maybe the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is:\n\nLet me count each letter step by step:\n\nLet me write the string as follows:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → that's 21 letters. But the sample output says that the input is this string. How can it be 19 letters?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me count again:\n\nLet me take the string 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let's count each letter:\n\nLet's see:\n\na (1)\nb (2)\nr (3)\na (4)\nk (5)\na (6)\nd (7)\na (8)\nb (9)\nr (10)\na (11)\nb (12)\nr (13)\na (14)\nk (15)\na (16)\nd (17)\na (18)\nb (19)\nr (20)\na (21)\n\nYes, 21 letters. But the sample input says that the first example input is this string. But the output is YES and 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. How does this fit?\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the sample input is ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', ...], and the output is ['YES\\nabrakadabra', ...]. So according to the problem statement, this input is a valid case.\n\nBut according to the earlier logic, for L = 11, k = 2*11 - 21 = 22-21=1. So k=1. Let me check this case.\n\nIf n is 21, then for L = 11, k = 2*11 -21 = 1. Then, s_candidate is the first 11 letters, which is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck if the last 1 character of s_candidate (which is 'a') is equal to the first 1 character of s_candidate ('a') — yes. So condition 2 is satisfied.\n\nThen check if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]. t[L:] is the substring starting at position 11. For n=21, L=11, t[L:] is the substring from index 11 to end, which is 'brakadabra' (length 10). s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] which is 'brakadabra' (length 10). So yes, this matches.\n\nSo in this case, the conditions are satisfied. Thus, the merged string is valid.\n\nAh! So earlier, I had assumed that the input length was 19, but in reality, it's 21 letters. My mistake was in counting the letters. This explains why the sample input is valid.\n\nSo the initial mistake was in calculating the length of the sample input. This shows that my earlier analysis was correct, and the example fits.\n\nSo back to the algorithm.\n\nThe correct approach is to check for each possible L in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1], compute k = 2L -n. For each such L, check:\n\n1. s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n2. Check if the last k characters of s_candidate are equal to the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n3. Check if the substring t[L:] equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf both are true, then return s_candidate.\n\nNow, let's proceed to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor the input string t:\n\n- Compute n = len(t).\n\n- Iterate L from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1.\n\n   For each L:\n\n   - Compute k = 2L -n.\n\n   - Check if k is between 1 and L-1. But since L is in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1], this should always be true.\n\n   - s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n   - Check if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]\n\n   - Check if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]\n\n   - If both are true, return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the L's satisfy the conditions, output NO.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nFor example, the third sample input is 'abcabc', output is NO. Let's see why.\n\nn = 6.\n\nPossible L ranges from ceil((6+1)/2) = 4 (since (6+1)/2 = 3.5, ceil is 4) to 5.\n\nSo L can be 4 or 5.\n\nFor L=4:\n\nk = 2*4 -6 = 8-6=2.\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and 3 (L-1=3). Yes.\n\ns_candidate = first 4 chars: 'abca'.\n\nCheck s_candidate[-2:] is 'ca' and s_candidate[:2] is 'ab' → not equal. So condition fails.\n\nFor L=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have resulted from an error where two identical messages were merged by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message matches the beginning of the second message, with the overlap length being positive and less than the length of the message.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Overlap Condition**: If two identical messages `s` are merged with an overlap of `k` characters, the resulting string `t` will have a length of `2 * len(s) - k`. This implies that for a given length `n` of `t`, we need to find possible lengths `L` of `s` such that `L` is in the range `[ceil((n+1)/2), n-1]`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `L` in the valid range, compute the overlap length `k = 2L - n`. Check if the overlap conditions are satisfied:\n   - The last `k` characters of the candidate message `s` (first `L` characters of `t`) must match the first `k` characters of `s`.\n   - The substring of `t` starting from position `L` must match the substring of `s` starting from position `k`.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: If both conditions are met for any valid `L`, output the candidate message `s`. If no valid `L` is found, output \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    t = input().strip()\n    n = len(t)\n    found = False\n    result = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate over possible L values\n    start_L = math.ceil((n + 1) / 2)\n    for L in range(start_L, n):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= L:\n            continue  # though theoretically shouldn't happen\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        # Check if the last k chars of s_candidate equal the first k\n        if s_candidate[-k:] != s_candidate[:k]:\n            continue\n        # Check if the rest of t matches s_candidate[k:]\n        if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n            found = True\n            result = s_candidate\n            break\n    \n    if found:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(result)\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Range Calculation**: The valid range for `L` is derived from the requirement that the overlap length `k` must be between 1 and `L-1`. This ensures that the merged string length condition is met.\n- **Overlap Check**: For each candidate length `L`, we check if the overlap conditions are satisfied by comparing the relevant substrings of the candidate message and the rest of the string `t`.\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm efficiently checks each possible length in the derived range, ensuring that it handles all edge cases within the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify if the given string `t` could be the result of an erroneous merge of two identical messages, providing the correct message `s` if possible.",
