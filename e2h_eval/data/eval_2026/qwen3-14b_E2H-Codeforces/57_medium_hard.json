His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on the given points from two tours. The key here is that the teacher knows Vasya's total points are at least x, but we need to consider all possible combinations of a_i and b_j for Vasya's scores such that a_i + b_j >= x. Then, for each possible combination, determine how his total would place him among others.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because for the best possible rank, we want Vasya's total to be as high as possible, so that he can be first. For the worst possible rank, we want his total to be as low as possible (but still at least x), and arrange others' totals in a way that maximizes his position.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nFirst, let's think about the best possible rank. To get the best rank, Vasya's total should be the maximum possible. So, we need to find the maximum possible value of a_i + b_j where a_i + b_j >= x. Then, count how many participants have a total higher than this maximum. But wait, no. Wait, if Vasya's total is the maximum possible, then he would be first. Because even if others have same sum, the jury can assign him first. So for best rank, we can assume that Vasya's total is the highest possible, so he is placed first. So the best possible rank is 1, unless there are other participants with higher sums. Wait no, because the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j (but only considering pairs where a_i + b_j >=x). Wait, but the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So, for the best case, Vasya's total is the maximum possible sum. Let me think: For example, if there's someone else who has a sum higher than that, then Vasya can't be first. But how can that happen? Because if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then others can't have higher. Because the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of all possible a_i + b_j. Wait, but the other participants' sums are a_i + b_i? No. Wait, no. The participants are in the list. For each participant, their first tour score is a_i, and second tour is b_i. Wait, no. Wait, the input gives the first line as a list of a_i (points in first tour), and the second line as b_i (points in second tour). But the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their first tour is a_i and second tour is b_i. But the problem is that the teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but they are not matched. So the actual participants' total is a_i + b_i? Or is it that the teacher has the list of first tour scores and the list of second tour scores, but they are not matched. So for example, the actual participants' total is a_i + b_j for some i and j. But that doesn't make sense. Wait no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but the problem is that the results have only points, no names. So for example, the first tour's list is a1, a2,... an, and the second tour's list is b1, b2,... bn. But each participant has a first tour score and a second tour score. However, the teacher doesn't know which a_i corresponds to which b_i. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i and second tour is b_i, but the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_i belong to the same participant. Wait, no. Wait, no. Because the problem states that each participant participated in both tours. So for each participant, there is a first tour score and a second tour score. But the lists are given in arbitrary order. So for example, the first list is all the first tour scores of the participants, but not necessarily in the same order as the second list. So the actual total for each participant is a_i + b_j, but that would be incorrect. Wait, no. Wait, the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but the problem is that the data is not matched. So for example, the first list is the first tour scores of all participants, and the second list is the second tour scores of all participants. But the teacher doesn't know which a_i belongs to which b_i. So when trying to find Vasya's possible positions, we need to consider that for each participant, their total is a_i + b_i (but that's not correct). Wait, no. Because the actual participants have their own a_i and b_i. For example, participant 1 has a1 in first tour and b1 in second. Participant 2 has a2 and b2, etc. But the teacher has the a's and b's, but not matched. So the teacher can't know which a and b belong to which participant. Therefore, when trying to find the possible positions of Vasya, we have to imagine that for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but that's not correct. Wait, but no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tours. So for example, the first tour's results are a1, a2,... an, and the second tour's results are b1, b2,... bn. But the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to the same participant. However, the actual participants' total scores are a_i + b_i for each participant (since each participant has a first and second tour score). But the teacher does not know which a_i and b_i belong to the same person. So the problem is that for the purpose of calculating the possible positions of Vasya, we need to consider that Vasya is one of the participants, and his total is a_i + b_j, where i and j are such that there exists some pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. But the rest of the participants are considered as having their total scores as a_k + b_l, but with the constraint that each a and b is used exactly once. Wait, no. That's not possible. Because each participant has exactly one a and one b. So the total for each participant is a_i + b_i, but the teacher doesn't know which a_i is paired with which b_i. Therefore, the problem becomes: given the two lists a and b, find all possible pairings (permutations of b) such that each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and then for each possible pairing, find the possible positions of Vasya. But since the problem allows us to choose any pairing (since the teacher doesn't know which is which), we have to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya can have, given that there exists a pairing where he has a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya is present in the Olympiad. Which means that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. However, in the actual pairing (the real one), Vasya's total is a_i + b_j (for some i and j). But the teacher needs to find the possible best and worst positions that Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings (since the teacher doesn't know the actual pairing). Wait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya based on the possible pairings. Because the teacher doesn't know which a and b belong to Vasya, but knows that in reality, there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is at least x. But the problem requires us to consider all possible pairings where there exists a pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >=x (which is guaranteed by the input constraints) and find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya.\n\nBut how to model this? For the best possible rank, we can choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and arrange others' totals in such a way that he gets the best possible rank. Similarly, for the worst possible rank, we can choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange others' totals to maximize his rank.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think again. The problem is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have, given that his total is at least x. But since the pairing is arbitrary, we can choose any possible pairing where Vasya's total is a_i + b_j >=x. For the best rank, we want to maximize his total, so that as many others as possible have lower totals. For the worst rank, we want to minimize his total (but still >=x), and arrange others' totals to be as high as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we model the other participants' totals? Because for the best case scenario, we can choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and the other participants' totals are as low as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe can select for Vasya the maximum possible a_i + b_j (>=x). Then, count how many participants can have a total higher than this value. But since the pairing is arbitrary, how can we arrange that others' totals are as low as possible?\n\nWait, no. Because in any pairing, each a_i is matched with exactly one b_j. So for the best case, we can choose Vasya's a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, for the other participants, we can pair their a's and b's such that their totals are as small as possible, thus allowing Vasya to be first. However, this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible value of a_i + b_j (for Vasya's total), and then the number of participants that can have a total strictly greater than that value. But how do we find that?\n\nWait, but the problem says that when multiple participants have the same total, the jury can assign their ranks as they like. So, for the best possible rank, if Vasya's total is the maximum possible, then he can be placed first regardless of others. Because even if someone else has the same total, the jury can assign him first. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1, provided that there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum possible.\n\nBut how do we ensure that? Well, the maximum possible value for Vasya's total is the maximum of all a_i + b_j. But since the pairing must be such that each a and b is used once, how can we choose a pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum possible?\n\nAh, but perhaps the maximum possible total for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j for all possible i and j. Because even though in the actual pairing, each a and b is used once, for the purposes of finding the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya is paired with the a_i and b_j that gives the maximum sum, and the rest of the pairings are arranged in a way that doesn't affect his rank. So for example, if there's a pair (a_i, b_j) that gives a sum of S, then we can choose that as Vasya's sum, and arrange the rest of the pairings as needed. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1, as long as there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Which is always possible, since the input guarantees that there's at least one pair with sum >=x.\n\nWait, but what if there are other participants whose total in the pairing is higher than Vasya's? For example, suppose that in the pairing, there's another participant with a higher sum than Vasya's. Then, Vasya's rank would be worse. But in the best case scenario, we want to avoid that. So how can we arrange the pairings to ensure that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible?\n\nAh, here's the key: in the best possible scenario, we can choose the pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and arrange the rest of the pairings such that no other participant has a higher sum than Vasya's. But is that possible?\n\nFor example, suppose that the maximum possible sum for Vasya is S. Then, we can pair him with the a_i and b_j that gives S. For the rest of the participants, we can pair them in a way that their sums are as small as possible. But how?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps the answer for the best possible rank is 1, because even if there are other participants with the same sum, the jury can assign the first place to Vasya. But if there are participants with a sum higher than Vasya's, then his rank would be worse. Therefore, to find the best possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible sum S that Vasya can have (without violating the pairing constraints), and then find how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than S in any possible pairing. If that number is zero, then best rank is 1. Otherwise, it's that number plus 1.\n\nWait, but how can we find the maximum possible sum S that Vasya can have, given that the pairing must be such that each a and b is used once?\n\nAh, this seems tricky. Because in reality, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j, but only if there's a way to pair the rest of the a's and b's. For example, if we take the maximum a_i and maximum b_j, then the rest of the a's and b's can be paired in some way. However, this is possible. For example, if we take a_i = max_a and b_j = max_b, then the remaining a's and b's can be paired arbitrarily. So the maximum possible sum for Vasya is indeed max_a + max_b, provided that there exists at least one pair (i,j) with a_i + b_j >=x. Which the input guarantees.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, we can take S = max(a_i + b_j). Then, the question is, how many participants can have a sum greater than S in any possible pairing. But since S is the maximum possible sum for any participant (because we can choose to pair a_i and b_j for Vasya as the maximum possible sum), then no other participant can have a sum greater than S. Because if there was a participant with a sum greater than S, that would contradict the fact that S is the maximum possible. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because in the best case scenario, we can arrange the pairing so that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Therefore, no other participant can have a sum higher than that. Thus, Vasya can be placed first. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple participants that can have the same maximum sum? For example, if two participants can have sum equal to S. But since the jury can assign ranks as they like, Vasya can be placed first. So yes, best rank is 1.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. But looking at the sample input, in the first example, the output is 1 5. Which matches that.\n\nBut let's check the second sample input. The output is 1 5. So best is 1. Which aligns with this reasoning.\n\nSo the best possible rank is 1. So the first part of the answer is always 1. Wait, but what if there are multiple people with higher sums than Vasya's? How can that be possible? Because if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then no one else can have a higher sum. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the answer is always 1. But why in the first sample input, the output is 1 5. Which matches. So that's correct.\n\nNow for the worst possible rank. This is more complex. We need to find the maximum possible rank that Vasya can have. To do this, we need to arrange the pairing such that Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and arrange the other participants' totals to be as high as possible, thus pushing Vasya down in the rankings.\n\nSo, the approach for the worst possible rank is:\n\nFind the minimal possible value of S_vasya (which is >=x), such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is S_vasya, and then compute how many participants can have a total >= S_vasya. But since the jury can arrange the same totals in any order, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with a total strictly greater than S_vasya plus 1.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal possible S_vasya (given that it's >=x) and arrange the rest of the pairings to maximize the number of participants with total >= S_vasya?\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think.\n\nThe minimal possible S_vasya is the minimal value that is >=x, and for which there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is S_vasya. But to find the worst case, we need to choose the minimal S_vasya (so that more people can have higher sums). Wait, no. Because if S_vasya is as small as possible (but still >=x), then others can have higher sums, which would push Vasya's rank down.\n\nSo the idea is to find the minimal possible S_vasya (>=x) that can be achieved, and then find how many other participants can have a sum >= S_vasya, assuming that the rest of the pairings are arranged to maximize that count.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFor the worst possible rank:\n\nWe need to choose a value S (>=x) such that there exists a way to pair a_i and b_j such that one of the pairs is (a_i, b_j) with sum S. And then, for the rest of the pairs, arrange them to have as many as possible sums >= S. Then, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum > S plus 1 (if there are k participants with sum > S, then Vasya can be placed in k+1-th position).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by the following approach:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible S (>=x) that can be achieved by Vasya (i.e., there exists a pair a_i + b_j = S, and the rest of the pairs can be arranged such that all a's and b's are used once). Then, for that S, calculate the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >= S. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1 (if there are m participants with sum >= S, then Vasya can be placed in m-th position, but since the jury can arrange same sums, the worst possible is m-th. Wait, no. If there are m participants with sum >= S, then the worst possible rank is m. Because if all of them are >= S, then Vasya's rank is at least m. But since the jury can arrange the same sums, the worst possible is m.\n\nBut how to find this m.\n\nBut how to find S and the maximum number of participants with sum >= S.\n\nThis seems complex. Let's think of it as follows:\n\nTo minimize S (but still >=x), and then for that S, find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >= S. But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible S (>=x) such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j = S, and the rest of the pairs can be formed. Then, for that S, find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >= S. But how?\n\nBut perhaps the minimal S is x, but we need to find the minimal S that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). However, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, so S can be as low as x (if such a pair exists).\n\nBut to maximize the number of participants with sum >= S, we need to choose S as low as possible. Because lower S allows more participants to have sum >= S.\n\nSo the strategy for the worst case is to find the minimal possible S (>=x) that can be achieved by Vasya's pair, and then find how many participants can have a sum >= S in some pairing.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal possible S?\n\nWell, the minimal possible S is the minimal value >=x such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = S, and there exists a way to pair all the other a's and b's.\n\nBut how to find that. Since the pairing is arbitrary, perhaps the minimal S is the minimal value >=x that can be achieved by any pair (a_i, b_j). Because even if we choose that pair for Vasya, the rest can be paired in any way.\n\nSo for example, if there's a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum x, then that's the minimal possible S.\n\nOnce we have that S, then we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >= S. Because the jury can arrange the pairings to maximize this number, thus making Vasya's rank as bad as possible.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum number.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For a given S, what is the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >= S, given that each a and b is used once.\n\nBut this is equivalent to the maximum matching between a and b where the sum is >= S. However, since we need to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with sum >= S, such that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nBut this is the maximum matching problem. However, for n up to 1e5, this approach would be too slow.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think of the following:\n\nTo maximize the number of pairs with sum >= S, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, and pair them. Then, for each pair, check if a_i + b_j >= S. The number of such pairs would be the maximum possible. Because this is a classic greedy approach for maximizing the number of pairs with sum >= S.\n\nWait, for example, if you have a sorted in ascending order and b sorted in descending order. Then, pairing the smallest a with the largest b, next smallest a with next largest b, etc. This way, you maximize the chance that each pair is as large as possible.\n\nYes, this is a standard approach for problems where you want to maximize the number of pairs with sum >= a certain value.\n\nSo, for the worst case scenario, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible S that Vasya can have (>=x). Let's call this S_min. This is the minimal value such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >=x. However, since we can choose any pair for Vasya, the minimal possible S is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. But how to find that?\n\nWait, no. The minimal S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. So it's the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. Because we can choose that pair for Vasya. So for example, if there are pairs with sum 5, 6, 7, and x is 5, then the minimal possible S is 5.\n\nSo the first step is to find the minimal possible S that is >=x. How to find that? Well, we can generate all possible pairs (a_i, b_j), but that would be O(n^2), which is impossible for n=1e5. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the minimal S is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. How can we find that efficiently?\n\nBut perhaps the minimal S is x, if there exists a pair with sum exactly x. Otherwise, the minimal possible S is the minimal sum that is >=x. But how to find this.\n\nBut given that n is up to 1e5, we can't check all possible pairs. So we need a better approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For the worst case scenario, we can assume that S is the minimal possible value that is >=x. To find this minimal S, perhaps we can find the minimal sum s such that s >=x and there exists at least one a_i and one b_j such that a_i + b_j = s.\n\nBut how to find this s quickly.\n\nBut given that we need to find the minimal possible s >=x, perhaps we can find the minimal s such that there exists a_i and b_j with a_i + b_j >=x, and then take s as the minimal such sum.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, we can consider that Vasya's sum is the minimal possible s >=x. To find that s, we can proceed as follows:\n\nSort the a array and the b array. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal s is the minimal among all a_i + b_j found in this way.\n\nBut this approach may not work for all cases, but perhaps for the purpose of finding the minimal s, we can use this method.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think: sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order. For each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal s is the minimum of all such a_i + b_j.\n\nBut since the arrays are sorted, for each a_i, we can perform a binary search on b to find the minimal b_j that satisfies the condition. Then, the minimal s is the minimum of all these values.\n\nBut this would give us the minimal possible s that is >=x. Because for each a_i, we find the minimal b_j that when added to a_i gives a sum >=x. Then, taking the minimum of all those gives us the minimal possible sum s that is >=x.\n\nYes, this approach would work. However, note that there may be multiple pairs (a_i, b_j) that sum to s. But this method finds the minimal possible s.\n\nOnce we have this s, then the worst possible rank depends on how many pairs can be formed with sum >=s. Because the maximum number of such pairs is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s. Then, Vasya's rank would be at most that number. But how?\n\nWait, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with sum >=s, such that each a and b is used exactly once. So for the worst case scenario, we need to find this maximum number. Then, Vasya's rank is that number, because he is one of them. But since the jury can arrange the same sums in any order, the worst possible rank is that number.\n\nWait, no. Suppose that the maximum number of participants with sum >=s is m. Then, Vasya is one of them. So the worst possible rank is m. Because if all m participants have sum >=s, then Vasya's rank is at least 1 and at most m. But the worst possible is m.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible s >=x (call it s_min) that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j).\n\n2. Compute the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with sum >=s_min. Let's call this m.\n\n3. Then, the worst possible rank is m.\n\nBut how to compute step 2.\n\nAs I thought earlier, to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s, we can sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order, and pair them. Then, count how many pairs have sum >=s.\n\nThis is a standard greedy approach. Let's see.\n\nFor example, if a is sorted ascending, and b is sorted descending, then pairing the smallest a with the largest b, next smallest a with next largest b, etc. This way, we maximize the number of pairs with sum >=s.\n\nYes, this is the standard approach for the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s.\n\nSo, the algorithm for the worst case is:\n\n- Find s_min as the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\n- Sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order.\n\n- Pair a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], etc.\n\n- Count how many of these pairs have sum >=s_min. Let this be cnt.\n\n- Then, the worst possible rank is cnt.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the cnt includes Vasya's pair. So the worst possible rank is cnt.\n\nBut how to ensure that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s_min and the cnt pairs are possible.\n\nBut since s_min is the minimal possible sum, and we have chosen a pairing that maximizes the number of pairs with sum >=s_min, then yes, this cnt is the maximum possible number of participants with sum >=s_min. Hence, Vasya's rank can be as bad as cnt.\n\nBut how to find s_min.\n\nLet me think about how to find s_min.\n\nAs discussed earlier, we can sort a and b, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then take the minimum of all such a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in ascending order.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   find the smallest index j in b such that a_i + b[j] >=x. This can be done via binary search.\n\n   if such j exists, then record a_i + b[j].\n\nThen, the minimal s_min is the minimum of all such recorded values.\n\nBut this would give the minimal possible sum that is >=x.\n\nBut what if there are multiple a_i and b_j that sum to the same value?\n\nYes, but the minimal is the smallest possible.\n\nBut how to handle the case when there are multiple possibilities.\n\nYes, this approach would work.\n\nOnce we have s_min, then proceed as described.\n\nBut let's test this with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=5, x=2\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nFor each a_i (all 1), find the minimal b_j such that 1 + b_j >=2. Since b_j is 1, 1+1=2 >=2. So for each a_i, the minimal sum is 2. So s_min is 2.\n\nThen, to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >=2. Since all pairs sum to 2, the maximum is 5. So the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond input:\n\nn=6, x=7\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nLet me compute s_min.\n\nSort a in ascending order: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nSort b in ascending order: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\nFor each a_i in sorted a:\n\nFind the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=7.\n\nFor a_i=3:\n\nWe need b_j >=4. Because 3 +4=7. Looking in sorted b, the first b_j >=4 is 4 (index 2). So 3+4=7.\n\nFor a_i=4:\n\nNeed b_j >=3. Because 4+3=7. The first b_j >=3 is 3 (index 1). So 4+3=7.\n\nFor a_i=4 again, same as above.\n\nSame for other 4s.\n\nFor a_i=5: need b_j >=2. 5+2=7. But the first b_j >=2 is 3 (index 1). 5+3=8 >=7.\n\nFor a_i=6: need b_j >=1. The first is 0, but 6+0=6 <7. Next is 3. 6+3=9 >=7.\n\nSo the minimal s_min is 7 (from 3+4, 4+3, etc).\n\nThen, to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >=7.\n\nSort a in ascending order: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nSort b in descending order: [8,6,4,4,3,0]\n\nPair them:\n\n3 + 8 = 11 >=7 → yes.\n\n4 +6 =10 → yes.\n\n4 +4 =8 → yes.\n\n4 +4=8 → yes.\n\n5 +3=8 → yes.\n\n6 +0=6 <7 → no.\n\nSo total of 5 pairs. So the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach works for the sample.\n\nSo now, the plan is:\n\nFor the best rank: always 1.\n\nFor the worst rank:\n\n- Find s_min (the minimal sum >=x that can be achieved by some pair a_i + b_j).\n\n- Then, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s_min. This is done by sorting a in ascending order, b in descending order, and pairing them. Count how many pairs have sum >=s_min.\n\nBut how to compute s_min.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the following:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list a and list b.\n\nCompute s_min.\n\nTo compute s_min:\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize s_min to a very high value.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   find the smallest index j in b such that a_i + b[j] >=x.\n\n   if such j exists, then current_sum = a_i + b[j]. Update s_min as min(s_min, current_sum).\n\nIf no such j exists for any a_i, but the problem says that there is at least one pair, so this can't happen.\n\nOnce s_min is found, then:\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in descending order.\n\nPair them, and count the number of pairs where a[i] + b[i] >= s_min.\n\nThat count is the worst rank.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, after sorting a ascending and b descending, the pairs are (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1). All sums are 2, which is s_min. So count is 5, which is the worst rank.\n\nIn the second sample, the count is 5, which is the worst rank.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut how to handle the binary search for finding the minimal j for each a_i.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nFor each a_i in sorted a (ascending), we need to find the minimal b_j (in sorted b) such that a_i + b_j >=x. Since b is sorted in ascending order, we can perform a binary search for the minimal value of b_j that is >= (x - a_i).\n\nFor example, for a_i, target is (x - a_i). Find the first element in b that is >= target. If such element exists, then the minimal sum is a_i + b_j.\n\nSo the code for this part would be:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nsorted_b = sorted(b)\n\ns_min = infinity\n\nfor ai in sorted_a:\n\n    target = x - ai\n\n    # find the first index j in sorted_b where sorted_b[j] >= target\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = len(sorted_b) - 1\n\n    res = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if sorted_b[mid] >= target:\n\n            res = mid\n\n            high = mid - 1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    if res != -1:\n\n        current_sum = ai + sorted_b[res]\n\n        if current_sum < s_min:\n\n            s_min = current_sum\n\nSo after this loop, s_min is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nOnce we have s_min, then proceed to sort a in ascending, sort b in descending, and count the number of pairs with sum >=s_min.\n\nBut how to sort b in descending order? Well, sorted_b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True).\n\nThen, for i in 0 to n-1:\n\nsum = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted_desc[i]\n\nif sum >= s_min: count +=1\n\nSo the count is the worst possible rank.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the count is 5. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there are multiple ways to pair the a and b to get more pairs with sum >=s_min?\n\nBut the greedy approach of pairing a_sorted ascending with b_sorted descending is known to give the maximum possible number of pairs with sum >=s.\n\nThus, this approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, the binary search for each a_i would be O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut also note that in the case where multiple pairs can be chosen",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total score from two tours. The solution involves efficiently calculating these ranks using sorting and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Rank Calculation**: The best possible rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. This is because we can always pair Vasya's scores such that his total is the maximum possible, ensuring he is at the top regardless of other participants' scores.\n\n2. **Worst Rank Calculation**:\n   - **Determine Minimum Possible Score (s_min)**: Find the smallest score Vasya can have that is at least the given minimum score `x`. This is done by sorting both the first and second tour scores, and for each score in the first tour, find the smallest score in the second tour that when summed with it meets or exceeds `x`.\n   - **Maximize Participants with Higher Scores**: After determining `s_min`, sort the first tour scores in ascending order and the second tour scores in descending order. Pairing them in this manner allows us to count how many participants can have scores greater than or equal to `s_min`, which gives the worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n, x = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n    \n    # Compute s_min\n    sorted_a = sorted(a)\n    sorted_b = sorted(b)\n    s_min = float('inf')\n    \n    for ai in sorted_a:\n        target = x - ai\n        # Find the first index in sorted_b where value >= target\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_b, target)\n        if idx < len(sorted_b):\n            current_sum = ai + sorted_b[idx]\n            if current_sum < s_min:\n                s_min = current_sum\n    \n    # Now compute the worst rank\n    # Sort a ascending, b descending\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    \n    count = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted_desc[i] >= s_min:\n            count += 1\n    \n    print(\"1\", count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the scores from the two tours.\n- **Finding Minimum Possible Score (s_min)**: By sorting the scores and using binary search, we efficiently determine the smallest score Vasya can have that meets or exceeds `x`.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: By sorting one array in ascending order and the other in descending order, we use a greedy approach to maximize the number of participants who can have scores greater than or equal to `s_min`, thus determining the worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute both the best and worst possible ranks using sorting and binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large inputs.",
