Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance d from their position. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this problem. The key idea is probably to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the radius needs to cover half of that gap (since each lantern can cover up to d on either side). But also, we have to consider the ends of the street. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive differences can't be calculated properly. For example, if the lanterns are at positions 5 and 3, then the gap between them is 2, but if they are sorted as 3 and 5, the gap is 2. So sorting is necessary.\n\n2. After sorting, check the first lantern. The distance from 0 to the first lantern's position. The required d must be at least that distance. Because otherwise, the area before the first lantern isn't covered.\n\n3. Similarly, check the last lantern. The distance from the last lantern to l. Again, d must be at least that.\n\n4. Then, for all consecutive pairs in the sorted list, compute the distance between them. For each such pair, the maximum gap between them is (current - previous). The required d for this gap is (gap)/2. Because each lantern can cover up to d on either side. So if two lanterns are s apart, the maximum distance between them that can be covered is s/2. For example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then each covers 2 units towards each other, so the entire gap is covered.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b). The maximum distance between them is b - a. The middle point between them is at (a + b)/2. The distance from a to that middle point is (b - a)/2. So if the radius is (b - a)/2, then both lanterns will cover up to that middle point. But if the gap is larger than that, then there's a point in between that isn't covered. So the required d for this gap is (gap)/2. So the maximum of all these (gap/2) values would be the required d.\n\nBut wait, the maximum of all these gaps divided by two, and also the first and last distances. So the overall answer is the maximum between the first distance, the last distance, and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance (first lantern's position - 0).\n- Compute the final distance (l - last lantern's position).\n- For each consecutive pair in the sorted array, compute the difference, divide by two, and track the maximum.\n- The answer is the maximum between the initial distance, the final distance, and the maximum of the consecutive gaps divided by two.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? Like, n=1. Then the initial distance is a[0], the final distance is l - a[0]. And since there are no consecutive pairs, the max gap is zero. So the answer is the maximum of those two.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lanterns are at positions 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nThe initial distance is 0 - 0 = 0. The final distance is 15 -15 =0. Then the consecutive gaps are 3-0=3, 5-3=2, 7-5=2, 9-7=2, 14-9=5, 15-14=1. The maximum gap is 5. Divided by two gives 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5]. Initial distance is 2-0=2. Final distance is 5-5=0. The consecutive gap is 5-2=3. Divided by two is 1.5. The maximum between 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: if n=1, l=10, lantern at 5. Then initial distance is 5, final is 5. The max is 5. So d is 5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 0 and 10. The initial distance is 0, final is 0. The gap between them is 10, divided by two is 5. So d is 5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 0 and 3. Then initial is 0, final is 7. The max between 7 and (3-0)/2=1.5. So answer is 7.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, coding steps in Python:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them.\n\nCompute the initial distance: a[0] - 0. Wait, no: the first lantern's position is a[0], but the initial distance is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. So if the first lantern is at position a[0], then the distance is a[0] - 0. But wait, if the lantern is at 0, then the distance is zero. So that's correct.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 3. So the radius must be at least 3 to cover the 0 point. Because the lantern's coverage is from 3 -d to 3 +d. So for 0 to be covered, 3 -d <=0 => d >=3. So yes, the initial distance is a[0], but if the first lantern is at 0, then that distance is 0. So the initial distance is a[0] - 0? No, it's the distance between 0 and the first lantern. Which is a[0] - 0. Because the lantern is at a[0], which is >=0. So yes.\n\nSimilarly for the last lantern. The distance between the last lantern and l is l - a[-1].\n\nSo the steps:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute initial = a[0]\n\nfinal = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n   gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   if gap > max_gap:\n\n       max_gap = gap\n\nthen, the required d is the maximum between initial, final, and max_gap / 2.\n\nWait, but for the initial and final, maybe the initial is the distance from 0 to first lantern. So initial is a[0] - 0. But if the first lantern is at 0, then initial is zero. Similarly for final.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code:\n\nOnce the array is sorted, compute:\n\nmax_d = 0\n\nif n == 0: but n is at least 1 according to input constraints (n >=1).\n\nSo for n >=1:\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1], (max_gap)/2 )\n\nBut wait, for example, if the first lantern is at 0, then a[0] is 0, so initial is zero. So the maximum between that and others.\n\nSo code:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\ninitial = sorted_a[0]\n\nfinal = l - sorted_a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\ncurrent_max = max(initial, final, max_gap / 2)\n\nThen, output current_max.\n\nBut wait, what if the max_gap is zero? Like when all lanterns are same position. For example, n=3, l=5, all lanterns at 2. Then sorted_a is [2,2,2]. initial is 2, final is 5-2=3. max_gap is 0. So the max between 2, 3, 0/2=0. So answer is 3.\n\nWhich is correct. Because the lanterns are at 2, so the coverage needs to reach from 0 to 5. The radius must be 2 (to cover 0) and 3 (to cover 5). So the answer is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=2, l=5, lanterns at 0 and 5. Then initial is 0, final is 0. max_gap is 5-0=5. So max between 0,0,5/2=2.5. Answer is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nIn Python, the input is read from stdin. The first line contains two integers n and l. The second line contains n integers.\n\nBut in the example input given, the first input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo for each test case, it's two lines. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen another test case:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo the code needs to read multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The sample input shows two examples. But the actual input for the problem is one test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement. So the code needs to read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps that's part of the way the sample is presented. For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the sample input has multiple test cases. But the actual problem may have only one test case per run.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input may have multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is two separate test cases, and the code needs to process them. But the problem's input description says that the first line is n and l, then the next line is the ai's. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases. For example, the user may have provided two test cases. But the actual code needs to read from standard input, which may have multiple test cases. However, the problem statement does not mention that. So perhaps the problem is that the user has given two examples, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. But how to know?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's input and output sections. The input says that the first line contains n and l. The next line contains the ai's. So the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. That's confusing. But perhaps the sample input is given in a way that the first line is the first test case, then the second line is the second test case. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nand the second test case is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo the code should read multiple test cases. But how many? How to know?\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample output, which is two outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description doesn't mention that. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement. The problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process a single test case. But then, how to explain the sample input and output?\n\nAh, perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But that's conflicting with the sample input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written with multiple test cases. But the problem's input description does not mention that. That's possible. But how to handle that?\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as two lines. The first line is \"7 15\", then the next line is the list of numbers. Then another line \"2 5\" and the next line is the list. So the code is supposed to read two test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut in the problem's original statement, the input is given as per the first line. So maybe the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to read one. But that's not possible.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's original statement. The sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich is perhaps a way to represent two test cases. So the code should read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem's input description is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nand the second test case is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, but the problem's input description is not clear.\n\nBut looking at the problem's output section, the sample output is given as two outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all test cases from the input. But how to know how many test cases there are?\n\nIn programming competitions, sometimes the input is given with multiple test cases. But the problem's input description may not mention that. However, in this problem, the sample input has two test cases. Therefore, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to do that in Python? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes the code is supposed to read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases. So the code can read all lines at once and process them.\n\nBut in this case, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line is n and l, the second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code needs to read all test cases. For example, in the sample input, there are two test cases. Each test case is two lines.\n\nSo the code should process each test case as follows:\n\nRead the first line as n and l.\n\nRead the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nProcess and output the result.\n\nBut how to read all test cases? Well, in Python, the standard way is to read all lines from stdin, split them into tokens, and process accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps the code can read lines until there's no more input.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But that would not match the sample input. So perhaps the problem's sample input is a mistake, or perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original note, the sample input is given as two test cases, but the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, but the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first test case's output is 2.5, and the second is 2.0. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nWell, perhaps the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into tokens, and process each test case as follows:\n\nRead the first two integers as n and l.\n\nThen read the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nBut how to handle multiple test cases? For example, the input could be:\n\nn l\n\na1 a2 ... an\n\nn l\n\na1 a2 ... an\n\netc.\n\nSo the code can read all the input, split into tokens, and process them accordingly.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can read all input as a list of tokens.\n\nFor example:\n\nimport sys\n\ndata = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\nThen, process the data as follows:\n\nindex = 0\n\nwhile index < len(data):\n\n    n = data[index]\n\n    l = data[index+1]\n\n    index +=2\n\n    a = data[index:index +n]\n\n    index +=n\n\n    # process this test case\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich would be parsed as:\n\nn=7, l=15, and a = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]\n\nThen the next test case is 2 5, and a = [2,5].\n\nSo this approach would work.\n\nBut the problem's input may have multiple test cases. So the code must handle that.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle only one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. However, in programming competitions, the code is supposed to process all test cases given in the input. So the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should be written to process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all data as a list of integers.\n\nProcess each test case by taking n and l, then the next n integers as a_i.\n\nFor each test case, compute the required d, and output with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, now, putting this into code.\n\nBut for the problem's sample input, the code would generate two outputs.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the data as a list of integers.\n\nThen, process each test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nSort the a_i list.\n\nCompute initial = a[0], final = l - a[-1].\n\nCompute max_gap between consecutive elements.\n\nThen compute the maximum between initial, final, max_gap / 2.\n\nThen output that value with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(data):\n\n        n = data[idx]\n\n        l = data[idx + 1]\n\n        idx +=2\n\n        a = data[idx:idx +n]\n\n        idx +=n\n\n        # process\n\n        a_sorted = sorted(a)\n\n        initial = a_sorted[0]\n\n        final = l - a_sorted[-1]\n\n        max_gap = 0\n\n        for i in range(1, n):\n\n            gap = a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[i-1]\n\n            if gap > max_gap:\n\n                max_gap = gap\n\n        d = max(initial, final, max_gap / 2)\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nBut wait, what about the case where n=0? But the problem says 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. So n is at least 1.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=7, l=15, a = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]\n\nsorted a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\ninitial is 0, final is 15-15=0.\n\nmax_gap is between 9 and 14 (difference 5). So max_gap is 5. d = max(0, 0, 5/2=2.5) → 2.5.\n\nSample output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample test case 2:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. sorted is [2,5]. initial is 2, final is 5-5=0. max_gap is 5-2=3. max is max(2, 0, 3/2=1.5) → 2. So output is 2.0000000000. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo code works for samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. initial is 5, final is 5. max_gap is 0. So d is max(5,5,0) →5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. initial is 0, final is 0. max_gap is 10. So d is 10/2=5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,3]. initial is 0, final is 7. max_gap is 3. So d is max(0,7, 1.5) →7.0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, the code must print the output with exactly 10 decimal digits, even if it's an integer. For example, 2.0 becomes 2.0000000000.\n\nIn Python, the format string \"{0:.10f}\" will do that.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first output is 2.5, which is printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code must read from stdin, and write to stdout. So the code must be written as a Python script.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n\nBut also, note that for the case where the max_gap is zero (all lanterns are same position), then the max_gap/2 is zero. But the initial and final may be larger. So the code handles that.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase 1: All lanterns are at 0. For example, n=3, l=5, a=[0,0,0]. Then sorted a is [0,0,0]. initial is 0, final is 5-0=5. max_gap is 0. So d is max(0,5, 0) →5.0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and l. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then initial is 0, final is 0. max_gap is 10. So d is 5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and l/2. Then the max_gap is l/2. So the max_gap/2 is l/4. But the final distance is l - l/2 = l/2. Which is bigger than l/4. So the answer is l/2.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can illuminate a distance `d` from its position. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to facilitate calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial and Final Distances**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Maximum Gap Between Consecutive Lanterns**: Determine the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns after sorting. The radius required to cover this gap is half the size of the gap.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius required is the maximum value among the initial distance, the final distance, and half of the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(data):\n        n = data[idx]\n        l = data[idx + 1]\n        idx += 2\n        a = data[idx:idx + n]\n        idx += n\n        \n        a_sorted = sorted(a)\n        initial = a_sorted[0]\n        final = l - a_sorted[-1]\n        max_gap = 0\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a_sorted[i] - a_sorted[i-1]\n            if gap > max_gap:\n                max_gap = gap\n        \n        d = max(initial, final, max_gap / 2)\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into a list of integers for easier processing.\n2. **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial and Final Distances**: These are calculated to ensure that the ends of the street are covered by the lanterns' illumination range.\n4. **Maximum Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted list of lantern positions, we determine the largest gap between any two consecutive lanterns. The radius needed to cover this gap is half the gap's size.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result for each test case is the maximum of the initial distance, the final distance, and half the maximum gap, ensuring the entire street is illuminated with the minimum radius.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including scenarios where lanterns are placed at the ends of the street or when multiple lanterns are positioned at the same location. The solution ensures precision up to 10 decimal places as required.",
