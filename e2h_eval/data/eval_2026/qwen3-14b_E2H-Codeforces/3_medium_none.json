Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. So the problem is to determine the smallest d where every point from 0 to l is within distance d of some lantern.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key idea is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns and find the maximum gap. Because the worst case for coverage would be in the middle of a gap between two lanterns. For example, if two lanterns are placed at positions a and b (with a < b), then the maximum distance from any point between them to the nearest lantern would be (b - a)/2. But wait, that's only if the lanterns are equally spaced. But if there's a gap between two consecutive lanterns, the required d for that gap is half of the gap's size. However, there's also the edge cases: the first lantern might not be at 0, so the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position, and similarly the last lantern might not be at l, so the distance from the last lantern to l. Those would need to be considered as well.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive ones can't be determined. For example, if the lanterns are at positions 5, 3, 7, then after sorting they are 3,5,7. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns are 2 and 2. The max gap is 2, so d would be 1.0. But also check the first and last positions.\n\nWait, but the street starts at 0 and ends at l. So the first lantern's position is a1 (after sorting). The distance from 0 to a1 is a1 - 0. But the lantern's light covers up to d from it. So for the left end, the required d is a1 - 0. Similarly for the right end, it's l - an. But wait, no. Because the lantern's light covers a distance of d. So if the first lantern is at a1, then the leftmost part of the street (0) needs to be covered. The distance between 0 and a1 is a1. So if the lantern's radius is d, then 0 must be within d of a1. So d must be at least a1. Similarly, the right end is l - an. So the maximum between those two and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial maximum d as the maximum between the first lantern's position (since 0 needs to be covered) and (l - last lantern's position).\n- Then, iterate through consecutive lanterns and compute the gaps between them. For each gap, the required d is (gap)/2. Find the maximum of these values.\n- The overall answer is the maximum between the initial max and the maximum gap/2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for the first part, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the area from 0 to a1 must be covered. The lantern's light can reach up to a1 - d. Wait, no. Wait, the lantern's light covers from ai -d to ai +d. So for the left end (0) to be covered, 0 must be >= ai -d. So d must be >= ai - 0. Because the lantern's left coverage is ai -d. So for 0 to be covered, ai -d <= 0 => d >= ai -0. But since ai is the first lantern's position, which is the earliest, then the distance from 0 to ai is ai. So the required d must be at least ai. Similarly for the end.\n\nWait, for example, if the first lantern is at position 3. Then the left end (0) is 3 units away. So the lantern's radius must be at least 3, otherwise the left end is not covered. Because the lantern's light extends from 3 -d to 3 +d. For 0 to be in that interval, 3 -d <=0 => d >=3. So yes, the required d for the left end is the first lantern's position. Similarly for the right end, the required d is l - last lantern's position.\n\nBut then, between two consecutive lanterns, say at positions a and b (a < b), the maximum distance between them is (b -a). The worst case is the middle of the gap. So the required d for that gap is (b -a)/2. Because the middle point is at (a +b)/2. The distance from a to that point is (b -a)/2. So the d must be at least that.\n\nSo the overall steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2\n\nif current_required > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nAt the end, return max_d.\n\nYes. That seems correct.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 15, and the lanterns are at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, the positions are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. So the first lantern is 0. So the left end is 0, which is covered. The right end is l - 15 = 15 -15 = 0. So the initial max_d is max(0, 0) = 0.\n\nNow check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3 -0 =3 → required 1.5.\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. So the overall max_d is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5, lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5].\n\nLeft end is 2 -0 =2. Right end is 5 -5 =0. Initial max_d is 2.\n\nThen the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, required 1.5. So the max_d is max(2, 1.5) = 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: if the lanterns are at 0 and l. Then the gaps between them is l. So required is l/2. But the left and right ends are 0 and l - l =0. So the max is l/2.\n\nAnother case: if there is only one lantern. For example, n=1, l=10, and the lantern is at 5. Then the initial max is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. Then no gaps between other lanterns. So the answer is 5. Which is correct because the lantern covers from 0 to 10 (since 5 -5 =0, 5+5=10).\n\nAnother case: n=1, lantern at 0. Then the left end is 0, and the right end is l -0 = l. So the answer is l. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 3 and 7. Then the initial max is max(3, 10-7=3) →3. The gap between 3 and7 is 4, required 2. So the max is 3. So answer is 3. Because the left end is 3 units away from the first lantern, and the right end is 3 units away from the second. The gap between them requires 2, which is less than 3. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through the sorted list, for each consecutive pair, compute the difference, divide by 2, and compare to max_d.\n\nFinally, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple lanterns at the same position? For example, two lanterns at position 0. Then the gap between them is zero, so (0)/2 =0, which doesn't affect the max_d. So that's handled correctly.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\nCase 1: n=1, l=0. Wait, but according to the input constraints, l is at least 1. So no. So l is ≥1.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then the max_d is max(0, 1-0=1) →1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[1]. Then max_d is max(1, 0) →1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then initial max is max(0, 0) →0. The gap between 0 and5 is 5 → required 2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nSo code should handle that.\n\nNow, in Python, the code steps:\n\nRead input. The first line is n and l. The next line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. The example shows two inputs, but perhaps the actual problem is that the user will input one case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement's input description: the first line contains two integers n and l. Then the next line contains n integers. So the code should read one test case. But the example shows two inputs, perhaps because it's two separate test cases. But the problem says, the code should read from stdin and output the answer. So the code should process one test case per run.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples, but the actual code is supposed to read from standard input. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich is one test case. The second example input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo the code should read one test case. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo in Python, the code can read the input as follows:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and l.\n\nThen read the second line, split into list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading from stdin, there may be multiple lines. But for the problem, the code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\nThen compute the initial max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? No, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nSo code:\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the a after sorting is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. So the first element is 0, and the last is 15. So l - a[-1] is 15-15=0. So the initial max_d is max(0, 0) =0. Then the gaps between the elements are 3, 2, 2, 2, 5, 1. The maximum of (gap/2) is 5/2=2.5. Which becomes the max_d. So output 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input.\n\nn=2, l=5. a = [2,5]. sorted is [2,5]. initial max is max(2, 5-5=0) →2. Then the gap is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So max_d remains 2. So output is 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about if the lanterns are not sorted? Like in the first example, the input is 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are ordered correctly.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the lanterns are not covering the entire street? For example, if there's a gap between two lanterns that is larger than the initial max_d.\n\nFor example, n=2, l=10. Lanterns at 1 and 3. Then the initial max_d is max(1, 10-3=7) →7. The gap between 1 and 3 is 2, so 1.0. So the answer is 7. Which is correct, because the right end is 7 units away from the last lantern. So the required d is 7.\n\nAnother example: n=3, l=10. Lanterns at 1, 5, 9. Then initial max is max(1, 10-9=1). The gaps between 1 and5 is 4 → 2. Between 5 and9 is 4 →2. So the max_d is 2. Which is correct. Because the middle of the street is covered by the 5 lantern. But the ends are 1 unit away. So the required d is 2.\n\nBut if the lanterns are at 0 and 5, and l=10. Then initial max is max(0, 10-5=5). The gap between 0 and5 is 5 → 2.5. So the max is 5. Which is correct because the right end is 5 units away from the lantern at 5. So d needs to be 5. The gap between 0 and5 would require 2.5, but the right end requires 5.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to print the answer with 10 decimal digits, even if it's an integer. For example, in the second sample, output is 2.0000000000.\n\nIn Python, formatting with .10f will do that.\n\nBut what about when the maximum is something like 2.5, which is exactly representable as a float? Well, Python's floating point numbers can have precision issues, but the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9. So using floating point calculations should be sufficient.\n\nBut in Python, when you do divisions, you get floats. So the code should be okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial max_d.\n\nThen loop through consecutive elements.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if the list a has only one element?\n\nFor example, n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then a[0] is 3, l - a[-1] is 5-3=2. So max_d is max(3, 2) =3. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=3, a=[0]. Then max_d is max(0, 3-0=3) →3. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=3, a=[3]. Then max_d is max(3, 0) →3. Correct.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d starts as max(0, 15-15=0) →0.\n\nThen the gaps:\n\n3-0=3 →1.5 →0.5? No, current is 3/2=1.5. Which is bigger than 0. So max_d becomes 1.5.\n\nNext gap 5-3=2 →1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 →1.0 → no.\n\nThen 9-7=2 →1.0.\n\nThen 14-9=5 →2.5 → which is bigger than 1.5. So max_d is 2.5.\n\nThen 15-14=1 →0.5 → no change.\n\nSo the output is 2.5 → printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) →2.\n\nThen the gap between 5-2=3 → 1.5. Which is less than 2. So the max_d remains 2. Output 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code works for samples.\n\nWhat about when the lanterns are at 0 and l?\n\nLike n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then initial max is max(0, 10-10=0) →0. The gap is 10, so 5. So the answer is 5.0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then initial max is max(0, 0) →0. The gaps are 5 and 5. Each gives 2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. Then initial max is max(0, 0) →0. The gaps are 3 (0 to 3) →1.5, then 7 (3 to 10) →3.5. So the max_d is 3.5. Which is correct. Because the middle of the gap between 3 and 10 is at 3 + 3.5 = 6.5. The distance from 3 is 3.5, so d must be at least that. The right end is 10-10=0. So the answer is 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length $ l $. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each lantern can illuminate a segment of the street within a distance $ d $ from its position. Our task is to find the smallest $ d $ such that the entire street is covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to easily analyze the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius $ d $.\n3. **Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum radius required to cover this gap is half the size of the gap, as the worst-case point in the middle of the gap would be equidistant from both lanterns.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius $ d $ is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the edges and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers $ n $ (number of lanterns) and $ l $ (length of the street), followed by a list of $ n $ integers representing the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Edge Distances Calculation**: The initial maximum radius $ d $ is determined by considering the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Gap Analysis**: By iterating through the sorted list of lantern positions, we calculate the gap between each pair of consecutive lanterns. The required radius for each gap is half the gap size, which is compared against the current maximum radius.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that all parts of the street are covered by the minimum possible radius $ d $, efficiently handling both edge cases and gaps between lanterns.",
