    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and see if they appear at least twice. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, that might be feasible, but I need to make it efficient enough.\n\nLet me think: the maximum possible length of such a substring is floor(n/2), maybe? Like, for a string of length 5, the maximum possible is 2 (like in 'aaaaa' where 'aa' appears multiple times). Wait, no. For example, 'ababa' has length 5, and the substring 'aba' is length 3. So the maximum possible is up to n-1, but only if there's a duplicate. But how to find that.\n\nSo the idea is to check for all possible substring lengths, starting from the maximum possible down to 1, and see if there's any substring of that length that appears at least twice. Once we find the maximum such length, we can return it.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths from the maximum possible (which is len(s) - 1) down to 1.\n2. For each length L, check all possible substrings of length L in the string. For each substring, check if it appears at least two times.\n3. If any such substring exists for a particular L, return L as the answer.\n4. If no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nBut how to efficiently check if a substring appears at least twice?\n\nFor each L, generate all substrings of length L, and track their occurrences. For example, for each substring, store the starting index. Then, if any substring has at least two different starting indices, then it's valid.\n\nBut since the problem allows overlapping occurrences, even if two occurrences start at positions i and j, as long as they are different, it's okay.\n\nSo for example, in 'ababa', for L=3, the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (positions 1-3), 'aba' (positions 2-4). So the substring 'aba' occurs at positions 0 and 2. So that's two occurrences.\n\nSo for each L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each possible L from max_len down to 1:\n\n   create a set or a dictionary to track the substrings we have seen so far.\n\n   for each starting index i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substring is already in the set, then return L as the answer.\n\n       else add it to the set.\n\n   after checking all substrings for this L, if none found, proceed to L-1.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, nothing is found, return 0.\n\nWait, but this approach may miss some cases where a substring occurs more than once but not in consecutive positions. But the way of checking for duplicates in the set would capture that. Because for each substring, if it's seen again, then we can immediately return L as the answer.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the same substring occurs three times, then when we check the first occurrence, we add it to the set. Then, when we check the second occurrence, it's already in the set, so we return L. So that's correct.\n\nBut for the case where a substring occurs exactly twice, but not overlapping. Like in 'aaaaa', for L=2, the substrings are 'aa' (positions 0,1,2,3). So for each i, the substring is 'aa'. So when we check i=0, add to set. Then i=1, check, and find it's already present. So return 2.\n\nYes. So this approach would work.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this.\n\nThe steps for the code would be:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCompute the maximum possible length, which is len(s) - 1. Because for a substring to appear at least twice, the minimal possible length is 1, but for example, for a string of length 2, the maximum possible is 1 (if both characters are same).\n\nBut for example, if the string is 'aa', then the maximum is 1, since the substring 'a' appears twice.\n\nSo the loop would start from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nFor each L in that range:\n\n   create a set.\n\n   iterate i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in the set: return L\n\n       else add to the set.\n\nIf after checking all L's, nothing found, return 0.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample input 'zzz' (length 3). Let's see:\n\nPossible L is 2, then 1.\n\nFor L=2:\n\nsubstrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). So when i=0, add to set. Then i=1, check and find it's in the set. So return 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is 'ababa' (length 5). Let's see:\n\nCheck L=4 first. For L=4, the substrings are:\n\ni=0: abab\n\ni=1: baba\n\ni=2: abab (but for L=4, len(s) is 5, so i can be 0,1. So for L=4, the possible i's are 0 and 1. So for L=4, the substrings are abab and baba. No duplicates. So move to L=3.\n\nFor L=3:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 2 (since 5-3=2).\n\ni=0: aba\n\ni=1: bab\n\ni=2: aba\n\nSo when i=0, add 'aba' to the set. Then i=2, check and find 'aba' is already present. So return 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, what about the first sample input, which is 'abcd'? The output is 0.\n\nBecause for L=3, the substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. For L=2, 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. For L=1, 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. All of these substrings occur once. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the code would return 0.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nIn Python, the code would read the input string. Let's say the input is read via input().strip().\n\nThen, the code would loop L from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nFor each L, check all substrings of length L, and see if any duplicates.\n\nOnce found, return L.\n\nElse, after all L's, return 0.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as a list? Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nOutput: ['0', '3', '2']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is a string. Oh, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases. But in reality, the actual input is a single string. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. So the input is a single string, not a list. But the sample input shows a list. That's probably a mistake in the problem description. For example, the sample input shows ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] as input, but perhaps that's a way to represent multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the actual input is a single string, and the sample input is written as a list for illustrative purposes.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nSo the input is a single string. So the sample input is perhaps a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one string.\n\nBut the sample output shows that for the input 'abcd', the output is '0'; for 'ababa', output is '3'; for 'zzz', output is '2'.\n\nTherefore, the code must read a single string from input, and output the required value.\n\nSo the code will read the input as a single string. So for example, in the sample input, perhaps the user inputs 'ababa' and the output is 3.\n\nSo the code should read the input as s = input().strip()\n\nNow, the code:\n\ndef main():\n\n    s = input().strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                return\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    print(0)\n\nBut wait, let's test this code for the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' (n=4). The loop starts with L=3.\n\nFor L=3, the substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. Both are unique. Then L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique. Then L=1: all characters. Each occurs once. So returns 0. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' (n=5). L starts at 4. For L=4, substrings are 'abab' (i=0), 'baba' (i=1). No duplicates. Then L=3. i ranges from 0 to 2. i=0: 'aba' added. i=1: 'bab' added. i=2: 'aba' which is in the set. So returns 3. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' (n=3). L starts at 2. For L=2, substrings are 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). The second occurrence is found, returns 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' (n=5). For L=4, substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0) and 'aaaa' (i=1). So returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaabaaa' (n=7). Let's see. For L=4: check substrings. The first occurrence of 'aaaa' is at i=0? Let's see:\n\ns = 'aaabaaa'\n\nsubstrings of length 4:\n\ni=0: 'aaab'\n\ni=1: 'aab a' ?\n\nWait, the string is a a a b a a a.\n\nSo for L=4:\n\ni=0: a a a b â†’ 'aaab'\n\ni=1: a a b a â†’ 'aaba'\n\ni=2: a b a a â†’ 'abaa'\n\ni=3: b a a a â†’ 'baaa'\n\nNo duplicates here. Then L=3:\n\nCheck substrings of length 3.\n\ni=0: 'aaa'\n\ni=1: 'aab'\n\ni=2: 'aba'\n\ni=3: 'baa'\n\ni=4: 'aaa'\n\nSo when i=0, add 'aaa' to the set. Then when i=4, check 'aaa' which is in the set. So returns 3. But there's also longer substrings. Wait, but for L=4, there was no duplicates. So the answer would be 3.\n\nBut in this case, the substring 'aaa' occurs at positions 0-2 and 4-6. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, edge cases: what if the string is of length 1? Then len(s) is 1, so the loop runs from 0 down to 1, but the for loop is range(0, 0, -1) which doesn't run. So returns 0. Which is correct, since a single character can't have a substring that occurs twice.\n\nAnother case: 'aa' (length 2). L starts at 1. For L=1, the substrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). So returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' (length 6). Let's see. The maximum L is 5. For L=5, substrings are 'aabba' (i=0) and 'abbaa' (i=1). No duplicates. Then L=4: substrings are 'aabb', 'abba', 'bbaa'. No duplicates. Then L=3: check substrings. 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa'. No duplicates. Then L=2: check substrings. 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. So when i=0, 'aa' is added. Then i=4, 'aa' is found again. So returns 2. But there's also the substring 'aa' which occurs at positions 0-1, 4-5. But what about longer substrings? Like 'aab' occurs once, but maybe 'aa' is the longest. But what about 'aabbaa' has 'aa' as a substring twice, but also 'aab' occurs once. So the code returns 2. But what about 'aabbaa' has 'aab' and 'baa' etc. But in this case, the maximum is 2. But perhaps there's a longer substring. Let's see: for L=3, the substrings are:\n\ni=0: 'aab'\n\ni=1: 'abb'\n\ni=2: 'bba'\n\ni=3: 'baa'\n\nSo no duplicates. For L=4, the substrings are:\n\ni=0: 'aabb'\n\ni=1: 'abba'\n\ni=2: 'bbaa'\n\nNo duplicates. So the code returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'ababab' (length 6). For L=3, the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba', 'bab'. So for L=3, during the loop, when i=0, 'aba' is added. Then i=2, 'aba' is found again. So returns 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as a list? Wait, no. The problem says that the input is a string. The sample input shows something else, but perhaps that's a mistake. For example, in the sample input, the input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but perhaps that's just a way to show multiple test cases. However, in reality, the code should read a single string. For example, the user would input a single string, like 'ababa'.\n\nSo the code should read the input as s = input().strip()\n\nBut perhaps the problem is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code needs to process a single string. So the code is written to process one string.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead the input string, then process as per the algorithm above.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut in Python, using exit() may not be the best practice, but for code submission, it's acceptable. Alternatively, after finding the answer, return.\n\nBut in code submission, the code must print the answer and exit. So the code can be written as:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut wait, in Python, the exit() function may not be allowed in some environments. Alternatively, we can use a flag.\n\nBut for code submission, using sys.exit() is better. Or perhaps, after finding the answer, break out of loops and print.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\ndef main():\n\n    s = input().strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                return\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    print(0)\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nBut the code must be written as a script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    s = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                return\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut perhaps the input is read as input().strip() instead of sys.stdin.read().strip(). For example, if the input is read via input(), but in some cases, when the input is provided with multiple lines, but according to the problem statement, the input is a single line.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\n...\n\nBut for code submission, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but that's probably a mistake. For example, the sample input shows ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but the actual input is a single string. So the code must read a single string.\n\nBut the sample output is given as ['0', '3', '2'], which suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string.\n\nThis is conflicting. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nSo the input is a single string. The sample input shows a list of strings, but that's probably a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the sample output shows that for the three inputs, the outputs are 0, 3, 2. So perhaps the actual code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given as a separate line. But the problem statement says that the input is a single string.\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe user says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code must read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nBut the sample input shows that there are three test cases. So perhaps the input is a list of strings, each on a separate line. But the problem statement says that the input is a single string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases, but the actual code must process a single string.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nSo the code must read one string from input. Therefore, the sample input is probably incorrect in the way it's presented. For example, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nand the output is:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code is to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement is unclear.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. Therefore, the code must process one string. However, in the sample input, the input is a list of strings. So perhaps the problem is written in a way that the code should process multiple test cases, but the problem statement is wrong.\n\nBut the user says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code must read from stdin. Let's think about the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nBut perhaps the actual input is multiple lines. For example, the input is three lines, each being a string. And the output is three lines, each being the corresponding answer.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is conflicting.\n\nBut the original problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nSo it's a single string. But the sample input shows a list of strings. That's probably a mistake. For example, perhaps the sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nOutput:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. Therefore, the code must read one string, and output one number.\n\nBut the sample input and output suggest that the code should process multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to resolve this? Well, the original problem says that the input is a single string. But the sample input shows a list of strings, and the sample output shows a list of numbers. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nSo perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code should process one string.\n\nBut the sample input shows three strings.

This is confusing.\n\nBut the user's note says:\n\nNote that this is a very hard question.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is from a programming contest where the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are lists, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.

In that case, the sample input is a list of strings, but the code should read one string, and output one number.\n\nBut the sample output is a list of numbers. This suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut without further information, it's difficult to tell.\n\nBut the user provided the problem statement, and the sample input and output. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nYou're given a string of lower-case Latin letters. Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string.\n\nOutput: Output one number â€” length of the longest substring...\n\nSo the code must process one string, output one number.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple strings. So perhaps that's an error. For example, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nOutput:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich would be the case where the code processes multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nHowever, given that the sample input and output are provided as lists, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.

So this is very confusing.\n\nBut the user says that the code should read from stdin and print to stdout.

So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, it's likely that the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line. So the code should read all lines from input, for each line, process the string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the input is three strings, and the output is three numbers. So the code should read all lines from input, and for each line, compute the answer.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, in that case, the code should read all lines from input, and for each line, process the string.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        if not found:\n\n            print(0)\n\nBut this code would handle multiple test cases. For example, if the input is three lines, each being a string.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So this is confusing.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that this is the correct approach.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is a single string. So why does the sample input show three strings?\n\nPerhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, and the actual input is multiple lines, each representing a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string.\n\nSo this suggests that the code should read one line, and process one string.\n\nBut the sample input shows three strings, and the sample output shows three answers. So this suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a contradiction. But given that the user included the sample input and output, it's likely that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should read one string, and output one number. But then, the sample input and output would not match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, and the code should read multiple lines.\n\nBut in that case, the code would need to process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut how to know? Well, the user's note says that the code should be ready to run and handle all edge cases.\n\nLooking back at the original problem statement, the example input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and output is ['0', '3', '2']. This suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output are provided as lists, perhaps the actual code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly.\n\nIn any case, the user's instruction says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So for the sake of solving the problem, I'll assume that the code should read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. So this is very confusing.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the code should process multiple test cases. So the code would read all lines from input, and for each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is conflicting. However, since the sample input and output show multiple test cases, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nBut in that case, the code would be:\n\nRead each line from stdin, for each line, process the string.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        if not found:\n\n            print(0)\n\nBut this code would process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut for the sample input, if the input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThe output would be:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly, and the actual code should process one string.\n\nIn that case, the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\n... as before.\n\nBut the sample input and output would not match.\n\nThis is very confusing.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. So I'll proceed with that, assuming that the sample input is a mistake.\n\nThus, the code should read a single string, and output a single number.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut for the sample input, if the input is 'abcd', the output is 0; if it's 'ababa', output is 3; if it's 'zzz', output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this code would work.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of strings, but that's likely a formatting error.\n\nThus, the final code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the maximum length of a substring that occurs at least twice in the given string. This substring can overlap with itself.\n2. **Brute Force with Optimization**: We check all possible substring lengths starting from the longest possible down to 1. For each length, we use a set to track substrings and check for duplicates.\n3. **Early Termination**: As soon as we find a valid substring length that meets the criteria, we return it immediately, ensuring efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    s = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    n = len(s)\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n            if substr in seen:\n                print(L)\n                return\n            seen.add(substr)\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string is read from standard input.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Starting from the longest possible substring length (`n-1`) down to 1, we check each possible length.\n3. **Check Substrings**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and use a set to track seen substrings. If a duplicate is found, print the current length and exit.\n4. **No Duplicates Found**: If no valid substring is found after checking all lengths, print 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the longest valid substring by leveraging early termination once a valid length is found, thus optimizing the solution.",
