The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, it needs a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, yes. Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. So the total is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys). \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. Calculate the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) and min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's the plan. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parities:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11). \n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7). \n\nSo min(3, 1) is 1 (even chests paired with odd keys). Then min(2, 3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: \nChests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests =5, odd_chests=0. Keys are 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0. So min(5,1) is 1. And min(0,0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. The other term is min(0, 4) which is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the logic works for these examples. \n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the list of a_i's, count even and odd.\n- Read the list of b_j's, count even and odd.\n- Compute the answer as min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) + min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count).\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet me think about the code structure. \n\nWe can read the input lines. For the chests and keys, we can process each number's parity. \n\nFor example, for the a list:\n\neven_chest = 0\nodd_chest = 0\nfor num in a_list:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest +=1\n    else:\n        odd_chest +=1\n\nSame for the keys. Then compute the answer.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen count even and odd in a, then even and odd in b.\n\nThen calculate the answer as min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nNow, let's handle the input. The input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Oh, the sample input shows three different test cases. But the actual input is given as per the problem. Wait, the input format says that the first line contains n and m, then the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in the list of chests and keys.\n2. **Match Parities**: The key insight is that an even chest can only be opened by an odd key and vice versa. Therefore, the maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys.\n   - Plus the minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = 0\n    odd_chest = 0\n    for num in a:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_chest += 1\n        else:\n            odd_chest += 1\n    \n    even_key = 0\n    odd_key = 0\n    for num in b:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            even_key += 1\n        else:\n            odd_key += 1\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We iterate through the list of chests and keys to count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- **Calculating Result**: The result is computed by taking the minimum of even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys, summing these two values gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal pairings using simple counting and comparison operations, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n + m), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
