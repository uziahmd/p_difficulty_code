Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But we can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo, the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So what does that mean for the order of characters? Well, since we can swap 0s and 1s, maybe we can arrange all the 0s and 1s in any order relative to each other, but not with the 2s. Wait, no. Because if there's a 0 and a 2, they can't be swapped. So the 2s can only be moved past 1s, but not 0s. Similarly, 0s can be moved past 1s but not 2s.\n\nWait, let me think. Let's say we have a 0 and a 2. They can't be swapped. So, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, we can't swap them. But if there's a 1 between them, maybe we can move the 0 and 2 around via the 1s?\n\nNo, because the 0 can only swap with 1s, and the 2 can only swap with 1s. So for example, if I have a sequence like 0-1-2, then maybe I can move the 0 to the right of the 1, and the 2 to the left of the 1. But that would require moving the 0 and 2 past each other via the 1. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose I have \"012\". Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2.\n\nWe can swap the 0 and 1 first, making it 1 0 2. Then, can we swap the 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. But then, the 0 can't be swapped with the 2. So in this case, the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the 0 can be moved past 1s, and the 2 can be moved past 1s, but 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed? Or can they?\n\nWait, suppose we have a 0 followed by a 2. Let's say the string is \"02\". Since they are adjacent, but we can't swap them. So their positions are fixed. But if there's a 1 in between, perhaps we can move them around?\n\nFor example, \"012\" can be transformed into \"102\" (swapping 0 and 1), then \"120\" (swapping 1 and 2). Then the 0 is at the end. So the original 0 and 2 were in positions 0 and 2, and now the 0 is after the 2. So that's possible. So the 0 and 2 can be swapped via the 1. So the relative order of 0 and 2 can be changed, but only through the presence of 1s. So that suggests that the 0s and 2s can be rearranged in any order, as long as there's a way to move them through the 1s. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, in the example \"02\", there's no 1s. So we can't swap them. But if there are 1s, then maybe we can move the 0s and 2s past each other via the 1s. So the key is that the 0s and 2s can be arranged in any order, but only if there are 1s between them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s and 2s can be considered as being in separate groups. Let me think about the movement possibilities.\n\nThe allowed swaps are:\n\n- Swap 0 and 1 (adjacent)\n- Swap 1 and 2 (adjacent)\n\nSo, the 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s. Therefore, 0s can be moved to the left of 1s, and 1s can be moved to the left of 2s. But what about 0s and 2s? Since 0s can't be directly swapped with 2s, but they can be moved through 1s. For example, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, then the 0 can move to the right of the 1, and the 2 can move to the left of the 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing allowed swaps between adjacent characters. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. This means that '0's can be rearranged freely among themselves and with '1's, and '2's can be rearranged freely among themselves and with '1's, but '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Characters**: We can separate the string into groups of '0's, '1's, and '2's. However, since '0's and '2's can be moved past '1's, we can treat '0's and '2's as being able to be rearranged around '1's.\n2. **Sort Within Groups**: Since we can freely move '0's and '1's relative to each other, and '1's and '2's relative to each other, we can sort the '0's and '1's in non-decreasing order, and similarly sort the '1's and '2's in non-decreasing order.\n3. **Merge Sorted Groups**: After sorting, we can merge these sorted groups while maintaining their relative order. This ensures that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # Split the string into groups of 0s, 1s, 2s\n    groups = []\n    current_char = s[0]\n    count = 1\n    for c in s[1:]:\n        if c == current_char:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            groups.append((current_char, count))\n            current_char = c\n            count = 1\n    groups.append((current_char, count))\n    \n    # Process groups to allow moving 0s and 2s through 1s\n    # First collect all 0s and 1s, then all 1s and 2s\n    zeros_ones = []\n    ones_twos = []\n    for char, cnt in groups:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros_ones.append(('0', cnt))\n        elif char == '1':\n            zeros_ones.append(('1', cnt))\n            ones_twos.append(('1', cnt))\n        elif char == '2':\n            ones_twos.append(('2', cnt))\n    \n    # Sort zeros and ones in non-decreasing order (they can be freely rearranged)\n    sorted_zeros_ones = sorted(zeros_ones, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    # Sort ones and twos in non-decreasing order\n    sorted_ones_twos = sorted(ones_twos, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    # Now merge the two sorted lists, but considering overlapping 1s\n    # To do this, we need to merge the sorted_zeros_ones and sorted_ones_twos\n    # But since the 1s are in both, we need to combine them properly\n    # Let's collect all characters in sorted order:\n    result = []\n    i = j = 0\n    while i < len(sorted_zeros_ones) and j < len(sorted_ones_twos):\n        if sorted_zeros_ones[i][0] < sorted_ones_twos[j][0]:\n            result.append(sorted_zeros_ones[i][0] * sorted_zeros_ones[i][1])\n            i += 1\n        elif sorted_zeros_ones[i][0] > sorted_ones_twos[j][0]:\n            result.append(sorted_ones_twos[j][0] * sorted_ones_twos[j][1])\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            # Both are '1's, so combine counts\n            result.append('1' * (sorted_zeros_ones[i][1] + sorted_ones_twos[j][1]))\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n    # Add remaining parts\n    while i < len(sorted_zeros_ones):\n        result.append(sorted_zeros_ones[i][0] * sorted_zeros_ones[i][1])\n        i += 1\n    while j < len(sorted_ones_twos):\n        result.append(sorted_ones_twos[j][0] * sorted_ones_twos[j][1])\n        j += 1\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and process each test case\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    test_cases = input_str.split()\n    for case in test_cases:\n        print(min_ternary_string(case))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping Characters**: The input string is divided into groups of consecutive characters ('0's, '1's, or '2's).\n2. **Separating Groups**: We separate the groups into two sets: one containing '0's and '1's, and another containing '1's and '2's.\n3. **Sorting Groups**: Each set of groups is sorted individually. This allows us to rearrange '0's and '1's freely and '1's and '2's freely.\n4. **Merging Sorted Groups**: The sorted groups are merged while maintaining the correct order, ensuring that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest possible.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
