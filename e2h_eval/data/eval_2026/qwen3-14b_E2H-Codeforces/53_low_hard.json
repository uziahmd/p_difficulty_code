Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and track their occurrences. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me think: for each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. The maximum possible L is floor(n/2), but maybe even higher? Wait, for example, if the string is 'aaaaa', then the maximum is 4 (since 'aaaa' appears twice, overlapping). So for a string of length n, the maximum possible L is n-1. But for the problem, the maximum possible answer is when the same substring occurs twice. So for example, for a string of length 1, the answer is 0, since there's only one character.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate possible lengths L from the maximum possible (which is len(s) - 1) down to 1.\n\n- For each L, generate all possible substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears at least twice.\n\n- Once such an L is found, return it.\n\n- If no such L is found after checking all possibilities, return 0.\n\nBut how do I generate all possible substrings of a certain length and check for duplicates?\n\nFor each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nFor example, for a given L, the number of possible substrings is (n - L + 1). For each of these substrings, we can store them in a set, and check if any of them is present more than once.\n\nWait, but for each L, we can collect all substrings of that length, and check if there's any duplicate. So for example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So 'aba' appears twice. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nLoop L from max_length down to 1:\n\n   create a set to store substrings of length L.\n\n   for i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr is already in the set, then return L as the answer.\n\n       else add substr to the set.\n\nBut wait, this approach would check for duplicates as we go. However, for example, if there are multiple duplicates, but the first occurrence is checked. But for the purpose of finding whether there exists at least two occurrences, once we find a substring that's already in the set, we can immediately return L as the answer.\n\nBut for each L, we have to check all possible substrings. However, since we're starting from the largest L possible, once we find such an L, we can return it immediately.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   seen = set()\n\n   for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n\n       current_sub = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if current_sub in seen:\n\n           return L\n\n       seen.add(current_sub)\n\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but this would work? Let's test with sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 'abcd' (output 0). Let's see:\n\nlen(s) is 4. So L starts at 3.\n\nCheck L=3: possible substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. Both are unique. So no.\n\nThen L=2: check substrings of length 2. 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique. Then L=1: check substrings of length 1. Each character. But since they appear once, no. So returns 0. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: 'ababa' (output 3). Let's see:\n\nlen(s) is 5. So L starts at 4.\n\nCheck L=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba'. Both unique. Then L=3. Check substrings:\n\ni=0: 'aba' added to set.\n\ni=1: 'bab' added.\n\ni=2: 'aba' which is already in the set. So return 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 'zzz' (output 2). Let's see:\n\nlen(s) is 3. So L starts at 2.\n\nCheck L=2: substrings are 'zz' (i=0),",
