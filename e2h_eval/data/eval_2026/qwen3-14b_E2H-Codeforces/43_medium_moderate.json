He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved.\n\nSo the process is: \n\nFirst, A has a string of some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's. The number of 'c's added must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the order of the string must be all a's followed by all b's followed by all c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the original string must have a's first, then b's, then c's. So the input string must be in the form of aaaaa...bbbb...ccc.\n\nSo first thing I need to check is that the string is in the correct order. Like, all a's come before any b's, and all b's come before any c's. If there's a 'c' before a 'b', or a 'b' after a 'c', that's invalid. So the first check is the order of characters.\n\nThen, after confirming the order, I need to check the counts. Let's break it down:\n\nLet me count the number of a's, b's, c's. Let's call them count_a, count_b, count_c.\n\nThe initial string from A is all a's. Then B adds some b's. So the count of a's and b's before adding c's must be such that count_a >=1, count_b >=1. Then C adds c's. The number of c's must be equal to count_a (original a's) or count_b (original b's). But wait, when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's are the same as before adding the c's. Because the c's are added after. So the count_c must be equal to count_a (original a's) or count_b (original b's). \n\nBut wait, the original a's and b's are the ones before adding the c's. So for example, the original a's is count_a, original b's is count_b. Then C adds count_c = count_a or count_b.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The string must be composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the order must be correct. For example, no 'b's before 'a's, no 'c's before 'b's, etc.\n\n- The count of c's must be equal to count_a or count_b. Also, since B added the b's, the count_b must be at least 1, and count_a must be at least 1. Also, since C added the c's, count_c must be at least 1? Wait, no. Because the problem says that the number of c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. But the original a's and b's are at least 1. So count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. But count_c can be zero? No, because C added some number of c's. Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. So the number of c's added is at least 1? Or can it be zero?\n\nWait, the problem says \"some number of letters 'c'\". But the term \"some number\" usually implies at least one. But let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So \"some number\" could be zero? Or does it have to be at least one? Because the problem says that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. But the original a's and b's are at least 1. So if C appends zero c's, then count_c is zero. But that would not be equal to count_a or count_b. So in that case, the string would not be valid. However, the problem says that C appends some number of letters. So perhaps the number of c's added must be at least one. Therefore, the count_c must be at least 1.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the original string (after B's appending) must have at least one a and one b. So when C appends the c's, he appends some number (could be zero?), but according to the problem statement, the number of c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. So if C appends zero c's, then the count_c is zero. But that would require that the number of a's or b's is zero, which is impossible. Therefore, the number of c's added must be at least one, which implies that count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. So in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. And also, count_c must be at least 1. \n\nBut the original count_a and count_b are at least 1. So count_c must be at least 1. So that's okay.\n\nSo putting this all together:\n\nThe steps to check are:\n\n1. Check that the string is in the form a* b* c*. So all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, if there's a 'c' followed by a 'b', that's invalid. Or a 'b' followed by an 'a', etc.\n\n2. Check that count_a >= 1, count_b >= 1, count_c >= 1. Because:\n\n   - After A gives the string to B, B appends some b's. So the original string before C appends c's has at least one a and one b. So count_a and count_b must be at least 1. Also, C appends some c's (so count_c must be at least 1).\n\n3. Check that count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, what if the count_c is equal to both count_a and count_b? Like, if count_a = count_b = count_c. Then that's allowed.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck the order, then check the counts.\n\nNow, how to check the order? Let's think.\n\nThe string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b' or 'a'.\n\nSo for the string S, we can check that:\n\n- All characters before the first 'b' are 'a's.\n\n- All characters before the first 'c' are 'a's or 'b's.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to check that the string is composed of a sequence of a's, followed by a sequence of b's, followed by a sequence of c's. So the transitions between characters can only be from a to b, then from b to c. So for example, the string can be split into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be checked by checking that:\n\n- The first occurrence of 'b' is after all 'a's. So the first 'b' must be after the first 'a' (if there are any a's). Similarly, the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all 'b's.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward way is to check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the letters. Because 'a' < 'b' < 'c'. So the string should be non-decreasing. For example, 'aabbc' is okay. But 'abba' is not. However, this approach would work. Because if the string is in non-decreasing order, then all a's come first, then b's, then c's. So that's a good check.\n\nWait, but the string can have a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the order of characters is non-decreasing. So if the string is not non-decreasing, then it's invalid.\n\nSo for example, 'abac' would not be non-decreasing (the 'a' after 'c' is not allowed), but the string 'aabbc' is non-decreasing.\n\nSo, first check that the string is non-decreasing. That's a necessary condition.\n\nBut wait, the string could be like 'aabbcc' which is non-decreasing. But what if there are other letters? Well, the problem states that the string consists only of a, b, c. So that's handled.\n\nSo step 1: check that the string is non-decreasing. If not, return NO.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to check the counts.\n\nSo, let's code this.\n\nNow, for example, the sample input:\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. The order is correct. Then check if c's count (3) equals a's (3) or b's (1). Yes, equals a's. So YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the string is 'bbaacc'? Wait, the input is 'bbacc' → the characters are b, b, a, c, c. So the order is not non-decreasing. Because the a comes after b. So the string is invalid. Hence output is NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → the string is a, a, b, c. Order is correct. Counts: a=2, b=1, c=1. So c's count is 1, which equals b's count. So YES.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, read the string S.\n\nCheck that the string is non-decreasing. How to do that? For each i from 1 to len(S)-1, check that S[i] >= S[i-1]. If any character is less than the previous, return NO.\n\nOnce that is done, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck that count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1. Because:\n\nOriginal string after B's appending has at least one a and one b. Then C appends c's (so count_c must be at least 1).\n\nThen, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf all those conditions are met, return YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is all a's and c's? For example, 'aacc'. Then, the order is correct. But count_b is zero. Which would fail the check. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: 'ab' → counts are a:1, b:1, c:0. But since the count_c is zero, which is not allowed. So the code would return NO. But according to the problem statement, the string must have been formed by appending c's. So in this case, the original string after B's appending is 'ab', and then C appends zero c's. But according to the problem statement, C appends some number of c's. So the count_c must be at least 1. So the code checks that count_c is at least 1. So in this case, the code would return NO.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nCheck order (non-decreasing). Then check:\n\ncount_a >= 1, count_b >= 1, count_c >= 1.\n\nThen check if count_c equals count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead S.\n\nCheck if the string is non-decreasing. If not, return NO.\n\nElse, count a, b, c.\n\nIf count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1 → return NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b. If yes → YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that C appends some number of c's. So the count_c must be equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. But the count of a's and b's in the string before adding the c's. But in the string, the count of a's and b's is exactly the original counts. Because the c's are added after. So the count_a and count_b are the original counts. So the code is correct.\n\nBut let's think: the count_c is the number of c's added, which is equal to the original count_a or count_b. So in the string, count_c is equal to the original count_a (which is the same as the current count_a) or original count_b (same as current count_b). So yes, the code checks that.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is a single line. But in the example given, the input is given as a list, but in actual code, the input is a single string. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The first and only line consists of a string S. So for example, in the sample input, the input is given as ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], but that's probably for the example. The actual code will read a single string.\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the input is a list of strings. But that's probably part of the problem's example. For example, the user input is a single string. So in the code, we need to read a single string from stdin.\n\nSo the code will read S = input().strip()\n\nThen, check the order.\n\nHow to check the order. For example, for S, iterate through each character and check that each character is >= the previous.\n\nFor example:\n\nprev_char = S[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < prev_char:\n\n        return NO\n\n    prev_char = S[i]\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\ndef is_non_decreasing(s):\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nSo, if that returns False, then output NO.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nThen check:\n\nif count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1 → return NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b → return YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is all a's and c's, but the count_c equals count_a. For example, 'aacc' → count_a is 2, count_b is 0, count_c is 2. But in that case, the count_b is zero. So the code would return NO. Which is correct, because B added some b's. So the original string after B's appending must have at least one a and one b. So in this case, the string has no b's, so it's invalid.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts a=3, b=1, c=3. The order is correct. count_c is 3, which equals a's count. So YES.\n\nSample input 2: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The order is not non-decreasing, since 'a' comes after 'b' → the check fails. So output is NO.\n\nSample input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. count_c equals count_b. So YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=0. So the check for count_c >=1 is false → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → counts are a=1, b=1, c=1. count_c is 1, which equals a and b. So YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c is not equal to either. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. So no. But if the string is 'aabbc' → the order is correct. But count_c is 1. So check if 1 equals a (2) or b (2). No. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → no. But if the string is 'aabbc' → but count_c is 1. So no. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbcc' → counts are a=2, b=2, c=2. So count_c equals a and b. So YES.\n\nWhat about 'abbbc'? The counts are a=1, b=3, c=1. So count_c is 1, which equals a's count. So YES.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → count_a=4, count_b=4, count_c=4. So count_c equals both a and b. So YES.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nCheck if it's non-decreasing.\n\nThen check counts.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n\n    # check non-decreasing\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    # check counts\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nif is_valid(s):\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'?\n\ncount_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2. So count_c equals both. So returns True. Correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'abcc'? The order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c is 2. Which is not equal to a or b. So returns False. So output is NO.\n\nBut what if the string is 'abbc'? count_c is 1. count_b is 2. So count_c is not equal to count_b. So no. So code returns no.\n\nBut what if the string is 'abbbc'? count_c is 1, count_b is 3. So no.\n\nBut if the string is 'abbcc' → count_c is 2. count_b is 2. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → code returns yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → the order is not non-decreasing. So returns no.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_b. So yes.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'abc'? The code returns yes. Because counts are 1,1,1. So yes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So 2 is not equal to 1. So returns no.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So no.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aabbc' → no.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → the order is correct. But count_b is 0 → returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbccc' → counts a=3, b=3, c=3 → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbcc' → count_a=4, count_b=4, count_c=2. So count_c is not equal to a or b. So returns no.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is all 'c's? For example, 'ccc' → the order is correct. But count_a is 0, count_b is 0, count_c is 3. So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'a' → count_b is 0, count_c is 0. So returns no.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
