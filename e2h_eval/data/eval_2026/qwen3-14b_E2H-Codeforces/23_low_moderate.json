In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and we have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements. The initial hand has three tiles. After drawing some tiles (any number), she must have at least one mentsu. We need to find the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nSo, the approach is to check if the current hand already has a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu when adding tiles?\n\nLet me think about all possibilities.\n\nFor the current three tiles, there are two possibilities for forming a mentsu:\n\n1. They already form a triplet or sequence. Then answer is 0.\n2. Not. Then, we need to add tiles to make it possible.\n\nBut since the initial hand is three tiles, adding tiles can make it possible. For example, if the initial three tiles can form a triplet with one more tile (like two of same, then adding another), or a sequence with one more tile (like two consecutive numbers, then adding the third).\n\nWait, but the problem allows adding any number of tiles. So the minimal steps would be to find the minimal steps needed to get a triplet or sequence.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think about all possible cases for the initial three tiles.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check what's the minimal number of tiles needed to add to form a mentsu.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: The three tiles can form a triplet by adding one tile. For example, if two of them are same. Like [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then adding another 1m would form a triplet. So in this case, the answer is 1.\n\nCase 2: The three tiles can form a sequence by adding one tile. Like [1s, 2s, 3s] already form a sequence. But if the initial three are [1s, 2s, 4s], then adding 3s would form a sequence. So answer is 1.\n\nBut wait, the initial three tiles may not have any mentsu. So the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that in the new set (original + added tiles) there is at least one mentsu.\n\nBut the added tiles can be any number. So the minimal steps would be the minimal between:\n\n- The steps needed to form a triplet (for any possible triplet)\n- The steps needed to form a sequence (for any possible sequence)\n\nSo, for each possible way to form a triplet or sequence, compute how many tiles are needed, and take the minimum.\n\nBut how to check all possibilities?\n\nLet me break down the problem into checking for possible triplet and sequence possibilities.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then for the triplet case:\n\nWe can look for all possible triplets that can be formed by adding some tiles. For example, if the current tiles have two of the same, then adding one more would form a triplet. If they have one of a tile, then adding two more. Or if they have none, then adding three.\n\nBut for the minimal steps, we need to find the minimal steps required to form any triplet.\n\nSimilarly for sequences.\n\nSo, for the triplet possibility:\n\nCount the frequency of each tile. For each tile type, if there are 3, then it's already a triplet. Otherwise, the number of tiles needed to reach 3 is (3 - count). But since the initial three tiles might have multiple different tiles, we need to check for each possible tile type.\n\nWait, but the triplet requires three identical tiles. So, for example, if the initial three tiles have two of one type, then adding one more gives a triplet. So steps needed is 1.\n\nBut if the initial three have one of a type, then you need to add two more. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, for triplet, the minimal steps would be:\n\nFor each possible tile type (like 1m, 2p, etc.), compute how many of that tile are present in the initial three. Then, the required steps to form a triplet is 3 - count. But since we can add any number of tiles, including those already present.\n\nBut since the minimal steps would be for the tile type that already has the maximum count.\n\nFor example, if in the initial three tiles, there are two of a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw in order to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) from her initial hand of three tiles.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the initial three tiles already form a valid mentsu (triplet or sequence). If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Triplet Possibility**: For each tile type in the initial hand, calculate how many more tiles are needed to form a triplet. The minimal number of tiles required to form any triplet is determined by checking the count of each tile type.\n3. **Sequence Possibility**: For each suit, check all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers. Determine the minimal number of tiles required to complete any such sequence with the existing tiles.\n4. **Determine Minimum**: The final answer is the minimum between the minimal tiles needed to form a triplet and the minimal tiles needed to form a sequence.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef is_triplet(tiles):\n    return len(set(tiles)) == 1\n\ndef is_sequence(tiles):\n    # Extract numbers and suit\n    nums = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n    suit = tiles[0][1]\n    for t in tiles:\n        if t[1] != suit:\n            return False\n    nums.sort()\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[0] + 2\n\ndef min_draws(tiles):\n    # Check if already has mentsu\n    if is_triplet(tiles) or is_sequence(tiles):\n        return 0\n\n    # Count frequencies\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    for t in tiles:\n        freq[t] += 1\n\n    # Check for triplet possibility\n    min_triplet = float('inf')\n    for tile, count in freq.items():\n        needed = 3 - count\n        min_triplet = min(min_triplet, needed)\n\n    # Check for sequence possibility\n    min_seq = float('inf')\n    suits = set(t[1] for t in tiles)\n    for suit in suits:\n        # Get all numbers in this suit\n        nums = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles if t[1] == suit]\n        # All possible sequences in this suit\n        for i in range(1, 8):\n            seq = [i, i+1, i+2]\n            current = 0\n            for n in seq:\n                if f\"{n}{suit}\" in freq:\n                    current += freq[f\"{n}{suit}\"]\n            needed = 3 - current\n            min_seq = min(min_seq, needed)\n\n    return min(min_triplet, min_seq)\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\ninputs = input_str.split('[')\noutputs = []\nfor inp in inputs:\n    if not inp:\n        continue\n    inp = inp.replace(']', '').strip()\n    tiles = [t.strip() for t in inp.split(',')]\n    outputs.append(str(min_draws(tiles)))\n\n# Print output\nprint('[' + ', '.join(outputs) + ']')\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **is_triplet** and **is_sequence** functions check whether the given list of tiles forms a valid triplet or sequence.\n- **min_draws** function calculates the minimum number of tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.
