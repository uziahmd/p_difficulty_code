In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The input is three tiles. The output is the minimum number of tiles she needs to add so that she can form at least one mentsu. So, for each case, I have to check whether she already has a mentsu (then answer is 0), else find the minimal draws needed.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n2. If not, find the minimal number of tiles to add to make it possible.\n\nLet me think about how to check for existing mentsu.\n\nFor a triplet (koutsu), all three tiles must be the same. So, for example, '9m 9m 9m' would be a triplet. So checking that all three are same.\n\nFor a sequence (shuntsu), they need to be three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But the order doesn't matter. So, the three tiles must be in the same suit, and their numbers must be consecutive. So, for example, 3p, 2p, 4p would form a sequence.\n\nSo first, for the given three tiles, check if they form either of these two cases.\n\nIf they do, then output 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to calculate the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nNow, how to find the minimal number of tiles to add?\n\nLet's think about possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: The current tiles can be part of a triplet or sequence with some additions.\n\nBut since the problem allows adding any number of tiles (but we need the minimal), perhaps we can consider different possibilities.\n\nBut since the initial count is three, and adding tiles, the minimal number would be 0, 1, 2, etc. But the answer can't be more than 2? Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add two more of any one tile. For example, adding two 1m's gives a triplet. So that would require 2 draws. Alternatively, maybe there's a better way. Or maybe there's a sequence possibility. But in this case, the three tiles are different suits, so no sequence. So the answer here would be 2.\n\nBut what's the minimal possible?\n\nBut how to find for each possible case?\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nCheck whether the current three tiles can form a mentsu. If not, then compute for all possibilities how many tiles are needed to reach a mentsu.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAlternative approach: For the current three tiles, check all possible ways to form a mentsu by adding some tiles. Find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about possible options:\n\nOption 1: Try to form a triplet.\n\nFor a triplet, we need three of the same tile. So, suppose the current three tiles have counts for each tile. Let's say, for example, the current tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s. Then, for forming a triplet, we need to get three of the same. So, for example, if we take the 1s, we need two more. If we take 2s, need two more. Or 3s, need two more. So in this case, the minimal is 2. However, maybe there's a better way via sequences.\n\nBut in this case, the three tiles already form a sequence. So the answer is 0. So in that case, the answer is zero.\n\nSo, for the current three tiles, the first thing is to check whether they already form a mentsu. If not, then proceed.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nNow, how to check if the current three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nLet me code this as a helper function.\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nThe input is three strings, like '1s', '2s', '3s'.\n\nWe can process them into a list of tuples. For example, each tile can be represented as (number, suit).\n\nSo, for the three tiles, let's collect their numbers and suits.\n\nFor checking triplet:\n\nAll three tiles must have same suit and same number.\n\nFor checking sequence:\n\nAll three must have same suit, and their numbers must be consecutive. But since they are in any order, we can sort the numbers and check if they are consecutive.\n\nSo, for example, [2,3,4] sorted is consecutive. [1,3,2] sorted is consecutive. But [1,2,4] is not.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, check:\n\nif all suits are same, and sorted numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, first check for triplet, then check for sequence.\n\nIf either is true, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\nSo, the possible options are:\n\nEither form a triplet, or form a sequence.\n\nWe need to find the minimal between the two possibilities.\n\nSo, for example, let's think about the third example from the problem:\n\nInput is 3p, 9m, 2p. So the three tiles are:\n\ntile1: 3p\n\ntile2: 9m\n\ntile3: 2p\n\nSo, the three tiles are in two suits. So, no triplet. Also, no sequence. So, the minimal is 1. Because adding 1p would allow 2p, 3p, 1p (sorted as 1,2,3) which forms a sequence. Or adding 4p to get 2p,3p,4p. So, in this case, adding one tile.\n\nSo, how to compute the minimal steps for such a case.\n\nSo, the idea is to consider all possible ways to form a triplet or sequence, and compute the minimal steps required.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nCase A: Forming a triplet.\n\nTo form a triplet, we need three of the same tile. So, the current three tiles may have some counts. For example, if two of them are same, then we need one more. If only one is same, then need two more. If none are same, then need three more.\n\nBut wait, the current three tiles may have multiple counts. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, for triplet, we can add another 1m (so need 1 tile). Or, maybe form a sequence. For example, adding 3m would make 1m, 1m, 2m, 3m. But then, the sequence is 1m, 2m, 3m. But since there are four tiles, but the mentsu requires three. So, the presence of three of them in the hand would be sufficient. So, in this case, the minimal steps would be 1 (adding 3m) to form a sequence. Or adding one 1m to form a triplet. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, the minimal steps needed is (3 - count of same tile). For example, if there are two same tiles, then 3-2=1. If there is one, 3-1=2. If none, 3-0=3. But wait, for the triplet, the current tiles could have some duplicates. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 1m. Then, the triplet is already present, so steps needed is 0.\n\nBut in our code, we first check if the current tiles form a mentsu. So, if the triplet exists, the answer is 0.\n\nSo, when considering the case where we need to form a triplet, the steps required is (3 - max_count) where max_count is the maximum count of any tile in the current three.\n\nBut for example, if the current tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Then, max_count is 1. So steps needed is 3 - 1 = 2. Which would be correct.\n\nSo, for the triplet option, the steps needed is 3 - max_count, but only if the current tiles have at least one of the same tile. But even if they don't, it's 3 steps.\n\nBut for the triplet case, the steps needed is (3 - count) where count is the number of same tiles in the current three. So, the minimal steps for triplet is (3 - count) where count is the maximum count of any tile in the current three.\n\nCase B: Forming a sequence.\n\nThis is more complex.\n\nTo form a sequence, we need three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, the current tiles may have some in the same suit, and we can add tiles to complete the sequence.\n\nSo, for example, if the three tiles are 1p, 2p, 4p. Then, the current suit is p. The numbers are 1, 2, 4. To form a sequence, we can add 3p. Then, 1,2,3 would form a sequence. So steps needed is 1.\n\nBut how to find this in general?\n\nThe approach here is to look for all possible sequences that can be formed with the current tiles and some added tiles.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For each suit, we can check the tiles in that suit. For example, if there are two tiles in the same suit, then see if adding one tile can make a sequence.\n\nBut the current three tiles may have multiple suits. So, for example, if two tiles are in suit 'p' and one in 'm', then the sequence can only be formed in 'p' (since the other suit has only one tile).\n\nSo, for each suit, collect the numbers of tiles in that suit.\n\nFor example, in the third example, the tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p. So, for suit 'p', there are 3 and 2. For suit 'm', there's 9. So, for suit 'p', the numbers are [2,3]. So, to form a sequence, we can add 1 or 4. Then, the sequence would be 1,2,3 or 2,3,4. So steps needed is 1.\n\nSo, for each suit, we can check the numbers present. Then, find the minimal number of tiles to add to get a sequence.\n\nSo, for a given suit, the numbers in the current tiles can be sorted. Then, for each possible way to form a sequence with those numbers, determine the minimal steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: For a given suit, let's say the current numbers are a list. Let's say the list is sorted. For example, for the suit p, the numbers are [2,3].\n\nWe can think of the possible sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles.\n\nA sequence is three consecutive numbers. So, for the current numbers, we can check for possible sequences that can be completed by adding tiles.\n\nFor example, with [2,3], possible sequences are:\n\n- 1,2,3 → need to add 1 → 1 tile.\n\n- 2,3,4 → need to add 4 → 1 tile.\n\n- 2,3,5 → no, not consecutive. So, the minimal steps here is 1.\n\nSo, for the current numbers, the minimal steps is the minimal number of tiles needed to complete a sequence.\n\nAnother example: if the numbers in a suit are [1, 3], then possible sequences are:\n\n- add 2 → steps 1.\n\n- add 1 and 2 → but that would make 1,1,2,3. But for a sequence, you need three consecutive numbers. So, if you have two 1s and a 2, you can't form a sequence. Wait, but you need three consecutive numbers. So, the numbers must be exactly three consecutive numbers, regardless of duplicates.\n\nWait, no. The sequence is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, the three tiles must be exactly three consecutive numbers. So, for example, if you have [1, 1, 2], then you can't form a sequence. Because you need 1,2,3. But you have two 1s and a 2. So, no sequence.\n\nBut if you have [1,2,2], you can't form a sequence. So, for the sequence, the three tiles must be three distinct consecutive numbers. So, for example, 1,2,3. So, in the case where the current numbers in a suit are [1,3], adding 2 gives [1,2,3], which is a sequence. So steps needed is 1.\n\nIf the current numbers are [1,1,2], then for the sequence, you need to have three consecutive numbers. But in this case, you have 1,1,2. So, the numbers are 1,1,2. No three consecutive numbers. So, you can't form a sequence. So, you need to add 3 (so that you have 1,2,3) but you have two 1s. So, you need to add 3 and one more 2? Or wait, the total tiles after adding would be 1,1,2,3. But you need three tiles to form the sequence. So, you can pick 1,2,3. So, in that case, you can form a sequence. But the problem says that after drawing tiles, the player can choose any subset of the tiles (the ones in her hand) to form the mentsu. So, the presence of the three tiles that form the sequence is sufficient. So, even if there are other tiles, as long as there's a subset of three that form the sequence, it's okay.\n\nSo, for example, if the current tiles in a suit are [1,1,2], then adding 3 gives you 1,1,2,3. You can select 1,2,3 to form the sequence. So, steps needed is 1.\n\nSo, in this case, the steps needed is 1.\n\nSo, the way to approach for the sequence is: for each suit, collect the numbers present, and find the minimal number of tiles to add to get a set of numbers that includes a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think for a given suit, the numbers present in the current tiles. Let's say the numbers are stored in a list. For example, in the case where the numbers are [2,3], then the possible sequences that can be formed are:\n\n- [1,2,3] → need to add 1.\n\n- [2,3,4] → add 4.\n\nSo, minimal steps is 1.\n\nIn another example, if the numbers are [1,2,4], then possible sequences:\n\n- [1,2,3] → add 3 → steps 1.\n\n- [2,3,4] → add 3 → steps 1.\n\nSo, minimal steps is 1.\n\nIf the numbers are [1,4,5], then possible sequences:\n\n- [1,2,3] → add 2 and 3 → steps 2.\n\n- [4,5,6] → add 6 → steps 1.\n\n- [3,4,5] → add 3 → steps 1.\n\nSo, minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo, the approach here is to find all possible sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles, and find the minimal steps required.\n\nBut how to compute that for a given list of numbers in a suit.\n\nAn efficient way is to look for the possible sequences that can be formed by the current numbers and the possible additions.\n\nLet me think of the following steps for a given suit:\n\n1. Collect all the unique numbers present in the current tiles for that suit. Let's call this S. For example, if the current numbers are [2,3], then S is {2,3}.\n\n2. For each possible sequence of three consecutive numbers, check if the current S can be extended with some additions to cover that sequence. Then compute the number of tiles needed to add.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences that can be covered by adding some tiles?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible sequence of three consecutive numbers (from 1-2-3 up to 7-8-9), check if the current S has at least one of the numbers, and then compute how many tiles are needed to fill the missing ones.\n\nWait, but for example, if the current S has 2 and 3, then the sequence 1-2-3 can be formed by adding 1. Similarly, sequence 2-3-4 can be formed by adding 4. So, for each possible sequence (like x, x+1, x+2), check how many of the three numbers are already present in S, and then the required steps is 3 - (number of existing elements in the sequence).\n\nBut since the current S may have more than one element of the sequence. For example, if S has 2,3, then for the sequence 1-2-3, the existing elements are 2 and 3. So, steps needed is 1 (add 1). For the sequence 2-3-4, steps needed is 1 (add 4). For the sequence 2-3-5, not consecutive. So, not considered.\n\nSo, for each possible sequence of three consecutive numbers (x, x+1, x+2), where x ranges from 1 to 7, check how many of the three numbers are present in S. Then, the number of tiles needed to form that sequence is (3 - count), but only if the count is less than 3. Because if all three are present, then no tiles needed. But in that case, the original three tiles would have already formed a sequence, which would have been detected in the initial check.\n\nBut in our case, the initial check has already determined that the three tiles do not form a mentsu. So, for the current case, the sequences that are already present in the current three tiles are not possible. So, perhaps during the initial check, we would have found that the three tiles can form a sequence, so the code would have returned 0.\n\nTherefore, in the current scenario, when we are looking for the minimal steps to form a sequence, the current S (for a particular suit) has less than three elements. For example, in the case where the three tiles are 2p,3p,9m, then for suit p, the S is {2,3} (two elements). For suit m, {9} (one element).\n\nSo, for each suit, we can check the possible sequences that can be formed with the numbers in that suit, and find the minimal steps required.\n\nSo, the steps for a given suit are:\n\nFor each possible sequence (x, x+1, x+2):\n\n- Check how many of x, x+1, x+2 are present in S.\n\n- The required steps is (3 - count) if the count is less than 3. However, since the current three tiles do not form a sequence, the count can't be 3. But for example, if the current S has two numbers that are part of a sequence (like x and x+1), then adding one tile (x+2) will form the sequence.\n\nBut how to find all possible sequences for the current S?\n\nBut for the current S, the numbers may be in any combination. For example, if S has 1 and 3, then the possible sequences are 1-2-3 (needs 1 addition of 2) or 3-4-5 (needs 2 additions of 4 and 5). But the minimal steps here is 1.\n\nSo, for the given S, we need to find the minimal steps required for any possible sequence.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAn approach is to generate all possible sequences (x, x+1, x+2) and for each, compute how many numbers are missing in S. Then, the minimal steps is the minimal of (3 - count) over all possible sequences that can be completed with additions.\n\nBut how to find which sequences are possible.\n\nFor example, if the current S is {2,3}, then the possible sequences that can be completed are:\n\n1-2-3: need to add 1 → 1 step.\n\n2-3-4: need to add 4 → 1 step.\n\nSo, the minimal is 1.\n\nAnother example: S is {1, 3}. Possible sequences:\n\n1-2-3: need 2 → 1 step.\n\n3-4-5: need 4 and 5 → 2 steps.\n\nSo, minimal is 1.\n\nAnother example: S is {1, 2, 4} → but wait, this is for a suit. So, if the current tiles for that suit are 1, 2, 4. Then, the possible sequences:\n\n1-2-3 → need 3 → 1 step.\n\n2-3-4 → need 3 → 1 step.\n\n3-4-5 → need 3 and 5 → 2 steps.\n\nSo, minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo, the approach for a given suit is:\n\nGenerate all possible sequences (x, x+1, x+2) where x ranges from 1 to 7. For each of these sequences, check how many of the numbers are in S. The minimal steps for that sequence is (3 - count). Then, take the minimal steps among all possible sequences for this suit.\n\nThen, for all suits, compute this minimal steps, and take the minimal among all suits.\n\nOnce we have the minimal steps for the triplet case and the minimal steps for the sequence case, the overall minimal steps is the minimum between these two.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor the current three tiles, the steps required to form a triplet is (3 - max_count), where max_count is the maximum number of same tiles in the current three.\n\nFor the sequence, for each suit, compute the minimal steps as described above, then take the minimal steps among all suits.\n\nThen, the overall minimal steps is the minimum between the triplet steps and the sequence steps.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nFirst, parse the three tiles into their components (number and suit).\n\nThen, check if they form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute steps for triplet and steps for sequence, and return the minimal between them.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, the code structure.\n\nRead the input as three strings. For example, input is given as a list like ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', ...], but the actual input is one line with three strings separated by spaces. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For example, the sample input is ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] — but that's probably the list of examples, but the actual input is one line with three strings, like \"1s 2s 3s\" (but the input is given as a single line, with three strings separated by space).\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nSo, the input is a single line, with three strings separated by spaces. For example, in the sample input, the first input is '1s 2s 3s', which is the three tiles. So, for the code, the input is read as a list of three strings.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read the input line as something like:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nSo, tiles is a list of three strings.\n\nThen, for each tile, extract the number and suit.\n\nSo, for example, tile_str = '1s' → number is 1, suit is 's'.\n\nNow, for the initial check:\n\nCheck for triplet: all three tiles have same suit and same number.\n\nCheck for sequence: all three have same suit, and their numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if all(tile[0] == tiles[0][0] and tile[1] == tiles[0][1] for tile in tiles):\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    suits = [tile[1] for tile in tiles]\n\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    nums = sorted([int(tile[0]) for tile in tiles])\n\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[0] + 2\n\nWait, for the sequence, the three numbers must be consecutive. So, sorted, the first is x, second x+1, third x+2. So, the code above checks that.\n\nSo, for example, if the numbers are [1,2,3], sorted, then yes. If [1,3,2], sorted becomes [1,2,3], same check.\n\nSo, that code should work.\n\nIf either of the conditions is true, then the answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed to compute steps.\n\nNow, compute steps for triplet.\n\nTo compute steps for triplet, we need to find the maximum count of any tile in the current three.\n\nFor example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s → counts are 1 for each. So max count is 1. Steps needed is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nIf the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m → counts are 2 for 1m, 1 for 2m. Max count is 2. Steps needed is 1.\n\nSo, code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ntile_list = [ (tile[0], tile[1]) for tile in tiles ]\n\ncounts = Counter(tile_list)\n\nmax_count = max(counts.values())\n\ntriplet_steps = 3 - max_count\n\nBut wait, if the max_count is 3, then triplet_steps is 0. But in that case, the initial check would have passed, so this code is called only when the initial check returns false. So, in this case, triplet_steps can be 0? No, because if the initial check returns false, then the triplet is not present. So, for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 1m → the initial check would have passed, and the code would have returned 0. So, when this code is called, the max_count can be 2 or 1. So, triplet_steps would be 1 or 2.\n\nNow, for the sequence steps.\n\nFor each suit, collect the numbers present in that suit.\n\nSo, group the tiles by suit.\n\nsuits_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor tile in tile_list:\n\n    num = int(tile[0])\n\n    suit = tile[1]\n\n    suits_dict[suit].append(num)\n\nThen, for each suit in suits_dict, process the numbers.\n\nFor each suit, process the list of numbers. For example, for suit 'p', numbers could be [2,3].\n\nThen, for this suit, find the minimal steps required to form a sequence.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nAs discussed earlier, for each possible sequence (x, x+1, x+2), check how many numbers are present in the current numbers of the suit. Then, the steps for that sequence is 3 - count, and the minimal among all possible sequences.\n\nSo, for each suit, generate all possible sequences, compute the steps, and find the minimal steps for that suit.\n\nThen, among all suits, find the minimal steps.\n\nSo, for example, in the third sample input:\n\ntiles are 3p, 9m, 2p → tile_list is [(3, 'p'), (9, 'm'), (2, 'p')]\n\nsuits_dict is:\n\n'p': [3, 2]\n\n'm': [9]\n\nFor suit 'p', numbers are [2,3]. The possible sequences are:\n\n1-2-3 → need 1 → steps 1.\n\n2-3-4 → need 4 → steps 1.\n\nSo, minimal steps for suit 'p' is 1.\n\nFor suit 'm', numbers are [9]. Possible sequences are 7-8-9 (need 7 and 8 → steps 2), 8-9-10 (but 10 is invalid), 9-10-11 (invalid). So, the possible sequences are 7-8-9, 8-9-10, 9-10-11 (but only 7-8-9 is valid). So, for 7-8-9, need to add 7 and 8 → steps 2. So, the minimal steps for suit 'm' is 2.\n\nSo, overall minimal steps for sequences is 1.\n\nSo, the minimal between triplet_steps (which is 3 - max_count. The counts for the three tiles are:\n\ntile_list is [(3,p), (9,m), (2,p)].\n\nThe counts are:\n\n(3,p): 1\n\n(9,m): 1\n\n(2,p): 1.\n\nSo, max_count is 1 → triplet_steps is 2.\n\nSo, the minimal between 2 and 1 is 1 → answer is 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code for sequence steps:\n\ndef compute_sequence_steps(suit_numbers):\n\n    # suit_numbers is a list of numbers in this suit.\n\n    # find the minimal steps to form a sequence.\n\n    # generate all possible sequences (x, x+1, x+2)\n\n    min_steps = float('inf')\n\n    # possible x ranges from 1 to 7.\n\n    for x in range(1, 8):\n\n        # the sequence is x, x+1, x+2.\n\n        # check how many of these are in suit_numbers.\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for num in [x, x+1, x+2]:\n\n            if num in suit_numbers:\n\n                count +=1\n\n        steps_needed = 3 - count\n\n        if steps_needed < min_steps:\n\n            min_steps = steps_needed\n\n    return min_steps\n\nWait, but this code is not correct. Because the suit_numbers may have duplicates. For example, if the suit_numbers are [2, 2, 3], then for the sequence 2-3-4, we need to add 4. But the current numbers have two 2's and one 3. So, the count of numbers in the sequence is 2 (2 and 3). So steps needed is 1. But the code above checks for presence in the list, but if the list has multiple instances of a number, it's counted once. Because in the code, for each of x, x+1, x+2, it checks if num is in the suit_numbers. So, even if there are multiple copies, the count is incremented once per unique number.\n\nBut that's correct. Because, for example, if the current numbers are [2,2,3], then for the sequence 2-3-4, we have 2 and 3 present. So, count is 2. steps needed is 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut the code for compute_sequence_steps needs to take the list of numbers in the suit (possibly with duplicates?), but in reality, for the purpose of checking the sequence, the duplicates don't matter. Because the sequence requires three distinct consecutive numbers. So, the presence of duplicates doesn't help in forming the sequence. For example, if the numbers are [2,2,2], then the code would check for sequences. For x=2, the sequence is 2,3,4. Only 2 is present. So steps needed is 2 (add 3 and 4). But the code would return that.\n\nBut in reality, the numbers in the suit can be [2,2,2]. So, the current numbers are all 2. So, the code would generate for x=2, the sequence 2,3,4. The count is 1 (only 2 is present). steps needed is 2. So, the minimal steps for this suit is 2.\n\nBut in reality, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the function compute_sequence_steps takes the list of numbers for a suit, and returns the minimal steps needed to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nBut in the code, for the suit_numbers, we can convert it to a set, to avoid checking duplicates. Because, for example, if the numbers are [2,2,3], the set is {2,3}, which is the same as [2,3], and the code would compute the same steps.\n\nSo, to optimize, perhaps we can pass a set instead of a list. For example, in the code, for each suit, we can collect the unique numbers present.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nfor suit in suits_dict:\n\n    numbers = suits_dict[suit]\n\n    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n\n    ... compute steps based on unique_numbers.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\ndef compute_sequence_steps(unique_numbers):\n\n    min_steps = float('inf')\n\n    for x in range(1, 8):\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for num in [x, x+1, x+2]:\n\n            if num in unique_numbers:\n\n                count += 1\n\n        steps_needed = 3 - count\n\n        if steps_needed < min_steps:\n\n            min_steps = steps_needed\n\n    return min_steps\n\nBut for example, if the unique_numbers is empty (but that's impossible, since the suit has at least one tile in it). So, for each suit in suits_dict, the unique_numbers is non-empty.\n\nSo, for each suit, compute the minimal steps for that suit, then take the minimal across all suits.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nsuit_steps = []\n\nfor suit, numbers in suits_dict.items():\n\n    unique_numbers = set(numbers)\n\n    steps = compute_sequence_steps(unique_numbers)\n\n    suit_steps.append(steps)\n\nsequence_steps = min(suit_steps) if suit_steps else float('inf')\n\nSo, the minimal steps for sequence is the minimal steps across all suits.\n\nNow, the overall minimal steps is the minimum between triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nSo, the answer is min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps).\n\nBut wait, what if there are no suits with enough numbers to form a sequence? Like, if the three tiles are in three different suits. For example, 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, for each suit, the unique_numbers is {1}, {2}, {3}. For each suit, the minimal steps would be:\n\nfor x in 1-7:\n\nfor suit m, numbers {1}:\n\nfor x=1: sequence 1-2-3 → count is 1 (only 1 is present). steps needed 2.\n\nfor x= - (no other sequences possible). So, the minimal steps for this suit is 2.\n\nSame for others. So, the sequence_steps is 2. The triplet_steps is 3-1=2. So, the answer is 2.\n\nBut what's the minimal steps? Well, adding two tiles to form a triplet (say, two more 1m's) or adding two tiles to form a sequence (like 2m and 3m for the 1m suit). So, the answer is 2.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All three tiles are same suit and numbers are 1, 1, 2. So, for triplet, steps is 3 - 2 = 1. For sequence: the suit has numbers {1,2}. The minimal steps for sequence is 1 (add 3). So, the answer is min(1, 1) = 1.\n\nEdge case 2: tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. For sequence steps, for suit m, unique numbers {1,3,5}.\n\nFor each possible x:\n\nx=1: sequence 1,2,3 → count is 2 (1 and 3). steps needed 1.\n\nx=2: 2,3,4 → count is 1 (3).\n\nx=3: 3,4,5 → count is 2 (3 and 5). steps needed 1.\n\nx=4: 4,5,6 → count is 1 (5).\n\nx=5: 5,6,7 → count 1.\n\netc. So, the minimal steps is 1. So, the answer is min(3-1=2, 1) → 1. Which is correct: adding 2m to form 1-2-3, or adding 4m to form 3-4-5, etc.\n\nAnother edge case: tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. The triplet steps is 1 (add another 1m). For the sequence steps: the suit has {1,2}. So, steps needed is 1 (add 3m). So, the answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. So, the sequence steps for the suit is {1,2,4}.\n\nPossible x:\n\nx=1 → sequence 1,2,3 → count 2 (1 and 2",
