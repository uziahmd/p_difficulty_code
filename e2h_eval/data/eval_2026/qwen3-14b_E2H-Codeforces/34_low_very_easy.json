And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I have to compute the average of their sleep times. Then, I have to find the average of all those averages. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says that the answer is the sum of all the weeks' averages divided by the number of weeks? Or is it the average of all the averages?\n\nWait, looking back at the note in the third example: the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So for example, if there are 7 weeks, each with their own sum (since average is sum divided by k), then the total average is (sum of all the sums) divided by (number of weeks * k) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The problem says that Polycarp is going to consider each week (each consecutive k days) and calculate the average for each. Then, the output is the average of all those averages. Wait, but the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Let me check the example.\n\nIn the third example input, n=8, k=2. So there are 8-2+1 = 7 weeks. Each week's average is sum of the two days divided by 2. Then, the overall average is the average of those 7 averages. Which would be equal to (sum of all the sums of the weeks) divided by (7 * 2). But the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check the example.\n\nThe third example input is:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo the weeks are:\n\n[1,2] sum 3 → avg 1.5\n\n[2,4] sum 6 → avg 3\n\n[4,100000] sum 100004 → avg 50002\n\n[100000,123] sum 100123 → avg 50061.5\n\n[123,456] sum 579 → avg 289.5\n\n[456,789] sum 1245 → avg 622.5\n\n[789,1] sum 790 → avg 395\n\nSo the sum of these averages is 1.5 + 3 + 50002 + 50061.5 + 289.5 + 622.5 + 395 = let's compute that.\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\nStart with 1.5 +3 = 4.5\n\nAdd 50002 → 50006.5\n\nAdd 50061.5 → 100068\n\nAdd 289.5 → 100357.5\n\nAdd 622.5 → 100980\n\nAdd 395 → 101375.\n\nThen the average of these 7 averages is 101375 /7 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see 101375 divided by 7. Well, 7*14482 = 101374. So 14482.142857... which is 14482.142857...\n\nBut according to the sample output, the answer is 28964.2857142857. Wait, that's exactly double of that. Because 101375/7 is 14482.142857... but the sample output is 28964.2857... which is exactly twice that. So that suggests that perhaps the problem statement is not asking for the average of the averages, but the average of the sums?\n\nWait, the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So in the example, the sum of all weeks would be 3 +6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790. Let's calculate that.\n\n3 +6 is 9. Add 100004 → 100013. Add 100123",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week consists of `k` consecutive days from a list of `n` recorded sleep times. The solution involves efficiently calculating the sum of each consecutive `k`-day window and then computing the overall average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each `k`-day window. This allows us to avoid recalculating the sum from scratch for each window, thus optimizing the solution.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array**: We first compute the prefix sum array of the given list of sleep times. This helps in quickly determining the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n3. **Sum of All Windows**: Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum of each `k`-day window and accumulate these sums. Finally, we divide the total sum by the number of such windows to get the required average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        total = 0\n        # Compute prefix sums\n        prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n        \n        # Calculate the sum of each window\n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        sum_total = 0\n        for i in range(num_weeks):\n            start = i\n            end = i + k\n            sum_total += prefix[end] - prefix[start]\n        \n        average = sum_total / num_weeks\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \n        # Check if there are more test cases\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing. Each line is processed to extract the values of `n` (number of days) and `k` (number of days per week), followed by the list of sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: A prefix sum array is constructed where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This allows for quick sum calculations of any subarray.\n3. **Sliding Window Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum array, the sum of each `k`-day window is calculated efficiently. These sums are accumulated to compute the total sum of all such windows.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time per week, which is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for large input sizes up to the given constraints.",
