She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nSo, Luba has n tabs open, numbered 1 to n from left to right. The mouse is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs except those from l to r inclusive. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to do this. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but within the current a and b, which are the min and max of the unclosed tabs), or close all tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\nHmm. So, the challenge is figuring out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to get to the desired state with the least time.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. First, check if the current tabs already satisfy the condition. Like, if l=1 and r=n, then nothing needs to be done. So the answer is 0. Also, if the current position is already in the [l, r] range, maybe some steps can be saved.\n\nBut the main thing is that she needs to close tabs outside of [l, r]. So, the tabs to the left of l and to the right of r must be closed. But how?\n\nThe key here is that closing tabs can be done in one second, but only if the cursor is positioned correctly. For example, to close all tabs to the left of the current cursor position, you need to be at a certain position. But when you close tabs, the a and b values change, which affects the movement.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when you close tabs, the a and b are the min and max of the unclosed tabs. So, for example, if you close tabs to the left of the cursor, then the new a becomes the current cursor's position (since all tabs to the left are closed). Or wait, no. Suppose the current a is 1 and b is 6. If the cursor is at position 3, and you close all tabs to the left (so tabs 1 and 2 are closed). Then the new a is 3, since that's the min of the remaining tabs. Similarly, if you close tabs to the right, then the new b is the current cursor's position.\n\nSo, the strategy would involve moving the cursor to the correct positions to perform these closes, and then doing the closes.\n\nLet me think of the steps required. The tabs to be closed are those less than l and those greater than r. So, we need to close all tabs left of l and all tabs right of r.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nLet me consider the case where l is 2 and r is 4, and the initial position is 3. For example, the first sample input: 6 3 2 4. The desired tabs are 2-4. So, the tabs to close are 1,5,6. How to do that?\n\nIn the sample explanation, she moves to tab 2, closes left (which would close tab 1), then moves to tab 3, then 4, then closes right (closing 5 and 6). The steps take 5 seconds.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nMove from 3 to 2 (1 sec). Close left (1 sec). Now, the a is 2, b is 6. Then, move from 2 to 3 (1 sec), then to 4 (another sec). Then close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1+1 + 2 + 1 = 5?\n\nWait, the movement steps are counted as per each move. So moving from 3 to 2 is one step. Then closing is another step. Then moving to 3 (another step), then moving to 4 (another step), then closing (another step). So total of 1 (move) + 1 (close) + 2 (moves) + 1 (close) = 5 steps. That's correct.\n\nSo the idea is that to close the left side, you need to be at position l, and then close left. Similarly, to close the right side, you need to be at position r, and then close right. But perhaps there are other ways?\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can close left and right in a different order. For example, if you first close the right side, then the left. But depends on the current position.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to figuring out the minimal steps needed to reach the positions where you can perform the closes, and then perform them.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the two required operations: closing left of l and closing right of r. However, sometimes these may not be needed. For example, if l is 1, then there's no tabs to the left to close. Similarly, if r is n, no tabs to the right.\n\nSo, first, determine whether we need to close left and/or right.\n\nCase 1: l == 1 and r == n. Then nothing to do. Answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: l == 1. Then need to close tabs to the right of r. So, the steps would be to move to position r, then close right.\n\nCase 3: r == n. Then need to close tabs to the left of l. So move to position l, close left.\n\nCase 4: Both l > 1 and r < n. Need to close left of l and right of r. So, need to perform both operations.\n\nBut how to arrange the order of these operations to minimize the steps.\n\nFor example, if you have to close left and right, then the order depends on the current position and the positions of l and r.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we need to close left and right. So, the optimal way is to perform one of the closes first, then the other. But which order is better?\n\nFor example, suppose the current position is pos. Let's say that after closing left, the a becomes l, and then closing right would be possible from position r. But what's the movement steps needed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal steps can be calculated by considering two possibilities: first closing left then right, or first closing right then left. Take the minimum between the two.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nIf we need to close left (i.e., l > 1) and right (r < n), then compute the time for both orders and choose the minimum.\n\nSo, for each scenario, what is the time required?\n\nLet me think about the first scenario: closing left first, then right.\n\nTo close left, you need to be at position l, then close left. Then, after closing left, the a is l, and the b is n. Then, to close right, you need to be at position r, then close right. So, how many steps does that take?\n\nThe steps would be:\n\nTime to move from pos to l (steps: |pos - l|). Then, 1 second to close left. Then, move from l to r (steps: |r - l|). Then, 1 second to close right. Total steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nAlternatively, if you first close right, then left. Then:\n\nTime to move from pos to r (steps: |pos - r|). Then 1 sec to close right. Then move from r to l (steps: |r - l|). Then 1 sec to close left. Total steps: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nSo the minimal between these two options would be the minimum of the two.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. For example, maybe after closing left, you can move to r more efficiently. But in this case, after closing left, the current position is l, and the a is l, and the b is n. So moving from l to r is |r - l| steps. Similarly for the other case.\n\nSo, the minimal steps for this case is min( |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2, |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2 )\n\nBut wait, the |r - l| is same in both cases. So the difference is between |pos - l| and |pos - r|. So the minimal between |pos - l| + ... and |pos - r| + ... would be the minimal of (|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut maybe there's another way. For example, if the current position is already in the [l, r] range, then maybe we can do something else.\n\nWait, but in this case, the problem requires that we need to close the tabs outside of [l, r]. So, for example, if the current position is inside [l, r], then perhaps we can close left and right in some way. But in the case where l > 1 and r < n, we need to close both left and right. So regardless of the current position, we need to perform both operations.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. For example, if the current position is already at l, then closing left takes 1 second, then moving to r takes (r - l) steps, then closing right takes 1 second. So total steps would be (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut the same as the previous calculation.\n\nSo, in general, when both left and right need to be closed, the minimal steps would be the minimum between the two options: closing left first or closing right first.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l or r?\n\nBut the formula would handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about other cases.\n\nCase where only left needs to be closed (r == n). So, we need to close all tabs to the left of l. How?\n\nTo close all tabs to the left of l, you need to be at position l, then close left. So the steps would be moving from pos to l (steps: |pos - l|), then 1 second to close. So total steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already at l? Then it's just 1 second.\n\nSimilarly for the case where only the right needs to be closed (l == 1). Then, move to r, then close right. Steps: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nNow, what if the current position is already in the correct place?\n\nLike, for example, in the second sample input: 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. So the tabs to the right of 3 (tabs 4,5,6) need to be closed. So the current position is 3. So moving to r (3) is zero steps. Then close right, which takes 1 second. So total steps is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: third input is 5 2 1 5. So l=1, r=5. No need to close anything. So answer is 0.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFirst, determine whether we need to close left (l > 1) and/or right (r < n).\n\nThen, based on that, compute the required steps.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n: answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nIf l == 1: need to close right. So steps are (steps to move to r) + 1.\n\nIf r == n: need to close left. Steps are (steps to move to l) + 1.\n\nElse: need to close both left and right. Compute the two options (close left first or close right first) and take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, pos is between l and r. Then, moving to l or r would take some steps, but perhaps the minimal steps would be the same as above.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l? Then steps to close left is 1. Then steps to move to r is (r - l) steps, then close right (1). So total steps is (r - l) + 2. Which is the same as the formula.\n\nBut what if there's a way to do it faster? For example, if after closing left, you can close right without moving? Probably not, because after closing left, the a is l, and the b is n. So, to close the right, you need to be at position r. So you have to move from l to r.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to do it in a different order. For example, if you first move to r, close right, then move to l, close left. Which is the same as the previous calculation.\n\nSo, the formula seems correct.\n\nBut let me think about another scenario. Suppose l is 2, r is 4. pos is 3. Then, the steps for closing left first would be:\n\nMove from 3 to 2 (1 step), close left (1). Then move from 2 to 4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 1+1+2+1 = 5 steps. Which matches the first sample.\n\nAlternatively, closing right first: move from 3 to 4 (1 step), close right (1). Then move from 4 to 2 (2 steps), close left (1). Total steps 1+1+2+1=5. Same as before. So the minimum between the two is 5.\n\nSo the formula for both options gives the same result.\n\nSo, the formula for the case when both left and right need to be closed is:\n\nmin( (steps to move to l) + (steps to move from l to r) + 2, (steps to move to r) + (steps to move from r to l) + 2 )\n\nBut steps to move from l to r is |r - l|. Similarly for steps from r to l. So the formula is:\n\nmin( |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2, |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2 )\n\nWhich simplifies to |r - l| + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut that's the same as |r - l| + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nSo, the code can compute that.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nif l == 1:\n\n   # need to close right. So steps to move to r, then close.\n\n   steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelif r == n:\n\n   # need to close left. steps to move to l, then close.\n\n   steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n   # need to close both left and right. Compute both options.\n\n   option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n   option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n   steps = min(option1, option2)\n\nprint(steps)\n\nWait, but what if l is 1 and r is not n? Then, we need to close right. So, the code would take the steps to move to r, then close right. But what about the left side? Because l is 1, so there are no tabs to the left of l. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, if r is n, then no need to close right. So the code handles that.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is not n, but the current position is already to the right of r? For example, n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=3. Then steps would be |5 - 3| + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 steps. Which would be moving from 5 to 3 (2 steps), then closing right (1 step). Which closes tabs 4 and 5. Correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at r? Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut let me check the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2: 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. So since l=1, code checks if r ==n? No, since n is 6. So steps is |3 - 3| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the third one: 5 2 1 5. Since l=1 and r=5 (n=5), code returns 0. Correct.\n\nWhat about the first sample input: 6 3 2 4. Here, l=2, r=4. So neither l=1 nor r=6. So code computes option1 and option2.\n\noption1 is |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5?\n\nWait, |pos - l| is 3-2=1. |r - l| is 4-2=2. So option1 is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\noption2 is |3-4| + 2 + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. So min(5,5) is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: let's imagine n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 4,5).\n\nSo steps:\n\noption1: move to l (2) from pos (1): 1 step. Then move from 2 to 3 (1 step). Then close right. So total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4? Wait, according to the formula, option1 is |1-2| + |3-2| + 2 → 1 +1 +2=4. option2 is |1-3| + 1 + 2 → 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. So min is 4. So steps is 4. Let's see:\n\nMove from 1 to 2 (1 sec). Close left (tabs 1). Then move from 2 to 3 (1 sec). Close right (tabs 4-5). So total steps: 1 + 1 (for the closes) + 1 (move) → 1+1+1+1? Wait, the formula says 1 (move to l) + 1 (steps to move from l to r) + 2 (the two closes). So 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 steps. Yes.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 4,5). So steps for option1: move from 5 to 2 (3 steps), then move to 3 (1 step), then two closes. Total 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 steps. Option2: move to r (3) from 5: 2 steps. Then move to l (2) (1 step). Then two closes. Total 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 steps. So the code would choose 5 steps. Which is better.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about when the current position is already in the [l, r] range?\n\nLike, n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=3. Then, need to close right (tabs 4,5). So steps are |2 - 3| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Which is correct: move to 3 (1 step) and close right (1 step).\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=4. So need to close right (tabs 5). So steps: |2-4| + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 steps. Move to 4 (two steps), close right (1 step). Correct.\n\nNow, what about if l is 3 and r is 5, and n is 5. So l=3, r=5. So r ==n, so code checks if r ==n. Then steps is |pos - l| + 1. So if pos is 1, then steps is |1-3| +1 = 2 +1 = 3. Which would be moving from 1 to 3 (two steps), then close left (tabs 1 and 2). Correct.\n\nBut wait, in this case, l is 3, so closing left would close tabs from a to i-1. But when you are at position 3, closing left would close all tabs to the left of 3 (tabs 1 and 2). Which is correct.\n\nSo, this seems to cover all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when the current position is already in the [l, r] range, but the l and r are not at the edges. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5). So steps would be min( |3-2| + (4-2) + 2, |3-4| + (4-2) + 2 ) → min(1 + 2 + 2=5, 1 + 2 + 2=5). So 5 steps.\n\nWhich would be, for example, move to 2 (1 step), close left (1), move to 4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5 steps. Correct.\n\nBut is there a better way? Let's think. What if you first close left and right in a different way?\n\nNo, because you need to close both. So you have to move to the positions to perform the closes.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: when l = r. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=3. So need to close all tabs except 3. So, need to close left (tabs 1,2) and right (tabs 4,5). So steps would be min( |3-3| + (3-3) + 2, ... ). So option1 is 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 steps. So steps is 2. Which would be: close left (from position 3) and then close right (from position 3). But how?\n\nWait, when you are at position 3, you can close left (which closes tabs 1 and 2) and then close right (tabs 4 and 5). So that's two operations. So the steps would be 2 seconds. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So code would compute that.\n\nSo, the code logic seems solid.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nThe code needs to read the input. Wait, the input is given as multiple lines? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line with four integers. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. But the problem says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\" So perhaps the actual input is a single line with four integers. However, the sample shows three test cases. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the problem says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\" So perhaps the user is supposed to read a single test case. But the sample input shows three lines. Wait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo, the input is a single line with four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines. Wait, perhaps that's an error in the problem statement. For example, the sample input may be three separate test cases, but the code should read one line per test case. However, the original problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of inputs, but the actual code should read one line.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is ['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5'], which seems to be a list of three test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So this might be a formatting error. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate lines, each being a test case. But the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut the user's task is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin and outputs the correct answer. So for the code, perhaps the input is one line with four integers. But the sample input shows three lines, but the sample output shows three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says \"the only line of input\" which suggests that it's a single test case.\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut that's probably indicating that the code should read multiple test cases, each on a separate line. However, the problem statement says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\" which implies that it's a single test case. But perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, but the problem statement is not clear.\n\nBut looking at the note in the problem statement, the first sample input is '6 3 2 4' which outputs 5, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single line of input. However, in the sample input, there are three lines. This is conflicting.\n\nBut the user's instruction says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, and for each test case, output the answer. But how many test cases are there?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the input is given as a single line. However, the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple lines, each being a separate test case. But the problem statement says that the input is a single line. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces or similar, and the sample input shows three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case per line. So, the code should read lines until EOF, processing each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut given that the sample input is given as three lines, and the sample output is three lines, the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line. So this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as a list of three strings, perhaps the code should read multiple lines. But in practice, for programming competition problems, the code should read from stdin, which may have multiple lines. So, perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\" which suggests that there's only one test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the original problem's sample input and output, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases, each on their own line. For example, the sample input is three lines, each with four integers, and the sample output is three lines with the answers.\n\nBut given that the user's code needs to be written, perhaps the code should read from stdin, and process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them, and process each line.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single line. However, the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the user's sample input and output are given as lists, I think that the code should read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the original problem statement says \"the only line of input\" which is confusing. However, the sample input shows multiple lines, and the sample output shows multiple lines. Therefore, perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nSo, the code should read each line, split into four integers, process them, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. However, given the sample input, I think the code should handle multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, for each line, split into n, pos, l, r, compute the answer, and print.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps the code should read one line of input, and output one line of output. But given the sample, perhaps the code should handle multiple lines.\n\nBut given that the user's example shows three lines of input and three lines of output, I think that the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nTherefore, in Python, the code would read from sys.stdin, split each line into four integers, and process them.\n\nBut let's check the sample input. For example, the first sample input line is '6 3 2 4', which outputs 5. Let's see:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. As discussed earlier, the answer is 5.\n\nSo, the code would process each line.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe can proceed with the following steps:\n\nRead each line from input (probably via sys.stdin), split into four integers.\n\nFor each line, compute the answer as per the logic discussed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    line = line.strip()\n    if not line:\n        continue\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, line.split())\n    # process\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        if l == 1:\n            # close right\n            steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n        elif r == n:\n            # close left\n            steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n        else:\n            # close both\n            option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n            option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n            steps = min(option1, option2)\n        print(steps)\n\nWait, but in the case where l is not 1 and r is not n, but the code is computing (r - l) + ... ?\n\nWait, |r - l| is r - l, since r >= l. So yes.\n\nBut in code, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the code uses (r - l) instead of abs(r - l). But since r >= l, it's okay.\n\nBut in code, for the case of option1 and option2, the code uses (r - l) as the distance between l and r. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if l > r? No, the input says that l <= r.\n\nYes, the input constraints say 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input line 1: 6 3 2 4 → l is 2, r is 4. Not 1 or n. So compute option1 and option2.\n\noption1 = |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\noption2 = |3-4| + 2 + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. steps is 5. Correct.\n\nSample input line 2: 6 3 1 3. l is 1, so steps is |3 - 3| + 1 → 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nSample input line 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5 (n=5). So print 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So l is not 1, r is not 5. So option1: |1-2| + (3-2) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. option2: |1-3| + 1 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. So steps is 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. So steps is min( |5-2| + 1 + 2, |5-3| + 1 + 2 ) → |5-2|=3, 3 + 1 + 2 = 6? Wait, no. Wait, option1 is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2 → 3 + 1 + 2 = 6. option2 is |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 → |5-3|=2, 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. So steps is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about when l is 1 and r is not n. For example, n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=3. So steps is |5-3| + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when l=3, r=5, n=5. So r ==n. steps is |pos - l| + 1. For example, pos is 1: |1-3| +1 = 2 + 1 = 3 steps. Which is correct.\n\nWhat if l=3, r=5, pos=3. Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct: close left (tabs 1 and 2) in one step.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code reads each line, splits into four integers, and processes as per the logic.\n\nBut in Python, when reading from stdin, using for line in sys.stdin: will read all lines, including possible empty lines. So, perhaps adding a check for empty lines.\n\nBut in practice, the code may be tested with multiple test cases, each on their own line.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        n, pos, l, r = map(int, line.split())\n        if l == 1 and r == n:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            if l == 1:\n                steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n            elif r == n:\n                steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n            else:\n                option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n                option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n                steps = min(option1, option2)\n            print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, the code could have l=1 and r !=n, but also r =n. But the first condition checks if l ==1 and r ==n, which would be handled first.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs except those within a specified range [l, r]. The solution involves efficiently moving the cursor and closing tabs to minimize the time spent.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the required range [l, r] already includes all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no action is needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Closing Tabs on One Side**:\n   - If the left boundary of the range is 1 (l=1), only the tabs to the right of r need to be closed. The time required is the time to move the cursor to position r plus one second to close the tabs.\n   - If the right boundary of the range is n (r=n), only the tabs to the left of l need to be closed. The time required is the time to move the cursor to position l plus one second to close the tabs.\n3. **Closing Tabs on Both Sides**: If both sides need closing, calculate the time for two possible strategies:\n   - Move to the left boundary (l), close the left tabs, then move to the right boundary (r) and close the right tabs.\n   - Move to the right boundary (r), close the right tabs, then move to the left boundary (l) and close the left tabs.\n   - Choose the minimum time between these two strategies.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        n, pos, l, r = map(int, line.split())\n        if l == 1 and r == n:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            if l == 1:\n                steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n            elif r == n:\n                steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n            else:\n                option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n                option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n                steps = min(option1, option2)\n            print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each representing a test case.\n- **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] covers all tabs, the result is immediately 0.\n- **Single Side Closing**: For cases where only one side needs closing, the time is calculated based on the distance from the current cursor position to the respective boundary.\n- **Both Sides Closing**: When both sides need closing, the optimal strategy is determined by evaluating the minimum time required for either closing the left side first or the right side first, considering the movement and closing operations involved.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal time required by considering all possible optimal paths for closing the tabs.",
