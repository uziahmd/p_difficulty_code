The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round, they use their own sequences cyclically. The key here is to simulate the rounds efficiently because n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big for a straightforward simulation.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to model their choices for each round. Let's think about the sequences. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nBut simulating each of the n rounds directly is impossible for large n. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so we can calculate the total losses without iterating through all n steps.\n\nLet's think about the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the pattern of moves between the two players will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Therefore, if we can compute the number of losses in one full cycle (of length LCM(m, k)), then we can multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the result for the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n2. For each round in 0 to period-1, determine who wins and count the losses for each player.\n3. The total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period.\n4. The remaining rounds are remainder = n % period.\n5. Multiply the counts from one period by total_periods, then add the counts from the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but it returns the absolute value, and since m and k are positive, that's fine. However, note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the correct value for positive integers.\n\nSo first, compute the LCM of m and k.\n\nOnce I have the period, I can simulate the first period rounds and calculate how many times each player loses in that period. Then multiply by the number of full periods, and then add the results for the remaining rounds.\n\nBut what if the period is very large? For example, if m and k are 1000 each, then the LCM could be up to 1e6. But since m and k are up to 1000, the maximum LCM would be 1000*1000 = 1e6. Which is manageable. Because even for 1e6 rounds, simulating each round is feasible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute the number of losses for each player in one full period (let's say, per_period_nik, per_period_poly). Then total_periods = n // period, and the remainder is rem = n % period. Then total_nik = per_period_nik * total_periods + count_losses_in_rem_rounds(nik, poly, rem). Similarly for poly.\n\nSo the main challenge is to compute the per_period counts and the counts for the remainder.\n\nNow, how to compute the per_period counts?\n\nFor each round in 0 to period-1:\n\n- Get the move of Nikephoros: A[i % m]\n- Get the move of Polycarpus: B[i % k]\n- Determine who wins, and increment the respective counters.\n\nSo for each i from 0 to period-1:\n\nBut period can be up to 1e6. So for each i, we can compute the moves, check the outcome, and accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce that's done, multiply by total_periods.\n\nThen for the remainder, we need to process the first rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1) and add those counts.\n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B as strings.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute per_period_nik, per_period_poly by simulating period rounds.\n\ntotal_periods = n // period\n\nrem = n % period\n\nCompute rem_nik, rem_poly by simulating rem rounds.\n\nTotal nik = per_period_nik * total_periods + rem_nik\n\nSame for poly.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM?\n\nImplementing LCM:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to handle the case when a or b is zero? But since m and k are at",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use the concept of least common multiple (LCM) to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds.\n2. **Period Calculation**: The pattern of moves for both players will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. This period allows us to compute the number of losses in one full cycle and then extrapolate this to the total number of rounds.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: Calculate the number of losses for each player in one full period (LCM(m, k) rounds).\n4. **Extrapolate Results**: Use the results from one period to compute the total losses for all full periods and then handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef count_losses(rounds, a_seq, b_seq, m, k):\n    nik = 0\n    poly = 0\n    for i in range(rounds):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_move = a_seq[a_idx]\n        b_move = b_seq[b_idx]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine winner\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n           (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n           (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            poly += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            nik += 1\n    return nik, poly\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a_seq = input[1]\n    b_seq = input[2]\n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    period = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Calculate losses in one period\n    per_period_nik, per_period_poly = count_losses(period, a_seq, b_seq, m, k)\n    \n    total_periods = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    # Calculate losses in remainder rounds\n    rem_nik, rem_poly = count_losses(remainder, a_seq, b_seq, m, k)\n    \n    total_nik = per_period_nik * total_periods + rem_nik\n    total_poly = per_period_poly * total_periods + rem_poly\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Loss Counting in One Period**: The number of losses for each player is calculated over one full period of LCM(m, k) rounds.\n4. **Extrapolation**: The total number of full periods in `n` rounds is determined. The losses from these full periods are multiplied by the number of periods. The remaining rounds after the full periods are simulated separately to get the final counts.\n5. **Output**: The total number of red spots for both players is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle large values of `n` by leveraging the repeating pattern of moves, thus avoiding the need to simulate each round individually.",
