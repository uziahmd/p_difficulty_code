Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Vasily and his candles. So he starts with 'a' candles. Each burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The thing is, every 'b' used candles can be turned into a new one. And this new one can be used again, burning for another hour, and then possibly contributing to more candles. The question is to find out the total number of hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2. So initially, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 used ones can be turned into 4/2 = 2 new candles. He uses those, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 used ones can be turned into 1 new candle. So that adds 1 hour. Then, after that, he has 1 used candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4+2+1=7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Those give 2 hours. Then 2 used candles. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. Wait but the output is 8. Wait 6 + 2 is 8. Oh right. Wait the example says output is 8. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones, adding to the total hours and keeping track of the new used candles.\n\nSo how to model this?\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n- Start with 'a' candles. Total hours is initially a.\n- The number of used candles is a.\n- Then, while the number of used candles is >= b:\n   - Convert them into new candles. The number of new candles is (used_candles // b)\n   - Add that number to the total hours.\n   - The new used candles are the (used_candles % b) + (new_candles), because the ones that were used to make the new ones are now gone (they're converted into new ones), but the new ones will be used and added to the used pile once they burn out.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take the first example:\n\nInitial a=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours = 4. used =4.\n\nFirst iteration: 4//2 = 2. So add 2 to total (now 6). The used becomes 4%2=0 + 2 (the new candles). So used is 2.\n\nSecond iteration: 2//2=1. Add 1 to total (7). used becomes 0 +1 =1.\n\nThird iteration: 1 <2, so stop. So total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours =6. used=6.\n\nFirst iteration: 6//3=2. Add 2 (total 8). used is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2<3, so done. So total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total = a\n\nused = a\n\nloop:\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n   new_candles = used // b\n\n   total += new_candles\n\n   used = (used % b) + new_candles\n\nrepeat until used <b.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nSo in code, we can do this with a loop.\n\nNow, the code needs to read a and b from input, compute this.\n\nLet me think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if a=1, b=2? Then initial total is 1. used is 1. Since 1 <2, nothing else. So output 1.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. used is 5. 5//5=1. total becomes 6. used is 0 +1=1. Now 1<5. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Initial total 5. used=5.\n\n5//3=1. total becomes 6. used is 5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nNow, 3 >=3. So 3//3=1. total is 7. used is 0 +1=1. So done. So total is 7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >=b:\n\n    new = used //b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = used %b + new\n\nreturn total.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code",
