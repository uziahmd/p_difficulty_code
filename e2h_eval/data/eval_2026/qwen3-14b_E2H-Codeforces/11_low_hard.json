A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs and what each part contributes.\n\nThe inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend?), wait no. Wait, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink per toast. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml, one slice, and np grams. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend requires those things. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl ml. Because each of the n friends has nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (one per friend), and n * np grams of salt.\n\nSo the total resources available:\n\nDrink: k * l ml.\n\nLime slices: c * d slices.\n\nSalt: p grams.\n\nNow, the number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's say the total number of toasts is t. Then:\n\nFor the drink: total required is t * n * nl. This must be ≤ k*l.\n\nFor the lime slices: total required is t * n. Must be ≤ c*d.\n\nFor the salt: total required is t * n * np. Must be ≤ p.\n\nSo, the maximum t is the minimum of (total drink // (n * nl), total lime slices // n, total salt // (n * np)).\n\nWait, but for each resource, the maximum possible t is (available resource) divided by (per toast requirement). But since t must be an integer, we take the floor of that division.\n\nSo for each resource, compute how many toasts can be made given that resource, then take the minimum of those three numbers.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l.\n\ntotal_drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d.\n\ntotal_lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nBut wait, in the first example:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Because per toast, each friend needs 3 ml, so for 3 friends, 3*3=9 per toast. So total_drink_toasts is 20 // 9 = 2 (since 9*2=18 ≤20, 9*3=27>20). \n\nLime slices: c=10, d=8. Total slices is 80. Each toast needs 3 slices (n=3). 80//3 is 26. But wait, in the sample explanation, they said that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, total_lime_toasts is 80//3 = 26. So why does the sample explanation say 80?\n\nWait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nAh! Oh right! Wait, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check:\n\nIn the first sample, the input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So c=10 limes, cut into d=8 slices each. So total slices is 10*8=80. Each toast requires one",
