A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires each friend to have nl milliliters. Wait, no. Wait the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. Oh right. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs these things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each friend has nl for their toast. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl. Similarly, each toast requires n slices (one per friend), and n * np grams of salt.\n\nSo the resources available are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made with that resource, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor the drink: total drink is (k*l) ml. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the number of toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, since each toast requires n * nl, the total toasts is total_drink // (n * nl). Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose total drink is T. Each toast requires per friend nl, so for all friends, per toast, it's n * nl. So the maximum number of toasts is T divided by (n * nl), integer division.\n\nSimilarly for the lime slices: total slices is c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So number of toasts is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt: total is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So number of toasts is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nWait, but the example given in the first input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nLet me compute each part.\n\nDrink: k*l = 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires n * nl = 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., integer division gives 2.\n\nLime slices: c*d=10*8=80. Each toast requires n slices, which is 3. 80//3 is 26.666... so 26.\n\nSalt: p is 100, n * np is 3*1=3. 100//3 is 33. So the min of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is to calculate for each resource the maximum possible toasts, then take the minimum of them.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\ntotal_salt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nThen answer is min of these three numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if any of these values is zero? Like if the total_drink is less than n * nl, then total_drink_toasts is zero, so the answer is zero.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input numbers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink_available = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = drink_available // (n * nl)\n\nlime_available = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = lime_available // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np",
