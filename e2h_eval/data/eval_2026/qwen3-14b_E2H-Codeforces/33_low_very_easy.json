You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number with some given digits to make it as large as possible. The key points here are:\n\nThe input is a number 'a' as a string, and a sequence of digits 's'. Each digit in s can be used once. The goal is to replace digits in a with digits from s to maximize the value. And I can choose not to use all elements from s.\n\nSo, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, I think the optimal strategy is to replace the leftmost possible digits with the largest possible digits from s. But wait, there's a catch. Because the digits in s can be used once each, but we can choose which ones to use. So maybe we should sort the s digits in descending order, then for each position in a, starting from the left, if the current digit can be replaced with a larger digit from s, we do so. But how to manage that?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose a is '1024' and s is '010'. Then sorted s in descending order is '100'. So, the first digit is 1. The first element in sorted s is 1. So replacing it would not help, since 1 is same as original. But maybe the next digits. Let's look at the example given. The input is '1024' and s is '010'. The output is '1124'. So the first digit is 1, but they replaced the second digit (0) with 1. Oh right. Because the sorted s is '100', so the first digit in s is 1. So for the first digit in a, which is 1, we can't replace it with a higher digit (since 1 is the highest in s). So then, we look for the next digits. The second digit in a is 0. We can replace it with 1, which gives a higher value. Then the remaining digits in s are 0 and 0. Then the third digit in a is 2. The next available digit is 0, which is smaller than 2. So we don't replace. Then the fourth digit is 4. Also no replacement. So the result is 1124.\n\nSo the approach is: sort the s digits in descending order. Then, for each digit in a from left to right, check if the current digit can be replaced with the next available digit in the sorted s. If the current digit is less than the next available digit in s, replace it and move to the next digit in s. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple digits in s that are higher than the current digit? For example, if s is sorted in descending order, then the first available digit that is higher than the current digit is the best choice. Because replacing the leftmost possible digits with the largest possible digits gives the maximum value.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Sort the digits in s in descending order. Let's call this sorted_s.\n\n- Then, iterate through each digit in a, from left to right.\n\n- For each position, if there are any digits left in sorted_s that are larger than the current digit, replace it with the first such digit (which is the largest possible available), and remove that digit from sorted_s. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nWait, but sorted_s is sorted in descending order. So, for example, if sorted_s is [9,8,7], and the current digit is 5, we take 9 and replace it. But if the current digit is 9, then we can't replace it with any of the digits in sorted_s (since they are all 9 or lower). So we leave it.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nSort s in descending order.\n\nInitialize a pointer j starting at 0.\n\nFor each i from 0 to len(a)-1:\n\n   if j < len(s) and s_sorted[j] > a[i]:\n\n       replace a[i] with s_sorted[j], increment j.\n\n   else:\n\n       leave a[i] as is.\n\nThis way, we greedily replace the leftmost digits with the largest possible available digits.\n\nBut why does this work? Because replacing a digit in a more significant position (left) with a larger digit gives a bigger increase in the overall value than replacing a digit in a less significant position. So even if there's a larger digit later, but we can replace a left digit with a larger one, that's better.\n\nFor example, consider a = '1234' and s is ['9', '8']. The sorted s is ['9','8']. Replace the first digit (1) with 9, resulting in 9234. Which is better than replacing the 2 with 9 (1934) or 3 with",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given integer by replacing its digits with a sequence of provided digits. The goal is to use the provided digits in such a way that the resulting number is the largest possible.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Provided Digits**: First, we sort the sequence of provided digits in descending order. This allows us to always consider the largest available digit first when making replacements.\n2. **Greedy Replacement**: Iterate through each digit of the given number from left to right. For each digit, if the current digit can be replaced with a larger digit from the sorted sequence, perform the replacement. This greedy approach ensures that we maximize the number by making the most significant changes first.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    a = input[0]\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    # Sort the digits in s in descending order\n    sorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Convert a to a list for easy manipulation\n    a_list = list(a)\n    j = 0  # Pointer for sorted_s\n    \n    for i in range(len(a_list)):\n        if j < len(sorted_s) and sorted_s[j] > a_list[i]:\n            a_list[i] = sorted_s[j]\n            j += 1\n        # else, do nothing\n    \n    print(''.join(a_list))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string split into two parts: the number `a` and the sequence of digits `s`.\n2. **Sorting Digits**: The sequence `s` is sorted in descending order to prioritize the largest digits for replacement.\n3. **Greedy Replacement**: By iterating through each digit of `a` from left to right, we replace each digit with the largest possible available digit from the sorted sequence. This ensures that the most significant positions are maximized first, leading to the largest possible number after all valid replacements.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the number is maximized using a greedy strategy, which is optimal for this problem given the constraints.",
