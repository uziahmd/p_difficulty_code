Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. Let me think about the requirements.\n\nThe problem says that the paper forms an X if two conditions are met. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, different from the diagonals.\n\nSo, the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check if all the elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are the same.\n2. Check if all elements on the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n3. Also, check that the two diagonals have different letters from each other.\n4. Then, check all the other cells (not on either diagonal) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping cells? Like, in the case of odd n, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the middle cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking the diagonals, we need to make sure that all elements on both diagonals are the same as each other. Wait, no. The problem says that on both diagonals, all letters are the same. But does that mean that the two diagonals must have the same letter? Or each diagonal has their own same letter, but they can be different?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So for example, the main diagonal must have all same letters, and the anti-diagonal must have all same letters. But the two diagonals can have different letters? No, wait, the second condition says that all other squares (non-diagonal) have the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Wait, so the diagonals can have different letters? Or do they have to be the same?\n\nWait, the first condition says that on both diagonals all letters are the same. So each diagonal must be uniform. But the two diagonals can have different letters. However, the second condition says that all other squares (non-diagonal) have the same letter, which is different from the letters on the diagonals. Wait, but that implies that the non-diagonal letters must be different from the letters on the diagonals. But what if the two diagonals have different letters? For example, suppose the main diagonal is all 'a' and the anti-diagonal is all 'b'. Then the non-diagonal letters must be a single letter that is different from both 'a' and 'b'? Or is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nAh, so the non-diagonal letters must be different from the letters on the diagonals. But what if the diagonals have different letters? Like, if one diagonal is 'a' and the other is 'b', then the non-diagonal letters must be different from both 'a' and 'b'. But that's impossible unless all non-diagonal letters are the same and different from both. But how can that happen?\n\nWait, maybe the problem requires that both diagonals have the same letter. Because otherwise, the non-diagonal letters would have to be different from both. But for example, if the two diagonals have different letters, then the non-diagonal letters would have to be a single letter that's different from both. But that's possible. Like, if diagonals are 'a' and 'b', and the rest are 'c'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the first condition is that both diagonals have all same letters. So each diagonal is uniform. But the two diagonals can have different letters. However, the second condition says that all other squares have same letter, different from the letters on the diagonals. So that implies that the non-diagonal letters must be different from both of the diagonal letters. Which would require that the two diagonals have the same letter, because otherwise, the non-diagonal letters must be different from both, but the diagonals have two different letters. But that's possible.\n\nWait, no. Let's say the diagonals are 'a' and 'b' (each diagonal is uniform). Then the non-diagonal letters must be a single letter that is different from both. So for example, if the non-diagonal letters are all 'c', that's acceptable. But in this case, the problem's example would require that.\n\nBut looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first example input, the first case is:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nThe output is NO. Let's see why. Let's check the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that both diagonals of the grid must contain the same letter, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same letter different from the ones on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that all elements on both the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Ensure that all elements not on either diagonal are the same and different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Collect the characters on both diagonals\ndiag1 = set()\ndiag2 = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    diag1.add(grid[i][i])\n    diag2.add(grid[i][n - 1 - i])\n\n# Check if both diagonals have single unique characters\nif len(diag1) != 1 or len(diag2) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d1_char = grid[0][0]\n    d2_char = grid[0][n-1]\n    if d1_char == d2_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        # Check all non-diagonal elements\n        other_char = None\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    continue\n                c = grid[i][j]\n                if other_char is None:\n                    other_char = c\n                else:\n                    if c != other_char:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid and other_char != d1_char and other_char != d2_char:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Diagonals Check**: We use sets to collect characters from both diagonals. If either set has more than one unique character, the grid cannot form an \"X\".\n3. **Character Consistency Check**: If both diagonals have unique characters but they are the same, it's invalid. Otherwise, we check all non-diagonal elements to ensure they are the same and different from both diagonal characters.\n4. **Validation**: If all checks pass, the output is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently validate the grid against the given conditions with a time complexity of O(n²), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
