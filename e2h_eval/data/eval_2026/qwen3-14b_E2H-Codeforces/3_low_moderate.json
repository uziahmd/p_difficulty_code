Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l.\n\nFirst, I think the approach should involve sorting the lantern positions. Because if they are sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered. Because each lantern covers a range around it, but overlapping with adjacent ones. The worst case for coverage would be the largest gap between two consecutive lanterns. But also, we need to consider the ends of the street.\n\nWait, right. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a candidate for d. Similarly, if the last lantern isn't at l, then the distance from the last lantern to l is another candidate. And between lanterns, the maximum gap between two consecutive ones divided by two would be the required d for that gap. Because if two lanterns are spaced s apart, then the middle point between them would be s/2 away from each. So the maximum of all these values would be the minimal required d.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the first lantern to 0. That's (a[0] - 0) → but wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then that distance is zero. So the maximum between this and the next parts.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to l. Similarly.\n4. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference between them, divide by two. Take the maximum of these values.\n5. The answer is the maximum of all these three values (the first part, the last part, and the max between consecutive lanterns).\n\nWait, but why divide by two? Let's think. Suppose two lanterns are at positions x and y, with x < y. The distance between them is y - x. The area not covered by either lantern would be in the middle. To cover the entire street, the radius must be at least (y - x)/2. Because if you have a radius of (y - x)/2, then each lantern covers up to (x + (y-x)/2) = (x + y)/2, and the same for the other lantern. So the middle point is covered. If the radius is less than that, then there's a gap between the two lanterns.\n\nSo yes, the maximum of (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2, the first lantern's position, and the last lantern's distance to l.\n\nBut wait, the first lantern's position is a[0], so the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. But if the first lantern is at 0, then that distance is zero. Similarly for the last lantern. So the maximum of these two (the first and last) and the max between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nSo the algorithm steps would be:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through each consecutive pair, compute (a[i] - a[i-1])/2, and compare with the current max_d.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the max_d would be max(a[0], l - a[0]). Because the lantern is covering from a[0]-d to a[0]+d. So to cover the entire street, the left end (0) must be within a[0] -d, and the right end (l) must be within a[0] +d. So d must be at least a[0] (so that 0 is covered) and l - a[0] (so that l is covered). So the maximum of those two. Which is exactly what the initial step does.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they become [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nThen the first lantern is at 0, so the distance from 0 is 0. The last lantern is at 15, so the distance from l (15) is 0. Then check the consecutive differences:\n\n3-0 = 3 → divided by 2 is 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining the minimum light radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street, we can follow a systematic approach based on sorting and analyzing the gaps between lantern positions.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach Overview**\n\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: \n   Sorting helps in easily identifying the largest gaps between consecutive lanterns, which is crucial for determining the minimal radius needed for full coverage.\n\n2. **Check Edge Coverage**:\n   - The distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern.\n   - The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`).\n\n3. **Analyze Consecutive Lantern Gaps**:\n   - For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap and determine the radius needed to cover the midpoint of this gap, which is `(gap / 2)`.\n\n4. **Determine the Maximum Required Radius**:\n   The minimal required radius `d` is the maximum among:\n   - The edge distances.\n   - The maximum of `(gap / 2)` for all consecutive lanterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    n, l = map(int, data[0].split())\n    a = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n    # Check the last lantern\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i - 1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Key Steps**\n\n- **Sorting**: Ensures that we can sequentially analyze the distances between adjacent lanterns.\n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - If the first lantern is not at position 0, then the distance from the start must be covered.\n  - If the last lantern is not at position `l`, then the distance from the end must be covered.\n- **Midpoint Gap Calculation**: For any two adjacent lanterns, the midpoint requires a radius of half the gap between them to ensure full coverage.\n- **Precision Handling**: The output is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the precision requirement.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all edge cases, including when there's only one lantern or multiple lanterns at the same position.",
