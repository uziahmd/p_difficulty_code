Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The key points are:\n\n- The initial string s is given.\n- There are n queries. Each query replaces all occurrences of a digit di in the current string with ti. And these replacements are done in the order of the queries.\n- After all queries, compute the number represented by the resulting string, ignoring leading zeros (but if it's empty, treat as zero), then output mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut directly simulating each substitution step might be computationally expensive, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and each substitution could replace a lot of characters. For example, if we have a query that replaces '2' with a long string, and there are many '2's, then doing this naively would lead to O(n * len(s)) operations, which might not be feasible for large cases.\n\nWait, but the constraints say that the sum of lengths of ti across all queries is up to 1e5. So maybe we can find a way to model the substitutions efficiently without actually expanding the string each time.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. However, the order of processing queries is important. For example, if a query replaces '2' with '0', and then another query replaces '0' with '1', then the first substitution would be processed first, and the second would replace the '0's generated by the first substitution.\n\nBut if we process substitutions in reverse order, perhaps we can model the transformations more efficiently. Wait, no. Because each substitution is applied to the current state of the string. So, for example, if a query is '2->a', and then 'a->b', but the second query is replacing 'a's, which were introduced by the first substitution. So the order is crucial.\n\nBut how can we model this without expanding the string?\n\nAn alternative approach: think of each digit in the original string as being transformed through all the substitutions. But since substitutions can be applied multiple times, perhaps we can track for each digit what it would be replaced with after all substitutions.\n\nWait, but substitutions are applied in sequence. For example, suppose the first substitution is '2->3', and the second is '3->4'. Then, any original '2's would first be replaced with '3's, then those '3's would be replaced with '4's. So, the net effect for the original '2's is to become '4's.\n\nBut if the substitution order is reversed, like first '3->4', then '2->3', then the original '2's would become '3's, and those '3's would not be replaced again (since the first substitution was '3->4' but that's already done). Wait, no. The first substitution is '3->4', then the second substitution is '2->3'. So the original '2's are replaced with '3's, but the existing '3's (if any) would have already been replaced with '4's in the first substitution. So the order of substitution matters.\n\nTherefore, the substitutions must be processed in the order given. So for each substitution, we need to know what the current mapping is for each digit.\n\nBut how can we model the transformations so that we can compute the final value efficiently?\n\nLet me think about using a mapping from each digit to its replacement string. However, when a substitution is applied, we need to replace all occurrences of a certain digit in the current string. But if we have a chain of substitutions, like replacing '2' with '3', then '3' with '4', then the original '2's would be first turned into '3's, then those '3's would be turned into '4's.\n\nBut if we can track for each digit, what it would be replaced with after all substitutions, then we can compute the final string by applying all substitutions in order. However, this seems tricky because substitutions can overwrite previous mappings. For example, if we first replace '2' with '3', then later replace '2' with '4', then the second substitution would override the first. But in that case, the original '2's would be replaced with '4's, and the '3's (from previous substitutions) would remain unless there's a substitution for them.\n\nWait, but the substitution queries are applied in sequence. Each query replaces all instances of di in the current string with ti. So, if a query is 'd -> t', then any occurrence of d in the current string is replaced with t. So, for example, if you have a query that replaces '2' with '3', then a query that replaces '3' with '",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly simulating each substitution can be computationally expensive due to the potential exponential growth of the string. Instead, we can use dynamic programming to track how each digit transforms through all substitutions.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming for Transformations**: \n   - We maintain an array `dp` where `dp[d]` represents the transformation result of digit `d` after applying all substitutions.\n   - Initially, `dp[d] = str(d)` for all digits `d`.\n   - As we process each substitution query `di -> ti`, we update `dp[di]` to be the concatenation of the transformations of the characters in `ti`.\n\n2. **Modulo Arithmetic**:\n   - Since we are ultimately interested in the value of the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$, we can compute this incrementally while processing the transformations.\n   - We maintain two arrays: `mod_val` which stores the value of each digit's transformation modulo $10^9 + 7$, and `length` which stores the length of each transformation (to handle large numbers).\n\n3. **Final Computation**:\n   - After processing all substitutions, we iterate over the original string and compute the final number by combining the precomputed values using modular arithmetic.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize dp with each digit as its own string\n    dp = {}\n    mod_val = {}\n    length = {}\n    for d in map(str, range(10)):\n        dp[d] = d\n        mod_val[d] = int(d)\n        length[d] = 1\n    \n    for q in queries:\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1]\n        # Update dp[di] to be the transformation of ti\n        new_str = ''\n        new_mod = 0\n        new_len = 0\n        for c in ti:\n            new_str += dp[c]\n            new_mod = (new_mod * 10 + mod_val[c]) % MOD\n            new_len += length[c]\n        dp[di] = new_str\n        mod_val[di] = new_mod\n        length[di] = new_len\n    \n    # Now compute the final value from the original string\n    result = 0\n    for c in s:\n        val = mod_val[c]\n        result = (result * pow(10, length[c], MOD) + val) % MOD\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization**: Each digit is initialized to itself with its own value and length.\n- **Processing Queries**: For each query, we update the transformation of the digit being replaced by combining the transformations of the characters in the replacement string.\n- **Efficient Modulo Calculation**: By maintaining `mod_val` and `length`, we avoid directly constructing potentially huge strings and instead compute the final number using modular arithmetic.\n- **Final Result**: The result is computed by iterating through the original string and combining the precomputed values using powers of 10 modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle even the largest inputs within the constraints.",
