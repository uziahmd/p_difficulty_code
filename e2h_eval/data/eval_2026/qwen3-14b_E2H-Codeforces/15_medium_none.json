They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find all integers x that can be the winning team given the rules of the tournament and the string s which dictates how each phase of the tournament works.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem again. We have 2^n teams. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The tournament has n phases. For each phase i (starting from 1?), the string s's i-th character tells us whether in that phase, the higher or lower skill level team wins each match. \n\nThe key is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. But how do we model the tournament structure and determine for each possible x whether it's possible to be the winner under some permutation p?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since the permutation p can be any permutation of 1 to 2^n, but we need to find x that can be the champion under some p. But the way the tournament proceeds depends on the rules of each phase. \n\nWait, the problem says that during phase i, each match is decided based on the skill levels. For example, if s_i is 0, then in that phase, the team with lower skill level wins. So for each phase, the matches are determined by the rules of that phase.\n\nBut how does the tournament proceed? Let's think recursively. The tournament is a binary tree structure. Each round is a level of the tree. For example, in the first phase (phase 1?), there are 2^{n-1} games. Then the next phase (phase 2?) has 2^{n-2} games, etc., until phase n which has 1 game.\n\nBut the problem defines the phases as follows: the first phase is when the initial 2^n teams are split into pairs. Then each subsequent phase is when the winners of the previous phase are grouped again into pairs. So phase 1 is the first round, phase 2 is the second round, etc. So for example, if n=3, there are 3 phases. The first phase has 4 games (since 2^3 / 2 = 4), then phase 2 has 2 games, phase 3 has 1 game.\n\nEach phase's matches are determined by the rule in s[i], where i is the phase index. Wait, the string s has length n. So for each phase from 1 to n, the i-th character (s[i-1] if using 0-based index) determines the rule.\n\nSo for each phase, the way the matches are decided depends on the phase's rule. For example, during phase 1, all matches are decided by the rule s[0], during phase 2 by s[1], etc.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find all x that can be the champion. How can we model this?\n\nAn idea is to think of the tournament as a series of rounds, each with certain rules. For a given x, we need to determine if there exists a way to arrange the other teams' skill levels such that x can reach the final by winning each of the required rounds according to the rules.\n\nBut how to model the possible paths?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model for each possible x, the minimal and maximal possible skill values that x must have in order to win each round, considering the rules of each phase.\n\nWait, here's an approach inspired by the way the tournament works. Let's think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each team must win log2(2^n) = n rounds. Each round corresponds to a phase. For example, the first round (phase 1) is the first level of the tree, then phase 2 is the next level, etc.\n\nIn each round, the team must win against another team. The way they win depends on the rule for that phase. For example, during phase i, the rule is either higher or lower skill wins.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be any arrangement, we can choose the p such that the team x is able to pass through each round. However, the other teams' skills must be arranged so that in each round, the required condition is met.\n\nWait, but how can we model the possible positions of x in the tournament bracket? Because the initial bracket structure is fixed: the first round pairs team 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. But the actual team's positions in the bracket are determined by their initial positions. However, since p is a permutation, the actual skill levels can be arranged in any order. But the bracket structure depends on the initial positions, not the skill levels. So the tournament bracket is fixed, but the skill levels are assigned to the teams in some permutation.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that the tournament is structured as follows: in the first phase, team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 vs 4, etc. But the team numbers are just identifiers. The actual skill levels are p_1, p_2, etc. So the bracket structure is fixed. For example, team 1 and 2 are paired in the first round. But in the permutation p, these teams could have any skill levels. However, the way the tournament proceeds depends on the rules of each phase. \n\nBut the problem requires that for some permutation p, the team with skill x (i.e., the team whose p_i is x) becomes the champion. So the question is, for each x, can we assign the skills to the teams such that x's team can win all the required matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how can we model the required conditions for x to be champion?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that during each phase, the team x must win its matches. For that, in each phase, depending on the rule (higher or lower), the team x must have a skill that is either higher or lower than the opponent in that match.\n\nBut the opponents depend on the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first phase, x's team is in a pair with another team. The winner of that pair proceeds to the next phase. In the next phase, that winner is paired with another winner from another pair, etc.\n\nBut since we can choose the permutation, we can arrange the other teams' skills in such a way that x can win each of the matches in each phase. However, the arrangement must be such that in each phase's matches, x's skill meets the required condition (higher or lower than the opponent).\n\nSo for each x, we need to find a way to assign the other teams' skills such that:\n\nIn phase 1 (the first round), x's team is in a match where, according to the rule for phase 1, x's skill is either higher or lower than the opponent. Then, in the next phase (phase 2), x's team is in a match where, according to the rule for phase 2, x's skill is either higher or lower than the opponent. And so on, until phase n.\n\nBut how to model the opponents in each phase? For example, in phase 1, x's team is in a group of two. The opponent is someone else. In phase 2, x's team is in a group of two, where the other team is the winner of another group of two in phase 1. And so on.\n\nBut since the permutation can be arbitrary, perhaps we can model for each phase, the constraints on x's skill relative to the number of teams that must be weaker or stronger than x in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each team must win n matches. Each match is in a certain phase. For each phase i (from 1 to n), the rule is given by s[i-1].\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tournament. For example, for n=3, the tournament has three rounds. The first round (phase 1) has 4 matches. The second (phase 2) has 2 matches, and the third (phase 3) has 1 match.\n\nFor x to be the champion, it must win all matches in each phase. For each match in phase i, the rule determines whether x's skill must be higher or lower than the opponent's.\n\nBut since the opponents in each phase depend on the previous rounds, how can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model for each possible x, the minimal and maximal possible skill values that x must have in order to be able to win all the required matches. But how?\n\nLet me think for each phase. Let's imagine that during phase i, the rule is r_i (either 0 or 1). For x to pass through phase i, during that phase's match, x must be either the higher or lower skill in that match. \n\nBut how many times does x need to be compared in each phase? Well, in phase i, there are 2^{n-i} matches. But for x, it's part of exactly one match in each phase. Because each phase reduces the number of teams by half. So x starts in the first phase, then proceeds to the next phases, until the final.\n\nSo for each phase i, x is in a match. The outcome of that match depends on the rule for that phase.\n\nBut how can we model the constraints on x's skill relative to other teams?\n\nLet's consider that for each phase i, during that phase's match, x must be either the higher or lower skill, depending on the rule. However, the opponent in that phase's match is determined by the previous matches. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the opponents' skill levels to be such that x can win each match.\n\nSo for example, suppose in phase i, the rule is 1 (higher skill wins). Then, x must be higher than the opponent in that match. To ensure that, we can arrange that the opponent's skill is lower than x. Similarly, if the rule is 0, then the opponent's skill must be higher than x.\n\nBut how do we ensure that in all phases?\n\nThe key insight here is that for each phase, the number of teams that must be weaker or stronger than x depends on the rules of the phases. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider that in order to win the tournament, x must win n matches, one in each phase. For each phase i, the rule r_i (s[i-1]) determines whether x must be the higher or lower skill in that match. \n\nNow, during phase i, the match that x participates in is against another team. Let's think about the number of teams that must be either less than or greater than x. \n\nFor example, suppose in phase 1, the rule is 0 (lower skill wins). Then, x must be the lower-skilled team in that match. Therefore, the opponent in phase 1 must have a higher skill than x. But then, in phase 2, the rule may be 1 (higher skill wins). So in phase 2's match, x must be higher than the opponent. Which means that the opponent in phase 2 must have a lower skill than x. \n\nBut how can we model this for all phases? It seems that for each phase, there's a requirement on the number of teams that must be either higher or lower than x. \n\nAnother thought: For each phase, the number of teams that must be beaten by x (in terms of skill) depends on the rules of the phases. For instance, if in phase i, the rule is 1 (higher skill wins), then x must be higher than the opponent in that phase. But that opponent was the winner of some previous matches. So perhaps, for each phase, we can compute the minimal and maximal number of teams that must be either less than or greater than x.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For x to be the champion, in each round i (phase i), x must beat someone. The way to beat them depends on the rule of that phase. For example, in phase i, if the rule is 1, then x must be stronger than the opponent. If the rule is 0, then x must be weaker than the opponent. \n\nBut how can we find the necessary conditions on x's value?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final match. For x to reach the root, it must win all the matches along the path from the leaf to the root.\n\nEach match along the path corresponds to a phase. For example, the first match (leaf's parent) is phase 1, the next is phase 2, etc.\n\nNow, for each match along this path, the rule for that phase determines whether x must be higher or lower than the opponent in that match.\n\nBut the opponent in each match is determined by the structure of the tournament. However, since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the opponents' skill levels as needed.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think for each phase. Suppose that in phase i, the rule is r_i. Then, in that match, x must be either the higher or lower skill. Let's say that in phase i, the required comparison is that x's skill is compared to the opponent's. \n\nTo maximize flexibility, we can arrange the opponents in such a way that for each phase, the required condition is met. However, the opponents in later phases depend on the previous choices.\n\nFor example, in phase 1, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be lower than the opponent. So the opponent's skill is higher than x. Then, in phase 2, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), x must be higher than the opponent in that phase. That opponent is the winner of another match in phase 1. For that to happen, the opponent in phase 2 must have a skill lower than x. But that opponent could be someone else who was defeated by x in phase 1, but that's not possible because in phase 1, x's opponent was higher than x. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nWait, the opponent in phase 2 is another winner from phase 1. So, for example, in phase 1, x's match is against A, and x loses (if the rule was 0, but wait, no. Wait, if the rule is 0, then the lower skill wins. So if x is lower than A, then x wins the match. Then, in phase 2, x will face another winner from another match. Let's call that winner B. The rule for phase 2 is 1 (higher wins). So x must be higher than B. So B must have a skill less than x. But B is the winner of a phase 1 match, which depends on the rule of phase 1. For example, if phase 1's rule was 0, then B is the lower-skilled team in their match. So B's skill is lower than their opponent. But how can we arrange this?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to model for each x the minimal and maximal possible rank it can have in order to satisfy all the phase rules.\n\nAnother approach is to model for each x, the minimal and maximal possible number of teams that must be weaker or stronger than x. \n\nFor example, for each phase i, depending on the rule, we can determine whether x needs to have more teams stronger than it, or weaker than it. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that during phase i, the rule is r_i. For x to win the match in phase i, the following must be true:\n\nIf r_i is 1 (higher wins), then x must be stronger than the opponent. So, the opponent must be weaker than x. \n\nBut the opponent is the winner of a subtree of the tournament bracket. The number of teams that must be weaker than x depends on the rules of the previous phases.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a binary tree. For each node in the tree (representing a match), the winner must be determined by the rule of the phase. For x to reach the root, it must be the winner of all the nodes along the path from the leaf to the root.\n\nLet me think about the number of teams that must be weaker than x, and the number that must be stronger than x.\n\nSuppose that during phase i, the rule is 1 (higher wins). Then, in that phase's match, x must be higher than the opponent. Therefore, the opponent must be weaker than x. But the opponent is the winner of a subtree that depends on the rules of previous phases.\n\nBut how can we model this for all phases?\n\nPerhaps we can model for each phase, the number of teams that must be either less than or greater than x, based on the rules.\n\nLet me think of it in terms of the number of teams that must be less than x (call this L) and the number that must be greater than x (call this G). \n\nFor x to be the champion, the total number of teams is 2^n. So x must be such that there are enough teams that are either less than or greater than x, depending on the rules.\n\nFor example, suppose that during phase 1, the rule is 1 (higher wins). Then, x must be higher than the opponent in phase 1. So there must be at least one team less than x. Then, during phase 2, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be lower than the opponent in phase 2. Therefore, there must be at least one team higher than x. But that opponent is the winner of another subtree. How does that affect the count?\n\nAlternatively, for each phase i, depending on the rule, we can determine whether x must have a certain number of teams that are either higher or lower than it.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as requiring that for each phase i, the number of teams that x must \"dominate\" (i.e., be higher than) or \"be dominated by\" (i.e., be lower than) depends on the rules of the phases. \n\nLet me think of the problem as building constraints on x's value. For example, in each phase, the rule imposes a constraint on how x's value compares to others. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that for a tournament with k rounds (phases), the required constraints on x are determined by the rules of each phase. \n\nLet's define for each phase i (from 1 to n), the direction of the comparison. For example, during phase i, the rule is r_i. So during that phase, x must be either higher or lower than its opponent. \n\nBut the opponent in phase i is the winner of a subtree of size 2^{n - i + 1} teams. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. \n\nIn phase 1, the tournament is divided into 2^{n-1} matches. Each match is between two teams. The winner proceeds to phase 2. \n\nIn phase 2, there are 2^{n-2} matches. Each match is between two winners from phase 1. \n\nSo, for a given x, during phase i, it's part of a subtree that has 2^{i} teams. For example, during phase 1, the subtree is 2 teams. During phase 2, it's 4 teams, and so on until phase n, which is the entire tournament.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. For phase i, the number of teams in the subtree that x is part of is 2^{i} teams. Because each phase reduces the number of teams by half. So, during phase 1, x is in a group of 2 teams. During phase 2, x is in a group of 4 teams. Phase 3: 8 teams, etc. So, for phase i, the subtree has 2^i teams, and x must be the winner of that subtree.\n\nBut how does that help us?\n\nWell, for x to be the winner of the entire tournament, it must be the winner of each of the subtrees in each phase. \n\nFor each subtree of size 2^i teams, during phase i, the rule determines how x wins its match. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: For each phase i (from 1 to n), we need to determine what constraints on x's value are required, based on the rule for that phase.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each possible x, we can compute the minimal and maximal number of teams that must be either less than or greater than x. \n\nFor example, if during phase i, the rule is 1 (higher wins), then in that phase's match, x must be higher than the opponent. So, the opponent must be from the other half of the subtree. But how to model the number of teams that must be less than x?\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as requiring that for each phase i, x must be able to \"win\" against the best possible opponent in that phase. \n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: For x to be the champion, during each phase i, the rule r_i determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^i teams. \n\nWait, that might not be accurate. For example, in phase i, the group is of size 2^i teams. The tournament structure requires that x must win in each of the i phases. For each phase, the rule determines whether x must be the higher or lower in the match. \n\nBut perhaps the way to model this is to find for each phase i, the number of teams that must be either less than or greater than x, depending on the rules. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the entire tournament as a sequence of rounds. For each round, the rule determines whether x needs to be the higher or lower in that round's match. \n\nLet me think for each round i (phase i), the number of teams that must be either less than or greater than x depends on the rules of the previous rounds. \n\nFor example, suppose that in phase 1, the rule is 0 (lower wins). Then, x must be the lower of the two in that match. Therefore, there must be at least one team with higher skill than x. Then, in phase 2, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than the opponent. Therefore, there must be at least one team with lower skill than x. But that opponent comes from another subtree. \n\nBut how to model this for all phases?\n\nMaybe we can think of it as follows: For each phase i, depending on the rule, x must be the minimum or maximum in the group of 2^i teams that it belongs to during that phase. \n\nWait, that might not be correct. Because during phase i, the group is of size 2^i teams. But x is only involved in one match per phase. For example, in phase 1, the group is 2 teams. In phase 2, the group is 4 teams, and x must have won its match in phase 1. \n\nSo during phase 2, the group of 4 teams consists of x and the three other teams that made it to phase 2. But how does the rule for phase 2 affect x's position in that group?\n\nActually, during phase 2, x is in a match against another team that also won their phase 1 match. The rule for phase 2 determines who wins that match. \n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the other teams' skills such that x can win each of its matches. \n\nBut how to find the constraints on x's value?\n\nLet me think of the following: For each phase i, the rule determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in the set of teams that it would have to defeat in that phase. \n\nBut how to calculate the number of teams that must be less than or greater than x?\n\nLet me try to model this with an example. Let's take the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\n101\n\nSample Output: 4 5 6 7\n\nSo n=3, s is '101'. So for phase 1, the rule is 1 (higher wins), phase 2 is 0 (lower wins), phase 3 is 1 (higher wins).\n\nWe need to find all x that can be champions. The output is 4,5,6,7.\n\nLet me think why x=4 is possible. Let's see. For x to be champion, it must win all three phases.\n\nPhase 1: rule is 1 (higher wins). So x must be higher than the opponent in phase 1. So the opponent must have a skill less than x.\n\nPhase 2: rule is 0 (lower wins). So x must be lower than the opponent in phase 2. Therefore, the opponent must have a higher skill than x.\n\nPhase 3: rule is 1 (higher wins). So x must be higher than the opponent in phase 3. Therefore, the opponent must have a lower skill than x.\n\nSo for x=4, how can this be arranged?\n\nIn phase 1, x (4) must be higher than its opponent. So the opponent must be <4. Let's say opponent is 1. Then x (4) wins.\n\nIn phase 2, x (4) must be lower than its opponent. The opponent is the winner of another group in phase 1. Since phase 1 rule is 1, the opponent must be higher than their own opponent. Let's say that opponent is 5. So 5 is higher than their opponent (say 2). Then in phase 2, x=4 must be lower than 5. So 5 wins, and x loses? No, that can't be. Because x needs to win the phase 2 match. Wait, no. Wait, during phase 2, the rule is 0, meaning lower skill wins. So in phase 2's match, the team with lower skill wins. So if x is 4 and the opponent is 5, then 4 is lower, so x wins. Oh right! So the rule for phase 2 is 0, so lower wins. So x (4) must be lower than the opponent, which would mean that the opponent is higher than x. So the opponent's skill is higher than x's. Then, since the rule is lower wins, x would win. \n\nAh, I see. So during phase 2, x's skill is lower than the opponent's, which allows x to win (because the rule says lower wins). \n\nSo for phase 2, x must be lower than the opponent. So the opponent must be higher than x. \n\nThen, in phase 3, x's opponent is the winner of another group. The rule for phase 3 is 1 (higher wins). So x must be higher than the opponent. So the opponent must be lower than x. \n\nSo how can this be arranged? Let's imagine the tournament bracket.\n\nIn phase 1, x is in a group of two teams. Let's say x is in group A. The other group is group B, which produces an opponent for x in phase 2. \n\nGroup A: x (4) and another team (say 1). x wins (since rule 1: higher wins). \n\nGroup B: two teams, say 5 and 2. The winner is 5 (since rule 1: higher wins). \n\nIn phase 2, x (4) faces 5. Rule is 0 (lower wins). x's skill is 4, which is lower than 5, so x wins. \n\nPhase 3: x (4) faces the winner of another group. Let's say that group C and D produce a team with skill 3. Then, rule 1: higher wins. x (4) is higher than 3, so x wins. \n\nThus, x=4 is a valid champion. \n\nSo the constraints on x are that:\n\nIn phase 1 (rule 1): x must be higher than at least one team (so x can't be the minimum, but there must be at least one team less than x).\n\nIn phase 2 (rule 0): x must be lower than at least one team (so there must be at least one team higher than x).\n\nIn phase 3 (rule 1): x must be higher than at least one team (so there must be at least one team lower than x).\n\nBut how to generalize this for any x and any s?\n\nFor each phase i, the rule determines whether x must be higher or lower than the opponent in that phase. The number of teams that must be higher or lower than x depends on the rules of the phases. \n\nLet me think of it as for each phase i, there is a direction (up or down). For example, for phase i, if the rule is 1, then x must be higher than the opponent in that phase. This requires that there exists a team that is lower than x. Similarly, if the rule is 0, x must be lower than the opponent, requiring that there exists a team higher than x. \n\nBut this seems too simplistic. Because for each phase, the opponent is determined by the previous matches. However, since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps the minimal constraints are that for each phase i, depending on the rule, there must be a certain number of teams that are either higher or lower than x. \n\nBut how to calculate that number?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that during phase i, the rule is r_i. For x to win this phase, it must have a certain relationship with the opponent. \n\nLet's imagine that for each phase i, the number of teams that must be either higher or lower than x is determined by the number of \"directions\" required in the previous phases. \n\nAnother approach is to model the minimal and maximal possible skill levels x can have. For example, during phase 1, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than someone. So the minimal x can be is 2 (since there must be at least one team with lower skill). But if the rule is 0, then x must be lower than someone, so the maximal x can be is 2^n - 1. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nLet me think of it as follows: For each phase i, the rule r_i determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in a certain subset of teams. \n\nFor example, in phase 1, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the higher of the two in its group. So in that group, x is the maximum. \n\nIn phase 2, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be the lower of the two in its group (which consists of the two winners from phase 1 groups). So in that group of 4 teams (x and three others), x must be the minimum of the two in the phase 2 match. \n\nBut how does this translate into constraints on x's value?\n\nFor example, in phase 1, x must be the maximum in its group of 2 teams. So there must be at least one team less than x. \n\nIn phase 2, x must be the minimum in its group of 2 teams (the two winners from phase 1). So the other team in the phase 2 match must be higher than x. But that other team is the winner of another phase 1 group, which, if the rule for phase 1 was 1 (higher wins), then that team is the maximum of its group of 2 teams. \n\nSo, for x to be the minimum in its phase 2 group, the other team must be higher than x. Which implies that there is at least one team higher than x. \n\nIn phase 3, if the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the maximum of its group of 2 teams. So there must be at least one team lower than x. \n\nSo overall, for x to be the champion in this example, there must be at least one team lower than x (from phase 1), at least one higher than x (from phase 2), and at least one lower than x (from phase 3). \n\nBut how does this relate to the actual value of x?\n\nIn the example, x=4. The total number of teams is 8. So there are 7 other teams. There must be at least one team lower than x (so x can't be 1), at least one higher than x (so x can't be 8), and so on. \n\nBut how to generalize this for all phases?\n\nLet me think for each phase i, the rule r_i determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in a certain subtree. \n\nIf during phase i, the rule is 1, then x must be the maximum in its subtree of 2^i teams. \n\nIf during phase i, the rule is 0, then x must be the minimum in its subtree of 2^i teams. \n\nWait, that might be the key. Because for each phase i, the rule determines whether x must be the maximum or minimum in the group of 2^i teams that it belongs to during that phase. \n\nLet me think about this. For example, during phase 1, the group is 2 teams. If the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be the higher of the two, thus the maximum of the group. \n\nDuring phase 2, the group is 4 teams (two winners from phase 1). The rule for phase 2 is 0 (lower wins), so x must be the lower of the two in its phase 2 match. Thus, in the group of 4 teams, x is the minimum of the two that meet in phase 2. But how does this relate to the entire group of 4 teams?\n\nActually, during phase 2, x's group consists of four teams. But x must be the minimum of the two that meet in phase 2. However, the other two teams in the group are eliminated in phase 1. So, for x to be the minimum of its phase 2 match, there must be at least one team in the group of four that is higher than x. \n\nBut how to model this for all phases?\n\nIf this logic holds, then for each phase i, the rule determines whether x must be the maximum or minimum in a certain subtree of 2^i teams. \n\nIf this is true, then for each phase i, we can calculate the required number of teams that must be less than or greater than x. \n\nFor example, if during phase i, x must be the maximum of a group of 2^i teams, then there must be (2^i - 1) teams in that group that are less than x. \n\nSimilarly, if x must be the minimum of a group of 2^i teams, then there must be (2^i - 1) teams in that group that are greater than x. \n\nBut how to combine these requirements across all phases?\n\nLet me think about the entire tournament. For each phase i, the group size is 2^i. But the groups for different phases are nested. For example, the group for phase 1 is 2 teams, for phase 2 it's 4 teams, etc. \n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be the maximum in the group for phase 1 if the rule is 1, the minimum in the group for phase 2 if the rule is 0, and so on. \n\nThus, the constraints on x are:\n\nFor each phase i, the number of teams that are less than x or greater than x depends on the rule of that phase. \n\nLet me think of the following: For each phase i, the rule r_i determines whether x must be the minimum or maximum in a group of size 2^i. \n\nIf r_i is 1, x must be the maximum in its group of size 2^i. So, there are (2^i - 1) teams in that group that are less than x. \n\nIf r_i is 0, x must be the minimum in its group of size 2^i. So, there are (2^i - 1) teams in that group that are greater than x. \n\nBut since these groups are nested, the constraints for earlier phases are included in the constraints for later phases. \n\nFor example, the group for phase 1 is a subset of the group for phase 2, which is a subset of the group for phase 3, etc. \n\nTherefore, the total number of teams that must be less than x is the sum of the required teams from phases where x must be maximum. Similarly for greater than x. \n\nWait, but this seems conflicting. Let me think again. \n\nLet me consider that for each phase i, the group of size 2^i teams includes all teams that x would have to face in that phase. For example, during phase i, x is in a group of 2^i teams. To be the maximum or minimum of that group, there are certain constraints on the number of teams that must be less than or greater than x.\n\nBut since the group for phase i+1 is larger than the group for phase i, the constraints for phase i are part of the constraints for phase i+1. \n\nSo, for example, if during phase 1, x must be the maximum of its group of 2 teams, then there must be 1 team less than x. During phase 2, if x must be the minimum of its group of 4 teams, then there must be 3 teams greater than x. However, the 1 team from phase 1's group is part of this group of 4. So the other 2 teams in the group of 4 must be greater than x. \n\nBut how can this be possible? Because if x is the maximum of its phase 1 group (so one team is less than x), and also the minimum of its phase 2 group (so three teams are greater than x), then x must be greater than the one team from phase 1, but also less than three other teams in the phase 2 group. \n\nThis suggests that for each phase, the required number of teams that are less than or greater than x depends on the rules of that phase, and the cumulative effect across all phases.\n\nSo, for all phases i, the required number of teams that must be less than x is the sum of (2^i - 1) for all phases where the rule is 1 (x is maximum in that group), and similarly for the number of teams greater than x being the sum of (2^i - ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which integers can be the winning team in a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The solution involves analyzing the constraints imposed by each phase's rule and determining the valid skill levels that can meet these constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in such a way that each phase halves the number of teams until one champion remains. Each phase has specific rules (either higher or lower skill level wins).\n2. **Constraints Analysis**: For each phase, depending on the rule (higher or lower skill level wins), we determine the minimum and maximum number of teams that must be either greater or smaller than the candidate winning team.\n3. **Cumulative Constraints**: By iterating through each phase, we accumulate the constraints on the number of teams that must be either greater or smaller than the candidate skill level. This helps us determine the valid range of skill levels that can potentially win the tournament.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    \n    min_val = 1\n    max_val = total_teams\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        phase = i + 1\n        group_size = 1 << phase  # 2^phase\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            # x must be the maximum in group of size group_size\n            # so there are (group_size - 1) teams less than x\n            # thus, x must be at least (group_size - 1 + 1) = group_size\n            min_val = max(min_val, group_size)\n        else:\n            # x must be the minimum in group of size group_size\n            # so there are (group_size - 1) teams greater than x\n            # thus, x must be at most (total_teams - (group_size - 1))\n            max_val = min(max_val, total_teams - (group_size - 1))\n    \n    result = []\n    for x in range(min_val, max_val + 1):\n        result.append(str(x))\n    \n    print(' '.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` that dictates the rules for each phase of the tournament.\n2. **Total Teams Calculation**: The total number of teams is calculated as $2^n$.\n3. **Constraint Accumulation**: For each phase, based on the rule ('0' or '1'), we adjust the minimum and maximum possible values that the winning team's skill level can take:\n   - If the rule is '1', the winning team must be the highest in its group of size $2^{\\text{phase}}$, thus requiring the minimum value to be at least $2^{\\text{phase}}$.\n   - If the rule is '0', the winning team must be the lowest in its group of size $2^{\\text{phase}}$, thus requiring the maximum value to be at most $2^n - (2^{\\text{phase}} - 1)$.\n4. **Result Compilation**: After processing all phases, the valid range of skill levels is determined and printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the valid skill levels by iterating through each phase once, ensuring the solution handles the constraints optimally.",
