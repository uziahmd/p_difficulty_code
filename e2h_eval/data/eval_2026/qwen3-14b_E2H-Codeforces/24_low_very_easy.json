She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem says that each second she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. So the goal is to figure out the optimal steps.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial setup. The current position is pos. The tabs that need to stay open are from l to r. So any tabs outside this range need to be closed. But how?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The key is to determine which tabs need to be closed. For example, if the current l and r already cover all tabs (like in the third example where l=1 and r=5 and n=5), then nothing needs to be done. So the answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, there are tabs to the left of l and/or to the right of r that need to be closed. Let's consider those two cases.\n\nBut how do we close them efficiently? Because closing tabs can only be done when the cursor is at a certain position. For example, to close all tabs to the left of the current position, you need to be at some position i, and then perform the close operation. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, the plan is: find the positions where the cursor needs to be to close the left and right sections, and calculate the steps required to get there, plus the time for the closing operations.\n\nWait, but closing operations take 1 second each. So, for example, if you need to close tabs to the left, you need to move the cursor to the position where that's possible, then perform the close. Similarly for the right.\n\nLet me think about the steps required.\n\nFirst, the left part. Suppose there are tabs to the left of l. So, the leftmost tab that needs to stay open is l. So, to close all tabs to the left of l, Luba must be at position l, and then close all tabs to the left. But wait, when she closes tabs to the left, that would close everything up to the current a (the minimum index of unclosed tabs). Wait, but the initial a is 1, and after closing tabs to the left of l, the a would become l. But maybe that's not important here.\n\nWait, the problem says that when she closes tabs to the left of the current position, it closes all tabs from a (current min) to i-1. So, for example, if she is at position i, then closing left would close all tabs from a to i-1. But after that, the new a becomes i. So, perhaps the idea is that to close all tabs to the left of l, she needs to be at l, and then close left. Because then, the tabs from a (initially 1) to l-1 are closed. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to be at r and close right.\n\nBut wait, suppose that the current position is somewhere else. Let's think about the case where she needs to close tabs to the left of l. For example, l is 2. So the tabs to the left are 1. She needs to be at position 2 (so that closing left would close all tabs from a (which is 1) to 1. So that's correct. So, she needs to move to l, then close left. Similarly for the right side.\n\nSimilarly, if there are tabs to the right of r, she needs to be at r and close right.\n\nSo, the steps needed are:\n\nIf there are tabs to the left of l (i.e., l > 1), then she needs to move to l, then close left. That takes (distance from current pos to l) + 1 seconds.\n\nSimilarly, if there are tabs to the right of r (i.e., r < n), then she needs to move to r, then close right. That takes (distance from current pos to r) + 1 seconds.\n\nBut wait, what if she can do both operations? Like, maybe she can first close the left, then close the right, or vice versa. But maybe the order affects the steps.\n\nWait, but when you close the left, the a (minimum index) becomes l. Then, when closing the right, the b (maximum index) becomes r. But the movement steps might be different depending on the order.\n\nWait, but the movement steps are determined by the initial position. Because once you close some tabs, the a and b change. However, in the problem statement, the movement is based on the current a and b. For example, if you have closed some tabs, then moving left or right is constrained by the current a and b.\n\nBut in this problem, the initial a is 1, and the initial b is n. So, when she starts, she",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified range [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` and/or to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Calculate Movement Steps**:\n   - If there are tabs to the left of `l`, Luba needs to move to `l` and then close all tabs to the left. The time taken is the distance from `pos` to `l` plus 1 second for the closing operation.\n   - If there are tabs to the right of `r`, Luba needs to move to `r` and then close all tabs to the right. The time taken is the distance from `pos` to `r` plus 1 second for the closing operation.\n3. **Sum the Times**: Add the times for closing tabs on both sides if necessary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\ntime = 0\n\n# Check if there are tabs to the left of l\nif l > 1:\n    # Need to move to l and close left\n    time += abs(pos - l) + 1\nelse:\n    # No tabs to the left\n    pass\n\n# Check if there are tabs to the right of r\nif r < n:\n    # Need to move to r and close right\n    time += abs(pos - r) + 1\nelse:\n    # No tabs to the right\n    pass\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Tabs to the Left**: If `l` is greater than 1, there are tabs to the left of `l` that need to be closed. Luba moves from her current position `pos` to `l` (taking `abs(pos - l)` seconds) and then closes the tabs to the left (1 second).\n- **Tabs to the Right**: If `r` is less than `n`, there are tabs to the right of `r` that need to be closed. Luba moves from her current position `pos` to `r` (taking `abs(pos - r)` seconds) and then closes the tabs to the right (1 second).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum time required by considering only the necessary movements and operations.",
