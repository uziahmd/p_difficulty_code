При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem statement first.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have resulted from an error where two identical messages were merged. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap has to be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part must be of positive length but less than the length of the message. Also, the case where they are completely overlapped (like the entire message) isn't considered an error. Similarly, just appending them without any overlap isn't considered an error either.\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if it could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with some overlap. If yes, output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the original string t must be formed by two copies of s overlapping. Let me think about the structure of t. Let's say the original s has length L. Then, when two s's are merged with an overlap of k characters, the resulting string would have length L + (L - k) = 2L -k. But since k is between 1 and L-1 (since the overlap must be positive and less than the length of s), the total length of t would be 2L -k. So for some k in 1..L-1.\n\nBut since t is given, we need to find possible L and k such that 2L -k = len(t). Also, since k can vary, perhaps we can find possible L values.\n\nWait, but how do we find L? Let's think. Let me denote the length of t as n. Then:\n\nn = 2L - k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ L-1.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation. Let's see: k = 2L -n. Since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L -n ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities for L.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L -n ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ n +1 → L ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L -n ≤ L-1 → 2L -n ≤ L-1 → L ≤ n -1.\n\nSo combining these, L must satisfy (n+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ n-1.\n\nBut since L must be an integer, we can compute possible values of L in this range.\n\nMoreover, since the original s is such that two copies of it are merged with overlap k, then the string t must be equal to s concatenated with s, but with the last k characters of the first s overlapping with the first k characters of the second s. So, the resulting string t would be s[0..L-k-1] + s (since the overlapping part is merged once).\n\nAlternatively, the entire t must be equal to s concatenated with s, but with the first occurrence's suffix overlapping with the second occurrence's prefix. So, the way to check is that the first part (the first L -k characters of s) plus the entire s (but overlapping) gives t. Wait, maybe another way to think: the first s's prefix (up to L -k) and the second s's suffix (from k onwards) would form t. Or perhaps the entire t must be equal to s + s[k:], but that's not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the correct way is that when two s's are merged with an overlap of k, the resulting string is s + s[k:]. Because the first s is length L, and the second s starts at position L -k. So the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k, which is n. So for t to be formed in this way, it must be that t is equal to s + s[k:].\n\nBut how to find s and k?\n\nAnother way: for each possible L (as per the constraints above), check if there exists a k (between 1 and L-1) such that:\n\nt starts with s, and ends with s, and the overlapping part is correct.\n\nWait, but since t is formed by overlapping two s's, then t must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:], which implies that the first L -k characters of s plus the entire s (but overlapping) gives t. Alternatively, the first part of t (the first L characters) is s, and the second part (the last L characters) is also s. But overlapping. So, for example, the first L characters is s, and the last L characters is s. However, since they overlap, the overlapping part must match.\n\nSo, for a given L, the possible k would be such that the first L characters (s) and the last L characters (also s) have an overlap of k characters. That is, the last k characters of the first s must be equal to the first k characters of the second s (which is the same as s). Therefore, the first L characters of t is s, and the last L characters of t is s. And the overlapping part (the last k of the first s and first k of the second s) must match.\n\nBut how do we find k here?\n\nAlternatively, for a given L, the possible k is such that the first L characters (s) and the last L characters (s) must have their overlapping part matching. For example, if the first s is t[0:L], and the second s is t[n-L: n]. Then, the overlapping part would be the last k characters of the first s and the first k characters of the second s. Since the first s is t[0:L], the last k characters of it are t[L -k : L]. The second s is t[n-L: n], so the first k characters of it are t[n-L : n-L +k]. These two substrings must be equal.\n\nMoreover, since the total length of t is n = 2L -k. So, solving for k gives k = 2L -n.\n\nSo for a given L, we can compute k as 2L -n. Then, check if this k is between 1 and L-1. Because if k is in that range, then the equations are valid.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each possible L in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], check:\n\n- Compute k = 2L -n. Check that 1 ≤ k ≤ L-1.\n\nIf that holds, then check whether the first L characters (s_candidate = t[0:L]) and the last L characters (s_candidate2 = t[n-L: n]) are the same. Also, check that the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate2. But since s_candidate and s_candidate2 are supposed to be the same s, then this is equivalent to checking that the last k characters of s_candidate equals the first k characters of s_candidate. Which is the same as checking that the first s_candidate's suffix of length k equals its prefix of length k.\n\nWait, because the second s_candidate is the same as the first. So if the first s_candidate is s, then the second s_candidate is also s. So the overlapping part is the last k characters of s and the first k characters of s. So they must be equal. Therefore, the condition is that the first L characters (s_candidate) and the last L characters (s_candidate2) are equal, and that the last k characters of s_candidate equal the first k of s_candidate.\n\nBut since s_candidate and s_candidate2 must be the same (because they are both s), then the check that s_candidate equals s_candidate2 is necessary. Because, for example, if the first L characters and the last L characters are different, then even if the overlapping part matches, it's impossible.\n\nWait, but if the first L characters is s, and the last L characters is s, then the entire t must be formed by overlapping s and s with k characters. So, the entire t must be s + s[k:], which would be of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. So for that to be true, the first L characters is s, and the last L characters is s. Therefore, the check that the first L and last L characters are the same is necessary. But also, the overlapping part must match.\n\nBut since the overlapping part is the last k characters of the first s (which is s_candidate's last k) and the first k of the second s (which is s_candidate's first k). So for that to be true, the first s_candidate must have its prefix of length k equal to its suffix of length k. So, the check is that s_candidate's prefix of length k equals its suffix of length k.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor each possible L in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], compute k = 2L -n. If k is between 1 and L-1 (inclusive), then check:\n\n- The first L characters (s_candidate) and the last L characters (s_candidate2) are equal. If they are equal, then check if the first k characters of s_candidate equals the last k characters of s_candidate. If both conditions are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf any such L and k exists, then output YES and the s_candidate. Else, output NO.\n\nBut wait, why do we need to check that the first L and last L are equal? Because the s_candidate is supposed to be the original message. So, the first L characters is s, and the last L is also s. So, if they are not equal, then that's not possible. For example, suppose that the first L is s, and the last L is something else. Then, the overlapping can't be done. Because the second s would have to be the same as the first.\n\nSo the steps for each L:\n\nCheck if k is valid (1<=k <= L-1). Then check if the first L characters equals the last L characters. Then check if the first k characters of the first L equals the last k of the first L.\n\nIf all that is true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet me take an example. Let's look at the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → Output is 'YES' and 'acaca'.\n\nLet's see. The length of t is 9. So n=9.\n\nPossible L values are (n+1)/2 = (9+1)/2 = 5, up to n-1=8. So L can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor each L:\n\nCase L=5: k= 2*5 -9 = 10-9=1. Which is between 1 and 4 (since L-1=4). So valid.\n\nCheck first L=5 characters: 'acaca' (positions 0-4). Last L=5 characters: positions 4-8: 'acaca' (since the string is a c a c a c a c a → indexes 0-8. Last 5 is 4-8: a c a c a. So yes, same as first 5. Now check if first k=1 character of first L equals last k=1 of first L. First 1 is 'a', last 1 is 'a'. So yes. So this is valid. So s_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: the third sample input is 'abcabc' → output is 'NO'.\n\nn=6. Possible L is (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil(3.5) is 4? Wait, L must be an integer. So for L in the range (n+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ n-1. For n=6, (6+1)/2 is 3.5, so L must be ≥4, and ≤5.\n\nSo possible L=4,5.\n\nFor L=4: k= 2*4 -6 = 2. Check 1<=k=2 <=3 (since L-1=3). Yes. Now check first 4 chars: 'abca' and last 4 chars: 'bcab' (positions 2-5: 'bca'... wait wait, n is 6. Last 4 is positions 6-4=2 to 5 (indices 2,3,4,5). The string is abcabc. So positions 2-5 are 'cabc'. First 4 is 'abca'. Are they equal? No. So this case fails.\n\nFor L=5: k=2*5-6=4. Check 1<=4 <=4 (since L-1 is 5-1=4). So yes. Check first 5 characters: 'abcab' and last 5: positions 1-5: 'bcabc'. Are they equal? No. So no.\n\nThus, no valid L. Hence output is NO.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is length 19. Let's see. The output is YES and 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. Let's check.\n\nn=19. So possible L ranges from (19+1)/2=10 to 18.\n\nFor L=11, k= 2*11 -19 = 22-19=3. Check 1<=3 <=10 (yes). Then check first 11 characters (abrakadabra) and last 11 characters (positions 19-11=8 to 18: let's see. Original string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — perhaps the last 11 is 'abrakadabra' again. So first 11 is s_candidate, last 11 is same. Then check if the first 3 of s_candidate equals last 3 of s_candidate. s_candidate is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). The first 3 is 'abr', last 3 is 'bra'. Are they equal? No. Wait, but according to the sample input, the output is YES. So perhaps my reasoning is wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the example. Let me check the first sample input again.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → Output is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Let me compute the length of the input. Let's count:\n\n\"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" → Let's see:\n\nabrakadabra is 11 letters. Then the input is abrakadabrabrakadabra. Let me count:\n\nabrakadabra (11) + brakadabra (10 letters?), but perhaps the input is 19 letters? Let me check:\n\nOriginal sample input says the first input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let me count:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → that's 21 letters? Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. But regardless, perhaps the example is better handled by the code.\n\nBut according to the note in the problem statement, in the first case, the merged string could be formed by overlapping 1 character or 4 characters. So for example, if the original s was 'abrakadabra' (length 11), then two copies of s merged with 1 character overlap would give a string of length 11 + 11 -1 = 21. Which would be the case if the input is 21 characters. So perhaps the sample input is 21 characters long. So for that case, n=21.\n\nThen, for L=11, k=2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. Which is valid. Then check if first 11 characters (s_candidate) and last 11 characters (positions 21-11=10 to 20) are equal. If the input is the merged string, then the first 11 is s_candidate and the last 11 is s_candidate as well. Then, check if the first k=1 character of s_candidate equals the last k=1 of s_candidate. For s_candidate = 'abrakadabra', first character is 'a', last character is 'a'. So yes. Thus, it's valid.\n\nSo the code would find this case.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm steps:\n\nFor the given string t of length n:\n\nLoop through all possible L values from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1 (inclusive). For each L:\n\nCalculate k = 2L -n.\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and L-1 (inclusive). If not, skip this L.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck if the first L characters (s_candidate) equals the last L characters (s_candidate2). If not, skip.\n\nIf they are equal, check if the first k characters of s_candidate equals the last k characters of s_candidate.\n\nIf all these are true, then output YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the L values work, output NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, get the input string t.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nThen, iterate L from (n+1)//2 to n-1 inclusive. Wait, because (n+1)/2 can be fractional. For example, if n is even, like 6: (6+1)/2 is 3.5. So L must be >= 4 (since L must be integer). So for L in range starting from math.ceil((n+1)/2) ?\n\nBut in Python, integer division can be handled as follows. For example, (n + 1) // 2 gives the floor of (n+1)/2. But we need to start from the ceiling of (n+1)/2. Wait, let's think:\n\nFor example, n=9 → (n+1)/2 = 5. So L starts at 5.\n\nFor n=6 → (n+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceiling is 4. So L starts at 4.\n\nBut how to calculate the starting L?\n\nThe starting L is the smallest integer L such that L >= (n+1)/2. Which can be written as L_start = (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nFor (n+1)/2, the ceiling is equal to (n+1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example:\n\nn=9: (9+1)/2 = 5 → ceiling is 5. (n+1 +1) // 2 = (10 +1)/2 = 11//2=5.5 → floor is 5. So yes, (n+1 +1)//2 is (n+2)//2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for L_start is (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for n=6: (n+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceiling is 4. (n+1 +1) // 2 is (6+1 +1)/2 = 8/2=4 → yes.\n\nn=5: (5+1)/2 = 3 → ceiling is 3. (5+1 +1)/2 = 7//2 = 3.5 → floor is 3. So yes.\n\nSo the starting L is (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps more accurately, L_start is ceil( (n+1)/2 ). How to compute that in Python?\n\nWell, for integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nIn our case, (n+1)/2. So ceil((n+1)/2) = (n+1 + 2 -1) // 2 = (n+2) // 2.\n\nYes. So L_start = (n + 2) // 2.\n\nSo the loop for L is in the range from L_start to n-1, inclusive.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor L in range(L_start, n):\n\nWait, but n-1 is the upper limit. So for example, for L in range(L_start, n) ?\n\nBecause in Python, range is exclusive on the upper bound. So if the upper limit is n, then L will go up to n-1.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nimport sys\n\nt = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfound = False\n\nfor L in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n    k = 2 * L - n\n\n    if k < 1 or k >= L:  # because k must be between 1 and L-1 inclusive\n\n        continue\n\n    # Check if first L characters and last L characters are equal\n\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n    s_candidate_last = t[-L:]\n\n    if s_candidate != s_candidate_last:\n\n        continue\n\n    # Now check if the first k characters of s_candidate equals the last k of s_candidate\n\n    if s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        print(s_candidate)\n\n        found = True\n\n        break\n\nif not found:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where there are multiple possible L's? For example, in the second sample input, 'acacacaca' (n=9). For L=5, we get a valid solution. But what about other L's?\n\nBut the code checks in order, and returns the first possible s_candidate. Which is acceptable as per the problem statement, which allows any valid s.\n\nBut let's test this code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → n=9. L starts from (9+2)//2 = 11//2=5. So L ranges from 5 to 8 (since n is 9, the upper bound is 9-1=8, so range(5,9) → L=5,6,7,8.\n\nFor L=5: k=2*5 -9=1. Check if k is between 1 and 4. Yes. Then check first 5 is 'acaca' and last 5 is 'acaca' (since the string is a c a c a c a c a → indexes 0-8. Last 5 is 4-8: a c a c a. So yes. Then check first k=1 is 'a' and last k=1 is 'a' → yes. So output YES and 'acaca'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' → output 'YES' and 'ababab'.\n\nLet's see. The input is 'abababab' (n=8). So L starts from (8+2)/2 = 5. So L ranges from 5 to 7.\n\nCheck L=5: k=2*5 -8=2. Check 1<=2 <=4 (yes). Check first 5 is 'ababa' and last 5 is 'babab'? Let's see:\n\nt is 'abababab' → indexes 0-7.\n\nFirst 5 is 0-4: 'ababa'.\n\nLast 5 is 3-7: 'ababa'? Let me check:\n\nOriginal string:\n\nIndices 0:a, 1:b, 2:a, 3:b, 4:a, 5:b, 6:a, 7:b.\n\nSo last 5 characters are from index 3 to 7: 'b a b a b' → 'babab'? Wait, index 3 is 'b', 4 'a', 5 'b', 6 'a', 7 'b' → 'babab' → which is not equal to first 5 characters 'ababa' → so no.\n\nSo this L=5 is invalid.\n\nNext L=6. k=2*6-8=4. Check 1<=4 <=5 (yes). Check first 6 characters: 'ababab' and last 6: positions 2-7: 'ababab' → yes. Then check first 4 of s_candidate (abab) and last 4 (abab). s_candidate is 'ababab' → first 4 is 'abab', last 4 is 'baba'? Wait, no. Wait, s_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). The last 4 characters are positions 2-5: 'abab' (since 6-4=2). Wait, no. For s_candidate = 'ababab', the last 4 characters are s_candidate[-4:] → 'abab'?\n\nYes. Let me see:\n\ns_candidate is 'a b a b a b' → indexes 0-5. Last 4 is indexes 2-5: 'a b a b' → 'abab'. The first 4 is indexes 0-3: 'abab'. So yes, they are equal. So this is valid. So the code would output YES and 'ababab'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output (the fourth sample input 'abababab' outputs 'YES\\nababab').\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abcabc' → output is NO. Let's see:\n\nn=6. L starts from (6+2)//2=4. So L=4,5.\n\nFor L=4: k= 2*4 -6=2. Check 1<=2 <=3. yes. first 4 is 'abca', last 4 is 'bcab' → not equal. So skip.\n\nFor L=5: k= 2*5 -6=4. Check 1<=4 <=4 (yes). first 5 is 'abcab', last 5 is 'bcabc' → not equal. So no. Hence output NO. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is 'tatbt' → output is NO. Let's see:\n\nn=5. L starts from (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → (5+2) is 7, divided by 2 is 3.5 → integer division in Python is 3. So range(3,5) → L=3,4.\n\nFor L=3: k= 2*3 -5 = 1. Check 1<=1 <=2. yes. Check first 3 is 'tat', last 3 is 'tbt' → not equal. So no.\n\nFor L=4: k= 2*4 -5 = 3. Check 1<=3 <=3 (since L-1=3). yes. Check first 4 is 'tatb', last 4 is 'atbt' → not equal. So no. Hence output NO. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about when the string is exactly twice the length of s, but with no overlap? Like, for example, t = 'aaaaa' (n=5). Let's see. Suppose s is 'aa', then two copies would be 'aaaa', but with overlap. But for t to be formed by overlapping, the length must be 2L -k. For example, if s is 'aaa' (L=3), then possible k=1. Then 2*3 -1=5. So t would be s + s[1:] → 'aaa' + 'aa' → 'aaaaa' (length 5). So for this case, the code should find L=3, k=1. Let's check.\n\nt is 'aaaaa', n=5. L starts from (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5 floored? Wait, in Python (5+2)//2 is 7//2=3. So range(3,5) → L=3,4.\n\nFor L=3: k=2*3 -5 = 1. Check 1<=1 <=2. yes. first 3 is 'aaa', last 3 is 'aaa' (since t[-3:] is 'aaa'). Then check first 1 character of s_candidate (a) equals last 1 (a). So yes. So output YES and 'aaa'.\n\nWhich is correct. So the code would return YES here.\n\nAnother case: t is 'aaaa' (n=4). Possible L ranges from (4+2)//2=3. So L=3.\n\nk= 2*3 -4=2. Check 1<=2 <=2 (L-1=3-1=2). yes. Check first 3 is 'aaa', last 3 is 'aaa' (t[-3:] is 'aaa')? For t='aaaa', the last 3 is 'aaa' (indices 1-3). So yes. Then check first 2 of s_candidate (aa) equals last 2 (aa). So yes. So output YES and 'aaa'.\n\nBut the problem says that the case where the two messages are completely overlapped (i.e., the entire message) is not considered an error. Wait, but in this case, the code would output YES. But according to the problem statement, the case where the two messages are completely overlapped (so the entire message) is not considered an error. Wait, but what's that scenario?\n\nThe problem says that the error is when two messages are merged with a positive overlap (k>0) but less than the length of the message. So, for example, if the two messages are merged with k = L (the full length), then it's considered as completely overlapping. But the problem says that this is not considered an error. However, in our code, for the case where k is L, but according to our code, k must be less than L. Because in our code, for k to be valid, it must be between 1 and L-1. So the code would not consider cases where k = L. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the example above, the code would output YES for t='aaaa' and s_candidate 'aaa' (L=3, k=2). Which is valid because k=2 is less than L=3. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: t is 'aa' (n=2). Then possible L is (2+2)//2 = 2. So L ranges from 2 to n-1=1. Which is invalid. So the loop doesn't run, and the code outputs NO. Which is correct. Because for the code to find a solution, L must be between (n+1)/2 and n-1. For n=2, (n+1)/2 is 1.5, so L starts from 2. But n-1 is 1. So the loop is from 2 to 1, which is not executed. Hence, output is NO. Which is correct, since the only possible way would be to have two messages of length 1, but merging with k=1 (overlap of 1, which is not allowed since k must be less than L=1. So impossible.\n\nAnother case: t is 'aaa' (n=3). L starts from (3+2)//2 = 5//2=2. So L can be 2. Check:\n\nk= 2*2 -3 = 1. Which is between 1 and 1 (since L-1=1). So yes. Check first 2 characters: 'aa', last 2: 'aa' (t[-2:] is 'aa'). Then check first 1 character of 'aa' is 'a' and last 1 is 'a'. So yes. So output YES and 'aa'. Which would be correct. Because two messages of 'aa' merged with overlap of 1 character. The merged string is 'aa' + 'a' → 'aaa'.\n\nYes. So code works.\n\nAnother case: t is 'ababab' (n=6). Let's see. Possible L is (6+2)/2=4 → L=4,5.\n\nFor L=4: k= 2*4-6=2. Check 1<=2<=3. yes. first 4 is 'abab', last 4 is 'baba' → not equal. So no.\n\nFor L=5: k=2*5-6=4. Check 1<=4 <=4. yes. first 5 is 'ababa', last 5 is 'babab' → not equal. So no. So output NO. But what if the original s was 'abab'? Then two copies would be merged with k=2. The merged string would be 'abab' + 'ab' → 'ababab' (n=6). But according to the code, the first L=4 is 'abab' and the last L=4 is 'abab'? Let me check:\n\nt is 'ababab' (n=6). last 4 characters are positions 2-5: 'abab' → yes. So s_candidate is 'abab' (first 4) and last 4 is 'abab'. Then check if first k=2 of 'abab' is 'ab' and last k=2 is 'ab' → yes. So code should output YES. But according to the previous calculation, for L=4, the code would check first 4 is 'abab', last 4 is 'abab' (since t[-4:] is 'abab' (positions 2-5: 'abab').\n\nWait, why did I think earlier that for L=4, the last 4 is 'baba'? Oh, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nt is 'ababab' → indexes 0:a, 1:b, 2:a, 3:b, 4:a, 5:b.\n\nFor L=4, the last 4 characters are t[2:6] (since 6-4=2). So indexes 2-5: a, b, a, b → 'abab'. Which is same as first 4 characters. So code would proceed to check the first k=2 characters of s_candidate (ab) and last k=2 (ab). So yes. So code would output YES and 'abab'.\n\nBut according to my previous analysis, I thought that for L=4, the last 4 is 'baba', but that's incorrect. So the code would output YES here. So why?\n\nAh, this shows that the code is correct. So for this input, the code would output YES and 'abab'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nTherefore, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, for the range, when (n + 2) // 2 is calculated, and the upper limit is n-1. So the code would be:\n\nRead t, then:\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n    k = 2 * L - n\n\n    if k < 1 or k >= L:\n\n        continue\n\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n    s_last = t[-L:]\n\n    if s_candidate != s_last:\n\n        continue\n\n    if s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        print(s_candidate)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, if the upper bound is n, then the loop runs for L from start to n-1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if (n+2)//2 is larger than n-1? For example, if n=1. But the problem says that t is non-empty, but for n=1, the loop would be range( (1+2)//2=1, 1) → which is range(1,1) → no iterations. So output NO. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2. (n+2)//2 is (4)//2=2. So range(2, 2) → no iterations. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3. (3+2)//2=5//2=2. So range(2,3) → L=2. Check.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut note that in Python, for negative indices, t[-L:] is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → let's assume the length is 19. Let me check:\n\nBut for code submission, the code needs to read from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead the input line, process, etc.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input as t = input().strip()\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n    k = 2 * L - n\n\n    if k < 1 or k >= L:\n\n        continue\n\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n    s_last = t[-L:]\n\n    if s_candidate != s_last:\n\n        continue\n\n    if s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        print(s_candidate)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where there are multiple possible L's? For example, in the second sample input, 'acacacaca' (n=9), the code finds L=5 and returns. But what if there is another L that also satisfies the condition? The code returns the first one, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, testing the sample input 2: 'acacacaca' → code returns 'acaca' which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input 'abababab' (n=8) → code returns 'ababab' when L=6",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have resulted from an error where two identical messages were merged with a positive overlap. The solution involves checking possible lengths of the original message and verifying if the given string can be formed by overlapping two identical messages.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Overlap**: When two identical messages are merged with an overlap, the resulting string length `n` must satisfy the equation `n = 2L - k`, where `L` is the length of the original message and `k` is the overlap length (1 ≤ k < L).\n2. **Range of Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `L` of the original message, we need to check if there exists a valid overlap `k` such that the resulting string `t` can be formed by overlapping two messages of length `L`.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each candidate length `L`, compute the overlap `k`. Verify if the first `L` characters and the last `L` characters of `t` are the same and if the overlap part matches correctly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range((n + 2) // 2, n):\n    k = 2 * L - n\n    if k < 1 or k >= L:\n        continue\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n    s_last = t[-L:]\n    if s_candidate != s_last:\n        continue\n    if s_candidate[:k] == s_candidate[-k:]:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(s_candidate)\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Iterating Over Possible Lengths**: The loop iterates over possible lengths `L` starting from `(n + 2) // 2` to `n - 1`. This range ensures we consider valid lengths for potential original messages.\n3. **Overlap Calculation**: For each length `L`, calculate the overlap `k` using the formula `k = 2L - n`. Check if `k` is within valid bounds (1 ≤ k < L).\n4. **Validation Checks**: \n   - Check if the first `L` characters and the last `L` characters of `t` are the same.\n   - Ensure the overlap part (first `k` characters of the message match the last `k` characters).\n5. **Output Result**: If valid conditions are met, print \"YES\" followed by the candidate message. If no valid message is found, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid configurations and ensures correctness by leveraging string slicing and comparison operations.",
