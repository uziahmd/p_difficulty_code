Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle these substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be very long and there are many queries.\n\nLet me think about the approach. If I naively process each query by replacing all occurrences of di in the string with ti, that could be very slow for large strings and many queries. For example, if the original string is 1e5 characters and each query replaces a digit that appears many times, doing this directly would be O(n * m) where m is the length of the string, which might not be efficient enough.\n\nWait, but the constraints say that the sum of the lengths of ti across all queries is up to 1e5. So maybe there's a smarter way to model this with some kind of transformation tracking.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the substitutions as a series of operations. Each substitution replaces a certain digit with another string. However, substitutions are applied in order. So, if a query replaces '2' with '00', and later a query replaces '0' with '1', then the first substitution would have to be processed first, and the second substitution would affect the '0's generated by the first substitution.\n\nBut processing the substitutions directly on the string is going to be expensive for large strings. For example, if the original string is 1e5 characters and there are 1e5 substitutions, each replacing a digit that's present in the string, then each substitution could take O(len(s)) time, leading to O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a more efficient approach. How can we model the substitutions?\n\nAn idea comes to mind: instead of modifying the string directly, track for each digit what it gets replaced with. But since substitutions can be applied multiple times, we need to track dependencies. For example, if a substitution replaces '2' with '3', and later '3' is replaced with '4', then any initial '2's would end up as '4's after both substitutions.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe using a mapping that for each digit, stores the current replacement string. However, when a substitution is done, we need to update the mappings in a way that accounts for previous substitutions.\n\nWait, here's an approach inspired by the concept of function composition. Let's consider that each digit can be represented as a function that, when expanded, gives the replacement string. But since substitutions can be applied in sequence, perhaps we can represent for each digit, the current expansion as a string, and when a new substitution is made, we update the mappings accordingly.\n\nFor example, initially, each digit maps to itself. When a substitution 'd -> t' is made, we need to update the mapping for d to t. But if other digits have already been mapped through previous substitutions, then we need to make sure that when we apply substitutions, we replace all instances of d in the current mappings with the new t.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose we have a mapping where each digit is associated with a string. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when we process a substitution query \"d -> t\", we need to update the mapping for d. However, any existing mappings that may have used d (like if another digit was previously mapped to a string containing d) would need to be updated as well. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as building a tree of replacements. Each substitution is applied to the current state of the mappings. For example, when you replace '2' with '00', then any future substitution of '0' will affect those '0's. But if we process substitutions in order, perhaps we can track for each digit, what the final expansion would be.\n\nBut how do we compute the final expansion of each digit after all substitutions?\n\nLet me think of this as a dynamic process. Let's maintain for each digit (0-9) a string that represents what it would expand to. Initially, each digit is mapped to itself. Then, when a substitution is made, say \"d -> t\", we need to update the mapping for d to be t. However, when we do that, we need to consider that t may contain digits that have their own mappings. Wait, no. Because substitutions are applied in order. So when we perform a substitution, we replace all instances of d in the current string with t. But when we process the substitution queries in order, the replacement for d is t, and any subsequent substitutions on other digits would affect the t's digits.\n\nBut how can we model the expansion of each digit after all substitutions?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's maintain for each digit, a string that represents what it would expand to. However, when we perform a substitution, say, replace d with t, then for all digits that had a mapping that included d, we need to update their mappings. But that's not feasible because there could be many digits that depend on d.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the mapping in such a way that whenever we process a substitution, we update the mapping for d to t, but also ensure that any existing mappings that refer to d are updated accordingly. But that seems complex.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. Since substitutions are processed in order, and each substitution replaces all occurrences of a digit in the current string. However, the problem is that the string is not stored directly, but instead, the substitutions are applied in sequence. Therefore, the final string depends on the order of substitutions.\n\nBut the key insight is that each substitution affects the way digits are expanded. For example, suppose we have a substitution sequence:\n\nFirst, replace '2' with '3'.\nThen, replace '3' with '4'.\n\nSo, any original '2's would become '3's, which then become '4's. So the overall effect is that '2' is replaced with '4'.\n\nBut if the substitution order is reversed, replacing '3' with '4' first, then '2' with '3', the original '2's would become '3's, which then become '4's. So the result is same. Wait, no. Wait, the order matters only if a substitution is made on a digit that is part of the replacement string of a prior substitution.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose we first replace '2' with '3', then replace '3' with '4'. Then, the original '2's are replaced with '3's, then those '3's are replaced with '4's. So the net effect is that original '2's become '4's.\n\nIf the order is reversed: first replace '3' with '4', then replace '2' with '3'. Then, original '2's are replaced with '3's, which are then replaced with '4's. So same result.\n\nWait, but what if the first substitution is '2' → '3', and then a substitution of '3' → '2'? Then the original '2's would become '3's, then become '2's again. So the net effect is that the original '2's remain as '2's. But if the order was reversed, first '3' → '2', then '2' → '3', then original '2's would become '3's, which would then become '2's again. So same result.\n\nSo, the order of substitutions may not matter in some cases. However, the problem is that substitutions can overwrite previous mappings. For example, if we first replace '2' with '3', then replace '2' with '4', the second substitution overrides the first. So the original '2's would be replaced with '4's.\n\nThis suggests that for each digit, we need to track the current expansion. However, when a substitution is made for a digit, say d, we need to update its expansion to be the new t. But when we do that, any existing expansions that include d would not automatically be updated. So how can we track this?\n\nWait, but the substitutions are applied in sequence. So, when we process a substitution query, we replace all instances of d in the current string with t. But if the current string is built from the expansions of the original digits, then perhaps we can model this with a mapping that for each digit, holds the current expansion. Then, when a substitution is made, we can update the mapping for d to be t. However, when other digits are expanded, they might have included d in their expansion. But since the substitution is applied in order, when we process a substitution for d, we need to make sure that any subsequent expansion of other digits that refer to d use the new t.\n\nBut how can we manage that?\n\nAh, here's the key: when we process a substitution for a digit d, we need to update the mapping for d to be t. However, any other digits that have expansions that include d would need to be updated as well. But that seems impossible unless we track dependencies.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a trie or some kind of memoization, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: for each digit, we track the current expansion as a string. When a substitution is made, say, replacing d with t, we set the expansion of d to t. However, when expanding other digits, their expansion is built based on the current mappings. So, for example, if a digit x has an expansion that includes d, and then we change the expansion of d, we need to recompute the expansion of x. But that's not feasible unless we track dependencies.\n\nThis seems complicated. However, considering that the substitutions are processed in order, perhaps we can model the expansion of each digit in a way that when a substitution is made for a digit d, we update the expansion of d, and for any other digit that has an expansion that includes d, we need to update their expansions as well. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. The expansion of a digit is the string that it would be replaced with. So, for example, when processing substitution queries, for each digit, we can track its expansion as follows:\n\nInitially, each digit's expansion is itself.\n\nWhen a substitution query comes in, say \"d -> t\", we need to update the expansion of d to be t. However, when we expand t, we need to replace any digits in t according to their current expansions. Wait, no. Because the substitution is applied to the current string. For example, suppose we have a substitution for '2' → '3', and then a substitution for '3' → '4'. When we process the first substitution, the expansion of '2' becomes '3'. Then, when processing the second substitution, the expansion of '3' becomes '4'. Now, if we look at the original string, any '2's would be replaced with '3's, which would then be replaced with '4's. However, the expansion of '2' is now '3', but when we expand it, we need to replace '3's with their current expansion, which is '4's. So the expansion of '2' should be '4's. But how can we track that?\n\nAh! This suggests that whenever we update the expansion of a digit, we need to make sure that it's expanded using the current mappings. So, when we set the expansion of d to t, we should actually replace all digits in t with their current expansions. Wait, but that would mean that when we set d's expansion to t, we need to expand t first according to the current mappings. Because when you perform the substitution, the replacement is done immediately. For example, if you replace '2' with '3', and then replace '3' with '4', then the expansion of '2' should be '4', not '3'. So how can we track that?\n\nThis seems like the right approach. Let me think again. Let's model the expansion of each digit as a string. But whenever a substitution is made, for example, replacing d with t, we need to set the expansion of d to be t, but with all digits in t already expanded according to their current mappings. Wait, no. Because the substitution replaces all occurrences of d in the current string with t. However, the current string is built from the previous substitutions. So when we perform the substitution, the t is taken as-is, but any future substitutions on digits in t will affect the expansion of d.\n\nWait, but the substitution is done in order. Let me take an example. Suppose the original string is \"2\". First substitution is 2→3. Now, the string is \"3\". Then substitution 3→4. Now the string is \"4\". So the expansion of 2 is \"4\".\n\nBut if we model the expansion of 2 as \"3\" after the first substitution, then after the second substitution, the expansion of 3 is \"4\", so the expansion of 2 would be \"4\" when expanded. Therefore, the way to model this is that each time a substitution is made, we need to update the expansion of the digit being substituted to be the t, but when expanding, we need to expand all digits in t according to their current expansions. Wait, but that would require that when we set the expansion of d to t, we actually expand t with the current mappings. Because otherwise, if t contains digits that are later substituted, those substitutions would not be reflected in the expansion of d.\n\nSo, for example, if we first substitute d → t, and then substitute a digit in t with something else, the expansion of d would not automatically change. Therefore, to capture the correct expansion, when we perform a substitution, we need to replace the expansion of d with the current expansion of t. Wait, but how can we do that?\n\nThis seems like a problem of maintaining for each digit, a string that represents the current expansion, considering all previous substitutions. So, when we perform a substitution \"d → t\", the new expansion of d is the string t, but with all digits in t expanded according to their current mappings. Because when we perform the substitution, we are replacing d with t, but the t is a string that may contain digits that have their own expansions. However, according to the problem statement, the substitution is done as per the current state. For example, if you have a substitution \"d → t\" and then another substitution \"x → y\", then the first substitution replaces d with t, and the second replaces x with y. But during the first substitution, the t is taken as is. So if t contains x, then during the first substitution, the t is not modified. Only during the second substitution, the x's in the current string (which may include those from t) are replaced.\n\nTherefore, the expansion of d after the first substitution is t, and during the second substitution, if x is replaced by y, then any occurrence of x in t (from the first substitution) would be replaced by y. But how can we track that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because when we perform a substitution, we have to replace all instances of a certain digit in the current string. However, the current string is not stored, but built from the expansions of the original digits.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to: for each substitution, we need to track how each original digit is expanded, and when a substitution occurs, we need to update the expansion of the target digit. However, the expansion of other digits that may contain the target digit need to be updated as well.\n\nThis seems impossible unless we can find a way to represent the expansion of each digit in terms of other digits, and track dependencies. However, this seems computationally heavy.\n\nAlternative idea: since the substitutions are applied in sequence, and each substitution replaces all instances of a digit in the current string, perhaps we can model the expansion of each digit as a string, and when a substitution is made, we update the expansion of the target digit to be the new string, but with the following caveat: when expanding the new string, we need to replace any digits in it with their current expansions. Wait, no. Because the substitution is applied immediately. For example, if the current expansion of '2' is '3', and then we do a substitution of '3' → '4', the existing '3's in the string (from the previous expansion) will be replaced by '4's. Therefore, the expansion of '2' should now be '4's. But how can we track that?\n\nThis suggests that whenever a substitution is made, we need to update not only the expansion of the target digit, but also all other digits whose expansions contain the target digit. However, this seems computationally expensive, as we would have to check every digit's expansion for the presence of the target digit and update them accordingly.\n\nBut given that the number of digits is small (only 10), perhaps this is manageable.\n\nLet me think. Let's have a mapping for each digit (0-9) to a string. Initially, each digit maps to itself. When a substitution \"d → t\" is processed, we need to update the mapping for d to be t. However, after this substitution, any other digits that have their expansion containing d would need to have their expansion updated to reflect that d now expands to t. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution replaces all instances of d in the current string. But the current string is built by expanding the original digits. So, when we perform a substitution, we are changing the way that d is expanded. However, any existing expansions that were built using the old value of d's expansion will not automatically update. Therefore, if we want to track the correct expansion of all digits, we need to ensure that when a substitution is made for d, all other digits that have expansions that include d are updated to use the new expansion of d.\n\nBut how can we track that?\n\nThis seems like a problem that requires dependency tracking. For example, when we have a substitution for d, we need to go through all other digits and check if their expansion contains d. If they do, we need to update their expansion by replacing all instances of d with the current expansion of d. However, this could be very expensive if done naively, because for each substitution, we have to scan all 10 digits and check if their expansion contains d, and if so, replace d with the new expansion.\n\nBut given that the number of digits is small (10), and the number of substitutions is up to 1e5, maybe this approach is feasible.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitialize for each digit 0-9, their expansion is themselves.\n\nFor each substitution query \"d -> t\":\n\n   We need to update the expansion of d to be t. However, when we do this, any other digits that have expansions containing d must have their expansions updated as well. Wait, no. Because when we perform the substitution, it's replacing all instances of d in the current string. But the current string is built by expanding all the original digits. Therefore, after the substitution, when we expand any digit, we need to use the latest expansion of d. However, if another digit's expansion contains d, then when that digit is expanded, it will use the latest expansion of d.\n\nWait, this suggests that we don't need to pre-process other digits. Instead, when we expand a digit, we recursively expand it. For example, when we need to expand a digit x, we look up its current expansion, and then for each character in that expansion, we expand them recursively. But this could lead to infinite loops if there are cycles in substitutions (like replacing 2 with 3, then 3 with 2). However, the problem says that the substitution is applied as per the current state. So, for example, if we have a substitution 2→3 and then 3→2, the first substitution replaces all 2's with 3's, and the second replaces all 3's with 2's. So the net effect is that the original 2's become 3's then 2's again. So, the expansion of 2 is 2, but the expansion of 3 is 2. However, when we expand 2, we get 3, which when expanded becomes 2. So, how do we handle this?\n\nIn this case, when we need to compute the final string, we have to expand each digit in the original string according to the substitutions. But if there's a cycle, the expansion could be infinite. However, the problem says that the substitution is applied in sequence. So, for example, when you perform the substitution 2→3, then the expansion of 2 is 3. Then, when you perform 3→2, the expansion of 3 is 2. Therefore, when you expand the original 2's, you first expand to 3, which then expands to 2. So the final expansion of the original 2's is 2.\n\nBut how can we model this in our code? If we have a way to expand a digit's current expansion, considering all substitutions up to that point, then we can compute the final string.\n\nSo, the idea is to represent each digit's expansion as a string, and when we need to expand a digit, we recursively expand each character in its expansion. However, this recursion can be memoized to avoid redundant computations.\n\nBut how can we handle this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of using memoization. For example, for each digit, we can have a function that returns its expanded string. When expanding a digit, we check if it's already been expanded, and if so, return that. Otherwise, we expand each character in the current expansion of the digit, recursively.\n\nBut for the problem at hand, we need to compute the final string after all substitutions. However, the original string s is given, and each character in s is a digit. So, for each character in the original string, we need to expand it according to the substitutions, and concatenate all those expansions. Then, compute the resulting number mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut if the original string is large (up to 1e5 characters), and each expansion can be large (since substitutions can add more digits), then expanding each character directly would result in a very long string, which is not feasible.\n\nTherefore, we need a way to compute the final value mod 1e9+7 without constructing the entire string. Because for large strings, even storing the entire string is impossible due to memory constraints.\n\nSo, the key challenge is to compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7 of the final string, without building the entire string. To do this, we can model the expansion of each digit as a pair (value, power), where 'value' represents the contribution of the digit's expansion to the overall number, and 'power' represents the multiplicative factor needed to shift digits when concatenated.\n\nWait, here's a better idea inspired by dynamic programming. Let's model for each digit d, two values:\n\n- val[d] = the numeric value of the expansion of d mod MOD, where MOD is 1e9+7.\n\n- len[d] = the length of the expansion of d (number of digits).\n\nBut when we concatenate two numbers, say A followed by B, the numeric value is A * 10^len(B) + B. So, for example, if we have a string that is the concatenation of the expansion of digit x and the expansion of digit y, then the total value is (val[x] * pow(10, len[y], MOD) + val[y]) % MOD.\n\nTherefore, for each substitution, we need to compute for each digit d, the val and len of its expansion. However, when a substitution is made, we need to update val and len for the affected digits.\n\nBut how can we do this efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the initial state. For each digit d, val[d] = d, len[d] = 1.\n\nWhen a substitution \"d -> t\" is processed, we need to compute the new val and len for d. However, the substitution replaces all instances of d in the current string with t. So, the expansion of d is now t. However, t may contain digits that have their own expansions. Therefore, the expansion of d is t, but when we expand t, we need to consider the current val and len of each digit in t.\n\nWait, but the substitution is applied immediately. So, the current expansion of d is t. However, when we process the substitution, the t is taken as is. But during the processing of the substitution, the t is a string that may contain digits which have their own expansions. However, the substitution replaces d with t, and the t is treated as a literal string. So, when you perform the substitution, the t is added as is, and future substitutions will affect the digits in t. Therefore, when we compute the val and len for d after this substitution, we need to compute the val and len of t, considering the current val and len of each digit in t.\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution replaces d with t. So, when you have a substitution \"d -> t\", the expansion of d is now t. However, the t is a string of digits, and each digit in t may have their own expansions. But when you expand d, you get t, and then when you expand the digits in t, you get their respective expansions. Therefore, the val of d's expansion is the value of the entire string t, which is computed by combining the val and len of each digit in t.\n\nSo, for example, if t is \"ab\", then the value of t is (val[a] * 10^len[b] + val[b]) mod MOD.\n\nTherefore, when processing the substitution \"d -> t\", we need to compute the val and len of the string t, considering the current val and len of each digit in t. Once we have that, we can set val[d] and len[d] to these computed values.\n\nBut how do we compute the val and len of the string t? Well, for each character in t, we can process them sequentially, keeping track of the accumulated value and length. For example, starting with value 0 and length 0. For each character c in t:\n\nnew_value = (current_value * 10 + val[c]) % MOD\n\nnew_length = current_length + 1\n\nWait, no. Because the length is the number of digits. For example, if the current accumulated value is from a string of length L, and we append a digit with length l, then the new length is L + l. But the value is (current_value * 10^l + new_val) mod MOD.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string t is a sequence of digits. Each digit in t is a single character, but each of those characters may have their own expansions. However, when processing the substitution, the t is treated as a literal string. But when we compute the val and len for the substitution, we need to compute the value of the expansion of t, which is the concatenation of the expansions of each digit in t.\n\nSo, for example, if t is \"ab\", then the expansion of t is the concatenation of the expansion of a and the expansion of b. Therefore, the value of t's expansion is (val[a] * pow(10, len[b]) + val[b]) mod MOD, and the length is len[a] + len[b].\n\nTherefore, to compute the val and len of t, we can process each character in t in order, accumulating the value and length. For example:\n\nInitialize current_val = 0, current_len = 0.\n\nFor each character c in t:\n\n    temp_val = (current_val * pow(10, len[c]) + val[c]) % MOD\n\n    temp_len = current_len + len[c]\n\n    current_val = temp_val\n\n    current_len = temp_len\n\nSo, after processing all characters in t, current_val is the value of the expansion of t, and current_len is the length.\n\nBut how do we compute pow(10, len[c])? Well, len[c] is the length of the expansion of c. But since we need to compute this for each step, we can precompute powers of 10 modulo MOD up to the maximum possible length. However, since the maximum possible len could be large (as substitutions can add digits), we need to compute pow(10, len[c]) on the fly.\n\nBut computing pow(10, len[c]) each time could be expensive if done naively. However, since len[c] can be up to (say) 1e5 (if substitutions are adding a lot of digits), but for each substitution, we need to compute exponents. However, during the processing of the substitution, we can compute the required exponents on the fly using modular exponentiation.\n\nWait, but for each character c in t, len[c] is known. So, for example, if we have to compute 10^len[c], we can compute it as pow(10, len[c], MOD). However, calculating this for each character in t may be time-consuming if done naively, but given that the sum of the lengths of all ti is up to 1e5, this should be manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize this by precomputing the powers of 10 modulo MOD. However, since len[c] can be up to a large number (theoretically, since substitutions can be adding more digits each time), it's not feasible to precompute all possible exponents. So, for each substitution, during the processing of the string t, for each character c in t, we compute pow(10, len[c], MOD) using the built-in pow function with three arguments (which is efficient).\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nWe have for each digit d, two arrays: val[d] and len[d]. Initially, val[d] = d, len[d] = 1.\n\nWhen a substitution query \"d -> t\" comes in, we need to compute the new val and len for d. To compute this, we process the string t as follows:\n\ncurrent_val = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 0\n\nfor each c in t:\n\n    # compute the value of appending the expansion of c to the current string\n\n    power = pow(10, len[c], MOD)\n\n    current_val = (current_val * power + val[c]) % MOD\n\n    current_len += len[c]\n\nOnce this loop is done, we set val[d] = current_val, len[d] = current_len.\n\nBut wait, this is assuming that the substitution replaces d with the string t. However, during this substitution, the t is considered as a literal string. But the digits in t may have their own expansions. Therefore, the val and len for the expansion of t is computed by concatenating the expansions of each digit in t. Which is exactly what the above code does.\n\nYes! This seems correct.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, the original string s is processed by expanding each character in s. For example, for each character c in s, we take its expansion's val and len, and combine them into the total value.\n\nBut how do we combine them? Because the original string is a sequence of characters, each of which is expanded into their own strings. So the total value is the concatenation of all these expansions.\n\nFor example, if the original string is \"abc\", then the total value is (expansion(a) concatenated with expansion(b) concatenated with expansion(c)).\n\nTo compute this, we can process each character in the original string s, and for each, accumulate the value and length. For example:\n\nInitialize total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\nfor each c in s:\n\n    # compute the value of appending the expansion of c to the current total\n\n    power = pow(10, len[c], MOD)\n\n    total_val = (total_val * power + val[c]) % MOD\n\n    total_len += len[c]\n\nOnce all characters are processed, total_val is the value of the entire string mod MOD.\n\nBut this approach requires that for each substitution, we can compute the val and len of the expansion of each digit, and during processing of the original string, we can compute the total value.\n\nThis seems manageable. Now, the key is to process all substitution queries, updating the val and len arrays for the digits involved.\n\nLet's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nOriginal string is '123123', n=1, query is '2->00'.\n\nInitial val for digits:\n\nval[0] = 0, len[0] = 1\n\nval[1] = 1, len[1] = 1\n\nval[2] = 2, len[2] = 1\n\n...\n\nProcessing substitution '2->00':\n\nt is '00'.\n\nProcess each character in t:\n\nFirst character is '0':\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * pow(10, len[0]=1) + val[0] = 0*10 + 0 = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nSecond character is '0':\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * pow(10, len[0]=1) + val[0] = 0*10 + 0 = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, after substitution, val[2] = 0, len[2] = 2.\n\nNow, processing the original string '123123':\n\nEach character is processed:\n\nFirst character '1':\n\ntotal_val = 0 * 10^1 + 1 = 1\n\ntotal_len = 1.\n\nSecond character '2':\n\npow(10, len[2] = 2) = 100.\n\ntotal_val = 1 * 100 + 0 = 100.\n\ntotal_len = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThird character '3':\n\npow(10, len[3]=1) = 10.\n\ntotal_val = 100 * 10 + 3 = 1003.\n\ntotal_len = 3 + 1 =4.\n\nFourth character '1':\n\npow(10, len[1]=1) = 10.\n\ntotal_val = 1003 * 10 + 1 = 10031.\n\ntotal_len = 4 + 1 =5.\n\nFifth character '2':\n\npow(10, len[2]=2) = 100.\n\ntotal_val = 10031 * 100 + 0 = 1003100.\n\ntotal_len = 5 + 2 =7.\n\nSixth character '3':\n\npow(10, len[3]=1) = 10.\n\ntotal_val = 1003100 * 10 + 3 = 10031003.\n\nWhich matches the first sample output of 10031003 mod 1e9+7.\n\nSo this approach works for the first sample.\n\nAnother sample: the third input in the examples:\n\nInput:\n\n222\n\n2\n\n2->0\n\n0->7\n\nSo initial val and len:\n\nval[2] = 2, len[2] =1.\n\nFirst substitution is 2->0:\n\nProcessing t = '0'.\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0.\n\nFor first character '0':\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10^1 (len[0] is 1) + 0 = 0.\n\ncurrent_len = 1.\n\nSo val[2] becomes 0, len[2] becomes 1.\n\nSecond substitution is 0->7.\n\nProcessing t = '7'.\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0.\n\nFor first character '7':\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10^1 (len[7] is 1) + 7 =7.\n\ncurrent_len = 1.\n\nSo val[0] becomes 7, len[0] becomes 1.\n\nNow, the original string is '222'.\n\nProcessing each '2':\n\nEach '2' has val 0, len 1.\n\nProcessing the first '2':\n\ntotal_val is 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\ntotal_len = 1.\n\nSecond '2':\n\ntotal_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\ntotal_len = 2.\n\nThird '2':\n\ntotal_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\ntotal_len = 3.\n\nBut the sample output is 777. Wait, why?\n\nWait, after substitution 2->0 and 0->7.\n\nSo the original string is '222'.\n\nFirst substitution replaces 2 with 0, so the string becomes '000'.\n\nSecond substitution replaces 0 with 7, so the string becomes '777'.\n\nSo the value is 777 mod 1e9+7 = 777.\n\nBut according to our approach, after the substitutions, val[2] is 0, len[2] is 1. But when we process the substitution 0->7, we updated val[0] to 7, len[0] to 1.\n\nBut when we process the original string's '2's, their val is 0 (from the first substitution), but that 0 is the expansion of 2, which is '0', which then is expanded to 7. But according to our approach, the val[2] is 0, which is the value of the expansion of 2, which is '0', but when we compute the total_val, we are using the val of each digit as their expansion's value. However, in this case, the expansion of 2 is '0', which has a value of 0. But the substitution of 0 with 7 would have changed the expansion of 0. However, the substitution of 0 is processed after the substitution of 2. Therefore, the expansion of 2 is '0', which is a string that would be further expanded to '7' during the processing of the original string.\n\nWait, but according to our approach, the val and len arrays are updated for each substitution. However, when we process the substitution 0->7, we are updating val[0] and len[0], but the val[2] is still 0, which is the value of '0' before the substitution of 0. So, according to our approach, the code would compute the value as 0, but the actual value should be 777.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh! Here's the problem. Our approach assumes that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The challenge lies in efficiently processing substitutions without directly constructing potentially very large strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming with Precomputed Values**: Track for each digit (0-9) its current value and length after all substitutions. This allows us to compute the value of the string efficiently without constructing it explicitly.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, ensuring calculations remain within the bounds of standard integer types.\n3. **Efficient Substitution Handling**: For each substitution query, update the value and length of the target digit by considering the current values of the digits in the replacement string. This avoids repeatedly expanding the entire string for each substitution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            line = ''\n        else:\n            line = input[idx].strip()\n        idx += 1\n        queries.append(line)\n    \n    # Initialize val and len arrays\n    val = [0] * 10\n    length = [0] * 10\n    for d in range(10):\n        val[d] = d\n        length[d] = 1\n    \n    for query in queries:\n        if not query:\n            continue\n        parts = query.split('->')\n        d_char = parts[0]\n        d = int(d_char)\n        t = parts[1]\n        \n        # Compute the new value and length for digit d\n        current_val = 0\n        current_len = 0\n        for c in t:\n            c_int = int(c)\n            power = pow(10, length[c_int], MOD)\n            current_val = (current_val * power + val[c_int]) % MOD\n            current_len += length[c_int]\n        val[d] = current_val\n        length[d] = current_len\n    \n    # Now compute the total value from the original string s\n    total_val = 0\n    total_len = 0\n    for c in s:\n        c_int = int(c)\n        power = pow(10, length[c_int], MOD)\n        total_val = (total_val * power + val[c_int]) % MOD\n        total_len += length[c_int]\n    \n    # Handle the case when the total string is empty (but according to problem statement, s is non-empty initially)\n    # However, if substitutions result in empty string, the output is 0\n    print(total_val if total_val != 0 or total_len == 0 else 0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing arrays `val` and `length` for each digit from 0 to 9.
