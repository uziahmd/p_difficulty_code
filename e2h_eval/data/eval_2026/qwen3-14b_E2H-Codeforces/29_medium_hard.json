Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where there are multiple substitution queries applied to a string, and then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle these substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. Directly applying each substitution step by step would be too slow because each substitution could replace a digit with a long string, leading to O(n * m) time where m is the length of the string after substitutions. That's probably not feasible for large cases.\n\nHmm, so what's the alternative? Maybe we can model the substitutions in a way that tracks how each digit is transformed through the queries. Since each query replaces a digit with another string, but later queries might overwrite previous replacements. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', then later replace '0' with '5', then all the previous '2's would now be replaced by '55'?\n\nWait, no. Because the queries are processed in order. Each query replaces all instances of di in the current string with ti. So the order of processing is crucial. So for example, if a query replaces '2' with '00', then a later query replacing '0' with '5' would affect those '0's generated by the first query.\n\nBut if we process the queries in reverse order, maybe we can find a way to track the transformations. Wait, perhaps we can model the transformations as functions. For each digit, we can track what it expands to after all the queries. But since later queries can overwrite earlier ones, we need to process the queries in the order they are given and track for each digit what substitution it has.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when a substitution is made, it replaces all occurrences of di in the current string. However, if we have a substitution for di, and then later another substitution for di again, the second one would overwrite the previous substitution. For example, if first we have a query '2->a', then another query '2->b', then any occurrence of '2' in the original string would be replaced by 'a' first, then replaced by 'b' in the second query. So the final substitution for '2' is 'b'.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because during substitution steps, when we replace a digit, it's possible that other digits have already been replaced. So the key is that each substitution affects the current state of the string, which is built from previous substitutions.\n\nSo, if we think about it, the substitutions are applied in sequence. Each query replaces all instances of di in the current string with ti. However, directly simulating this for each query would be O(total_length), but if the substitutions are done naively, the string can become very large. For example, if you have a substitution that replaces a single digit with a string of length 1e5, and you have many such substitutions, the string can grow exponentially, which would be impossible to handle for n=1e5.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach. Let me think: perhaps we can represent the substitutions as a mapping from each digit to its replacement string, but track how each digit is transformed through the queries. However, since substitutions are applied in sequence, we need to process them in order, and for each digit, track what it expands to. However, when a substitution is made for a digit, say 'd', then any occurrence of 'd' in the current string will be replaced by ti. However, if ti contains digits that have their own substitutions, those would be processed in subsequent queries.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the substitution is applied to the current string. So for example, suppose we have a query that replaces '2' with '3', and then a query that replaces '3' with '4'. Then, the original '2's in the string would first be replaced by '3's, and then those '3's would be replaced by '4's. So the net effect is that the original '2's become '4's.\n\nBut if we process the queries in reverse order, perhaps we can model the transformations. For example, if we process the last query first, but that seems tricky.\n\nAlternatively, think of each substitution as a function. For each digit d, we can track what it is replaced by after all the queries. However, the problem is that when a substitution is applied, it may affect digits that were previously substituted. For example, if a query replaces '2' with '3', and then a query replaces '3' with '4', then the initial '2's would end up as '4's. So the final substitution for '2' is '4', but the substitution for '3' is '4' as well. However, if a query replaces '3' with something else later, then the substitution for '2' would have to be updated accordingly.\n\nThis suggests that we need to track for each digit, what is the current expansion. However, since substitutions can be applied in any order, and each substitution may affect the expansion of other digits, we need to process the queries in order and update the mappings accordingly.\n\nWait, here's an idea: for each digit, we can keep track of the expansion string. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a query comes in, say 'd -> t', we need to update the mapping for d to t. However, when we process a query, we need to make sure that any existing expansions for d are replaced by t. However, this approach would not capture the fact that when we replace d with t, the t may contain other digits which have their own expansions. But since the substitutions are applied in sequence, when a query is processed, the current string is modified. So, for example, if we have a substitution for d, and then later a substitution for another digit e, which is present in the expansion of d, then the expansion of d would need to be updated to reflect that e is now replaced by its new expansion.\n\nWait, but that's not possible unless we recompute the expansion of d every time a substitution for any digit that appears in its expansion is changed. Which sounds complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the substitution process as building a tree of expansions. For example, each digit's expansion is a string that may contain other digits. When a substitution is made, we can update the expansion of that digit. However, when we need to compute the final string, we have to recursively expand each digit according to the current mappings. But since the substitutions are applied in order, the expansion of a digit depends on the current state of the mappings at the time of substitution.\n\nWait, but how can we model this? Let's think of each substitution as modifying the expansion of a digit. For example, initially, each digit's expansion is itself. Then, when a query 'd->t' is processed, the expansion for d is set to t. However, when t contains digits, those digits may have their own expansions. However, during the substitution process, when we apply the query, we replace all instances of d in the current string with the expansion of t (which may itself be expanded). Wait, but the problem is that the current string is being modified. So, for example, if we have a substitution for d, and then a substitution for e, which is part of the expansion of d, then the expansion of d would not automatically include the substitution for e unless we reprocess the expansion of d.\n\nThis seems like a problem. Because if we track the expansion of each digit as a string, and when a substitution is made for a digit, we can't just update the expansion of that digit, because it may contain other digits that have been substituted later.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nInitial mappings: d maps to d, e maps to e.\n\nQuery 1: d -> e. Now, d's expansion is e.\n\nQuery 2: e -> f. Now, e's expansion is f. But the expansion of d was set to e, which now expands to f. So, the expansion of d should now be f. But how do we track that?\n\nIf we process the queries in order, and whenever a substitution is made, we need to update all existing expansions that contain the substituted digit. But that's not feasible unless we can track dependencies.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming. For example, when we process a query, we can update the expansion of the digit, but when we need to compute the value of the expansion of a digit, we compute it on the fly by expanding all the digits in the expansion string using the current mappings.\n\nWait, but how can we compute the final value of the entire string without actually building the entire string? Because the problem requires us to compute the number mod 1e9+7, but the string can be very long. So we need a way to compute the numeric value mod MOD without building the actual string.\n\nAh! Here's the key insight. Instead of tracking the actual strings, we can track for each digit, the value of the expansion as a number mod MOD. However, since the expansion can be a string of digits, we need to compute how substituting that string would contribute to the overall value.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think recursively. Suppose that for each digit d, we have two values:\n\n- The value of the expansion of d as a number mod MOD.\n\n- The length of the expansion of d as a number of digits. Because when we append digits to the left or right, we need to know how to compute the contribution to the overall number.\n\nWait, but when we substitute a digit, the expansion can be thought of as a string that is inserted into the current string. For example, suppose that the current string is S, and we replace all instances of d with t. The new string is formed by replacing each occurrence of d in S with t. So, the numeric value of the new string can be computed based on the numeric value of the original string and the substitutions.\n\nBut how can we model this with dynamic programming?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the initial string is s. Each query replaces all instances of di with ti. After all queries, compute the numeric value mod MOD.\n\nBut the problem is that the substitutions can be very expensive if done naively.\n\nAlternative approach: For each digit, track a function that represents the value of expanding that digit. However, since the substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution may affect the expansion of digits, we can model this with a memoization approach.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nWe can maintain for each digit d, a pair (val, len), where val is the value of the expansion of d mod MOD, and len is the number of digits in the expansion of d. This way, when we need to compute the value of a string that is formed by concatenating expansions of digits, we can compute it efficiently.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a string that is formed by digits a followed by b. The value of this string is a_val * 10^b_len + b_val. Similarly, if a string is formed by multiple parts, we can compute the total value by multiplying the previous parts by 10^length of new parts and adding the new parts.\n\nSo, during substitution processing, we can track for each digit, the (val, len) of its expansion. Then, when a query comes in, say \"d -> t\", we need to compute the (val, len) of t, and set d's (val, len) to that of t. However, the expansion of t may involve other digits, whose (val, len) are already tracked.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the (val, len) of t? Because t is a string of digits, which can be processed by expanding each character in t and combining their values. For example, if t is \"abc\", then the value of t is the value of a's expansion multiplied by 10^(len_b + len_c) plus the value of b's expansion multiplied by 10^(len_c) plus the value of c's expansion. And the length is len_a + len_b + len_c.\n\nSo, for a given string t, we can compute its (val, len) by processing each character in t in order, and combining their contributions.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Maintain a dictionary (or array) for each digit (0-9), storing (val, len) of their expansion. Initially, for each digit d, val is d mod MOD, and len is 1.\n\n- For each query, process it by replacing the digit d with the string t. To compute the (val, len) for t, we process each character in t, and for each character, get its current (val, len) and combine them into the overall val and len of t.\n\nOnce we have the (val, len) for t, we update the (val, len) for d to be equal to that of t.\n\nThen, after processing all queries, we process the original string s. For each character in s, we get its (val, len) and combine them into the total value of the entire string.\n\nThis approach avoids building the actual string and instead computes the value incrementally using the (val, len) pairs for each digit.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's think about how to compute the combination of two parts. Suppose we have a current value V and length L, and we append a new part with value W and length M. The new value is (V * 10^M + W) mod MOD. The new length is L + M.\n\nSo, for each step in processing the original string s, we can accumulate the total value by combining the current accumulated value with the next character's (val, len).\n\nBut how do we compute 10^M mod MOD quickly? Well, we can precompute powers of 10 mod MOD, but since M can be up to ... well, the maximum length of the expansion. However, since the maximum possible length is not known in advance, but during the processing of the queries, we can compute 10^M mod MOD on the fly using modular exponentiation. However, since M can be up to a large value (like 1e5), but for each step, we can compute the power as needed.\n\nWait, but for each combination of two parts, we need to compute 10^M mod MOD, where M is the length of the second part. So, if we have a way to compute 10^k mod MOD for any k, then we can proceed.\n\nBut computing 10^k mod MOD for arbitrary k can be done with pow(10, k, MOD), but that's O(log k) time. However, if we can precompute all possible exponents up to the maximum possible length, that would be better. However, since the maximum possible length can be up to the sum of lengths of all ti, which is up to 1e5, but during the processing of the queries, the len for each digit can be up to that.\n\nBut considering that for each query, when we process t, we need to compute the combined (val, len) of t. For example, if t is a string of length m, then when processing each character in t, we can compute the cumulative val and len.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize for each digit d (0-9):\n\ndigit_map[d] = (val, len) = (d, 1)\n\nThen, for each query in order:\n\nThe query is of the form d -> t.\n\nWe need to compute the (val, len) of t. How?\n\nWe can process each character in t in order, and for each character, get its current (val, len) from digit_map. Then, combine them into the overall val and len of t.\n\nFor example, suppose t is \"abc\".\n\nStart with current_val = 0, current_len = 0.\n\nProcess 'a':\n\ncurrent_val = (current_val * 10^current_len_of_a + val_a) mod MOD ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think: the initial value is 0. We add the first character, which is 'a'. The value is val_a, and the length is len_a.\n\nThen, the next character is 'b'. The current value is (current_val * 10^len_b + val_b) mod MOD? No, wait, the current value is the value of the string up to now, and when we append the new part (the 'b'), the new value is current_val * 10^len_b + val_b. And the new length is current_len + len_b.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the first part is 'a' with value Va and length La. The second part is 'b' with value Vb and length Lb. The combined string is 'ab', which has value Va * 10^Lb + Vb. The length is La + Lb.\n\nSo, when processing the string t, which is a sequence of characters, we can process each character in order, and for each step, compute the accumulated value and length.\n\nSo for example, for t = \"abc\":\n\nInitialize acc_val = 0, acc_len = 0.\n\nTake first character 'a':\n\nacc_val = (acc_val * 10^len_a + val_a) mod MOD ?\n\nNo, because initially, acc_val is 0, and we are adding 'a' which has val_a and len_a. The new value is 0 * 10^len_a + val_a = val_a. The new length is 0 + len_a = len_a.\n\nYes. So for the first character, it's straightforward.\n\nThen, take the second character 'b', which has val_b and len_b. The current acc_val is val_a, and acc_len is len_a. The new value is val_a * 10^len_b + val_b. The new length is len_a + len_b.\n\nThen, take third character 'c', which has val_c and len_c. The new value is (previous acc_val) * 10^len_c + val_c. The new length is previous len + len_c.\n\nSo, for each character in t, we need to compute this.\n\nTherefore, for the string t, we can compute its (val, len) by processing each character in order, and for each step, combining the accumulated value with the current character's (val, len).\n\nOnce we compute the (val, len) of t, we can set the digit d's (val, len) to that of t.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, we need to process the original string s. For each character in s, we get its (val, len) and combine them into the total value.\n\nSo, for example, the original s is processed character by character, combining each character's (val, len) into the accumulated value.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute 10^k mod MOD for arbitrary k. Since k can be up to the maximum possible len of any expansion, which could be up to 1e5 (since sum of ti lengths is 1e5). But for each combination step, we need to compute 10^len_part mod MOD.\n\nBut for each combination step, the len_part is the length of the part being added. So, for example, when combining the accumulated value with a new part, we need to compute pow(10, len_new_part, MOD). However, calculating this each time with pow() may be acceptable if the number of operations is manageable.\n\nBut since for each query, when processing t, we may have to compute multiple exponents. For example, processing a t of length m would require m steps, each requiring a pow(10, len_i, MOD) where len_i is the len of the current character being added. Wait, no. Wait, during the processing of t, each step involves combining the accumulated value with the next character's (val, len). For example, when adding the next character, we need to compute 10^len_current_char, where len_current_char is the len of the current character's expansion. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that the accumulated value is V, with length L. We are adding a new part with value W and length M. The new value is V * 10^M + W. The new length is L + M.\n\nSo, during the processing of the string t, each step requires multiplying the accumulated value by 10^M (where M is the length of the new part) and adding the new part's value.\n\nBut how do we compute 10^M mod MOD? For example, during the processing of the string t, for each character, we have to compute 10^len_current_char, where len_current_char is the len of that character's expansion.\n\nSo, for example, during the processing of the string t, when we add the first character, which has len = len_1, then the next character has len = len_2, etc.\n\nThus, for each step, when combining the accumulated value with the new part, we need to compute 10^M mod MOD, where M is the length of the new part.\n\nSo, for each step, we need to compute pow(10, M, MOD). But since M can be up to 1e5, and there are up to 1e5 steps, this could be computationally expensive if done naively.\n\nBut in Python, pow(10, M, MOD) is efficient, even for large exponents, because it uses modular exponentiation under the hood. So for each step, it's O(log M) time. However, with 1e5 steps, each taking O(log M) time, that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute all possible exponents up to the maximum possible length. However, the maximum possible length is the sum of all ti lengths, which is up to 1e5. So precomputing an array of 1e5+1 elements, where power[i] = 10^i mod MOD, would allow O(1) access. But how to compute that?\n\nWell, for the initial problem, during the processing of the queries and the original string, we need to compute 10^k mod MOD for various k. However, during the processing of the queries, the len of each digit's expansion can be up to the sum of all ti lengths. So precomputing up to 1e5 is possible. But how?\n\nBut the problem is that during the processing of the queries, the len for each digit can be updated. For example, if a substitution replaces a digit with a longer string, the len increases. So precomputing up to 1e5 may not be enough. However, the maximum possible len for any digit is the sum of all ti lengths. Since the sum of ti lengths is up to 1e5, then precomputing up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nWait, no. Because when you process a query, the ti can be up to 1e5 in total sum. For example, if a query replaces a digit with a string of length 1e5, then the len for that digit becomes 1e5. So precomputing up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nSo, let's precompute an array of powers of 10 mod MOD, up to 1e5 + 1. Then, for any k up to that maximum, we can get the value in O(1) time.\n\nBut how do we know the maximum required power? Well, the maximum possible len for any digit's expansion is the sum of the lengths of all ti strings. Since the sum of ti lengths across all queries is up to 1e5, then the maximum len for any digit's expansion is up to 1e5. Therefore, precomputing up to 1e5 would suffice.\n\nSo, during the initial processing, we can precompute pow10 = [1] * (max_len + 1), and for i from 1 to max_len, pow10[i] = (pow10[i-1] * 10) % MOD.\n\nBut how do we know the max_len? Well, the sum of the lengths of all ti is up to 1e5. So during the input processing, we can compute the total length of all ti strings, and precompute pow10 up to that length. However, since the sum can be up to 1e5, we can precompute up to 1e5.\n\nBut for the problem, the input is given as a list of test cases. Wait, no, the problem is a single input. Wait, the user provided some examples, but the actual input is read from stdin. So, for the code, during the processing of the input, the code can calculate the total length of all ti strings across all queries, and precompute the pow10 array up to that length. However, for cases where the sum is zero (n=0), then the pow10 array can be of size 1.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to precompute up to 1e5 + 1, since the sum is guaranteed to be <= 1e5. So, precompute pow10 up to 1e5 + 1 once.\n\nBut in Python, even if we compute pow(10, k, MOD) on the fly, for each k, it's manageable. Let's think about the time complexity. For each query, when processing the ti string, each character in ti is processed once. For each character, when combining into the accumulated value, we need to compute 10^m mod MOD, where m is the len of the current character's expansion. So, for each step, it's O(1) with pow(10, m, MOD). However, if m is up to 1e5, then each pow(10, m, MOD) is O(log m) time. For each query, the total time is O(len(ti) * log m), which for len(ti) up to 1e5, and n up to 1e5, would be O( (1e5)^2 * log m ), which is way too big.\n\nWait, that's not feasible. For example, if each query has ti of length 1e5, then for each query, we have O(1e5) steps, each with O(log m) time. That would be O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible. Therefore, we need to find a way to compute the exponents more efficiently.\n\nAlternative idea: during the processing of the ti string, when combining the accumulated value with the new part, we can track the accumulated length, and compute the required exponent on the fly using the precomputed pow10 array. But how?\n\nWait, the problem is that during the processing of the ti string, the accumulated length is being built incrementally. For example, when processing the first character, the accumulated length is len_1. When processing the second character, the accumulated length is len_1 + len_2. But when combining the accumulated value with the new part, we need to compute 10^len_new_part, where len_new_part is the length of the new part (the current character's len).\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express the combination step again. Suppose the accumulated value is V with length L. We are adding a new part with value W and length M. The new value is V * (10^M) + W. The new length is L + M.\n\nSo, during the processing of the ti string, for each character in ti, we have to compute 10^M, where M is the length of the current character's expansion.\n\nSo, if we can precompute the pow10 array up to the maximum possible M (which is up to 1e5), then for any M, we can get pow10[M] in O(1) time.\n\nThus, precomputing the pow10 array is essential for efficiency.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute pow10 array up to 1e5 + 1, where pow10[k] = 10^k mod MOD.\n\nBut how do we know the maximum required k? Well, during the processing of the queries, the maximum possible len for any digit's expansion is the sum of the lengths of all ti strings. Since the sum of ti lengths is up to 1e5, then the maximum possible len is up to 1e5. Thus, precomputing pow10 up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nSo, during the code initialization, we can compute pow10 up to 1e5 + 1.\n\nBut how do we compute that? Well, for the code, we can precompute pow10 as follows:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nmax_pow = 1e5 + 10 (to be safe)\n\npow10 = [1] * (max_pow)\n\nfor i in 1 to max_pow-1:\n\n    pow10[i] = (pow10[i-1] * 10) % MOD\n\nBut in Python, for the given problem, the maximum possible sum of ti lengths is 1e5. So, during the code, we can compute the maximum possible pow10 needed as the sum of all ti lengths across all queries. However, since that's not known until we read the input, perhaps it's easier to precompute up to 1e5 + 1, since the sum is constrained by the problem statement.\n\nBut given that the sum of ti lengths is up to 1e5, the maximum len of any expansion is up to 1e5, so precomputing pow10 up to 1e5 is sufficient.\n\nSo, during the code, before processing the queries, we can precompute pow10 up to 1e5 + 1.\n\nBut how to handle cases where len exceeds that? Well, according to the problem statement, the sum of ti lengths across all queries is up to 1e5. Therefore, during the processing of the queries, the len for any digit's expansion will not exceed that sum, which is up to 1e5. Thus, the precomputed pow10 array is sufficient.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's proceed.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the initial string s.\n\nRead n, the number of queries.\n\nRead the n queries.\n\nCompute the sum of lengths of all ti strings. Let's call it total_ti_length. But perhaps we can just precompute up to 1e5 + 1, since the problem says that sum of ti lengths is <= 1e5.\n\nSo, precompute pow10 up to 1e5 + 1.\n\nInitialize for each digit (0-9) their (val, len) as (digit, 1).\n\nThen, process each query in order:\n\nFor each query, parse d and t.\n\nCompute the (val, len) of t as follows:\n\nInitialize current_val = 0, current_len = 0.\n\nFor each char in t:\n\n    get the (val_char, len_char) from digit_map for this char.\n\n    compute the multiplier = pow10[len_char]\n\n    current_val = (current_val * multiplier + val_char) % MOD\n\n    current_len += len_char\n\nOnce the entire t is processed, the (val_t, len_t) is (current_val, current_len).\n\nThen, set digit_map[d] = (val_t, len_t).\n\nOnce all queries are processed, process the original string s:\n\nInitialize total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\nFor each char in s:\n\n    get (val_char, len_char) from digit_map.\n\n    compute multiplier = pow10[len_char]\n\n    total_val = (total_val * multiplier + val_char) % MOD\n\n    total_len += len_char\n\nFinally, output total_val % MOD.\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? According to the problem statement, leading zeros are not removed. However, when converting the string to a number, leading zeros are ignored. For example, if the final string is '00123', the number is 123.\n\nBut in our approach, the code is computing the numeric value mod MOD as if the string is taken as a decimal number. However, leading zeros would contribute to the value. For example, the string '00123' would be treated as 123, but our code would compute (0 * 10^5 + 0 * 10^4 + 1 * 10^3 + 2 * 10^2 + 3 * 10^1) ? No, no. Wait, our approach is to compute the numeric value of the string as a decimal number, including leading zeros. However, the problem says that leading zeros are ignored. So, for example, if the string is '00123', the number is 123, not 00123. But how does our approach handle that?\n\nThis is a critical point. Our current approach computes the numeric value of the string as a decimal number, including leading zeros. However, according to the problem statement, leading zeros are not considered. For example, the string '00123' would be considered as 123, which is 123 mod MOD.\n\nBut how can we compute this correctly with our approach?\n\nThis is a problem. Because our current approach would compute the value of the entire string as the actual numeric value, including leading zeros. However, the problem says that leading zeros are ignored. For example, the string '000' would be considered as 0, not 000. But according to our approach, the value is 0 mod MOD, which is correct. However, for the string '00123', the numeric value is 123, but according to our approach, the value would be 0 * 10^5 + 0 * 10^4 + 1 * 10^3 + 2 * 10^2 + 3 * 10^1 + ...? No, no. Wait, the way we compute the value is by processing each character in the string and combining them. For example, the string '00123' would be processed as follows:\n\nInitially, total_val is 0, total_len is 0.\n\nFirst '0' (val 0, len 1):\n\ntotal_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. total_len is 1.\n\nSecond '0' (val 0, len 1):\n\nmultiplier is 10^1 (pow10[1] = 10). total_val = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0. total_len is 2.\n\nThird '1' (val 1, len 1): multiplier is 10^1. total_val = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1. total_len is 3.\n\nFourth '2' (val 2, len 1): multiplier is 10^1. total_val = 1 * 10 + 2 = 12. total_len is 4.\n\nFifth '3' (val 3, len 1): multiplier is 10^1. total_val = 12 * 10 + 3 = 123. total_len is 5.\n\nWhich is correct. So the code would return 123 mod MOD, which is correct. However, what about a string like '0'? It would return 0, which is correct. What about '000'? The code returns 0, which is correct. So, our approach correctly handles leading zeros because the way we compute the value is equivalent to the numeric value of the string, which includes leading zeros. However, when the numeric value is computed, leading zeros do not affect the value. For example, '00123' is 123, and our code computes that correctly. So the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code as outlined is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nCase 1: empty string. According to the problem statement, if the string is empty, the number is considered as zero. However, in our code, during processing of the original string, if s is empty, the total_val remains 0, which is correct.\n\nCase 2: substitutions leading to empty strings. For example, if a query replaces a digit with an empty string. For example, the original string is '123', and a query replaces '1' with empty string. Then the string becomes '23'. Then, another query replaces '2' with empty string, resulting in '3'.\n\nIn our code, during processing of the query, when t is empty, then for the string t, the current_val is 0, current_len is 0. So the (val, len) for the digit d is (0, 0). Then, when processing the original string, each occurrence of d would contribute 0 and 0. So when combining, the code would multiply the accumulated value by 10^0 (which is 1) and add 0. So, for example, if the original string is 'd', and d's expansion is (0, 0), then the total_val is 0.\n\nBut what about the case where the entire string becomes empty? Then, the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: substitution leading to a string with leading zeros. For example, original string is '1', and query replaces '1' with '00'. Then, the string is '00', which is treated as 0. Our code would compute 0*10^1 + 0 = 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: substitution replaces a digit with a longer string. For example, original string is '1', and query replaces '1' with '123', then the code would compute 123 mod MOD.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the pow10 array.\n\nBut how to precompute it? Since the maximum possible len is up to 1e5, we can precompute pow10 up to 1e5 + 1.\n\nBut in Python, for the code, we can precompute it once before processing the queries.\n\nBut what about when the len exceeds 1e5? Well, according to the problem statement, the sum of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle multiple substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The challenge lies in efficiently processing substitutions without explicitly constructing potentially very large strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Precompute Powers of 10 Modulo**: Since we need to compute values modulo $10^9 + 7$, precomputing powers of 10 up to a sufficiently large number (based on input constraints) helps avoid repeated expensive modular exponentiation calculations.\n2. **Track Digit Expansions**: Maintain mappings for each digit that track the value and length of its expansion after all substitutions. This allows us to dynamically update expansions as substitutions are applied.\n3. **Efficient Substitution Processing**: For each substitution query, compute the new value and length of the target string using the current mappings, ensuring efficient combination of values using precomputed powers of 10.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    total_ti_length = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            line = ''\n        else:\n            line = input[idx].strip()\n        idx += 1\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        queries.append(line)\n        # Calculate the total length of ti for all queries\n        parts = line.split('->')\n        ti = parts[1]\n        total_ti_length += len(ti)\n    \n    # Precompute pow10 up to max needed length (total_ti_length + 1)\n    max_pow = max(100000, total_ti_length + 1)  # 1e5 is the maximum possible\n    pow10 = [1] * (max_pow + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_pow + 1):\n        pow10[i] = (pow10[i-1] * 10) % MOD\n    \n    # Initialize digit_map: for each digit, (val, len)\n    digit_map = {}\n    for d in range(10):\n        digit_map[str(d)] = (d, 1)\n    \n    # Process each query\n    for q in queries:\n        if not q:\n            continue\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1]\n        # Compute (val, len) of ti\n        current_val = 0\n        current_len = 0\n        for c in ti:\n            val_char, len_char = digit_map[c]\n            multiplier = pow10[len_char]\n            current_val = (current_val * multiplier + val_char) % MOD\n            current_len += len_char\n        # Update digit_map for d\n        digit_map[d] = (current_val, current_len)\n    \n    # Process the original string s\n    total_val = 0\n    total_len = 0\n    for c in s:\n        val_char, len_char = digit_map[c]\n        multiplier = pow10[len_char]\n        total_val = (total_val * multiplier + val_char) % MOD\n        total_len += len_char\n    \n    print(total_val % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Powers of 10**: We precompute an array `pow10` where `pow10[i]` holds $10^i \\mod (10^9 + 7)$.
