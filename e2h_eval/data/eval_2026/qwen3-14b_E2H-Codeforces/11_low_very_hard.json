A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the goal is to determine how many toasts each friend can make, given certain resources. All friends must make the same number of toasts. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the inputs. The input consists of several integers: n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend). \n\nEach toast requires each friend to have nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. So for one toast, all n friends are making one toast each. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for one toast, each friend uses those amounts. So for one toast, total drink required is n * nl. Because each of the n friends uses nl for their toast. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices needed per toast is n. And salt per toast is n * np, since each friend uses np grams.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the wording says \"each friend needs ...\". So for each toast, each friend needs their own portion. So if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, per friend, they need nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend would need t * nl ml. But since there are n friends, the total drink required is n * t * nl? Or wait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend has one. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, for the lime slices: each toast requires each friend to have a slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. For t toasts, n * t slices. And the salt per toast is n * np grams. So for t toasts, total salt is t * n * np.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the maximum t such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nSo let's calculate how much of each resource is available:\n\nTotal drink available is k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices available is c * d.\n\nTotal salt available is p grams.\n\nSo for the drink, the maximum possible t is (k*l) // (n * nl). Because total drink needed is t * n * nl. So t can't exceed (k*l) divided by (n * nl). Similarly for the lime slices: t can't exceed (c*d) divided by (n). And for salt, it's p divided by (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three constraints must be satisfied.\n\nWait, but the example given in the first input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nnl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total drink is 3 * 3 =9 ml. So for t toasts, total is 3*3*t = 9t. So the total available is 20. So 9t <=20. So t can be 2 (since 9*2=18 <=20, 9*3=27>20). So that gives 20//9 = 2.222, floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation where they say 20/3=6. Wait, wait, why?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why is that?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the note, they say:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters. It is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why divide by 3? Because each toast requires 3 ml per friend. Wait, but for one toast, each of the 3 friends needs 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, which would give 2 toasts. But according to the note, they have 6 toasts. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says:",
