A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs and what each part represents.\n\nThe input consists of n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl milliliters. Because each of the n friends uses nl for their toast. Similarly for the salt: each toast requires n * np grams of salt, since each friend uses np grams.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs these. So total for one toast:\n\nDrink: n * nl ml.\n\nSalt: n * np grams.\n\nLime slices: each friend needs one slice. So per toast, n slices are needed.\n\nSo the total resources available are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d slices.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nSo the number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor the drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the maximum possible toasts from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, if the division isn't exact, we take the floor, because you can't have a fraction of a toast.\n\nSame for salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So max_toasts_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nFor the lime slices: total_slices = c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So max_toasts_lime = (c*d) // n.\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but let me check the example given.\n\nFirst example input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. That's the drink limit.\n\nSalt: 100 grams. Each toast requires 3 * 1 =3 grams. 100/3 is 33.333, floor 33. But the example says the salt is enough for 100 toasts. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no. Wait in the note, they say the salt is enough for 100 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says: the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. Oh, because np is 1. So for each toast, each friend needs 1 gram. So per toast, 3 friends need 3 * 1 = 3 grams. So the total salt is 100 grams. 100 divided by 3 is 33.333, which would be 33. But according to the note, the salt is enough for 100 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says: the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, the total salt needed is n * np grams. So in the first example, np is 1. So per toast, 3 * 1 =3 grams. So 100 grams would allow 100 / 3 = 33.333, which is 33 toasts. But according to the note, the salt is enough for 100 toasts. That suggests that maybe I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, the total drink required is",
