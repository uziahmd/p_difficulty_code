After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are the best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column), find the maximum value.\n2. For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many students meet this condition.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, input handling. The input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line is a string of digits. So, for example, if the input is '223', that represents the marks for three subjects for a student.\n\nSo, I need to read the input, parse the numbers, and then process each column (subject) to find the maximums.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines as a list of strings. Each string represents a student's marks for m subjects.\n- For each subject (columns 0 to m-1), find the maximum value among all students.\n- Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n- Count the number of such students.\n\nSo, the key part is to find for each column the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in that column is equal to the column's max.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the data. Let's say we have a 2D list, where each row is a student, and each column is a subject. For example, for the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe data would be:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nFor each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (students 0 and 1 have 2)\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 1)\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 0)\n\nSo, student 0 is best in subject 2, student 1 is best in subject 1, and student 2 isn't best in any. So the count is 2.\n\nSo, how to compute the max for each column?\n\nWe can transpose the matrix. For example, for the data, each row is a student. Transposing would make each row a subject. Then, for each row in the transposed matrix, find the max.\n\nAlternatively, for each column index j, iterate through all students' j-th mark and find the max.\n\nOnce we have the max for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max of that subject.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read the input. Let's read n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string. Then, for each line, convert it into a list of integers. For example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have the data as a list of lists, then for each column j, compute the maximum value.\n\nLet me think about how to get the columns. For example, for the data:\n\nstudents = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\ncolumns are:\n\nsubject 0: [2,2,1] → max is 2\nsubject 1: [2,3,1] → max is 3\nsubject 2: [3,2,2] → max is 3\n\nSo, for each j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( students[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject equals the max_marks for that subject.\n\nSo for each student in students:\n\nfor any j in 0..m-1:\n\nif student[j] == max_marks[j], then mark this student as successful.\n\nOnce we find that, we can count the number of students who have at least one such occurrence.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead n lines, each line as a string, then",
