For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to output this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for every binary string s (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. The multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n. The maximum size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Our goal is to find the number of valid c_s assignments that make this maximum exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The key is to find for each possible c_s configuration, what is the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset, and then count those configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute the maximum possible size given the c_s values?\n\nLet me consider that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by some constraints. For example, each string in the multiset contributes to the counts of all its prefixes. So, if we have a string of length n, say '010', then it contributes to the counts of '0', '01', '010'.\n\nThe problem is similar to a trie structure, where each node (representing a prefix) has a capacity c_s. The maximum number of strings we can place in the multiset is constrained by these capacities. But since each string contributes to multiple prefixes, we need to ensure that for every prefix, the total number of strings that have that prefix doesn't exceed c_s.\n\nThis feels like a problem where we need to find the maximum number of strings that can be placed under these constraints, which might be modeled using some kind of flow or dynamic programming approach. However, since the problem is about counting the number of c_s configurations that result in a certain maximum, perhaps there's a way to model this with inclusion-exclusion or generating functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum of some values along the paths in the trie. Let's think recursively. For each node (prefix), the number of strings that can pass through it is limited by c_s. But each string is a path from the root to a leaf (since all strings are of length n). So, the problem resembles a tree with nodes for all prefixes, and we need to select a set of leaves (strings of length n) such that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree does not exceed c_s. The maximum number of leaves we can select is the maximum possible beautiful multiset size.\n\nAh! So the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected such that for every node (prefix), the number of selected leaves in its subtree is at most c_s. Then, our task is to count the number of c_s configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nNow, the question is: How do we compute, for a given set of c_s values, what is the maximum number of strings (leaves) that can be placed in the multiset?\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where each node has a capacity, and the sum of capacities along the path must be respected. But how?\n\nLet me think of this as a tree. Each node represents a prefix. The root is the empty string (but perhaps not considered here). Wait, the prefixes are of length 1 to n. For example, for n=2, the nodes are all strings of length 1 and 2. The root would be the empty string, but perhaps not considered here. But in the problem statement, the constraints are for all prefixes of length 1 to n.\n\nEach leaf is a string of length n. For any node (prefix), the number of leaves in its subtree (i.e., strings that start with this prefix) cannot exceed c_s. So the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints of all nodes. How do we find this maximum?\n\nThis sounds like the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves such that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. This is equivalent to the minimum over all nodes of the capacity multiplied by the number of leaves that can be placed under that node's subtree. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nFor example, if a node has capacity c, then the number of leaves in its subtree can't exceed c. However, each leaf is in the subtree of multiple nodes (all its prefixes). So, the problem is to assign to each leaf a count, such that for every node, the sum of counts of leaves",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to choose values for each binary string prefix such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of binary strings of length exactly `n` is exactly `f`. The solution involves dynamic programming and combinatorial counting with modular arithmetic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: Consider all binary strings as nodes in a trie where each node represents a prefix. Each node's capacity constraint (c_s) limits how many strings can have that prefix.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use DP to calculate the number of valid configurations for each node based on its children. This helps in determining the constraints for the prefixes.\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: For each node, compute the number of ways to choose capacities such that the constraints are satisfied and the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is exactly `f`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    cases = []\n    for i in range(0, len(data), 3):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        k = int(data[i+1])\n        f = int(data[i+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, k, f in cases:\n        # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials up to n\n        max_len = n\n        fact = [1] * (max_len + 1)\n        for i in range(1, max_len + 1):\n            fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n        \n        inv_fact = [1] * (max_len + 1)\n        inv_fact[max_len] = pow(fact[max_len], MOD-2, MOD)\n        for i in range(max_len-1, -1, -1):\n            inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n        \n        # dp[i] = number of ways to assign c's for all strings of length <= i\n        # such that the maximum possible beautiful multiset size is exactly f\n        # But we need to compute for the entire tree\n        # However, the problem requires considering all prefixes, so we need a way to model the constraints\n        \n        # The key idea is that for each node (prefix of length l), the number of leaves in its subtree is limited by c_s\n        # The maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n-l}) for all prefixes s of length l\n        # Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n        # For each node (prefix s of length l), the number of leaves in its subtree is at most c_s.\n        # Since each leaf is of length n, the number of leaves in the subtree of s is equal to the number of ways to extend s to length n, which is 2^{n - l}.\n        # However, if c_s is less than 2^{n - l}, then the maximum number of leaves under s is c_s. Otherwise, it's 2^{n - l}.\n        # So the overall maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 1) if we can choose the leaves such that all constraints are satisfied.\n        # Wait, no. Because each leaf contributes to multiple prefixes. So the maximum number of leaves is constrained by the minimum over all nodes of (c_s * 1) multiplied by some factor?\n        \n        # Another approach: the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s) multiplied by the number of leaves in their subtrees. But this seems unclear.\n        \n        # Instead, consider that for the entire trie, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s) * 1, but adjusted for overlapping constraints.\n        # However, this might not be accurate. Let's think recursively.\n        \n        # For the root (empty string?), but in our case, the prefixes are from length 1 to n. So maybe we should model the problem as follows:\n        # Each node of depth l (length l) has a capacity c. The number of leaves that can be under this node is min(c, ...). But the exact relation is complex.\n        \n        # A better approach is inspired by the following observation: the maximum number of leaves is the minimum of (c_s) over all nodes s, where s is a prefix of some leaf. But this is not correct either.\n        \n        # Let me look for patterns in the sample input.\n        # In the first example, n=1, k=42, f=2. The answer is 3.\n        # The possible c_0 and c_1 values must be chosen such that the maximum beautiful multiset size is exactly 2.\n        # For n=1, the multiset consists of strings of length 1. Each string is either '0' or '1'.\n        # The maximum size is the minimum between c_0 and c_1, because each string contributes to its own prefix (the string itself).\n        # So the maximum size is min(c_0, c_1). To make this equal to f=2, we need min(c_0, c_1) = 2, and c_0 and c_1 are between 0 and k=42.\n        # The number of ways is the number of pairs (a, b) where min(a,b)=2, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 42.\n        # Which is (number of pairs where a >= 2, b >=2, and at least one is exactly 2).\n        # But this seems more complex. However, for the first sample, the answer is 3, which corresponds to (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the min is 2 in each case.\n        \n        # So for general n, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum of (c_s) for all s of length 1, and also for longer prefixes? No, because longer prefixes may impose stricter limits.\n        \n        # Another idea: the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal value of c_s for all prefixes s of length l, where l ranges from 1 to n. But this is not necessarily true. For example, a prefix of length 2 may have c_s = 1, but the prefix of length 1 may have c_s = 2. Then, the maximum number of leaves is 1, since each leaf that starts with the length-2 prefix would contribute to the length-1 prefix as well.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal value of c_s for all prefixes s of length l, where l ranges from 1 to n. However, this is not precise. It depends on the structure of the trie and how the capacities propagate.\n        \n        # Given the complexity, perhaps we need to model the problem using dynamic programming on the trie structure. Each node has a capacity, and the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimum capacity along the path from the root to the leaf. But since the root here isn't considered, perhaps the approach is different.\n        \n        # Let me think recursively. For each node (prefix of length l), the number of leaves that can be in its subtree is bounded by c_s. But each leaf in the subtree of this node is also in the subtree of its parent, grandparent, etc. So the actual constraint is that for every node, the number of leaves in its subtree cannot exceed c_s.\n        \n        # This seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves in a trie with capacity constraints. The maximum number of leaves is the sum over all leaves of 1, but subject to the constraints that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n        \n        # The maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s * 2^{n - l}), where l is the length of the node's prefix. Wait, this might be the case. For example, if a node has length l, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n-l} if there are no constraints. If the capacity c_s is less than this, then the maximum number of leaves in this subtree is c_s. Otherwise, it's 2^{n-l}. But the actual maximum number of leaves in the entire trie is the minimum of these values across all nodes.\n        \n        # For example, consider a node with l=1 and c_s=2. Then, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 2*2^{n-1} = 2^n. But this is not possible because the total number of possible leaves is 2^n. However, this suggests that the minimum of these values over all nodes gives the maximum number of leaves.\n        \n        # Wait, this seems incorrect. Let's take an example where n=2. Suppose c_0 = 1, c_00 = 1, c_01 = 1, c_1 = 1, c_10 = 1, c_11 = 1. Then, the maximum number of leaves is 1 (since for the root-like node of length 1, c_0 and c_1 are 1, and each can contribute 1*2^1 = 2, but the actual constraint is that the number of leaves in each subtree is <= c_s. But since the root-like nodes are of length 1, their subtree has 2 leaves. But c_s is 1, so the maximum number of leaves is 1.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s) * 2^{n - l}, where l is the length of the node. This is because each node of length l can have at most c_s leaves in its subtree, which is 2^{n-l} leaves if c_s >= 2^{n-l}. Otherwise, it's c_s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum of (c_s) * 2^{n-l} for all nodes s of length l (1 ≤ l ≤ n). And this must be exactly f.\n        \n        # Now, the task reduces to counting the number of ways to choose c_s for all nodes s (of lengths 1 to n) such that:\n        # 1. For each node s, 0 ≤ c_s ≤ k.\n        # 2. The minimum of (c_s * 2^{n-l}) over all nodes s is exactly f.\n        \n        # To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion. First, compute the number of configurations where the minimum is ≥ f, then subtract those where the minimum is ≥ f+1. The difference will be the number of configurations where the minimum is exactly f.\n        \n        # So, the answer is: (number of ways where min ≥ f) - (number of ways where min ≥ f+1).\n        \n        # Now, how to compute the number of ways where the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n-l}) over all nodes is ≥ x.\n        \n        # For a given x, we need to ensure that for every node s of length l, c_s * 2^{n-l} ≥ x. Which means c_s ≥ ceil(x / 2^{n-l}).\n        \n        # However, since c_s is an integer between 0 and k, we need to find for each node s, the lower bound on c_s as L_s = max(ceil(x / 2^{n-l}), 0). But since x can be up to 2^n * k, and for each node, we need to choose c_s ≥ L_s, and ≤k.\n        \n        # But the problem is that for all nodes s, the value of c_s must be ≥ ceil(x / 2^{n-l}).

If this m_s exceeds k, then there are 0 ways.\n        \n        # Therefore, for a given x, the number of valid configurations is the product over all nodes s of (k - m_s + 1), provided that m_s ≤ k for all s.

No, wait: for l=1, there are 2 nodes: '0' and '1'. So the number of nodes of length l is 2^{l} ? No. Wait, for each length l, the number of binary strings of length l is 2^l. But the prefixes of length l are all binary strings of length l. So for each l, there are 2^l nodes of length l. Wait, no. For l=1, there are 2 nodes: '0', '1'. For l=2, there are 4 nodes: '00', '01', '10', '11'. So for length l, there are 2^l nodes.\n        \n        # Thus, for each l in 1..n, there are 2^l nodes. For each of these nodes, the required minimum c_s is ceil(x / (2^{n-l})).

The function `compute_count(x)` calculates the number of valid configurations where the minimum value is at least `x`.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: All operations are performed modulo 998244353 to handle large numbers efficiently.\n5. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: The result for each test case is derived by subtracting the count of configurations where the minimum value is at least `f+1` from the count where it is at least `f`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the valid configurations while adhering to the constraints and modular arithmetic requirements.",

Otherwise, it's 2^{n - l}.\n        # So the overall maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 1) if we can choose the leaves such that all constraints are satisfied.\n        # Wait, no. Because each leaf contributes to multiple prefixes. So the maximum number of leaves is constrained by the minimum over all nodes of (c_s * 1) multiplied by some factor?\n        \n        # Another approach: the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s) multiplied by the number of leaves in their subtrees. But this seems unclear.\n        \n        # Instead, consider that for the entire trie, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s) * 1, but adjusted for overlapping constraints.\n        # However, this might not be accurate. Let's think recursively.\n        \n        # For the root (empty string?), but in our case, the prefixes are from length 1 to n. So maybe we should model the problem as follows:\n        # Each node of depth l (length l) has a capacity c. The number of leaves that can be under this node is min(c, ...). But the exact relation is complex.\n        \n        # A better approach is inspired by the following observation: the maximum number of leaves is the minimum of (c_s) over all nodes s, where s is a prefix of some leaf. But this is not correct either.\n        \n        # Let me look for patterns in the sample input.\n        # In the first example, n=1, k=42, f=2. The answer is 3.\n        # The possible c_0 and c_1 values must be chosen such that the maximum beautiful multiset size is exactly 2.\n        # For n=1, the multiset consists of strings of length 1. Each string is either '0' or '1'.\n        # The maximum size is the minimum between c_0 and c_1, because each string contributes to its own prefix (the string itself).\n        # So the maximum size is min(c_0, c_1). To make this equal to f=2, we need min(c_0, c_1) = 2, and c_0 and c_1 are between 0 and k=42.\n        # The number of ways is the number of pairs (a, b) where min(a,b)=2, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 42.\n        # Which is (number of pairs where a >= 2, b >=2, and at least one is exactly 2).\n        # But this seems more complex. However, for the first sample, the answer is 3, which corresponds to (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the min is 2 in each case.\n        \n        # So for general n, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum of (c_s) for all s of length 1, and also for longer prefixes? No, because longer prefixes may impose stricter limits.\n        \n        # Another idea: the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal value of c_s for all prefixes s of length l, where l ranges from 1 to n. But this is not necessarily true. For example, a prefix of length 2 may have c_s = 1, but the prefix of length 1 may have c_s = 2. Then, the maximum number of leaves is 1, since each leaf that starts with the length-2 prefix would contribute to the length-1 prefix as well.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimal value of c_s for all prefixes s of length l, where l ranges from 1 to n. However, this is not precise. It depends on the structure of the trie and how the capacities propagate.\n        \n        # Given the complexity, perhaps we need to model the problem using dynamic programming on the trie structure. Each node has a capacity, and the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimum capacity along the path from the root to the leaf. But since the root here isn't considered, perhaps the approach is different.\n        \n        # Let me think recursively. For each node (prefix of length l), the number of leaves that can be in its subtree is bounded by c_s. But each leaf in the subtree of this node is also in the subtree of its parent, grandparent, etc. So the actual constraint is that for every node, the number of leaves in its subtree cannot exceed c_s.\n        \n        # This seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves in a trie with capacity constraints. The maximum number of leaves is the sum over all leaves of 1, but subject to the constraints that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n        \n        # The maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s * 2^{n - l}), where l is the length of the node's prefix. Wait, this might be the case. For example, if a node has length l, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n-l} if there are no constraints. If the capacity c_s is less than this, then the maximum number of leaves in this subtree is c_s. Otherwise, it's 2^{n-l}. But the actual maximum number of leaves in the entire trie is the minimum of these values across all nodes.\n        \n        # For example, consider a node with l=1 and c_s=2. Then, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 2*2^{n-1} = 2^n. But this is not possible because the total number of possible leaves is 2^n. However, this suggests that the minimum of these values over all nodes gives the maximum number of leaves.\n        \n        # Wait, this seems incorrect. Let's take an example where n=2. Suppose c_0 = 1, c_00 = 1, c_01 = 1, c_1 = 1, c_10 = 1, c_11 = 1. Then, the maximum number of leaves is 1 (since for the root-like node of length 1, c_0 and c_1 are 1, and each can contribute 1*2^1 = 2, but the actual constraint is that the number of leaves in each subtree is <= c_s. But since the root-like nodes are of length 1, their subtree has 2 leaves. But c_s is 1, so the maximum number of leaves is 1.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s) * 2^{n - l}, where l is the length of the node. This is because each node of length l can have at most c_s leaves in its subtree, which is 2^{n-l} leaves if c_s >= 2^{n-l}. Otherwise, it's c_s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum of (c_s) * 2^{n-l} for all nodes s of length l (1 ≤ l ≤ n). And this must be exactly f.\n        \n        # Now, the task reduces to counting the number of ways to choose c_s for all nodes s (of lengths 1 to n) such that:\n        # 1. For each node s, 0 ≤ c_s ≤ k.\n        # 2. The minimum of (c_s * 2^{n-l}) over all nodes s is exactly f.\n        \n        # To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion. First, compute the number of configurations where the minimum is ≥ f, then subtract those where the minimum is ≥ f+1. The difference will be the number of configurations where the minimum is exactly f.\n        \n        # So, the answer is: (number of ways where min ≥ f) - (number of ways where min ≥ f+1).\n        \n        # Now, how to compute the number of ways where the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n-l}) over all nodes is ≥ x.\n        \n        # For a given x, we need to ensure that for every node s of length l, c_s * 2^{n-l} ≥ x. Which means c_s ≥ ceil(x / 2^{n-l}).\n        \n        # However, since c_s is an integer between 0 and k, we need to find for each node s, the lower bound on c_s as L_s = max(ceil(x / 2^{n-l}), 0). But since x can be up to 2^n * k, and for each node, we need to choose c_s ≥ L_s, and ≤k.\n        \n        # But the problem is that for all nodes s, the value of c_s must be ≥ ceil(x / 2^{n-l}). Let's denote for each node s of length l, the required minimum c_s is m_s = max(ceil(x / (2^{n-l})), 0). If this m_s exceeds k, then there are 0 ways.\n        \n        # Therefore, for a given x, the number of valid configurations is the product over all nodes s of (k - m_s + 1), provided that m_s ≤ k for all s. Otherwise, it's 0.\n        \n        # Now, for each node s of length l, the term 2^{n-l} is 2^{n-l} = 2^{d}, where d = n - l. For example, for l = n, d = 0, so 2^0 = 1. For l = 1, d = n-1, so 2^{n-1}.\n        \n        # The number of nodes of length l is 2^{l-1}. For example, for l=1, there are 2^0 = 1 node (either '0' or '1'? No, wait: for l=1, there are 2 nodes: '0' and '1'. So the number of nodes of length l is 2^{l} ? No. Wait, for each length l, the number of binary strings of length l is 2^l. But the prefixes of length l are all binary strings of length l. So for each l, there are 2^l nodes of length l. Wait, no. For l=1, there are 2 nodes: '0', '1'. For l=2, there are 4 nodes: '00', '01', '10', '11'. So for length l, there are 2^l nodes.\n        \n        # Thus, for each l in 1..n, there are 2^l nodes. For each of these nodes, the required minimum c_s is ceil(x / (2^{n-l})). So, for each l, we can compute the required minimum m_l = ceil(x / 2^{n-l}).\n        \n        # For example, if x = f, and we want to compute the number of ways where all nodes have c_s ≥ m_l, where m_l = ceil(x / 2^{n-l}).\n        \n        # However, we need to ensure that for each node of length l, the value m_l is such that m_l ≤ k. Otherwise, the count is zero.\n        \n        # Therefore, for a given x, the number of valid configurations is:\n        # product_{l=1 to n} [ (number of choices for each node of length l) ]^{number of nodes of length l}\n        # where the number of choices for each node of length l is (k - m_l + 1) if m_l ≤ k, else 0.\n        \n        # Now, the problem becomes: compute for x = f and x = f+1, the above product, and subtract them.\n        \n        # So, the steps are:\n        # 1.
