For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem seems quite complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to calculate the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, we need to count all possible choices of c_s values that make this maximum exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. The key is to find for each possible choice of c_s's, what is the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. Then, count those choices where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum? Let's think of it as a problem of constraints. Each c_s imposes a limit on the number of times a string with prefix s can appear in the multiset. But since the multiset contains only strings of length n, each string in the multiset contributes to multiple prefixes. For example, a string of length n has all its prefixes (from length 1 up to n) as prefixes.\n\nThe maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints. It's similar to a flow problem or some kind of constraint satisfaction. However, since we are looking for the maximum possible size, perhaps it's equivalent to finding the minimum over certain constraints.\n\nWait, think of it as a tree structure. Each binary string of length l can be considered as a node in a trie. The root is the empty string (but maybe not relevant here). Each node has two children: appending a 0 or 1. The constraints are on the nodes. For a node s (a binary string), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s.\n\nBut the multiset consists of exactly n-length strings. So, for each such string, all its prefixes (from length 1 to n) are counted towards their respective c_s's. The problem is to select a set of n-length strings such that for every s, the count of strings in the set that have s as a prefix is <= c_s. The maximum size of such a set is the maximum possible under the given c_s constraints.\n\nNow, the question is, given all possible c_s choices (each c_s between 0 and k), how many of them have the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset equal to exactly f?\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each possible assignment of c_s's (each c_s can be from 0 to k), compute the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset. Then count how many such assignments have this maximum equal to f.\n\nBut since n can be up to 15, the number of binary strings from length 1 to n is sum_{l=1}^n 2^l = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16-2= 65534. So, considering all possible assignments of c_s's is impossible because even for n=15, each of the 65534 variables can take up to k+1 values. So brute force is out of the question.\n\nTherefore, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the maximum size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s's. How can we compute that?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of n-length strings that can be selected without violating the constraints. But how?\n\nLet me think of it as a flow problem. But perhaps there's a way to model this as a tree and use dynamic programming or some greedy approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of the constraints as a hierarchy. For example, the number of strings in the multiset that start with a particular prefix s can't exceed c_s. However, the count of strings starting with a longer prefix (like s followed by a bit) must be <= the count of the shorter prefix. Because if a string starts with s followed by a bit, then it also starts with s. Therefore, the constraints must satisfy that for any s, the sum of the counts of its children (s0 and s1) is <= c_s. Wait, no. Because for a given s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. But each such string contributes to all its prefixes. However, for the maximum possible multiset,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for `c_s` such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of binary strings of length exactly `n` is exactly `f`. The constraints involve ensuring that for every binary string `s` of length from 1 to `n`, the number of strings in the multiset with `s` as a prefix does not exceed `c_s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: Consider all binary strings of lengths from 1 to `n` as nodes in a trie (tree structure). Each node represents a binary string and has children representing extensions by '0' or '1'.\n2. **Constraints Hierarchy**: For each node (binary string), the count of strings in the multiset that have it as a prefix must be less than or equal to `c_s`. This implies that constraints on longer prefixes are more restrictive.\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use DP to compute the number of valid configurations for `c_s` values that allow the maximum multiset size to be exactly `f`. The DP state will track the number of valid configurations up to a certain depth in the trie.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, use modulo `998244353` for all calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    cases = []\n    for i in range(0, len(data), 3):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        k = int(data[i+1])\n        f = int(data[i+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, k, f in cases:\n        if f > (1 << n):\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Precompute the number of nodes at each level\n        total_nodes = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for l in range(1, n + 1):\n            total_nodes[l] = (1 << l)\n        \n        # We need to compute for each node, the constraints\n        # The idea is to model the problem as a tree where each node's capacity\n        # must be at least the sum of capacities of its children.\n        # But since we need the maximum possible size of the multiset to be exactly f,\n        # we can think in terms of the minimum of the capacities along the paths.\n        \n        # Let's think recursively. The maximum size of the multiset is determined by the minimum\n        # over all nodes of the sum of capacities of their children. Wait, perhaps not.\n        # Another approach: For a given set of c_s values, the maximum size of the multiset is\n        # the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix).\n        # Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, think of the problem as a flow network where each node's capacity\n        # limits the flow through it. The maximum flow would be the maximum number of strings in the multiset.\n        # However, this seems complex.\n        \n        # A better way: The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # Wait, for example, consider the root node (length 1). The maximum number of strings that can be chosen is min(c_0, c_1) * 2^{n-1}? No, that doesn't seem right.\n        # Let me think again. For any node s of length l, the number of strings of length n that have s as a prefix is exactly 2^{n - l}.\n        # Therefore, the constraint for node s is that the number of such strings in the multiset is <= c_s.\n        # So the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # Wait, but this is not correct. Because the same string contributes to multiple nodes. For example, a string of length n contributes to all its prefixes. Thus, the constraints are interdependent.\n        \n        # However, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the minimum value of c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)} across all nodes s. But this is only true if the c_s values form a hierarchy where each node's c_s is at least the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, this is similar to the problem of finding the minimum capacity in a tree where each node's capacity must be at least the sum of its children's capacities.\n        \n        # Let me think about the following: For the maximum multiset size to be f, we need that for all nodes s, c_s >= floor(f / 2^{n - len(s)}), and there exists at least one node s where c_s = floor(f / 2^{n - len(s)}). But this might not be accurate.\n        \n        # Alternatively, the maximum number of strings that can be selected is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}). Because for each node s, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is at most c_s, and each such string contributes to exactly 2^{n - len(s)} different nodes (the ones that are prefixes of s). Wait, no, each string of length n contributes to exactly one node at each level (its prefixes). So the total number of strings is constrained by the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} over all s.\n        \n        # Wait, let's take an example. Suppose n=2, and for all nodes, c_s is 1. Then the maximum number of strings is 1 (since for the root nodes (length 1), c_0 and c_1 are 1, so they can allow 1*2^(2-1) = 2 strings. But for the leaves (length 2), c_00, c_01, c_10, c_11 are 1, so each allows 1*2^0 = 1. So the maximum is min(2, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 1. So the answer is 1. Which makes sense because you can only pick one string of length 2.\n        \n        # So the formula seems to be that the maximum size of the multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}). Therefore, to have the maximum size exactly f, we need that for all nodes s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, and there exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f.\n        \n        # But wait, how does this work? Let's see. For each node s, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. Since each string of length n has exactly one string of length n, which contributes to all its prefixes. So the total number of strings in the multiset can't exceed c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} for any node s. Therefore, the maximum possible size is the minimum of these values over all nodes s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s values such that:\n        # 1. For every node s, c_s >= ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)}) (since c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f => c_s >= ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)}))\n        # 2. There exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f.\n        # Also, since each c_s can be at most k, we must have that ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)}) <= k for all s.\n        \n        # So first, check if there's any node s where ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)}) > k. If yes, then the answer is 0.\n        \n        # Now, for each node s, compute the minimum required value m_s = ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)}). If any m_s > k, then no solution.\n        \n        # Then, the number of valid assignments is the product over all nodes of (k - m_s + 1) minus the product over all nodes of (k - m'_s + 1), where m'_s is ceil((f) / 2^{n - len(s)}) but with the condition that for all nodes, c_s >= m'_s and there is no node where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f.\n        \n        # Wait, no. The inclusion-exclusion approach here would be to calculate the number of assignments where for all nodes s, c_s >= m_s (where m_s is ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)})), and subtract those assignments where for all nodes s, c_s >= m'_s where m'_s is ceil((f+1)/2^{n - len(s)}). Because the former ensures that the minimum is at least f, and the latter ensures that the minimum is at least f+1. Therefore, the difference would be the number of assignments where the minimum is exactly f.\n        \n        # However, this requires that for all nodes s, m_s <= k. Otherwise, the answer is 0.\n        \n        # Let's formalize this:\n        # Let for each node s, define low_s = ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)}))\n        # and high_s = ceil((f + 1) / (2^{n - len(s)}))\n        \n        # The number of valid assignments where the minimum is exactly f is equal to:\n        # total_with_at_least_f = product_{s} (k - low_s + 1) if low_s <=k else 0\n        # total_with_at_least_f_plus_1 = product_{s} (k - high_s + 1) if high_s <=k else 0\n        # answer = total_with_at_least_f - total_with_at_least_f_plus_1\n        \n        # But we also need to ensure that for some node s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f. Which is equivalent to c_s = f / 2^{n - len(s)}. Since f is an integer, and 2^{n - len(s)} divides f, which may not be the case. Wait, this complicates things. Because even if all c_s >= low_s, the minimum could be higher than f. So the previous approach may not be accurate.\n        \n        # Wait, the initial assumption that the maximum multiset size is the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} over all s is incorrect. Because even if for all s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, the actual maximum size could be larger than f if the constraints are not tight. However, the maximum possible size is exactly the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} over all s. So to get the maximum size exactly f, we need that this minimum is exactly f. Which means that for all nodes s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, and there exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} = f.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem becomes:\n        # Count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that:\n        # 1. For all s, c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)}))\n        # 2. There exists at least one s where c_s = ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)})) and 2^{n - len(s)} divides f. Wait, no. For a node s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} = f implies that f must be divisible by 2^{n - len(s)}, and c_s = f / 2^{n - len(s)}.\n        \n        # So, for each node s, let’s define d_s = n - len(s). Then for s to be such that c_s * 2^d_s = f, we need that 2^d_s divides f. Let’s denote that for each node s, d_s = n - len(s), and check if f mod 2^d_s == 0. If not, then this node cannot contribute to the existence of a node with c_s * 2^d_s = f.\n        \n        # Therefore, the steps are:\n        # 1. For all nodes s, compute m_s = ceil(f / 2^{d_s}), where d_s = n - len(s).\n        # 2. Check if any m_s exceeds k. If so, answer is 0.\n        # 3. Compute the total number of assignments where for all s, c_s >= m_s. This is the number of assignments where the minimum is at least f.\n        # 4. Compute the number of assignments where for all s, c_s >= m_s' where m_s' = ceil( (f + 1) / 2^{d_s} ). This is the number of assignments where the minimum is at least f+1.\n        # 5. The answer is total_1 - total_2.\n        \n        # However, this approach assumes that the minimum of c_s * 2^d_s is exactly f. But this is not necessarily the case. For example, if all c_s * 2^d_s are >= f, and at least one is exactly f, then the minimum is f. Otherwise, if all are strictly greater than f, then the minimum is > f. So the difference between total_1 and total_2 gives the number of assignments where the minimum is exactly f.\n        \n        # So the key is to compute the number of assignments where the minimum of c_s * 2^{d_s} is exactly f. Which is equal to the number of assignments where all c_s * 2^{d_s} >= f, and at least one c_s * 2^{d_s} == f.\n        \n        # To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion. The number of assignments where all c_s * 2^{d_s} >= f is total_1. The number of assignments where all c_s * 2^{d_s} >= f+1 is total_2. Then the difference is the number of assignments where the minimum is exactly f.\n        \n        # However, we need to make sure that for some node s, c_s * 2^{d_s} == f. Which is ensured by the difference between total_1 and total_2, provided that for all s, f is achievable (i.e., 2^{d_s} divides f for some s). But how?\n        \n        # Wait, no. The difference total_1 - total_2 counts all assignments where the minimum is exactly f. This includes cases where some s has c_s * 2^{d_s} = f, and others have higher. So the inclusion-exclusion approach is correct.\n        \n        # So, the plan is:\n        # - For each node s, compute d_s = n - len(s)\n        # - Compute m_s = ceil(f / (2^{d_s}))\n        # - If any m_s > k, answer is 0\n        # - Compute total_1 = product over all nodes of (k - m_s + 1) if m_s <= k else 0\n        # - Compute m'_s = ceil( (f + 1) / (2^{d_s}) )\n        # - Compute total_2 similarly\n        # - The answer is (total_1 - total_2) mod MOD\n        \n        # Now, implement this logic.\n        \n        # First, precompute all d_s for all nodes.

The constraints on the number of strings in the multiset that can have a given string as a prefix are derived from the depths of these nodes.\n2. **Dynamic Programming and Modular Arithmetic**: The solution uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations efficiently, leveraging modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.\n3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: The number of valid configurations is calculated by considering the difference between configurations that allow a minimum value of `f` and those that allow a minimum value of `f+1`, ensuring the exact count of valid configurations is derived.",

The maximum size of the multiset is determined by the minimum\n        # over all nodes of the sum of capacities of their children. Wait, perhaps not.\n        # Another approach: For a given set of c_s values, the maximum size of the multiset is\n        # the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix).\n        # Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, think of the problem as a flow network where each node's capacity\n        # limits the flow through it. The maximum flow would be the maximum number of strings in the multiset.\n        # However, this seems complex.\n        \n        # A better way: The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # Wait, for example, consider the root node (length 1). The maximum number of strings that can be chosen is min(c_0, c_1) * 2^{n-1}? No, that doesn't seem right.\n        # Let me think again. For any node s of length l, the number of strings of length n that have s as a prefix is exactly 2^{n - l}.\n        # Therefore, the constraint for node s is that the number of such strings in the multiset is <= c_s.\n        # So the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        # Wait, but this is not correct. Because the same string contributes to multiple nodes. For example, a string of length n contributes to all its prefixes. Thus, the constraints are interdependent.\n        \n        # However, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the minimum value of c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)} across all nodes s. But this is only true if the c_s values form a hierarchy where each node's c_s is at least the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, this is similar to the problem of finding the minimum capacity in a tree where each node's capacity must be at least the sum of its children's capacities.\n        \n        # Let me think about the following: For the maximum multiset size to be f, we need that for all nodes s, c_s >= floor(f / 2^{n - len(s)}), and there exists at least one node s where c_s = floor(f / 2^{n - len(s)}). But this might not be accurate.\n        \n        # Alternatively, the maximum number of strings that can be selected is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}). Because for each node s, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is at most c_s, and each such string contributes to exactly 2^{n - len(s)} different nodes (the ones that are prefixes of s). Wait, no, each string of length n contributes to exactly one node at each level (its prefixes). So the total number of strings is constrained by the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} over all s.\n        \n        # Wait, let's take an example. Suppose n=2, and for all nodes, c_s is 1. Then the maximum number of strings is 1 (since for the root nodes (length 1), c_0 and c_1 are 1, so they can allow 1*2^(2-1) = 2 strings. But for the leaves (length 2), c_00, c_01, c_10, c_11 are 1, so each allows 1*2^0 = 1. So the maximum is min(2, 1, 1, 1, 1) = 1. So the answer is 1. Which makes sense because you can only pick one string of length 2.\n        \n        # So the formula seems to be that the maximum size of the multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}). Therefore, to have the maximum size exactly f, we need that for all nodes s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, and there exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f.\n        \n        # But wait, how does this work? Let's see. For each node s, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. Since each string of length n has exactly one string of length n, which contributes to all its prefixes. So the total number of strings in the multiset can't exceed c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} for any node s. Therefore, the maximum possible size is the minimum of these values over all nodes s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s values such that:\n        # 1. For every node s, c_s >= ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)}) (since c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f => c_s >= ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)}))\n        # 2. There exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f.\n        # Also, since each c_s can be at most k, we must have that ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)}) <= k for all s.\n        \n        # So first, check if there's any node s where ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)}) > k. If yes, then the answer is 0.\n        \n        # Now, for each node s, compute the minimum required value m_s = ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)}). If any m_s > k, then no solution.\n        \n        # Then, the number of valid assignments is the product over all nodes of (k - m_s + 1) minus the product over all nodes of (k - m'_s + 1), where m'_s is ceil((f) / 2^{n - len(s)}) but with the condition that for all nodes, c_s >= m'_s and there is no node where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f.\n        \n        # Wait, no. The inclusion-exclusion approach here would be to calculate the number of assignments where for all nodes s, c_s >= m_s (where m_s is ceil(f / 2^{n - len(s)})), and subtract those assignments where for all nodes s, c_s >= m'_s where m'_s is ceil((f+1)/2^{n - len(s)}). Because the former ensures that the minimum is at least f, and the latter ensures that the minimum is at least f+1. Therefore, the difference would be the number of assignments where the minimum is exactly f.\n        \n        # However, this requires that for all nodes s, m_s <= k. Otherwise, the answer is 0.\n        \n        # Let's formalize this:\n        # Let for each node s, define low_s = ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)}))\n        # and high_s = ceil((f + 1) / (2^{n - len(s)}))\n        \n        # The number of valid assignments where the minimum is exactly f is equal to:\n        # total_with_at_least_f = product_{s} (k - low_s + 1) if low_s <=k else 0\n        # total_with_at_least_f_plus_1 = product_{s} (k - high_s + 1) if high_s <=k else 0\n        # answer = total_with_at_least_f - total_with_at_least_f_plus_1\n        \n        # But we also need to ensure that for some node s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} == f. Which is equivalent to c_s = f / 2^{n - len(s)}. Since f is an integer, and 2^{n - len(s)} divides f, which may not be the case. Wait, this complicates things. Because even if all c_s >= low_s, the minimum could be higher than f. So the previous approach may not be accurate.\n        \n        # Wait, the initial assumption that the maximum multiset size is the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} over all s is incorrect. Because even if for all s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, the actual maximum size could be larger than f if the constraints are not tight. However, the maximum possible size is exactly the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} over all s. So to get the maximum size exactly f, we need that this minimum is exactly f. Which means that for all nodes s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= f, and there exists at least one node s where c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} = f.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem becomes:\n        # Count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that:\n        # 1. For all s, c_s >= ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)}))\n        # 2. There exists at least one s where c_s = ceil(f / (2^{n - len(s)})) and 2^{n - len(s)} divides f. Wait, no. For a node s, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} = f implies that f must be divisible by 2^{n - len(s)}, and c_s = f / 2^{n - len(s)}.\n        \n        # So, for each node s, let’s define d_s = n - len(s). Then for s to be such that c_s * 2^d_s = f, we need that 2^d_s divides f. Let’s denote that for each node s, d_s = n - len(s), and check if f mod 2^d_s == 0. If not, then this node cannot contribute to the existence of a node with c_s * 2^d_s = f.\n        \n        # Therefore, the steps are:\n        # 1. For all nodes s, compute m_s = ceil(f / 2^{d_s}), where d_s = n - len(s).\n        # 2. Check if any m_s exceeds k. If so, answer is 0.\n        # 3. Compute the total number of assignments where for all s, c_s >= m_s. This is the number of assignments where the minimum is at least f.\n        # 4. Compute the number of assignments where for all s, c_s >= m_s' where m_s' = ceil( (f + 1) / 2^{d_s} ). This is the number of assignments where the minimum is at least f+1.\n        # 5. The answer is total_1 - total_2.\n        \n        # However, this approach assumes that the minimum of c_s * 2^d_s is exactly f. But this is not necessarily the case. For example, if all c_s * 2^d_s are >= f, and at least one is exactly f, then the minimum is f. Otherwise, if all are strictly greater than f, then the minimum is > f. So the difference between total_1 and total_2 gives the number of assignments where the minimum is exactly f.\n        \n        # So the key is to compute the number of assignments where the minimum of c_s * 2^{d_s} is exactly f. Which is equal to the number of assignments where all c_s * 2^{d_s} >= f, and at least one c_s * 2^{d_s} == f.\n        \n        # To compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion. The number of assignments where all c_s * 2^{d_s} >= f is total_1. The number of assignments where all c_s * 2^{d_s} >= f+1 is total_2. Then the difference is the number of assignments where the minimum is exactly f.\n        \n        # However, we need to make sure that for some node s, c_s * 2^{d_s} == f.

The difference total_1 - total_2 counts all assignments where the minimum is exactly f. This includes cases where some s has c_s * 2^{d_s} = f, and others have higher.
