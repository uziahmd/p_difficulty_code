He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, which might be Roman.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the next line is the number c in base a.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b. If b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string, using letters for digits above 9 (like A for 10, etc.).\n\nSo the main parts are:\n\n- Parsing the input correctly.\n- Converting c from base a to decimal.\n- Converting decimal to base b or Roman.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, if a is 10 and c is '001', it's 1 in decimal.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion? Well, for each character in the string, we can process it as a digit in base a. For example, if the string is 'A' in base 12, then it's 10 in decimal. So, for each character in the input string, we need to get its value. For digits 0-9, it's straightforward. For letters A-Z (uppercase?), they represent 10 and above. Wait, the problem says that in bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So the input c may contain letters, but only if a is greater than 10. Wait, no. Wait, the input c is given in base a. So, for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase). But the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. So the input c may have letters if a is larger than 10.\n\nBut how to parse that? For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (10), B (11). So when converting the input string to decimal, each character must be converted to its corresponding value.\n\nSo first, I need to process the input string c into a decimal number. Let's think about writing a helper function for that.\n\nFor example, for the input 'A' in base 12, the value is 10. For '1A' in base 16, it's 1*16 + 10 = 26.\n\nSo the code for converting the input string to decimal would be:\n\nInitialize a variable, num = 0.\n\nFor each char in the string:\n\ndigit_value = int(char) if it's a digit, else ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input c may contain letters, but only if a is large enough. For example, if a is 10, then the input c can't have letters. But the problem says that the input is valid. So we don't need to check for invalid characters. So, assuming that the input is correct.\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal is:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nBut wait, what if the input is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the number can be zero. However, the input says that c is a non-negative integer. So for example, if c is '0' in base a, then the decimal is 0.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, then I need to convert it to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nNow, the second part: converting from decimal to base b or Roman.\n\nFirst, handling the case when b is 'R'. So, the decimal number must be converted to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert to base b as a string, using letters for digits >=10.\n\nSo, for example, if the decimal number is 10, and base is 12, then it's 'A'.\n\nSo, for converting decimal to base b, we need to handle digits 0 to b-1. For digits less than 10, just use the digit as a string. For digits >=10, use letters A, B, etc.\n\nSo, for example, for base 13, the digits go up to 12, which is 'C'.\n\nSo the code for converting decimal to base b would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # rem is >=10, so convert to letter.\n            # For example, 10 is A, 11 is B, etc.\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    # digits are in reverse order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but what if the input is zero? For example, if the original number is zero, then the output should be '0' (but according to the problem statement, if Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So in that case, the code for converting to base b would need to handle zero. But the problem says that in the case of Roman, the number is not zero. So for other cases, when converting to base b, the input could be zero. So the code for decimal_to_base must handle n=0.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the input is not zero. So for example, if the input is 0, then the output is '0' (but in that case, the code would have to output '0' even if the base is R? No, but the problem says that if Roman is included, the number is not zero. So the code can assume that when the target is Roman, the number is non-zero. So the code for converting to Roman can assume that n is positive.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nFirst, convert c to decimal (n).\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert n to Roman.\n\nElse, convert n to base b as a string, with letters for digits >=10.\n\nBut what about leading zeros? The problem says to omit leading zeros. So for example, if the converted value is zero, output '0'. Otherwise, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nBut in the code for decimal_to_base, when n is zero, return '0'. Otherwise, the code processes digits in reverse order, but for example, if n is zero, the code returns '0'.\n\nNow, the Roman conversion.\n\nHow to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals?\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of tuples that map values to their Roman numeral equivalents, starting from the highest possible value down to the lowest.\n\nThe standard Roman numerals are:\n\nM 1000\nCM 900\nD 500\nCD 400\nC 100\nXC 90\nL 50\nXL 40\nX 10\nIX 9\nV 5\nIV 4\nI 1\n\nSo, for example, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize a list of (value, symbol) pairs, sorted in descending order.\n\nFor each pair, subtract as many times as possible from the number, appending the symbol each time.\n\nSo, for example, for 4, it would be IV.\n\nSo, the code for converting to Roman would be something like:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman conversion is guaranteed to be <= 3000 (decimal) and not zero. So this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nThe steps for the program:\n\nRead the input lines. Wait, the input is given as two lines. First line is a and b (with possible R), second line is c.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as first line with a and b, then the next line with c.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich converts 1 (base 10) to base 2, which is 1.\n\nAnother sample input is 16 R\\n5. So c is 5 in base 16. That's 5 in decimal, which is 'V' in Roman.\n\nSo the code needs to read two lines. The first line is split into a and b. But b can be 'R'.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read the first line as:\n\na_str, b_str = input().split()\n\nBut then, for example, if the first line is '5 R', then a is 5, b is 'R'.\n\nThen, the second line is the string c.\n\nOnce we have a, b, and c, the steps are:\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal (n).\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert n to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert n to base b as a string.\n\nBut how to handle the case when the converted number is zero? For example, if c is '0' in base a, then n is zero. Then, if b is not R, output '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So in that case, the code can safely assume that for Roman conversion, n is positive.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nRead c.\n\nConvert c to decimal (n).\n\nIf b is 'R':\n\n   convert n to roman, output.\n\nelse:\n\n   convert n to base b, as a string, with letters for digits >=10, omitting leading zeros.\n\nBut how to handle leading zeros in the output? For example, if the converted number is zero, output '0'. Else, the code for decimal_to_base returns the digits without leading zeros.\n\nBut in the code for decimal_to_base, when n is zero, returns '0'. Else, the code processes digits in reversed order, and the digits are generated correctly. For example, if n is 10, base 2: 1010. So the code returns that.\n\nSo, the code for decimal_to_base seems correct.\n\nNow, some edge cases to consider:\n\nCase 1: c is zero. For example, input is 10 2, and c is 0. Output is 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So for example, if the input is 10 R and c is 0, then the problem says it's not possible. So the code can assume that in such cases, the input is not zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base b, which is 2, and the number is zero. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 16, and the number is 10, output is 'A'.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing the functions:\n\nFirst, converting c to decimal.\n\nBut what about the case where c is empty? Well, the problem says that c is a non-negative integer, and the length doesn't exceed 10^3. So c can be '0' (which is allowed), but not empty.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is '2 10\\n0', the output is '0'.\n\nNow, the code for converting c to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\nBut wait, what if the input is '0'? Then the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nNow, the code for converting decimal to base b:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nBut for example, if n is 10 and base is 16, then rem is 10, which becomes 'A'. So the code returns 'A'.\n\nBut what about when n is zero? The code returns '0'.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nRead c.\n\nConvert c to decimal (n).\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert n to roman.\n\nElse, convert n to base b, using the decimal_to_base function.\n\nBut what about when the base is 1? Wait, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25, except that b can be R. So the input for a and b (if not R) is between 2 and 25. So no need to handle base 1.\n\nSo, code steps.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nIn Python, the first line is read as a and b. But the first line can have two elements. For example, the first line may be '16 R', so a is 16, b is 'R'.\n\nSo:\n\nimport sys\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nBut for example, in the sample input, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains a and b. The next line contains c.\n\nWait, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of inputs and outputs. For example, the first input is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', ...]\n\nBut in reality, the actual input for the program is one test case. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line is a and b. The second line is c. So for each test case, the program reads two lines. However, in the sample input, there are multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is showing multiple examples, but the actual program must read one test case per run.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nBut this suggests that the program is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, but that's not clear from the problem description. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the input is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of input cases. For example, each element of the input list is a separate test case. But in reality, the program should process a single test case. But perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. Or perhaps the problem expects the code to process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" So, in competitive programming problems, the input is usually read from stdin, and the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample input shows multiple lines. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nLooking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['10 2\\n1', ...], but perhaps that's a way to represent multiple test cases. For example, each test case is two lines. But the problem's actual input is two lines. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read two lines from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input and output in the problem show that for each input line (the first line and the second line), the output is a single line. So, for example, the first test case input is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nSo the code should read two lines from stdin. So the code should read the first line as a and b, then the second line as c.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code must process a single test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read two lines from stdin. So for the code, the code will read:\n\na_and_b = input().strip()\n\nc = input().strip()\n\nBut in Python, the input is read line by line. So the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line, split into a and b.\n\nRead the second line as c.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    a_str, b_str = input().split()\n    a = int(a_str)\n    c_str = input().strip()\n    \n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    n = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n    \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(n))\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n        result = decimal_to_base(n, b)\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the converted number is zero, the code returns '0', which is correct. For other numbers, the decimal_to_base function returns the correct digits without leading zeros. Because in the code, when n is not zero, the digits are generated in reverse order, but the loop processes n down to zero. So for example, if the number is 10 in base 2, the code would generate 1010, which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nConverts to decimal 1. Then base 2 is 1. Output is '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nConverts 5 in base 16 to decimal 5. Then Roman is 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nConverts 4 in base 5 to decimal 4. Roman is 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\nConverts 1111001 in base 2 to decimal. Let's compute that:\n\nThe binary is 1111001.\n\nWhich is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0.\n\nWhich is 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converting to base 2 again gives 1111001, which is the same as input. So output is '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA\n\nConverts 'A' in base 12 to decimal: 10. Then converting to base 13. 10 in base 13 is 'A', so output is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: input is 2 10, c is 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: input is 10 R, c is 3000. Output is MMM.\n\nWhat about leading zeros in c? For example, input a is 10, c is '001', which is 1. So converted to base 2 is 1.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal number is zero and the target base is not R. For example, input is 10 10, c is 0. Output is 0.\n\nNow, what about when converting to base higher than 10. For example, decimal is 15, base 12. Then 15 is 1*12 + 3 → '13' in base 12. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: decimal 10 in base 16 is 'A'.\n\nNow, what about when the input c is zero and the target is R? According to the problem statement, this case is not present. So the code can assume that when b is R, the number is non-zero.\n\nNow, what about when converting to base 1? Well, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, the input is a non-negative integer, so c is not empty. So no need to handle that.\n\n- What about uppercase vs lowercase letters in the input c? The problem says that the input may have letters, but in the note, it says that in bases greater than 10, letters are used. But the input is given as a string, which may have letters. For example, in base 12, 'A' is allowed. But the code uses ch.upper() to process them. So if the input is lowercase, like 'a', it would be converted to uppercase. So the code should handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: the to_decimal function. For example, if the input c is 'Z' in base 36. But the problem says that a is between 2 and 25. So the input c's letters are valid for the given base. For example, if a is 16, then the input can have letters up to F. But the code processes any letters, but the problem says that the input is valid.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when converting from base a=2, c is '0' (zero). Then converted to decimal is zero, and output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 25, and the decimal is 25. Then 25 in base 25 is 10 (since 1*25 + 0). So the code would return '10'.\n\nBut in the decimal_to_base function, the code for rem = 25 % 25 = 0. So the digit is 0. Then n becomes 1. Next iteration, rem is 1%25 = 1, so digits are [0, 1], reversed to '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: decimal is 25, base is 25. Output is '10'.\n\nAnother test case: decimal is 25, base is 10. Output is '25'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input Number to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a`. We convert this number to a decimal integer by processing each digit of the input string.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - If the target base is Roman numerals (`R`), convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a standard mapping of values to Roman symbols.\n   - If the target base is a numerical base (2-25), convert the decimal number to the specified base using a method that handles digits greater than 9 by using letters (A-Z).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    a_str, b_str = input_lines[0].split()\n    a = int(a_str)\n    c_str = input_lines[1]\n    \n    # Convert c from base a to decimal\n    n = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n    \n    if b_str == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(n))\n    else:\n        b = int(b_str)\n        result = decimal_to_base(n, b)\n        print(result)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, where `b` might be 'R' indicating Roman numerals. The second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input string `c`, converting it to its decimal equivalent by considering both digits and letters (for bases greater than 10).\n3. **Conversion to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - **Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` uses a list of tuples to map decimal values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols, repeatedly subtracting the largest possible value from the number until it reaches zero.\n   - **Numerical Base Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the target base, handling digits greater than 9 by converting them to letters (A-Z).\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution efficiently handles all edge cases, including leading zeros and different numeral systems, providing the correct output as required.",
