There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament with certain rules. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, I need to model how the tournament structure can be arranged to maximize the winner's games under this constraint.\n\nLet me think about examples. For example, when n=3, the output is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: first, maybe the winner plays against player 2, then against player 3. But wait, in the first game, the winner has 1 game, and then the next game, the opponent (player 3) has 0 games. Wait, but the difference is 1, which is allowed. Oh right, because the rule says that the difference can't be more than one. So that's allowed. So that's why for n=3, the answer is 2.\n\nBut for n=4, the answer is 2. Hmm. Because if you try to have the winner play three games, that would require three opponents. But each time, the opponents must have a game count differing by at most one. Let's think: the winner starts with 0 games. First game, plays against someone (say, player 2), so after that, the winner has 1 game. Then, the next game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. Suppose the winner plays against player 3. Then, the winner has 2 games. Now, the next opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But the remaining players are player 4. If the winner plays against player 4, then player 4 has 0 games. The difference is 2, which is not allowed. So that's why the maximum is 2. So the answer for n=4 is 2.\n\nSo, how to model this? It seems like the problem is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for the winner to play as many games as possible, each time they play, their opponents must have a certain number of games. Let me think recursively. Let's say that the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). How can we find f(n)?\n\nFor the winner to play k games, they must have k opponents. Each of those opponents must have been eliminated in a way that allows them to play against the winner. But perhaps the structure is such that each time the winner plays a game, the opponent is from a subtree where they have a certain number of games.\n\nAlternatively, think about the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games. Let's denote this as m(k). Then, for each game the winner plays, they need to have an opponent. For the first game, the opponent is someone who has played 0 games. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the winner's opponents are themselves in a structure that requires a certain number of players.\n\nThis feels similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example:\n\nTo have the winner play 1 game, you need 2 players. m(1) = 2.\n\nTo have the winner play 2 games, you need 3 players. Because the first game is between the winner and another player. Then the second game is between the winner and another player. But that's possible with 3 players. Wait, but in the case of n=3, the answer is 2. So m(2) = 3.\n\nFor the winner to play 3 games, what's the minimum number of players required?\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either the same number of games as the winner or one less. Let's think recursively. Let's suppose that the winner plays k games. For each game, the opponent must have played some number of games. Let's think that for the winner to play k games, the first game's opponent must have played 0 games. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the opponent for the second game has played 1 game. But how?\n\nThis seems like the structure of a Fibonacci tree. Let me think: For the winner to play k games, the number of players required is the sum of the players required for the previous steps. For example, to have the winner play k games, he must have beaten k opponents. Each of these opponents must have themselves played a certain number of games. For instance, the first opponent requires 1 player (the one he beats). The second opponent must have played one game, which requires that he had a certain number of players. So, maybe the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is equal to the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus something?\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Let's define f(k) as the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play k games. For the winner to play k games, he must have played against k opponents. Let's consider that each of those opponents must have played a certain number of games. For example, the first game, the opponent has 0 games. The second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. To maximize the number of games, the opponent for the second game must have played 1 game. But how can that opponent have played 1 game? That implies that that opponent had to play against someone else before. So, for the winner's second game, the opponent must have come from a subtree where he played 1 game. Which requires that the number of players in that subtree is f(1) + 1? Or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps the recurrence is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, for the winner to play k games, he must have played against an opponent who has played k-1 games (so that the difference is 1). But for that opponent to have played k-1 games, he must have had a subtree that required f(k-1) players. And the winner also has to have another opponent for his previous games. Or maybe it's the other way around.\n\nAlternatively, think about the structure. For the winner to play k games, the first game is against someone. Then, in order to get to the next game, the winner must have an opponent who has played either 0 or 1 games. But to maximize, perhaps the opponent has played 1 game. So, the winner's path is such that each time, the opponent has played one less game than the winner. So, for the winner to have played k games, the number of players needed is the sum of the players needed for the previous steps.\n\nLet me take an example. For k=1, the minimum players is 2. For k=2, the winner plays two games. The first game is against one player (needs 2 players). The second game is against another player who has played one game. To have that player, he must have played one game, which requires that he had a subtree with f(1) players. So total players is f(1) + f(0) ? Wait, but what is f(0)? Maybe f(0) is 1, since the winner has played zero games, but that's just himself. So for k=2, the total players is f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3. Which matches the example for n=3, which gives 2 games.\n\nFor k=3, it would be f(2)+f(1) = 3+2=5. So, for 5 players, the maximum number of games is 3. Let's check that. For example, if there are 5 players, the winner can play 3 games. How?\n\nLet me imagine the structure. The winner plays three games. Let's think about the opponents. The first game is against someone (say, player 2). Then, the second game must be against someone who has played 0 or 1 games. Suppose the second opponent is someone who has played 1 game. How did that happen? That opponent must have played against someone else. Let's say that opponent is player 3, who beat player 4. Then, the winner plays against player 3 (who has 1 game). Then, the third game, the opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. So, the opponent for the third game could be someone who has played 2 games. How is that possible? That person would have to have played two games, which would require that they had two wins. So, maybe the winner's third opponent is player 5, who has beaten someone else (player 6?), but wait, but in this case, there are only 5 players. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, let's think that the minimal number of players for k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Let me think:\n\nLet's define the Fibonacci sequence as F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc. But perhaps the minimal number of players for k games is F(k+2). For example:\n\nk=1: F(3)=2. Correct.\n\nk=2: F(4)=3. Correct.\n\nk=3: F(5)=5. So for 5 players, the answer is 3. Let's see. How can the winner play 3 games? Let's think:\n\nThe tournament structure would be such that the winner plays against players who each have a certain number of games. For example, the first game is against a player (A) who has 0 games. Then, the second game is against a player (B) who has 1 game. For B to have 1 game, he must have played against someone else (C). Then, the third game is against a player (D) who has 2 games. For D to have 2 games, he must have played two games. So, D must have beaten two players. So, the structure would be:\n\nWinner (W) beats A (game 1).\n\nThen, W beats B (game 2). B is the winner of a match between B and C (so B has 1 game).\n\nThen, W beats D (game 3). D is the winner of a match between D and E, and then another match between D and someone else. Wait, but how can D have 2 games? Let's think:\n\nD must have played two games before facing W. So, D's path would be: first, D beats E (game 1), then D beats F (game 2). But then, that would require 3 players (D, E, F). But in this case, the total players would be:\n\nFor W's first game: 1 player (A).\n\nFor B's subtree: 2 players (B and C).\n\nFor D's subtree: 3 players (D, E, F).\n\nSo total players is 1 (A) + 2 (B and C) + 3 (D, E, F) + W? Wait, no. The total players would be 1 (A) + 2 (B and C) + 3 (D, E, F) = 6 players. But according to the earlier formula, for k=3, the minimal players is 5. So maybe my reasoning is wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal players for k games is F(k+2). For k=3, F(5)=5. How can that be achieved?\n\nLet me think of the tournament structure. The winner has to play three games. Let's imagine that each of his opponents comes from a subtree that requires a certain number of players.\n\nFirst game: opponent comes from a subtree that requires F(1+2) = F(3) = 2 players. Wait, maybe the recurrence is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let's think of f(k) as the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, the last game is against an opponent who has played (k-1) games. Because the difference between the winner's current game count (k-1) and the opponent's (k-1) is zero. But how does that opponent get to have played (k-1) games? That requires that the opponent's subtree needs f(k-1) players. Also, the winner must have another path where he has played (k-1) games. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, when the winner plays his k-th game, he must have played (k-1) games before that. His opponent must have played (k-1) or (k-2) games. To maximize the number of games, the opponent must have played (k-1) games. But how can that opponent have played (k-1) games? That would require that the opponent was the winner of a subtree where he played (k-1) games. So, the number of players required for that is f(k-1). Additionally, the winner must have played (k-1) games, which requires that he has beaten (k-1) opponents. But how does that fit into the structure?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because:\n\nIn order for the winner to play k games, he must have played against someone who has played (k-1) games. To get that opponent, you need f(k-1) players. But also, the winner must have played (k-1) games before this final game. However, that's not quite right. Maybe the recurrence is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let's see:\n\nBase cases:\n\nf(0) = 1 (the winner hasn't played any games, so only himself)\n\nf(1) = 2 (two players, one game)\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3 → which matches the example where n=3 gives 2 games.\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. So, for n=5, the maximum games is 3.\n\nSimilarly, f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8. So for n=8, the answer is 4.\n\nSo, the idea is that the minimal number of players required to have the winner play k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number if we start with F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(3)=2, etc. Because:\n\nFor example, f(1) = 2 = F(3), f(2)=3=F(4), f(3)=5=F(5), f(4)=8=F(6). So, f(k) = F(k+2).\n\nSo the problem becomes: given n, find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤ n.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2 is n=3. The maximum k is 2, since F(2+2)=F(4)=3 ≤ 3. So output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. The maximum k where F(k+2) ≤4 is k=2, because F(4)=3 ≤4, F(5)=5>4. So output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 10: the output is 4. Let's check. F(6) is 8, F(7)=13. So for n=10, the maximum k is 4 since F(6)=8 ≤10, and F(7)=13>10. So output is 4. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes! So the problem reduces to finding the largest k such that F(k+2) ≤n, where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the point where F(m) exceeds 1e18.\n\n- For a given n, find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤n. The answer is k.\n\nBut how do we compute this for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nWe can generate the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed 1e18. Let's see:\n\nLet's list the Fibonacci numbers:\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nF(6) = 8\n\nF(7) = 13\n\nF(8) = 21\n\nF(9) = 34\n\nF(10) = 55\n\n...\n\nLet's see how many terms there are before reaching 1e18. Since Fibonacci grows exponentially, it's manageable. For example, the 90th Fibonacci number is around 2.8e18, so we can generate up to that.\n\nOnce we have the list of Fibonacci numbers, for a given n, we can perform a binary search to find the maximum m where F(m) <=n. Then, the answer is (m-2). Because for m = k+2, the answer is k.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nWe want the maximum k where F(k+2) <=n. So m = k+2. So k = m-2.\n\nFor example, for n=3, F(4) =3. m=4. k=4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nGenerate all F(m) up to 1e18.\n\nFor input n, find the largest m where F(m) <=n. Then, the answer is m-2.\n\nBut what if n is not exactly a Fibonacci number? For example, n=4. The largest F(m) <=4 is F(5)=5? No, wait F(4)=3, F(5)=5. So for n=4, the largest is F(4)=3, m=4, answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example, n=5: F(5)=5, m=5, answer is 5-2=3. Which would be correct.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum m where F(m) ≤n, then subtract 2.\n\nBut how do we generate the Fibonacci numbers?\n\nWe can precompute them in a list. Let's generate them until the next term exceeds 1e18.\n\nLet me code that.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nGenerate the Fibonacci sequence until the value exceeds 1e18.\n\nThen, find the largest m such that F(m) ≤n.\n\nThe answer is m-2.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, according to the input constraints, n starts from 2. So no problem.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. The Fibonacci list up to 3 is [1,1,2,3]. So m=4, answer 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. The largest F(m) is 3 (m=4). answer 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 10: F(6)=8, F(7)=13. So m=6, answer 6-2=4. Correct.\n\nAnother example, n=2. The F(3)=2. m=3, answer 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example, n=5. answer is 3. Which would be correct.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers. Let's generate them as a list.\n\nInitialize a list fib = [1, 1], then generate next terms until the next term exceeds 1e18.\n\nWait, but for the initial terms:\n\nfib[1] = 1 (m=1)\n\nfib[2] = 1 (m=2)\n\nfib[3] = 2 (m=3)\n\nfib[4] = 3 (m=4)\n\netc.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_val)\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to generate all the terms up to that.\n\nOnce we have the list, for a given n, find the largest m where fib[m-1] <=n. Wait, the indexes here need to be handled carefully. Let's think:\n\nThe list starts with fib[0] = 1 (m=1?), or maybe the indexes are shifted. Let's think:\n\nLet me create a list where fib[0] = F(1) =1, fib[1] = F(2)=1, fib[2]=F(3)=2, fib[3]=F(4)=3, etc. So for m, the index is m-1.\n\nSo for m=1, F(m) is 1, stored in fib[0].\n\nSo for the list, we can generate as follows:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nthen, for each new term, append fib[-1] + fib[-2].\n\nOnce generated, for a given n, we can find the maximum m where F(m) <=n. So, find the largest index i such that fib[i] <=n. Then m = i+1.\n\nBecause:\n\nfor example, if fib[i] is F(m) where m = i+1.\n\nBecause:\n\ni=0 → F(1) = 1.\n\ni=1 → F(2)=1.\n\ni=2 → F(3)=2.\n\nSo, for the list, the index is i, and m is i+1.\n\nOnce m is found, the answer is m-2.\n\nSo, for example, for i=3 (fib[i]=3, which is F(4)), m=4. answer is 4-2=2.\n\nThus, the code steps are:\n\nGenerate the list of F(m) as fib list, where each element is F(1), F(2), F(3), etc.\n\nOnce generated, for input n, find the largest i where fib[i] <=n. Then m = i+1. Answer is (i+1) -2 = i-1.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nIf the list is [F(1), F(2), F(3), ...], then for each element at index i, it's F(i+1). So for example, index 0 is F(1), index 1 is F(2), index 2 is F(3), etc.\n\nSo if we find the largest i where fib[i] <=n, then m is i+1. Then answer is m-2 = (i+1) -2 = i-1.\n\nWait, but for example, when n=3, the fib list has elements [1, 1, 2, 3]. So for n=3, the largest i is 3 (since fib[3] is 3). Then m = 3+1=4. answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct. i is 3, answer is 3-1=2. Yes.\n\nSo the answer is (i) - 1 ?\n\nWait, m = i+1. answer is m-2 = i+1 -2 = i-1.\n\nYes. So the answer is i-1.\n\nSo, for example, when i=3 (as in the case of n=3), answer is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest i such that fib[i] <=n. Then, answer is i-1.\n\nBut what if n is less than F(1) =1? Well, according to input constraints, n is >=2. So no problem.\n\nNow, how to find the largest i where fib[i] <=n.\n\nSince the fib list is sorted in increasing order (since Fibonacci numbers increase), we can perform a binary search.\n\nBut for small lists, even linear search is acceptable. However, for the sake of efficiency, binary search is better.\n\nBut given that the list is small (for example, the 90th Fibonacci number is about 2.8e18, so the list will have about 90 elements), even a linear search is acceptable.\n\nSo, for code:\n\nOnce the fib list is generated, iterate through it to find the maximum i where fib[i] <=n. Then answer is i-1.\n\nBut let's think about the case when n is 1. But the input constraints say n≥2. So no problem.\n\nLet me test with sample input 2:\n\nSample Input 2 is n=3. The fib list is [1,1,2,3]. So the maximum i is 3, answer is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. The fib list up to 3 is [1,1,2,3], next is 5. So the maximum i is 3 (fib[i]=3 ≤4). answer is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 10: the fib list would have 3,5,8,13. So for n=10, the maximum i is 3 (fib[3] is 3, then next is 5 (i=4?), wait let me recheck.\n\nWait, the list is built as follows:\n\nfib starts with [1, 1]. Then:\n\nnext is 1+1=2 → append. list becomes [1,1,2]\n\nnext is 1+2=3 → append. list [1,1,2,3]\n\nnext is 2+3=5 → append. list [1,1,2,3,5]\n\nnext is 3+5=8 → append. list [1,1,2,3,5,8]\n\nnext is 5+8=13 → append. list [..., 8, 13]\n\nSo for n=10, the maximum fib[i] is 8 (i=5, since list is [1,1,2,3,5,8], indexes 0-5). So i=5. answer is 5-1=4. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code would generate the list, then find the maximum i where fib[i] <=n.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, generate the fib list.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the list can be generated as follows:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float. So perhaps better to use 10**18 as integer.\n\nSo:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nOnce this list is generated, for a given n, find the largest i where fib[i] <=n.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nFor example, for n=2, the list has [1,1,2, ...]. So the maximum i is 2 (fib[2]=2). answer is 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nThen, find the maximum i where fib[i] <=n.\n\nOnce found, output i-1.\n\nBut what if n is less than the first element of fib? Well, since n is at least 2, and fib[0] is 1, fib[1] is 1, fib[2] is 2. So for n=2, it's okay.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the fib list as above.\n\nInitialize max_i = 0.\n\nLoop through the list:\n\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[i] <=n:\n\n        max_i = i\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nBut since the list is in increasing order, once a value exceeds n, all following values will also exceed n. So we can break early.\n\nBut in Python, for a list that's generated as [1,1,2,3,5,8,...], for example, for n=10, the loop would check each element until 8 (which is <=10), then next is 13, which is >10, so break. So the max_i would be 5 (since fib[5]=8).\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nmax_i = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[i] <=n:\n\n        max_i = i\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nBut this would work only if the list is in increasing order. Which it is.\n\nBut for example, for i=0, fib[0]=1 <=n (for n≥2). So max_i is set to 0. Then i=1, fib[1]=1 <=n, set to 1. Then i=2, 2<=n, set to 2. etc.\n\nOnce the loop ends, the max_i is the largest index where fib[i] <=n.\n\nBut what if the entire list is smaller than n? For example, if n is larger than the last element of the fib list. For example, if n is 1e18 and the last element is 1e18-1. Then, the code would set max_i to len(fib)-1.\n\nBut in the code generation step, we break when next_num exceeds 1e18. So the last element in the fib list is the largest Fibonacci number <=1e18.\n\nSo, for example, if n is 1e18, then the code would find the max_i as len(fib)-1.\n\nOnce we have max_i, the answer is max_i -1.\n\nWait, no. As discussed earlier, answer is i-1.\n\nBut let's take the case where n is 3. The max_i is 3 (since fib[3] is 3). answer is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5. max_i is 4 (fib[4] is 5). answer is 4-1=3. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the input constraints say n is ≥2, so no problem.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut let's think about the case where n is 1. Not applicable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nBut the input is a single integer. So:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nGenerate the fib list as described.\n\nOnce the list is generated, find the max_i.\n\nBut what if the list is empty? No, because the list starts with [1,1].\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for the case where n is 2, the fib list is [1,1,2, ...]. So, the code would find max_i=2 (fib[2]=2), answer is 2-1=1. Which is correct.\n\nNow, let's implement this.\n\nBut let's think about the code for generating the fib list.\n\nIn Python:\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nBut what about for the first few steps?\n\nYes.\n\nOnce that is done, then:\n\nmax_i = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[i] <=n:\n\n        max_i = i\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nBut this loop is O(k), where k is the number of Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18, which is about 90 steps. So acceptable.\n\nOnce max_i is found, the answer is max_i -1.\n\nBut wait, what if n is larger than all elements in fib? For example, if n is larger than the last element in the fib list. Then, the loop would have set max_i to len(fib)-1. But in that case, the answer would be len(fib)-1 -1 = len(fib)-2. But what if the actual maximum k is higher?\n\nNo. Because the code stops generating when next_num exceeds 1e18. So the last element in the fib list is the largest Fibonacci number <= 1e18. So, if n is 1e18, then the code would have included it. But if n is larger than that, but according to the problem statement, n can be up to 1e18. So the code is okay.\n\nWait, the problem says n can be up to 1e18. So, the code generates all Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. So, for any n in the input, the code will find the correct max_i.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. The fib list includes 1,1,2,3,5, etc. So during the loop, i ranges from 0 to len(fib)-1. For each i, check if fib[i] <=3. For i=0: yes. i=1: yes. i=2: 2<=3. i=3: 3<=3. i=4:5>3. So break. So max_i is 3. answer is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. The loop checks i=0 to ... up to i=3 (fib[3]=3<=4). Then i=4, fib[4]=5>4 → break. So max_i=3. answer is 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 10: n=10. The fib list includes up to 8, 13. So for i=5, fib[5]=8<=10. i=6: fib[6]=13>10 → break. So max_i=5. answer is 5-1=4. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5. The answer is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=8. The answer is 6-1=5? Wait, no. Let me see.\n\nWait, for n=8, the fib list has 8 as the 6th element? Let's see:\n\nfib[0] = 1 (F(1))\n\nfib[1] = 1 (F(2))\n\nfib[2] = 2 (F(3))\n\nfib[3] = 3 (F(4))\n\nfib[4] = 5 (F(5))\n\nfib[5] = 8 (F(6)).\n\nSo for n=8, the max_i is 5. answer is 5-1=4. Which is correct. Because F(6) is 8. m=6. answer is 6-2=4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when n is exactly a Fibonacci number?\n\nYes, it's handled correctly.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut what about the case when n is 1? Well, the input constraints say n≥2.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the fib list.\n\nFind max_i.\n\nOutput max_i -1.\n\nBut let's code that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nmax_i = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n\n    if fib[i] <= n:\n\n        max_i = i\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nprint(max_i -1)\n\nWait, but what if the loop runs through all elements? For example, if n is larger than all elements in fib. But according to the code, the loop appends numbers until next_num exceeds 1e18. So the last element in the fib list is the largest Fibonacci number not exceeding 1e18. So, for n up to 1e18, the code will find the correct max_i.\n\nBut for example, if n is 1e18 and the last element of fib is 1e18, then the code will set max_i to len(fib)-1. Otherwise, if the last element is less than 1e18, but the next_num would be larger than 1e18, then the code would have stopped. So for example, if the last element is F(k) which is <=1e18, but F(k+1) would be >1e18.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test for n=2.\n\nThe fib list starts with [1,1,2, ...]. So for i=0, 1 <=2 → max_i=0. Then i=1, 1<=2 → max_i=1. i=2, 2<=2 → max_i=2. i=3, 3>2 → break. So max_i=2. answer is 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=1 is invalid.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut let's check the sample input for n=2. Output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5. Output is 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about n=6. The fib list has 5, 8. So the maximum is 5 (fib[4]=5). answer is 4-1=3. So the maximum",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem Constraints**: The tournament follows a knockout format where each loss eliminates a player. The key constraint is that two players can only compete if the difference in their number of previously played games is at most one.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The problem can be reduced to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given number of players `n`. This is because the structure of the tournament that maximizes the number of games for the winner resembles a Fibonacci tree.\n3. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible value (10^18) to handle large inputs efficiently.\n4. **Binary Search for Maximum Games**: For a given number of players `n`, find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n` and use it to determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [1, 1]\nwhile True:\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n    if next_num > 10**18:\n        break\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nmax_i = 0\nfor i in range(len(fib)):\n    if fib[i] <= n:\n        max_i = i\n    else:\n        break\n\nprint(max_i - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: The code starts by generating all Fibonacci numbers up to 10^18. This is done using a loop that continues until the next Fibonacci number exceeds 10^18.\n2. **Finding the Maximum Index**: After generating the Fibonacci sequence, the code iterates through the list to find the largest index `max_i` such that the corresponding Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The maximum number of games the winner can play is derived from the index found in the previous step. Specifically, the result is `max_i - 1` because the Fibonacci sequence indices are offset by 2 relative to the game count.\n\nThis approach efficiently leverages the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to solve the problem in linear time relative to the number of Fibonacci numbers generated, ensuring it handles very large values of `n` up to 10^18 efficiently.",
