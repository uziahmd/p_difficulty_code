Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. Each takes turns, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the total sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of H and M moves that gives this maximum total.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to choose, at each step, whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit, such that the total sum is maximized. But since both players are taking digits, and each has to take exactly n digits, the problem is about choosing the order of taking digits to maximize the sum of their numbers.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Let's think about the digits. Each time a player takes a digit, it's added to their number. Since the numbers are formed by appending digits, the order in which they take digits affects the value of their numbers. For example, taking a higher digit earlier (as the first digit) contributes more to the value than taking it later.\n\nBut since the total sum is S1 + S2, which is the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective positions. Wait, no. Because each digit taken by a player contributes to their own number. For example, if Homer takes a digit d at position i (where i is the ith move he makes), then that digit contributes d * 10^{n - i} to his total. Similarly for Marge. But since the problem requires the sum of S1 and S2, perhaps we can think of each digit's contribution as being multiplied by 10^k, depending on when it's taken.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Since the total sum S1 + S2 is the sum of all digits multiplied by their place values. However, the place value depends on when the digit is taken. For example, the first digit taken by a player contributes more than the second. So, the problem is to assign each of the 2n digits to either Homer or Marge, with exactly n digits each, and arrange their order of taking so that the sum of their numbers is maximized.\n\nBut how do we model the order? Because the order in which they take digits affects the place value. For example, if Homer takes a digit first, it's the first digit of his number, which is worth 10^{n-1} times the digit. If he takes it second, it's 10^{n-2} times, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each player makes exactly n moves. So for Homer, the first digit he takes is the first digit of his number, then the next one is the second, etc. So for each digit assigned to Homer, the position in which he takes it determines its contribution. Similarly for Marge.\n\nBut how can we model this optimally? It seems complicated because the choice of who takes which digit affects the overall sum based on their order of taking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to greedily choose, at each step, whether Homer or Marge should take the current leftmost digit, based on which choice leads to a higher total sum. But since the problem requires considering future steps, a greedy approach might not work. For example, taking a slightly smaller digit now might allow for larger digits later.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. The straightforward approach would be to try all possible ways to assign the digits to Homer and Marge, but that's impossible for n=18, since the number of possibilities is C(36, 18) which is way too big.\n\nSo we need a dynamic programming approach. Let's think about the state. At any point in time, the number of digits remaining is 2n - k, where k is the number of digits already taken. But more importantly, we need to track how many digits Homer and Marge have already taken. Let's say that after some steps, Homer has taken h digits, and Marge has taken m digits. Since each must take exactly n digits, the total steps taken so far is h + m, and the remaining steps are (n - h) + (n - m) = 2n - (h + m). The state can be represented by (h, m), and the current position in the string A.\n\nWait, but the current position in the string can be determined by the number of digits already taken. For example, if the original A has length 2n, then after taking k digits, the next digit to take is at position k. So the state can be represented by (h, m), where h is the number of digits Homer has taken so far, m is the number of digits Marge has taken. Then, the next digit to take is the (h + m)-th digit (since each step takes one digit). Wait, no. The initial A is a string of length 2n. The first digit taken is the first one, then the next is the second, etc. So, when h + m digits have been taken, the next digit is the (h + m + 1)th digit of the original string.\n\nSo the state is (h, m). The transitions are: if it's Homer's turn (i.e., the next move is Homer's), then he takes the next digit, and h increases by 1. Or if it's Marge's turn, she takes the next digit, and m increases by 1.\n\nBut how do we decide who's turn it is? Well, the total number of moves taken so far is h + m. The next move can be either Homer or Marge, but subject to the constraints that h < n and m < n. Also, the total number of moves is 2n, and each player must take exactly n moves.\n\nBut how do we model the decision of who takes the next digit? At each state (h, m), the next move can be either Homer or Marge, provided that they haven't taken their n digits yet.\n\nThe key idea is that for each state (h, m), we can compute the maximum total sum that can be achieved from that state onwards. Then, using memoization, we can recursively compute this.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence. Let's denote dp[h][m] as the maximum total sum achievable when Homer has taken h digits and Marge has taken m digits. The current digit to take is the (h + m)th index (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's clarify.)\n\nWait, suppose A is a string of length 2n. Initially, h=0, m=0. The first digit is A[0], then after taking it, the next is A[1], etc. So when h + m digits have been taken, the next digit is A[h + m].\n\nSo, for state (h, m), the next digit is A[h + m].\n\nAt this state, the next move can be either Homer or Marge, provided that h < n and m < n respectively.\n\nSo, for dp[h][m], the maximum total sum is the maximum between:\n\nOption 1: Homer takes the next digit. Then, the contribution to the total sum is the value of the digit multiplied by 10^{n - h - 1} (since Homer is taking his (h+1)th digit, which will be placed as the (h+1)th digit in his number. Since his number has n digits, the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc. So the (h+1)th digit is multiplied by 10^{n - (h+1)} = 10^{n - h - 1}).\n\nSimilarly, if Marge takes the digit, her contribution is the digit multiplied by 10^{n - m - 1}.\n\nBut wait, the total sum is S1 + S2, which is the sum of all digits taken by Homer, each multiplied by their respective place value, plus the same for Marge. So, for each digit taken by Homer at step h (i.e., when he has taken h digits before this step), the place value is 10^{n - h - 1}? Or is it 10^{n - (number of digits he has taken so far after this step)}?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose Homer has taken h digits so far. When he takes another digit, this becomes his (h+1)th digit. Since his number has n digits, the first digit is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, ..., the h+1-th digit by 10^{n - (h+1)}. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, when Homer takes the next digit, the contribution is digit * 10^{n - h - 1}.\n\nSimilarly for Marge, when she takes the next digit, it's digit * 10^{n - m - 1}.\n\nBut then, the total sum is the sum of these contributions for all steps. Therefore, the DP transition can be:\n\ndp[h][m] = max( (digit * 10^{n - h - 1} ) + dp[h+1][m], (digit * 10^{n - m - 1} ) + dp[h][m+1] )\n\nBut wait, the digit is the same in both cases. Let me think again. The current digit is A[h + m], which is the next digit to take. So, if Homer takes it, then the contribution to the total is digit * 10^{n - h - 1} (since he has taken h digits before, and now takes one more). Then, the rest of the sum is dp[h+1][m]. Similarly for Marge.\n\nSo the DP recurrence is:\n\ndp[h][m] = max( (digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp[h+1][m]), (digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp[h][m+1]) )\n\nBut what's the base case? When h + m = 2n, which is when all digits are taken. Then, dp[n][n] = 0.\n\nBut for h and m, the maximum possible is n. So the DP table is (n+1) x (n+1) in size.\n\nNow, the problem is that for n=18, the DP table would be 19x19, which is manageable. But the issue is computing the 10^{...} terms. For example, for n=18, the exponents can be up to 18-0-1=17, so 10^17. But since the digits are up to 9, the maximum contribution per step is 9 * 10^17, which for 36 steps could be up to 9*36 * 10^17, which is a very big number, but Python can handle big integers.\n\nSo the DP approach is feasible here. However, we also need to reconstruct the path, i.e., the sequence of H and M choices that leads to the maximum sum. For that, we can keep track of the decisions made at each state.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the powers of 10 needed. For each possible exponent (from 0 to n-1), since for Homer's h-th step, the exponent is n - h - 1. For example, when h is 0, the exponent is n-1. When h is n-1, the exponent is 0. So for each possible h and m, we can compute the required exponents.\n\n2. Implement memoization for the DP function. Since n can be up to 18, the DP table is manageable. For each (h, m) pair, we can compute the maximum sum.\n\n3. Once the DP table is filled, we can backtrack from (0,0) to determine the choices made at each step. For each state (h, m), we check whether the optimal choice was to take Homer or Marge. Then, append 'H' or 'M' accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute the DP? Since the recurrence depends on states (h+1, m) and (h, m+1), which are further along in the process, we can compute the DP in a bottom-up manner.\n\nLet me think about the order of filling the DP table. The base case is when h = n and m = n, which is dp[n][n] = 0. Then, for other states, we can compute them in order of increasing h + m. Because, for a state (h, m), the next states (h+1, m) and (h, m+1) have h + m + 1 steps. So, for example, we can process the states in order of decreasing h + m. So, for h + m = 2n - 1 (the last step), then 2n-2, etc., down to 0.\n\nWait, the maximum h + m is 2n (when h = n and m = n). But the states that are processed are those where h + m ranges from 0 to 2n. However, for the DP to be filled, we can process the states in order of the sum s = h + m. For each s, from 2n down to 0, we process all (h, m) pairs such that h + m = s.\n\nBut for each (h, m) pair, we need to check if h < n and m < n. Because, for example, if h = n, then Homer can't take any more steps. Similarly for m.\n\nSo, for each s from 2n down to 0:\n\n   for all possible h and m where h + m = s:\n\n      if h == n and m == n: dp is 0\n\n      else:\n\n          if h < n and m < n:\n\n              current digit is A[s]\n\n              option1: Homer takes it. Then, the contribution is digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp[h+1][m]\n\n              option2: Marge takes it. Then, contribution is digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp[h][m+1]\n\n              dp[h][m] = max(option1, option2)\n\n          else:\n\n              if h < n: then Homer must take the next step. So, the contribution is digit * ... and add dp[h+1][m]\n\n              if m < n: same for Marge.\n\nWait, but for the case when h + m = s, and for example, h = n, m < n. Then, the next step must be Marge's. Because Homer has already taken all his n steps. So, in this case, the decision is forced. Similarly, if m = n, then Homer must take the next step.\n\nTherefore, in the DP transitions, for each (h, m), we need to check whether Homer or Marge can take the next step. So, for the state (h, m):\n\nif h < n and m < n: we can choose either.\n\nif h == n: only Marge can take the next step.\n\nif m == n: only Homer can take the next step.\n\nSo, the code for the DP would be:\n\nfor each s from 2n down to 0:\n\n    for all h, m where h + m = s:\n\n        if h + m == 2n:\n\n            dp[h][m] = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            current_digit = A[s]\n\n            if h < n and m < n:\n\n                option_h = current_digit * 10^(n - h - 1) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n                option_m = current_digit * 10^(n - m - 1) + dp[h][m+1]\n\n                dp[h][m] = max(option_h, option_m)\n\n            elif h < n:\n\n                # only Homer can take\n\n                dp[h][m] = current_digit * 10^(n - h - 1) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n            else:\n\n                # only Marge can take\n\n                dp[h][m] = current_digit * 10^(n - m - 1) + dp[h][m+1]\n\nBut how do we precompute the 10^exponents? Well, for each possible exponent, which can be from 0 to n-1, since for example, when h is 0, the exponent is n - 0 - 1 = n-1, and when h is n-1, the exponent is n - (n-1) -1 = 0.\n\nSo, we can precompute a list of powers, power = [10^k for k in range(n)] ?\n\nWait, for example, 10^0 is 1, 10^1 is 10, etc. So for the exponent (n - h -1), which ranges from 0 to n-1, we can compute it as pow(10, n - h -1).\n\nBut for n up to 18, 10^17 is manageable as an integer in Python.\n\nSo, during the DP computation, for each step, we can compute the value of the digit multiplied by the appropriate power.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, we can reconstruct the path.\n\nFor the reconstruction, we need to track for each state (h, m) which choice (H or M) was taken. So, during the DP computation, we can also store a parent pointer or a decision matrix.\n\nSo, during the DP calculation, for each (h, m), we can record whether the optimal choice was to take Homer or Marge. Then, during backtracking, starting from (0, 0), we can check for each state which choice was made and append 'H' or 'M' accordingly.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and A.\n\n2. Precompute the powers of 10 up to 10^(n-1).\n\nWait, but for each possible exponent, we can calculate it on the fly. For example, when Homer takes a digit at state (h, m), the exponent is (n - h - 1). So, 10 ** (n - h - 1).\n\nBut for n up to 18, this is acceptable.\n\n3. Initialize a DP table of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with 0s.\n\n4. Initialize a decision table (or a memo) for tracking the choices made.\n\n5. Iterate over s from 2n down to 0:\n\n   for all possible h and m where h + m = s:\n\n       if h + m == 2n:\n\n           dp[h][m] = 0\n\n       else:\n\n           current_digit = int(A[s])\n\n           if h < n and m < n:\n\n               option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n               option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n\n               if option_h > option_m:\n\n                   dp[h][m] = option_h\n\n                   decision[h][m] = 'H'\n\n               else:\n\n                   dp[h][m] = option_m\n\n                   decision[h][m] = 'M'\n\n           elif h < n:\n\n               # must choose H\n\n               dp[h][m] = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n               decision[h][m] = 'H'\n\n           else:\n\n               # must choose M\n\n               dp[h][m] = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n\n               decision[h][m] = 'M'\n\nOnce this is filled, the decision table can be used to backtrack from (0, 0) to build the sequence.\n\nBut how to generate the sequence? Starting from h=0, m=0, and for each step, look up the decision for (h, m), append the character, then increment h or m accordingly.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nresult = []\n\nh, m = 0, 0\n\nfor _ in range(2n):\n\n    choice = decision[h][m]\n\n    result.append(choice)\n\n    if choice == 'H':\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        m += 1\n\nThen, the result is the sequence of characters.\n\nBut wait, the decision table is built for each (h, m) state. So during the backtracking, the code would proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the question is: How to iterate through all possible (h, m) pairs for each s = h + m.\n\nFor example, for s in range(2n, -1, -1):\n\n   for h in range(0, n+1):\n\n       m = s - h\n\n       if m < 0 or m > n:\n\n           continue\n\n       process (h, m)\n\nBut for each s, h can be from max(0, s - n) to min(n, s). Because m = s - h must be between 0 and n.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor s in reversed(range(0, 2*n + 1)):\n\n    for h in range(0, n+1):\n\n        m = s - h\n\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # process (h, m)\n\nBut for s from 0 to 2n, and for each h, check if m is valid.\n\nBut for the DP, we can process all possible (h, m) pairs.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 18, the total number of (h, m) pairs is (n+1)*(n+1) = 19*19 = 361 for n=18, which is manageable.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nSample Output: HHMM.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=2, A = '1234'.\n\nThe digits are [1,2,3,4].\n\nThe DP starts from s=4 (h+m=4), which is h=2, m=2. dp[2][2] = 0.\n\nThen, for s=3:\n\npossible h and m pairs:\n\nh can be 0, m=3 (invalid, since m can't be more than 2).\n\nh=1, m=2: valid.\n\nh=2, m=1: valid.\n\nh=3, m=0: invalid.\n\nSo for h=1, m=2:\n\nh=1 < 2, m=2 == n. So only Homer can take. The current digit is A[3] = 4. So the contribution is 4 * 10^{2 - 1 -1} = 4 * 10^0 = 4. Then, dp[1][2] = 4 + dp[2][2] = 4 + 0 = 4. Decision is 'H'.\n\nSimilarly, for h=2, m=1: m < 2, h=2 == n. So only Marge can take. The digit is A[3] = 4. Contribution is 4 * 10^{2 - 1 -1} = 4 * 1 = 4. Then, dp[2][1] = 4 + dp[2][2] = 4.\n\nThen, for s=2:\n\npossible h and m pairs:\n\nh=0, m=2 → m=2 is n. Only Homer can take. Digit is A[2] = 3. Contribution is 3 * 10^{2 - 0 -1} = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then dp[0][2] = 30 + dp[1][2] = 30 +4 = 34.\n\nh=1, m=1: both can take. Digit is A[2] =3.\n\noption_h: 3 * 10^{2 -1 -1} = 3 * 1 → 3 + dp[2][1] (which is 4) → 3 +4=7.\n\noption_m: 3 * 10^{2 -1 -1} → same as above. 3 + dp[1][2] (4) → 7. So either choice. Which one is chosen? The code would pick 'H' or 'M' arbitrarily if equal. But in the sample output, the first choice is H, then H, then M, then M. So for this state (1,1), the code may choose H or M. Let's see what happens in the rest of the steps.\n\nBut perhaps the code will choose H here, leading to the sample output.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nFor s=2, h=1, m=1:\n\ncurrent digit is 3. option_h is 3 * 10^(2-1-1) = 3 * 1 = 3, plus dp[2][1] which is 4. Total 7.\n\noption_m is 3 * 10^(2-1-1) = 3, plus dp[1][2] which is 4. Total 7. So the code would choose either. Let's assume that in the code, when options are equal, it chooses 'H' first.\n\nSo decision for (1,1) is 'H'.\n\nThen, for h=2, m=0: h=2 is n, so Marge takes. Digit is A[2] =3. Contribution is 3 * 10^{2 - 0 -1} = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then dp[2][0] = 30 + dp[2][1] (which is 4) → 34.\n\nSimilarly, for other states.\n\nContinuing this way, eventually the decision for (0,0) would be to choose H, then H, then M, then M, leading to the sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement this.\n\nBut first, note that in Python, for exponents, 10 ** (something) can be computed directly. However, for large exponents, this is okay.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead A as a string.\n\nInitialize a DP table as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1).\n\nInitialize a decision table as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1), storing 'H' or 'M'.\n\nThen, for s in reversed(range(0, 2*n + 1)):\n\n   for h in 0 to n:\n\n       m = s - h.\n\n       if m is not between 0 and n, skip.\n\n       if h + m == 2n:\n\n           dp[h][m] = 0\n\n       else:\n\n           current_digit = int(A[s])\n\n           if h < n and m < n:\n\n               option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h -1 )) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n               option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m -1 )) + dp[h][m+1]\n\n               if option_h >= option_m:\n\n                   dp[h][m] = option_h\n\n                   decision[h][m] = 'H'\n\n               else:\n\n                   dp[h][m] = option_m\n\n                   decision[h][m] = 'M'\n\n           elif h < n:\n\n               dp[h][m] = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h -1 )) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n               decision[h][m] = 'H'\n\n           else:\n\n               dp[h][m] = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m -1 )) + dp[h][m+1]\n\n               decision[h][m] = 'M'\n\nOnce filled, reconstruct the path.\n\nNow, the code can be written in Python.\n\nBut for n=18, 10^17 is a very large number. However, Python handles big integers well.\n\nBut for the DP, the code may take O(n^2) time, which for n=18 is 324 steps, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the code for the reconstruction:\n\nh = 0\n\nm = 0\n\nresult = []\n\nfor _ in range(2*n):\n\n    choice = decision[h][m]\n\n    result.append(choice)\n\n    if choice == 'H':\n\n        h +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        m +=1\n\nreturn ''.join(result)\n\nBut how to handle the decision table? For example, in the case where the options are equal, the code chooses 'H' first.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\nThe digits are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nLet me simulate the DP for some states.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n9911\n\nOutput: HMHM.\n\nLet me think.\n\nBut regardless, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in Python, for the DP, we can use a 2D list for dp and decision.\n\nImplementing this:\n\nRead n from input, then A.\n\nBut note that the input is read from stdin. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '2', the second is '1234'.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nThen, create dp and decision tables.\n\nBut for Python, initializing a 2D list:\n\ndp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\ndecision = [['']*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nThen, for s in reversed(range(0, 2*n + 1)):\n\n   for h in range(0, n+1):\n\n       m = s - h\n\n       if m < 0 or m > n:\n\n           continue\n\n       if h + m == 2*n:\n\n           dp[h][m] = 0\n\n       else:\n\n           current_digit = int(A[s])\n\n           if h < n and m < n:\n\n               option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h -1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n               option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m -1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n\n               if option_h >= option_m:\n\n                   dp[h][m] = option_h\n\n                   decision[h][m] = 'H'\n\n               else:\n\n                   dp[h][m] = option_m\n\n                   decision[h][m] = 'M'\n\n           elif h < n:\n\n               dp[h][m] = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h -1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n\n               decision[h][m] = 'H'\n\n           else:\n\n               dp[h][m] = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m -1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n\n               decision[h][m] = 'M'\n\nOnce filled, reconstruct.\n\nBut wait, the s is from 0 to 2n. For example, for the first step, s=0, h=0, m=0.\n\nBut in the code, the loop is for s in reversed(range(0, 2*n + 1)):\n\nBut 2n is the maximum possible sum of h + m. For example, when n=2, 2n=4. So the reversed range is 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce the decision table is filled, the code can generate the sequence.\n\nNow, testing the first sample input.\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All digits are zero. The sequence can be any, but the code would choose H first when options are equal.\n\n- n=1, A is two digits. For example, input 1 and 21. Then the code would choose H first, then M. Or M then H, depending on which gives higher sum.\n\nBut for n=1, the sum is:\n\nIf H takes first digit (say 2) and M takes second (1): total is 2*10^0 + 1*10^0 = 2 +1 =3.\n\nIf M takes first (2) and H takes second (1): sum is 1*10^0 + 2*10^0 = 3. So the code can choose either. The output could be HM or MH.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, any of the possible solutions is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code would output HM or MH, depending on the decision when options are equal.\n\nIn the code, when option_h >= option_m, it chooses H. So in this case, for (h=0, m=0), the code would compare 2*1 (option_h) + dp[1][0] (which is the next step, which is m=0, h=1. Then, since h=1 is n=1, the next step is m's turn. The digit is 1. So for dp[1][0], the current digit is 1, and m is 0. So the contribution is 1 * 10^{1 - 0 -1} = 1 * 10^0 = 1. Then, dp[1][0] = 1 + dp[1][1] (which is 0). So dp[1][0] =1. So option_h for (0,0) is 2 + 1 =3. option_m is 2 * 10^{1 - 0 -1} (same as 2*1) + dp[0][1]. For dp[0][1], the current digit is 1, and since m=1 is n=1, the next step is h's turn. The digit is 1, and h=0. So contribution is 1 * 10^{1-0-1} = 1*1=1. dp[0][1] = 1 + dp[1][1] = 1. So option_m is 2 + 1 =3. Thus, the code would choose H. So the sequence is HM. Which is one of the possible correct answers.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut note that for s in reversed(range(0, 2*n +1)):\n\nBut in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. So, for example, range(0, 2n +1) would be from 0 to 2n (inclusive?), no. Wait, in Python, range(a, b) includes a, excludes b. So for 2n +1, the upper limit is 2n +1. So for example, when 2n is 4, range(0, 5) gives 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSo reversed(range(0, 2n +1)) would iterate from 4 down to 0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    size = 2 * n\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    decision = [['']* (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for s in reversed(range(0, 2*n +1)):\n        for h in range(n+1):\n            m = s - h\n            if m < 0 or m > n:\n                continue\n            if h + m == 2*n:\n                dp[h][m] = 0\n            else:\n                current_digit = int(A[s])\n                if h < n and m < n:\n                    option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h -1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n                    option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m -1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n                    if option_h >= option_m:\n                        dp[h][m] = option_h\n                        decision[h][m] = 'H'\n                    else:\n                        dp[h][m] = option_m\n                        decision[h][m] = 'M'\n                elif h < n:\n                    dp[h][m] = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h -1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n                    decision[h][m] = 'H'\n                else:\n                    dp[h][m] = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m -1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n                    decision[h][m] = 'M'\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path\n    res = []\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    for _ in range(2*n):\n        res.append(decision[h][m])\n        if decision[h][m] == 'H':\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            m += 1\n    print(''.join(res))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, for s in reversed(range(0, 2*n +1)): ?\n\nWait, 2*n +1 is the upper bound. For example, for n=2, 2n is 4, and the range is 0 to 4+1=5? No, the code says range(0, 2*n +1). So for 2n=4, the range is 0 to 5, which gives 0,1,2,3,4. So yes.\n\nBut when s is 4, which is 2n, then for h + m = 4, which is 2n, the code sets dp[h][m] =0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when s is 2n? For example, when s=4, and h=2, m=2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing this code with the first sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a given number, with each player taking exactly n turns. The goal is to maximize the sum of the numbers formed by the digits each player takes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a DP table where `dp[h][m]` represents the maximum total prize achievable when Homer has taken `h` digits and Marge has taken `m` digits.\n2. **State Transition**: For each state `(h, m)`, decide whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit based on which choice leads to a higher total prize. This decision is made by evaluating both possible moves and selecting the one with the higher value.\n3. **Reconstruction of Path**: After filling the DP table, reconstruct the sequence of moves by backtracking from the initial state `(0, 0)` using a decision matrix that records the optimal choice at each state.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    size = 2 * n\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    decision = [['']* (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for s in reversed(range(0, 2*n + 1)):\n        for h in range(n+1):\n            m = s - h\n            if m < 0 or m > n:\n                continue\n            if h + m == 2 * n:\n                dp[h][m] = 0\n            else:\n                current_digit = int(A[s])\n                if h < n and m < n:\n                    option_h = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n                    option_m = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n                    if option_h >= option_m:\n                        dp[h][m] = option_h\n                        decision[h][m] = 'H'\n                    else:\n                        dp[h][m] = option_m\n                        decision[h][m] = 'M'\n                elif h < n:\n                    dp[h][m] = current_digit * (10 ** (n - h - 1)) + dp[h+1][m]\n                    decision[h][m] = 'H'\n                else:\n                    dp[h][m] = current_digit * (10 ** (n - m - 1)) + dp[h][m+1]\n                    decision[h][m] = 'M'\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path\n    res = []\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    for _ in range(2 * n):\n        res.append(decision[h][m])\n        if decision[h][m] == 'H':\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            m += 1\n    print(''.join(res))\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The `dp` table is initialized to store the maximum total prize values for each state `(h, m)`, where `h` and `m` are the number of digits taken by Homer and Marge respectively.\n2. **State Evaluation**: For each state `(h, m)`, we evaluate the next digit to be taken from the string `A`. Depending on whether Homer or Marge takes the digit, we calculate the potential total prize and update the DP table accordingly.\n3. **Decision Matrix**: The `decision` matrix keeps track of whether Homer (`H`) or Marge (`M`) should take the next digit at each state to maximize the total prize.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Starting from the initial state `(0, 0)`, we use the decision matrix to trace back the sequence of moves that leads to the maximum total prize, ensuring each player takes exactly `n` digits.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the optimal sequence using dynamic programming, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and efficient even for the upper constraint limits.",
