He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is: \n\nFirst, A has a string of only 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's. The number of 'c's added must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the 'c's are added to the end.\n\nSo the final string must have all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters must be all a's, followed by all b's, followed by all c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. Like, if there's a 'c' before a 'b', that's impossible because the 'c's are added after the 'b's.\n\nSo first check: the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So any deviation from this order is automatically a 'NO'.\n\nFor example, the second example input is 'bbacc'. Let's see: the order is 'bbacc'. So after the a's (there's one a?), but the first two are 'b's. Wait, but the initial string was all a's. Then B added some b's. So the first part must be all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So if the string has a 'b' followed by an 'a', that's invalid. So the first thing to check is that the string is composed of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So for example, the string must be like a...ab...bcc...c.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. If not, return NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then proceed to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts. Let's say the counts are:\n\ncount_a = number of a's\n\ncount_b = number of b's\n\ncount_c = number of c's\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\nThe initial string was all a's. Then B added some b's. So the count_b must be at least 1. Also, count_a must be at least 1. Because the problem says that after B appends, there is at least one a and one b. So in the final string, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. Also, since C appends c's, count_c must be >=1? No. Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of c's. But the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. However, the note says that the example 'aabc' is valid. Let's check that. For example, the third example input is 'aabc', which has count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. So in that case, the count_c is 1. Which equals the count_b (1). So that's allowed. But what if count_c is zero? Well, the problem says that C appends some number of letters. So \"some number\" implies that it's at least one? Because otherwise, if C appends zero, then the count_c would be zero. But the problem says that the number of c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. But if the number of c's added is zero, then that would require that the number of a's or b's is zero. But that's impossible because after B appends, there's at least one a and one b. So the count_c must be at least 1. Therefore, in the final string, count_c must be at least 1. So the string must have at least one c. Wait, but the problem says that C appends some number of letters. So \"some number\" could be zero? Or does it mean that he appends at least one?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" The term \"some number\" can be zero? Or is it required to be at least one?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: the note says that in the third example, the number of c's equals the number of b's. The third example input is 'aabc', which has one c. So the count_c is 1, which is the same as count_b (1). So in that case, C added exactly one c. So the problem says that C appends some number of letters. So the number can be zero? But then, how would that work",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a', 'b', and 'c' characters in a particular order. The key constraints are that the string must start with some number of 'a's, followed by some number of 'b's, and then some number of 'c's, and the number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must be composed of a block of 'a's followed by a block of 'b's followed by a block of 'c's. If this order is not maintained, the answer is \"NO\".\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Check Validity**: Ensure that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check if the string is in the form a*b*c*\n    i = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    # Check for 'a's first\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n    # Check for 'b's next\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n    # Check for 'c's next\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n    \n    if i != n:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if there's at least one a, one b, and one c\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split the input into the list of strings (assuming input is like ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'])\n    # However, the input format might be a single string, but according to the example, it's a list.\n    # Wait, the input is a single string, but the example shows a list.
