He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, handling Roman numerals correctly.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps required.\n\nStep 1: Convert the input number c (given in base a) to a decimal integer.\n\nStep 2: Convert that decimal integer to base b. However, if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals instead of a regular base.\n\nSo the main parts are:\n\n- Parsing the input c (which may have letters for bases higher than 10, like A for 10, B for 11, etc.)\n- Converting from base a to decimal.\n- Then converting from decimal to base b (or Roman if needed).\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have letters, like in the example where the input is 'A' in base 12. So for example, if the input is 'A', then in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nBut how do I handle letters? Well, the input c is a string. For each character in the string, I need to convert it to its corresponding value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, up to 'Z' which would be 35? But since a can be up to 25, the maximum digit is 24 (since base a is up to 25). Wait, the input c is given in base a, which can be up to 25. So digits in c can be from 0 to a-1. So for example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-15. So letters would be used for digits >=10. Like A=10, B=11, ..., up to whatever is needed for base a.\n\nBut how do I parse the input string into a decimal value?\n\nSo, for each character in the string, I need to convert it to its numerical value. For example, if the input is 'A', then it's 10. But if the input is '10' in base 16, that's 16 in decimal.\n\nSo the first step is to process the input string c into a decimal number.\n\nSo, for each character in the string, I need to check if it's a digit or a letter. For example, '0'-'9' are 0-9, then 'A'-'Z' are 10-35. However, since the base a can be up to 25, the digits in c can't have values higher than a-1. But the problem says that the input is valid, so we don't need to check that.\n\nSo, the code for converting c from base a to decimal would be something like:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but the input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay because when converting to decimal, leading zeros don't affect the value. So that's handled automatically.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that c is a non-negative integer in base a. So the input c can be zero? Well, the note says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the number can be zero. However, the input says that c may contain leading zeros, but the length doesn't exceed 10^3.\n\nBut for the case when c is zero, for example, if the input is '0' in base 10, then converting to base 2 would be '0', but the output requires omitting leading zeros. So the output would be '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is not zero. So when converting to Roman, the input will not be zero. So in our code, when converting to Roman, we can assume that the decimal value is positive.\n\nNow, once we have the decimal value, the next step is to convert it to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nSo, the second part is converting from decimal to base b (if b is not R), or to Roman numerals (if b is R).\n\nLet's handle the case when b is not R first.\n\nConverting a decimal number to base b. The standard way is to repeatedly divide by b and collect the remainders. However, for bases higher than 10, digits above 9 are represented as letters. For example, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', etc.\n\nBut the problem says that in the output, when converting to base b (not R), the digits should be written in the usual way. For example, if the base is 16, then digits 10-15 are A-F.\n\nSo, the function to convert a decimal number to base b (as a string) would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            # rem is 10 or higher. For example, 10 is A, 11 is B, etc.\n            # So, rem - 10 is the offset. So 'A' is 0, 'B' is 1, etc.\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    # digits are collected in reverse order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? For example, if the input c is zero, then the output would be zero. But the problem says that when Roman is involved, the input isn't zero. So for other cases, we need to handle zero.\n\nBut in the code above, if n is zero, we return '0'. However, in the case where the input is zero, but the output is in base b (not R), then the output should be '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that in the input, for the case when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So when converting to Roman, the input is non-zero. However, when converting to base b (non-R), the input could be zero.\n\nSo the code for converting to base b needs to handle zero.\n\nBut in the code above, when n is zero, returns '0'.\n\nBut in the case of converting to base 2, for example, if the input is zero, the output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must omit leading zeros. However, in the case of zero, the output is just '0'.\n\nSo that's handled correctly.\n\nNow, the other case is when b is 'R', which means converting the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, how to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals?\n\nThe Roman numerals have specific rules. The standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. Then, subtract the largest possible value each time and append the corresponding symbol.\n\nFor example, the standard list would be:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value in the list, we check how many times it fits into the number, append the symbol that many times, and subtract the value.\n\nFor example, 4 is IV, 5 is V, etc.\n\nSo the code for converting to Roman would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman conversion is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 3000 (in decimal) and not zero. So the function can safely handle numbers up to 3000.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe steps for each test case are:\n\nRead a and b. Note that b can be 'R'.\n\nRead the string c.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal.\n\nIf b is 'R', convert the decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert the decimal to base b, using letters for digits above 9.\n\nBut also, the output must omit leading zeros. However, in the case of converting to base b, the code for decimal_to_base returns the correct digits without leading zeros except when the number is zero, which returns '0'.\n\nWait, the code for decimal_to_base returns '0' when n is zero. Which is correct. For example, if the input is 0, then output is '0'.\n\nBut for other cases, like when the decimal is 5 and base is 2, the code returns the correct binary string with no leading zeros.\n\nSo the code for converting to base b is okay.\n\nNow, let's think about the examples given.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nSo a is 10, b is 2. c is '1' in base 10. The decimal is 1. Convert to base 2: 1. Output is '1'.\n\nSecond example:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nSo c is '5' in base 16. The decimal is 5. Convert to Roman: V.\n\nThird example:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nc is 4 in base 5. Decimal is 4. Convert to Roman: IV.\n\nFourth example:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\nWhich is binary 1111001. Convert to decimal: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then convert to base 2 again: 1111001. Which is the same as input. Output is same as input.\n\nFifth example:\n\n12 13\n\nA\n\nSo c is 'A' in base 12. Which is 10 in decimal. Convert to base 13. 10 in base 13 is 'A', so output is 'A'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where c is zero. For example, input a is 10, b is 10, c is '0'. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: converting from base 2 to base 10. For example, input is 2 10, c is '0'. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base 1? Wait, but the input constraints say that a and b are between 2 and 25. So no. The problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So no need to handle base 1.\n\nBut the input says that the first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by R. So in the code, when reading the first line, the first part is a, the second is either an integer (b) or R.\n\nSo, the code needs to read the first line as a and b, but for the second part, check if it's R or not.\n\nSo, for the first line, the code can split into two parts. For example, in Python, the first line can be split into two parts. Let's see:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is '10 2', then '16 R', etc.\n\nSo, the first line is split into two elements. For example, in the first case, a is 10, b is 2. In the second case, a is 16, b is 'R'.\n\nSo, the code can read the first line as a string, split into two parts. Then, check if the second part is 'R' or not.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each test case:\n\nread the first line as a_str and b_str. For example, in Python:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nBut since the input is given as multiple test cases, perhaps each test case is two lines. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows that the input is a list of multiple test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', ...]\n\nBut in reality, the input is given as lines. For example, each test case is two lines: first line has a and b, second line has c.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (with b possibly being R). The next line contains c.\n\nSo, for each test case, there are two lines. But the problem's sample input shows that the input is a list of multiple test cases, but in practice, the code must read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. So the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. So the code must read all test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (or R). The next line contains c. So for each test case, there are two lines. But how many test cases are there? The problem says that the input is given as per the problem's input description, but in the sample input, there are multiple test cases. However, the problem's input format isn't clear on that. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting that there are multiple test cases, each given as two lines. But the problem's input description is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of multiple test cases, each with their own two lines. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich is five test cases. Each test case has two lines. So the code should read all lines, process them as pairs of lines. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut the problem's input description isn't clear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code should read all lines, processing them in pairs. For example, the first line is a and b, the second is c, then third line is a and b again, fourth is c, etc.\n\nBut how does the code know when to stop? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is given as multiple test cases, each with their own lines, and the code must read until EOF.\n\nBut in the problem statement's sample input, the input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual input is probably multiple lines, each pair representing a test case.\n\nSo, the code should read lines until EOF. For example, read two lines per test case. So, in Python, the code can read all lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to read the input? Let's think.\n\nIn Python, the standard way is to read from stdin. So perhaps the code should read all lines, then process them in pairs. For example, for each i in 0, 2, 4, ...:\n\na_line = lines[i]\n\nc_line = lines[i+1]\n\nBut how to handle that? Well, the code can read all lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut for the code submission, perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample shows multiple outputs. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of multiple test cases, but the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So this suggests that the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input and output show multiple test cases, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases. This is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But perhaps the sample input is a way to show multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. But that's conflicting with the sample input and output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented with multiple test cases in the sample, but the actual code should process one test case. But that's unlikely. Because the sample input and output have multiple entries. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut the problem's input description is unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. For example, the code reads lines until there are no more lines, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs. For example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n    a_b_line = lines[i]\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n\nBut this assumes that the number of lines is even, which is the case for the sample input.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, given the sample input and output, I think the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut why does the sample input show multiple test cases? Because in programming competitions, sometimes the problem has multiple test cases, and the sample shows several of them. However, the problem's input description may not mention that. But the problem's input description says \"the first line contains...\", implying that it's for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases.\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. For example, the first input line is '10 2', the next is '1', which is one test case. Then '16 R' and '5' is another test case, etc.\n\nTherefore, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code should read all lines, process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to read them in Python? Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, moving on.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nFor each pair of lines (a and b line, then c line):\n\nProcess the test case.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        a_b_line = lines[idx]\n        c_line = lines[idx + 1]\n        idx += 2\n        # process this test case\n\nBut need to make sure that idx + 1 is within the range. However, the problem says that the input is correct, so the code can assume that.\n\nNow, processing the a_b_line. Split into a and b.\n\nFor example, a_b_line could be '10 2' or '16 R'.\n\nSo, split into parts = a_b_line.split()\n\na = parts[0], which is an integer.\n\nb_part = parts[1]. If it is 'R', then the target is Roman numerals. Else, it's an integer (base b).\n\nOnce a and b are parsed, then process c_line.\n\nNow, converting c_line from base a to decimal.\n\nBut how to handle the case where a is 1? Well, the problem says that a is between 2 and 25, inclusive. So no need to handle a=1.\n\nNow, the code for converting c_line to decimal.\n\nBut the c_line can have letters. For example, if a is 12, then the digits can be 0-11, represented as 0-9, A, B.\n\nSo, for each character in c_line:\n\ndigit_value = int(ch) if ch is a digit, else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nBut need to make sure that the digit_value is less than a. But the problem says that the input is valid, so no need to check.\n\nSo, the code for converting c_line to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nBut what if the input is zero? For example, c_line is '0', then the value is zero.\n\nOnce that is done, then process the conversion to base b or Roman.\n\nNow, for the case where b is 'R':\n\ndecimal_value = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n\nroman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n\nprint(roman)\n\nElse, for base b:\n\ndecimal_value = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n\nconverted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, b)\n\nprint(converted)\n\nBut need to handle the case where decimal_value is zero. For example, if the input is '0' in base a, then converted to base b would be '0'.\n\nBut the code for decimal_to_base returns '0' in that case.\n\nBut what about when the input is zero and the target base is R? Well, the problem says that in such cases, the input would not be zero when Roman is involved. So the code can safely assume that when b is R, the decimal value is non-zero.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nLet's take the sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c=1. Convert to decimal 1. Then to base 2: 1. Output is '1'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b=R, c=5. Convert to decimal 5. Roman is 'V'.\n\nTest case 3:\n\na=5, b=R, c=4. decimal is 4. Roman is 'IV'.\n\nTest case 4:\n\na=2, b=2, c=1111001. decimal is 121. Convert to base 2: 1111001. Output same.\n\nTest case 5:\n\na=12, b=13, c=A. decimal is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A'.\n\nSo the code should output the sample outputs.\n\nNow, code for decimal_to_base:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nBut what if the base is 16 and the number is 10? Then the code appends 'A', which is correct.\n\nNow, the code for decimal_to_roman.\n\nBut what about numbers like 4, which is IV, etc. The code for decimal_to_roman seems correct.\n\nNow, code for the functions.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, handling the case where the input c is '0' and the output is '0'.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting from base 10 to base 10, the output is the same as input. But the code would convert to decimal and back. For example, input c is '123' in base 10, then converted to base 10 would be '123'.\n\nBut the code for decimal_to_base would return that.\n\nBut what if the input is '000' in base 10? Then to_decimal returns 0, and the code returns '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that in the case of Roman, the input is not zero, but for other cases, it's allowed.\n\nNow, code for the functions.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nImplementing all that.\n\nBut also, note that the input c may have leading zeros, but the output must omit leading zeros. However, the code for decimal_to_base returns the correct string with no leading zeros (except for zero itself). For example, if the decimal is 5, and base is 10, returns '5'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, coding.\n\nBut first, the code needs to read the input lines. Now, the code for the main function.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        a_b_line = lines[idx]\n        c_line = lines[idx + 1]\n        idx += 2\n        # process a_b_line and c_line\n        parts = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(parts[0])\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        # process c_line\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            b = int(b_part)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, b)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the input has multiple test cases, and the code reads all lines in pairs. But in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich would be lines[0] = '10 2', lines[1] = '1', then idx increases by 2, etc.\n\nBut in the code, the lines are read as [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]. So any empty lines are skipped. But the problem says that the input is correct, so no empty lines.\n\nBut the code may have issues if the input has an odd number of lines. However, the problem says that the input is correct, so that's not a problem.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first test case:\n\na=10, b=2, c='1' → decimal is 1 → converted to base 2 is '1' → output is '1'.\n\nSample Output is '1'.\n\nSecond test case:\n\na=16, b=R, c=5 → decimal is 5 → 'V'.\n\nThird test case:\n\na=5, b=R, c=4 → decimal is 4 → 'IV'.\n\nFourth test case:\n\na=2, b=2, c=1111001 → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001 → output same.\n\nFifth test case:\n\na=12, b=13, c=A → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: input a=10, b=10, c=0 → output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: input a=2, b=10, c=0 → output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: input a=10, b=16, c=255 → decimal is 255 → converted to base 16 is 'FF'.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when converting to base 1? Well, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 25, and the decimal is 25 → 25 in base 25 is '10'.\n\nYes, because 25 is 1*25 + 0.\n\nSo the code would generate '10'.\n\nBut the code for decimal_to_base:\n\nn = 25, base 25.\n\nrem = 25%25 = 0 → digits.append('0'), n becomes 1.\n\nrem = 1%25 = 1 → digits.append('1'), n becomes 0.\n\ndigits is ['0', '1'], reversed → '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code for the Roman numerals. For example, 3000 is MMM. But according to the problem statement, the input for Roman is guaranteed to be ≤ 3000. So the code can handle that.\n\nBut what about numbers like 3999? Well, the problem says that in the case of Roman, the number is <= 3000. So the code can safely process up to 3000.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, check for leading zeros in the output. For example, if the converted number is zero, output is '0'. Otherwise, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nIn the code, decimal_to_base returns '0' when n is zero. For other cases, leading zeros are not present. For example, if the decimal is 5, base 10 → '5'.\n\nAnother example: if the decimal is 0, base 10 → '0'.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, check the sample input.\n\nAnother sample input case:\n\nInput:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\nWhich is 1111001 in base 2. Which is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converting to base 2 again gives 1111001. Which is the output.\n\nSo code returns that.\n\nAnother test case: input is 5 R and c is 4. Which is 4 in base 5 → decimal is 4 → Roman is IV.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which can either be a standard numerical base or Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base `b` or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: Convert the given number from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, considering both numeric digits and alphabetic characters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a numerical base or Roman numerals, convert the decimal integer accordingly:\n   - For numerical bases, repeatedly divide the decimal number by the target base and collect remainders, converting them to appropriate characters if necessary.\n   - For Roman numerals, use a predefined list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral representation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        a_b_line = lines[idx]\n        c_line = lines[idx + 1]\n        idx += 2\n        parts = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(parts[0])\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            b = int(b_part)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, b)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, with each test case consisting of two lines: the first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, and the second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes the input string `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and converting it to its corresponding value.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: \n   - If the target base `b` is a numerical base, the function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal integer to the target base, handling values greater than 9 by using alphabetic characters.\n   - If the target base `b` is Roman numerals, the function `decimal_to_roman` constructs the Roman numeral using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs, ensuring correct formatting according to Roman numeral rules.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion requirements and ensures correct formatting for both numerical bases and Roman numerals.",
