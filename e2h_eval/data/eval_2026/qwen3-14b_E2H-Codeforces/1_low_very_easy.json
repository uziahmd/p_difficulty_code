The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge. The second is two cells away from the edge. Wait, maybe the way to think about it is that each ring is a border around a rectangle that's smaller than the previous one. \n\nThe formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, the rectangle that's being bordered is smaller by 4*(i-1) in both width and height. Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next ring is 2 cells inward on each side. So for example, the first ring is around the original rectangle. The second ring is around a rectangle that's 2 cells smaller in each direction. Wait, but if you subtract 2 from each side, then the total reduction in width is 4? Like, original width is w. For the second ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(2-1)) = w-4? Because the first ring is i=1, then for i=2, it's 4*(i-1) = 4*1 =4. So the rectangle for the second ring is (w-4) × (h-4). Then the ring is the border of that rectangle. \n\nSo the number of cells in each ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. But wait, how is the perimeter calculated here? Because for a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(W + H), but since each cell is counted once, perhaps when you take the border, you have for each side: top and bottom rows (each has W cells), and left and right columns (each has H-2 cells, since the top and bottom are already counted). So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Alternatively, maybe it's 2*(W + H) - 4, since the four corners are counted twice. Let me think. For example, if W is 3 and H is 3. The perimeter would be 3*4 - 4 (since each corner is counted in two sides). Wait, 3x3 square. The perimeter cells are the outermost layer. That's 3*4 -4 = 8 cells. Which matches the first example input. The first example input is 3 3 1, output is 8. So yes, that formula works. So the formula for the number of cells in the border of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because 2*(W + H) counts each side, but subtract 4 because the four corners are counted twice. Or maybe another way: for a rectangle of W columns and H rows, the number of cells in the border is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Which is the same as 2*(W + H) -4. So yes.\n\nSo for each ring i, we need to compute this value for the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those values for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the rectangle for each ring is valid. For example, if the original w and h are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1) from each, the resulting width and height must be at least 1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's ≤ floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me check that. Let me think: for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for the rectangle to exist, both dimensions must be ≥ 1. So for the k-th ring, the minimum between w and h must be ≥ 4*(k-1) + 1. Because for example, if min(w, h) is m, then for the k-th ring, we have m - 4*(k-1) ≥ 1 → m ≥ 4*(",
