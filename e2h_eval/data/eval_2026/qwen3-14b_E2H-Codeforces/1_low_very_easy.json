The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of gilded cells for each ring. The problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do I find the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, right. The perimeter of a rectangle. Oh right, but for a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Like, top and bottom have W cells each, left and right (excluding corners) have H-2 each. So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2(W + H - 2). Or maybe another way: the perimeter formula for a rectangle in grid terms.\n\nWait, for example, a 3x3 rectangle. The perimeter would be 3*4 - 4 (since each corner is counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think. The outer ring for 3x3 would be the cells around the edge. For a 3x3 grid, the outer ring has 8 cells. Which matches the first example input where the output is 8. So for a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each side has W or H cells, but the four corners are counted twice. So 2*(W + H) - 4. Which is the same as 2*(W + H - 2).\n\nYes. So for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w', h') where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all these perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each ring, the rectangle must be at least 3x3? Or maybe not. Because when you subtract 4*(i-1) from both dimensions, you have to ensure that the resulting dimensions are at least 1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's possible. Because the input says k is up to floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ). Wait, the original problem says that the input k is such that it's valid. So for example, if w and h are 3, then k can be 1, since 3 is the minimum. For example, for the first sample input 3 3 1, the first ring is 3x3, which gives 8 cells.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum them all.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize total = 0\n\n- For each i in 1..k:\n\n   - current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   - add perimeter to total\n\n- Return total\n\nWait, let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. \n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h =3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input:7 9 1. So current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example:7 9 2. First ring is 7x9: 2*(7+9-2)=28. Second ring: i=2. current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Wait, but 28 +12 is 40. Which matches the third example's output. So yes.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input, process each case, and compute this sum.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as three integers on a line. But the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as three integers. Wait, the problem says \"the only line contains three integers w, h, k\". So for each run, it's one test case. But the example shows three inputs, but perhaps that's just for illustration. Wait, the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps the actual input is one line",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle, and the task is to compute the total number of such cells for all specified rings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells corresponds to the perimeter of the rectangle formed at that ring level. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` can be calculated as `2 * (w + h - 2)`. This formula accounts for the four sides of the rectangle while avoiding double-counting the corners.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, adjust the width and height by reducing them by 4 times the ring index minus one (to account for the previous rings). This adjustment ensures that each subsequent ring is positioned inward by one cell from the previous ring.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: Sum the perimeters of all the rings from 1 to `k` to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input values\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values for width (`w`), height (`h`), and number of rings (`k`) are read and parsed.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the adjusted width and height by subtracting `4 * (i - 1)` from both the original width and height. This adjustment ensures that each subsequent ring is correctly positioned inward.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, calculate the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n4. **Summing Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by leveraging the perimeter calculation for each ring and ensures correctness by iterating through each specified ring level.",
