Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from one block (region) to another, where each step involves crossing a road (i.e., moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border). The home and university are in different blocks, and we need to find the shortest path between them.\n\nFirst, I need to model this as a graph problem. Each block is a node, and edges exist between blocks that share a common border. But how do I represent the blocks and their adjacency? Since there are infinite regions, it's impossible to represent all of them directly. So, I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, the key observation here is that each time you cross a road, you switch from one block to another. The problem is similar to BFS where each state is determined by the set of roads that you have crossed an odd number of times. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, think about the parity of the number of roads that separate the home from the current block. \n\nAnother approach: For any point not on a road, the position relative to each road can be determined. For example, for each road, the point is either on one side or the other. So, the block can be uniquely identified by the sign of each road's equation evaluated at the point. However, since there are n roads, there are 2^n possible combinations. But that's way too big for n=300. But wait, 2^300 is way too large. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nBut maybe the actual number of regions is manageable? No, because with n lines, the maximum number of regions is O(n²), but for n=300, that's 90,000. However, the problem is that each region is connected via adjacent regions. But how do we model this?\n\nAlternative idea: The movement between blocks is equivalent to crossing a road. So, the minimal steps between two blocks is the minimal number of roads you have to cross to get from the home block to the university block. But how do we model the adjacency between blocks?\n\nAlternatively, think of each block as being represented by the set of roads that are on its boundary. But again, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, here's a better idea. Let's model the problem using BFS where each state is the set of roads that have been crossed an odd number of times. Wait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nEach block can be uniquely determined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road i, the value of a_i x + b_i y + c_i can be positive or negative. Since the home is not on any road, for each road, the home is on one side. Similarly for the university. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to go from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration. Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. So, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped to convert the home's configuration into the university's configuration. But how?\n\nWait, suppose the home's configuration is a vector of signs (s_1, s_2, ..., s_n), where each s_i is +1 or -1, depending on whether the home is on the positive or negative side of road i. Similarly for the university's configuration (t_1, t_2, ..., t_n). Then, the problem is to find the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped (each flip corresponds to crossing that road once) so that the home's configuration becomes the university's configuration. Because each step allows us to cross one road, thereby flipping the sign of that road's value. However, the problem is that crossing a road changes the sign of exactly that road. So, the minimal steps needed is the number of roads where the home's sign differs from the university's sign. But that's only if those roads can be crossed in sequence. But why would that be the case?\n\nWait, no. Because if you cross a road, you can flip that road's sign. So, the difference between the home and university configurations is the set of roads where their signs differ. Each such road must be crossed once. But the order doesn't matter. Because each crossing toggles the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads where the home and university have different signs. However, this seems too simple. Let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome is (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are 0x+1y+0=0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first road (y=0): 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1>0 → sign is +1.\n\nSecond road (x=0): 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → sign +1. So home's configuration is (+1, +1).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → -1.\n\nSecond road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → -1. So university's configuration is (-1, -1). \n\nThe differences are both roads. So number of differing roads is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nx=0: 1>0 → +1.\n\ny=0: 1>0 → +1.\n\nx+y-3=0: 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -1. So home's config is (+1, +1, -1).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nx=0: -1 <0 → -1.\n\ny=0: -1 <0 → -1.\n\nx+y-3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -1. So university's config is (-1, -1, -1). \n\nDifferences are first two roads. So number of differing roads is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nSo this approach seems correct. So the minimal steps is the number of roads where the sign of home and university differ. \n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, to get from the home's configuration to the university's, you need to flip exactly the roads where they differ. Because flipping a road once changes its sign. So if you have k differing roads, you need to cross them once each. Thus the minimal steps is k. \n\nBut why can't there be a shorter path? Because each step allows you to cross exactly one road. So, for example, if two roads are crossed, you need two steps. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing roads. \n\nBut this seems to contradict some scenarios. Let's think of a case where two roads are crossed, but the differing roads are two, but there's a way to cross them in one step. Wait, no. Because each step crosses exactly one road. So, for example, if you have two differing roads, you need to cross each once, so two steps. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because when you cross a road, you change your sign for that road. So, if you start with home's configuration, and you cross a road, you flip that road's sign. Then, if you cross another road, you flip that road's sign. So, after crossing two roads, you have two signs flipped. So, if the university's configuration differs in exactly those two roads, then you can reach it in two steps. \n\nBut how can you cross a road that's not in the differing set? Well, if you cross a road that's not in the differing set, you would flip it, which would make it differ. So, that would not help. Therefore, the minimal steps is indeed the number of differing roads. \n\nSo the problem reduces to computing for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. The number of such roads is the answer. \n\nBut wait! What about overlapping roads? For example, if two roads are parallel and don't intersect. But in that case, the regions are divided by those roads. However, the home and university may be on different sides of each road. But the steps required would be the sum of differing roads. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads? Because each step crosses a road, and each crossing flips the sign of that road. So, regardless of the order, the number of steps is the number of differing roads. \n\nBut what if there's a road that's not crossed, but the home and university are on opposite sides of it? Well, that's part of the differing count. So, the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor each road, compute the sign of the home point (evaluate a_i x1 + b_i y1 + c_i). Similarly for the university point. If the signs are different, increment the count. \n\nBut wait, the sign for the home and university for a road can be same or different. So, for each road, check if (home_sign * university_sign) < 0. If yes, then this road is in the differing set. \n\nSo the answer is the count of such roads. \n\nBut wait, why does that work? Let's think again. \n\nSuppose that the home and university are in the same block. Then, the answer is 0. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the home and university are not on any road, but they could be in the same block. However, the problem says that the university is located in some block. But the problem says that the input is such that the home and university are in different blocks? Or not? Wait, the problem says that the home and university are located in some block. It's possible that they are in the same block. But in that case, the answer is 0. \n\nBut according to our approach, if the home and university are in the same block, then for all roads, their signs are same. So the count is zero. Which is correct. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nBut wait, this seems way too easy for a programming competition problem. Why would the sample inputs be as given? Let me check the first sample again. \n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are y=0 and x=0. \n\nFor the first road (y=0), home is +1, university is -1. So different. For second road, same. So total of 2 steps. Which matches the sample. \n\nSample Input 2: \n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nFor the third road, home's value is 1+1-3 = -1. University's is -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Both are negative. So same sign. So the count is 2. Which is correct. \n\nSo this approach seems to work. \n\nBut why is this the case? How does crossing roads correspond to flipping the signs? \n\nBecause each time you cross a road, you move into a neighboring block. Each block is defined by the signs of all roads. Crossing a road flips the sign of that road. So, the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of sign flips needed to get from the home's sign configuration to the university's. \n\nBut since each step can flip exactly one sign, the minimal steps is the number of differing signs. Because each differing sign requires exactly one flip. \n\nSo, the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nThis seems to be the solution. \n\nSo, the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), the university coordinates (x2, y2), then n roads. For each road, compute the value of a_i x1 + b_i y1 + c_i and the value of a_i x2 + b_i y2 + c_i. Check if their product is negative. If so, increment the count. \n\nBut wait, since the home and university are not on any road, the values for each road are non-zero. So, for each road, the home's value and the university's value are non-zero. \n\nSo, for each road, compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. If val1 * val2 < 0, then count +=1. \n\nThe answer is the count. \n\nBut why is this correct? Because each such road is a barrier between the home and the university. So, to get from home to university, you have to cross each of these roads once. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly these roads? Because each road that separates the home and university must be crossed once. And crossing them in any order would get you there. \n\nYes. Because each road that has different signs for home and university is a separator between the two blocks. So, the minimal steps is the number of such roads. \n\nBut why isn't there a case where two roads are crossed, but they are not in the differing set? Well, because if the home and university are on the same side of a road, then crossing that road would take you to a different block, but you would have to cross it again to get back. So, that would add two steps, but it's unnecessary. \n\nThus, the minimal steps is indeed the count of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let's test this against the sample inputs. \n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads:\n\n0 1 0 → y=0. \n\nval1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1. \n\nRoad 1 0 0 → x=0. val1 is 1*1 +0 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1. Total is 2. Correct. \n\nSample Input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0. val1 is 1, val2 is -1 → product -1 → count +=1. \n\n0 1 0 → y=0. val1 is 1, val2 -1 → product -1 → count +=1. \n\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0. val1 is 1+1-3 =-1. val2 is -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0 → no count. So total is 2. Correct. \n\nAnother test case: suppose home and university are in the same block. Then, for all roads, their val1 and val2 have same sign. So count is zero. \n\nAnother test case: if there is one road. Suppose home is on one side, and university on the other. Then count is 1. So answer is 1. Which makes sense. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead x1, y1. Then x2, y2. Then n. Then read n lines of a, b, c. For each line, compute val1 and val2. Check if val1 * val2 < 0. Count. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 are non-zero. So no division by zero. \n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of n roads:\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but that's all? That's the solution? \n\nYes. \n\nBut why was the problem considered a competitive programming problem? Because perhaps the initial approach was more complex. But the actual solution is very simple. \n\nBut why? Because the problem is equivalent to counting the number of roads that separate the home and university. Each such road must be crossed once. \n\nThus, the code is straightforward. \n\nLet me check the sample input again. \n\nIn the first sample, the answer is 2. Which the code gives. \n\nIn the second sample, the answer is 2. Which the code gives. \n\nAnother test case: home and university are on the same side of all roads. Answer is 0. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by 3 roads. Answer is 3. \n\nSo the code works. \n\nTherefore, the solution is to count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo the Python code is as follows.\n",
