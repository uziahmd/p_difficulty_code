Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent the blocks? Since each block is defined by the arrangement of the roads (lines), maybe there's a way to represent each block uniquely based on the positions relative to each road.\n\nWait, each road divides the plane into two parts. For any given line, a point is either on one side or the other. So for each line, we can determine which side of the line the home and university are on. Then, the blocks can be represented by the sign of each line's equation evaluated at that point. But since there are n lines, each block can be represented as a tuple of signs for each line. However, since the lines are infinite, the number of possible blocks could be 2^n, but in reality, with n lines, the maximum number of regions is O(n²), but for n up to 300, that's impossible to handle directly. So that approach might not be feasible for n=300.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires us to find the minimal steps between two blocks. So perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node is a block, and edges exist between adjacent blocks. Then perform BFS from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do we represent the blocks? The key is that two blocks are adjacent if they share a common border, which implies that they differ by exactly one line. Because when you cross a line, you move from one region to another. However, this is only true if the regions are separated by that line. Wait, but two regions that are adjacent must share a common line. So, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one line's sign. Because if two blocks differ in exactly one line, then they are separated by that line, and hence their common border is that line. But how?\n\nLet me think: suppose two regions are such that all lines except one have the same sign. Then they are separated by that line. Therefore, moving between them would require crossing that line, hence they are adjacent. So, the adjacency is determined by differing in exactly one line's sign. But how to confirm this?\n\nYes, because if two regions differ in exactly one line's sign, then they are separated by that line. Hence, their common boundary is that line. So, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of line sign changes needed to go from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration.\n\nBut how to model this? Let me think: each block can be represented by a binary string (or a tuple) indicating for each line whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the line. Then, two blocks are adjacent if their binary representations differ in exactly one bit. Because changing one bit means crossing that line, hence adjacent.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of bit flips needed to transform the home's sign configuration into the university's sign configuration, where each flip corresponds to moving through a line. But wait, no. Because each step allows moving between adjacent blocks (which differ by exactly one line). Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two configurations. Because each step can change exactly one bit.\n\nWait, but that can't be right. Suppose the home is in a block that has signs S, and the university is in a block with signs T. The minimal steps would be the number of lines where S and T differ. Because each step can flip one line's sign. So the answer is the Hamming distance between the two vectors. But why?\n\nFor example, if the home and university are in regions that differ in k lines, then the minimal steps is k. Because each step you can cross one line. But wait, that's only possible if there's a path where each step flips exactly one line. But how can that be possible? Because each step requires moving across a line, which changes exactly one line's sign.\n\nSo for example, if the home and university differ in k lines, then the minimal steps is k. But how can we be sure that there's a path of exactly k steps? Because each step can flip one line. So, for example, if the home and university differ in k lines, then you can cross each of those lines once. So the minimal steps is the number of differing lines.\n\nWait, but this seems too simple. Let me check the sample input.\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\nHome is (1,1), University is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x +1y +0=0 (which is y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0).\n\nSo, the home (1,1) is above y=0 (since 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0?), so for the first line, the value is 1. For the second line, x=0: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1>0. So the home's sign vector is (positive for line 1, positive for line 2). The university is (-1,-1). For line 1: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. For line 2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So the sign vector is (negative, negative). So the two vectors differ in both lines. So Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. That's correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one. Let's see:\n\nSample Input 2:\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nSo for home (1,1):\n\nLine 1: x=0 → 1>0 → positive.\n\nLine 2: y=0 → 1>0 → positive.\n\nLine 3: x + y -3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → negative.\n\nSo home's sign vector is (+, +, -).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nLine 1: x=0 → -1 <0 → negative.\n\nLine 2: y=0 → -1 <0 → negative.\n\nLine 3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → negative.\n\nSo the sign vector is (-, -, -). Comparing with home's (+,+,-), the differences are in the first two lines. So Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. So that works.\n\nSo according to this, the answer is simply the number of lines where the home and university have different signs. So the problem reduces to computing for each line, the sign of the home and the sign of the university. Then count how many lines have different signs between the two points.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross one line. So if you have to cross k lines, then you can do it in k steps. But how can you cross each line once? Because each time you cross a line, you flip the sign for that line. So the minimal steps is the number of differing lines.\n\nBut why can't there be a shorter path? Like, maybe some lines are crossed multiple times. But since each step flips exactly one line, the minimal steps would be the number of differing lines.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: for each line, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the line. The total number of such lines is the answer.\n\nWait, but that seems very straightforward. So how does the problem's example work? Let's think again.\n\nYes, the answer is the number of lines that separate the home and university. Because each such line must be crossed once. And each step crosses exactly one line. So the minimal steps is the number of such lines.\n\nBut how do we know that there's a path that crosses each of these lines once, without needing to cross any other lines?\n\nBecause, for example, imagine that the home and university are separated by k lines. Then, there exists a path that crosses each of these lines once. Because each line that separates them is a barrier that needs to be crossed once. But how?\n\nBut perhaps the problem is equivalent to the number of lines that separate the home and university. Because each such line must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is the count of such lines.\n\nSo how do we compute that?\n\nFor each line, compute the sign of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) for home and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i) for university. If the signs are different, then this line separates them, and thus contributes 1 to the answer.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each line, compute the value for home and for university.\n\n- For each line, check if the product of the two values is negative (meaning they are on opposite sides of the line).\n\n- Count the number of such lines.\n\nThat's the answer.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because each such line must be crossed once. But how can we be sure that there's no overlapping or something else?\n\nLet me think of an example where two lines separate the home and university, but the minimal steps is 2. Which would be the case here.\n\nBut what if the home and university are separated by two lines, but there's a way to cross them in one step? No, because each step can cross only one line. So you need two steps.\n\nSo the answer is indeed the count of lines that separate the two points.\n\nThis seems to be the case. So the problem is actually very simple once you realize that the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nBut why is this the case? Let me think of a scenario where two points are separated by two lines, but the minimal steps is 2.\n\nSuppose there are two lines, x=0 and y=0. Home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). Then, the two lines separate them. So the answer is 2. Which is correct. You need to cross x=0 and y=0, which takes two steps.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three lines, x=0, y=0, and x + y = 1. Home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). Then, the lines x=0 and y=0 separate them. The third line x + y = 1: for home, 1+1-1=1>0. For university, -1 + (-1) -1 = -3 <0. So the product is negative. So that line also separates them. So the answer would be 3. But how can you cross three lines in three steps?\n\nYes. Each step crosses one line. So the answer is 3.\n\nBut how can we be sure that the minimal steps is exactly the number of separating lines?\n\nBecause each step can cross exactly one line. So if there are k lines separating the two points, then you have to cross each of them once. Hence, k steps.\n\nBut what if some lines are not separating the two points but you have to cross them? No, because if a line does not separate the two points, then they are on the same side of that line. So crossing that line would not bring you closer to the university. So the minimal path would not involve crossing such lines.\n\nTherefore, the minimal steps is exactly the number of lines that separate the two points.\n\nSo the solution is to compute for each line, check if the home and university are on opposite sides of the line. Count the number of such lines.\n\nThat's a very simple solution. Let me check the sample inputs again.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Two lines: y=0 and x=0. For each line:\n\nFor line y=0: home is 1*1 + 0*...? Wait, the line equation is a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. For the first line, it's 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. So for home (1,1): 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. For university: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. So product is 1*-1 = -1 <0. So this line counts. Similarly for the second line, x=0. Home is 1*1 +0*... → 1. University is -1. Product is -1. So two lines. Answer is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: three lines. The home and university are separated by two lines (the first two lines). The third line's equation is x + y -3 =0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Both negative. So same sign. So not counted. Hence, total of 2 lines. Answer is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works. Then the code is straightforward.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n, then read n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nFor each line, compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. Check if val1 * val2 < 0. If yes, increment the count.\n\nOutput the count.\n\nWait, but why is that sufficient? Because each line that separates the two points must be crossed once. And each such line contributes exactly one step. So the answer is the count of such lines.\n\nSo the code is simple. Let's test another example.\n\nSuppose there is one line. The home and university are on opposite sides. Then the answer is 1. Which is correct. If they are on same side, answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: three lines. Suppose home and university are separated by two lines. So answer is 2.\n\nThis seems to be the case.\n\nBut why does this work? Because the blocks are connected in such a way that moving through each separating line once is sufficient.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's no scenario where two lines are crossed in a way that the steps are less than the number of separating lines? Well, since each step can cross exactly one line, and each separating line must be crossed once, the minimal steps is the number of separating lines.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each a, b, c in the lines:\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but what about if the line is vertical or horizontal? No, the code handles that correctly.\n\nBut what about if a line is such that val1 is zero? But the problem statement says that neither home nor university lies on any road. So val1 and val2 can't be zero. So the code is safe.\n\nYes. Because the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So for each line, val1 and val2 are non-zero. Therefore, val1 * val2 can be positive or negative. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is simply the count of lines where the two points are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing each line:\n\nFirst line: a=0, b=1, c=0.\n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1.\n\nval2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1*-1 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: a=1, b=0, c=0.\n\nval1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1.\n\nval2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), univ (-1,-1).\n\nn=3.\n\nLines:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nval1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1.\n\nval2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: 0 1 0 → y=0.\n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → product negative → count +=1.\n\nThird line: 1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0.\n\nval1: 1 +1 -3 = -1.\n\nval2: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So no count. Total count is 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nSo the problem is actually much simpler than it seems. The key insight is that the minimal steps is the number of lines separating the two points. Which is determined by checking for each line whether the two points are on opposite sides.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nIn Python, read the input lines. The first two lines are the home and university coordinates. Then the third line is n, followed by n lines of a, b, c.\n\nBut note that in the input, the first line is x1 y1, the second line x2 y2, then n, then n lines.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each line:\n\n    a, b, c = ... \n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nSo this is the code.\n\nNow, let's test for possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, no. The problem says n is given as 1 ≤ n ≤ 300. Wait, the third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n is at least 1. So no need to handle n=0.\n\nAnother edge case: when a line is such that val1 is positive and val2 is positive. So no count.\n\nAnother case: when a line is such that val1 is positive and val2 is negative. So count +=1.\n\nAnother case: when a line is such that val1 is negative and val2 is positive. Also count +=1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, write the Python code.\n\nBut note that in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin. However, sometimes for multiple lines, it's better to read all input at once. But for this problem, the code can be written as:\n\nRead first line as x1, y1.\n\nRead second line as x2, y2.\n\nRead third line as n.\n\nThen read n lines, each as a, b, c.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, home (1, 0), university (-1, 0). Line is x=0. Then val1 is 1*1 + 0*0 +0 = 1. val2 is 1*(-1) + 0*0 +0 = -1. product is -1 → count 1. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are on same side of all lines. So output 0.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city with infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If two points (home and university) are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move between the blocks. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and university points.\n\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Check Separation**: For each road, determine if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. This is done by evaluating the sign of the linear equation for both points. If the signs differ, the points are separated by that road.\n3. **Count Separating Roads**: Count how many roads separate the home and university points. This count gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Sign Evaluation**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at the home and university coordinates.
