Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm. So the initial number is a candles. Each burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The key is to figure out how many times he can recycle the candles.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down. Initially, he has 4 candles. He burns them all, which takes 4 hours. Now he has 4 burned candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He lights those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burned ones. Again, he can make 2/2 = 1 new candle. That adds 1 hour. Now he has 1 burned candle. Since 1 is less than 2, he can't make any more. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Oh right, but wait, after making the 2 new ones, he uses them, which gives 2 hours. Then after that, he has 2 burned ones, which makes another one. So that's 1 more hour. Then after that, he has 1 burned candle left. So total is 4+2+1=7.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But each time you make new candles, you have to add the number of new ones to the total hours, and then collect the burned ones again.\n\nSo the algorithm could be something like:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\ncurrent_candles = a\nburned_candles = 0\n\nWhile current_candles > 0:\n    burn all current_candles, add to total_hours\n    burned_candles += current_candles\n    current_candles = 0\n    then, make new candles from burned_candles: new_candles = burned_candles // b\n    current_candles = new_candles\n    burned_candles = burned_candles % b\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Because each time you make new candles, you can use the burned ones. But after making new candles, those new ones will be burned again, adding to the burned count.\n\nBut how to model this? Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: every time you have some number of burned candles, you can make new ones. So the process is:\n\nStart with a candles. Each time you burn them, you get some burned candles. Then, you can make new ones from those.\n\nSo for example, let's take the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\nInitial step: burn 4 candles. total hours +=4. Now, burned_candles =4.\n\nThen, make 4//2 = 2 new candles. Now, burn those 2, total hours +=2. Now burned_candles is 2 (from the 2 new ones). Then, make 2//2=1 new candle. Burn it, total +=1. Now burned_candles is 1. Can't make any more. So total is 4+2+1=7.\n\nSo the process is to keep track of the burned candles, and each time you can make new candles from them. But when you make new candles, you have to burn them again, which adds to the total hours.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_burned = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nwhile current_candles > 0:\n\n    total_hours += current_candles\n\n    current_burned += current_candles\n\n    new_candles = current_burned // b\n\n    current_candles = new_candles\n\n    current_burned = current_burned % b\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because when you make new_candles, you have to burn them. So in the next iteration, current_candles is new_candles, which will be added to the total.\n\nWait, but the code would look like:\n\nInitially, current_candles is a.\n\nIn each iteration:\n\n- Burn all current_candles, add to total_hours.\n\n- Then, the current_burned is increased by current_candles.\n\n- Then, new_candles is current_burned // b.\n\n- current_candles becomes new_candles.\n\n- current_burned becomes current_burned % b.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly right. Because when you make new candles, you need to take the current_burned (the number of burned candles) and divide by b to get the new candles. But then, the new candles are burned in the next iteration, adding to the total hours.\n\nSo for example, in the first step, current_candles is 4. Burn",
