There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced binary tree. But here, the structure isn't fixed, and we need to maximize the number of games for the winner. However, the rule complicates things. \n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: the first game is between two players, say 1 vs 2. Suppose player 1 wins. Then, player 1 has 1 game played. The next game would be against player 3, who hasn't played yet. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So the maximum is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because in a normal knockout, you need 3 games (since 4 players, each round halves the number). But according to the sample, the answer is 2. Oh, because the way the matches are arranged. Let me think. If the tournament is arranged as two initial matches (like 1 vs 2 and 3 vs 4), then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner (player 1) has played 2 games. So that's the maximum possible. But why can't there be a way for the winner to play 3 games? Well, maybe because the rules prevent that. Let's see: For the winner to play 3 games, he must have played three matches. Each time, the opponent must have a number of games that's within one. Let's think about how that would work. \n\nFirst game: player 1 vs someone. Then, second game: he plays again. Then third game. But for each of these steps, the opponent must have a game count that's within one. So for the first game, the opponent has 0 games. For the second game, the opponent could have 0 or 1. Let's say after first game, player 1 has 1 game. Then, the next opponent could be someone who has 0 or 1. Suppose that player 1 beats someone else (so that player has 1 game). Then, the next opponent would have to have 1 or 0. But if the winner has already played two games, then the next opponent must have 1 or 2. But how can that happen? Let's think for n=4. Let's say player 1 plays against 2 (game 1, player 1 has 1 game). Then, player 1 plays against 3 (game 2, player 1 has 2 games). Now, player 3 has 1 game. Then, the next opponent would need to have 1 or 2 games. But there's only player 4 left. Player 4 hasn't played any games. So the difference is 2 (player 1 has 2, player 4 has 0). That's not allowed. So the third game can't happen. Hence, the maximum is 2. \n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum number of games the winner can have, given that the tournament is structured in such a way that each time the players meet, their game counts differ by at most one. \n\nSo how do we model this? It seems like a problem that can be modeled recursively. Let's think about the maximum number of games possible for a winner when there are n players. Let's denote this as f(n). \n\nThe idea is that the winner must play against opponents in such a way that each time, the opponent has played either the same number of games as the winner or one less. \n\nLet me think of the process. For the winner to have k games, he must have played k matches. Each time, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let's think of the structure as a tree. For example, the first match is with someone who has 0 games. Then, the second match is with someone who has 0 or 1 games. But for the winner to maximize his games, perhaps the optimal way is to arrange that each time he plays against an opponent who has played the same number of games as him. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a Fibonacci-like sequence. Let me think: suppose that to have a player reach k games, he must have defeated players in such a way that each step requires that the number of players required is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the structure of the tournament can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. This is because each time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less. This recursive structure leads us to use a binary search approach over the Fibonacci sequence to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The number of players required for a winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci sequence. For example, to play 1 game, 2 players are needed; to play 2 games, 3 players are needed; to play 3 games, 5 players are needed, and so on.\n2. **Binary Search**: Given the constraint that `n` can be as large as $10^{18}$, we use binary search to efficiently determine the maximum number of games the winner can play by checking against precomputed Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef max_games(n):\n    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while fib[-1] < n:\n        fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])\n    \n    # Now find the largest k such that fib[k+1] <= n\n    # The answer is the index k (starting from 0)\n    # Since the first few terms are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5...\n    # For example, fib[2] = 2 (for 1 game), fib[3]=3 (for 2 games), etc.\n    # So the maximum number of games is len(fib) - 2 if fib[-1] is <=n\n    # But let's do a binary search to find the maximum k where fib[k] <=n\n    low = 0\n    high = len(fib) - 1\n    ans = 0\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if fib[mid] <= n:\n            ans = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    # The answer is ans - 1, since the first term is 1 (game count 0?), but need to check\n    # Let's think: for fib[2] = 2, which is the minimum n for 1 game. So for n=2, answer is 1.\n    # The index in fib is 2, and the answer is 1. So the formula is (ans - 1)\n    # But wait, let's see:\n    # fib[0] = 1 (game count 0? No, because with 1 player, no games)\n    # fib[1] = 1 (same)\n    # fib[2] = 2 (for 1 game)\n    # fib[3] = 3 (for 2 games)\n    # fib[4] = 5 (for 3 games)\n    # So the number of games is (index - 1)\n    # So for ans being the index, the answer is (ans - 1)\n    # However, when n is exactly a Fibonacci number, it's (ans - 1)\n    # For example, n=3, ans is 3, answer is 2 (correct)\n    # For n=2, ans is 2, answer is 1 (correct)\n    # For n=5, ans is 4, answer is 3\n    # But what if n is not a Fibonacci number? For example, n=4. The largest fib <=4 is 3 (index 3), answer is 2 (correct)\n    return ans - 1\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: We generate Fibonacci numbers until the value exceeds the input `n`. This helps in determining the possible number of games the winner can play.\n2. **Binary Search**: Using binary search on the generated Fibonacci sequence, we find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n`. The index of this Fibonacci number gives us the maximum number of games the winner can play, adjusted by subtracting 1 to account for the initial indices in the sequence.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$ using logarithmic time complexity for both Fibonacci generation and binary search.",
