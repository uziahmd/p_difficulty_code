There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions.

The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$.

The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on a street with n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range from l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit under these constraints.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this? Well, since n, h, m are all up to 50, maybe a brute force approach is possible, but maybe not. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nEach house's height can be between 0 and h, but with some restrictions. However, the restrictions are about the maximum in a range. So for example, if there's a restriction that says the max in [1,3] is 2, then each of the houses 1, 2, 3 can't be higher than 2. Wait, no. Because the maximum of them must be <= x_i. So that means that each of the houses in that range must be <= x_i. Because if even one house is higher than x_i, then the maximum would be higher than x_i. So, for each restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i), every house in positions l_i to r_i must be <= x_i. Because if any of them is higher than x_i, then the maximum would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Suppose there's a restriction that says the maximum in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. So for that interval, all houses must be <= x_i. Because if any house in the interval is higher than x_i, then the maximum would be higher than x_i. Therefore, the restriction implies that all houses in that interval must be <= x_i. So each restriction adds constraints on individual houses. So for example, if a restriction is on [1,3], then each house 1, 2, 3 must be <= x_i. So perhaps, the problem reduces to for each house, finding the minimum upper bound across all restrictions that include that house. Then, the maximum height for each house is the minimum between h and all the x_i's from restrictions that cover that house. Wait, but maybe not. Because a restriction could be on a range that includes the house. For example, if there are two restrictions: one that says [1,2] must be <= 3, and another that says [2,3] must be <= 4. Then for house 2, it's covered by both. So the maximum allowed height for house 2 is min(3,4) = 3. But if there's a restriction that says [1,3] must be <= 5, then for each house in 1-3, their max is min(5, ... other restrictions that apply). So for each house, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of h and all x_i's from restrictions where the house is in [l_i, r_i]. Because each such restriction requires that the house's height is <= x_i. Therefore, the maximum height for each house is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include that house.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple restrictions that apply to the same house? For example, if there are two restrictions that apply to house 1: one says [1,1] must be <= 2, and another says [1,2] must be <= 3. Then the first restriction requires that house 1 is <= 2, and the second allows up to 3. So the overall maximum for house 1 is 2. So the minimum of all the x_i's from restrictions that cover that house. So yes, for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include that house. Because each restriction that includes the house imposes an upper bound on its height. So the maximum possible height for each house is the minimum of all those x_i's and h.\n\nWait, but what if there are no restrictions that include a particular house? Then the maximum height for that house is h. Because there's no restriction on it. So that's correct.\n\nSo, if I can compute for each house, the maximum allowed height (call it max_height[i]), then the optimal solution is to set each house to max_height[i], and the total profit is the sum of squares of those values.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because maybe there's a situation where a restriction applies to a range, but the maximum in that range is not the same as the min of the x_i's. For example, suppose there's a restriction that says [1,3] must have max <= 5. Then, each house in 1-3 can be up to 5. But if there's another restriction that says [1,1] must be <= 3, then house 1 can be at most 3. However, the other houses in 2-3 can be up to 5. So the maximum for each house is the minimum of the x_i's of all restrictions that include that house. So yes, that approach would work.\n\nBut then, why is the first example's answer 14? Let's check.\n\nIn the first example input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3. The restrictions are:\n\n1 1 1 → house 1 must be ≤1.\n\n2 2 3 → house 2 must be ≤3.\n\n3 3 2 → house 3 must be ≤2.\n\nSo for each house, the maximum allowed is 1, 3, 2. So the total profit is 1^2 +3^2 +2^2 = 1+9+4=14. Which matches the sample. So that seems to work.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2. Restrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → houses 2 and 3 must be ≤8.\n\n3 4 7 → houses 3 and 4 must be ≤7.\n\nSo for house 1: no restrictions, so max is 10.\n\nHouse 2: only the first restriction applies. So max is 8.\n\nHouse 3: both restrictions apply. So min(8,7) =7.\n\nHouse 4: only the second restriction applies. So 7.\n\nSo the heights are [10,8,7,7], sum of squares is 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. So the problem reduces to, for each house i, find the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include i. Then, the maximum height for i is min(h, that minimum). Then, the sum of squares of those values.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple restrictions that apply to a house. For example, if a house is covered by multiple restrictions. For example, if there are two restrictions on the same house: one says [1,1] must be ≤2, and another says [1,2] must be ≤3. Then, the house 1 is covered by both. The minimum x_i is 2. So the max height is 2.\n\nYes. So the approach is correct.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each house i (from 1 to n):\n\n- Find all restrictions where l_i ≤ i ≤ r_i.\n\n- Take the minimum x_i among those restrictions.\n\n- The max allowed height for house i is min(h, that minimum). If there are no such restrictions, then it's h.\n\nOnce we have that for each house, sum the squares.\n\nSo the problem is straightforward once we can compute for each house the minimum x_i of the restrictions that cover it.\n\nSo the steps for code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen for each of m restrictions, read l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nFor each house i (from 1 to n), collect all x_i's from restrictions where l_i <= i <= r_i. Then take the minimum of those x_i's. If there are no such restrictions, then the max height is h. Otherwise, the min between h and the minimum x_i.\n\nWait, but why the min between h and the minimum x_i? Because the x_i can be up to h. For example, if a restriction says that a house's max is 5, but h is 10. Then the house can be up to 5. But if the restriction says x_i is 15, but h is 10, then the house can be up to 10. So the maximum allowed for the house is min( min_restrictions, h )\n\nWait, but the problem says that each restriction's x_i is between 0 and h. Wait, according to the input description, x_i is between 0 and h. Because the input says \"0 ≤ x_i ≤ h\".\n\nSo the x_i's are already within 0 to h. Therefore, the min of the x_i's for the house's restrictions is already ≤ h. Therefore, the maximum allowed height for the house is the min of the x_i's (if there are any restrictions covering it), else h.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the house can be between 0 and h. So even if there are no restrictions, the maximum allowed is h. So for each house, the maximum allowed is min( (minimum x_i of all restrictions covering it), h ). But since x_i is already <= h, the min is just the minimum of the x_i's. Unless there are no restrictions covering it, in which case it's h.\n\nSo for example, if there are no restrictions covering a house, then the maximum is h.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize for each house i, max_h[i] = h.\n\nThen, for each restriction (l, r, x), for each position i in l to r, we take the minimum between current max_h[i] and x.\n\nSo, for each restriction, we iterate over all positions in l to r, and set max_h[i] = min( max_h[i], x )\n\nBecause for each house in l to r, this restriction adds a constraint that the house's height can't exceed x. So for each such house, the maximum allowed is the minimum between the previous value and x.\n\nYes. So that's a way to compute it.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nInitialize an array max_heights of size n, filled with h.\n\nFor each restriction in the m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = ... \n\n   for i in range(l-1, r):  # since Python is 0-based, but the problem uses 1-based\n\n       if max_heights[i] > x:\n\n           max_heights[i] = x\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute the sum of squares of each element in max_heights.\n\nWait, but why not? Because each restriction applies to the range l to r. So for each house in that range, the maximum allowed is min( previous value, x ). So this approach would correctly capture all the constraints.\n\nYes. Let's test this approach with the first example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1 → l=1, r=1, x=1. So for i=0 (since 1-1 is 0 in 0-based), max_heights[0] = min(3, 1) = 1.\n\nThen the second restriction is 2 2 3. So for i=1 (second house), set to min(3,3) → 3.\n\nThird restriction is 3 3 2 → i=2, set to min(3, 2) → 2.\n\nSo the array is [1,3,2]. Sum squares is 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → l=2, r=3. So for i=1 and 2 (0-based?), no. Wait, the code is using 0-based indexes. Let me think.\n\nOriginal code:\n\nfor i in range(l-1, r):\n\nWait, if l is 2 and r is 3 (in 1-based), then the indices are 2-1=1 to r=3 (but in Python, range is up to but not including the end. So range(1, 3) is 1 and 2. Which correspond to positions 2 and 3 in 1-based. So yes.\n\nSo for the first restriction (2,3,8):\n\nfor i from 1 to 2 (inclusive) → indexes 1 and 2 (0-based) → which are houses 2 and 3 (1-based). So initial max_heights is [10, 10, 10, 10].\n\nAfter processing the first restriction, the max_heights becomes [10, 8, 8, 10].\n\nThen the second restriction is 3-4 (1-based), which is l=3, r=4. So in 0-based, l-1=2, r=4. So range(2,4) is 2 and 3 (indices). So for these indices, set their max_heights to min(current, 7). So:\n\nindex 2 (house 3) was 8 → min(8,7)=7.\n\nindex 3 (house 4) was 10 → min(10,7)=7.\n\nSo the max_heights array is [10,8,7,7]. Sum of squares is 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize max_heights = [h] * n.\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions:\n\n   read l, r, x.\n\n   for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n       if max_heights[i] > x:\n\n           max_heights[i] = x\n\nThen compute sum of squares.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping restrictions? For example, if a restriction is applied to a range that includes multiple houses, and then another restriction that applies to a subset. But the code handles that because each time, it checks for the current min.\n\nYes. So this approach is correct.\n\nNow, what about cases where there are multiple restrictions on the same house. For example, a house is in multiple ranges. The code will process each restriction, and for each, set the max_heights[i] to the minimum between current value and x. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, h=5, m=0. Then the max_heights is [5], sum is 25.\n\nEdge case 2: n=1, h=5, m=1, restriction l=1, r=1, x=3. So the max is 3, sum 9.\n\nAnother case: overlapping ranges. For example, n=2, h=5, m=2. Restriction 1: [1,2] x=3. Restriction 2: [1,1] x=4. So for house 1, the first restriction sets it to 3, then the second restriction (x=4) doesn't change it. So house 1 is 3. House 2 is 3. So sum is 3² + 3² = 18.\n\nAnother case: a restriction that covers a range and another that covers a larger range. For example, n=3, h=5. Restriction 1: [1,3] x=4. Restriction 2: [2,2] x=3. So for house 1, it's 4. House 2 is min(4,3) =3. House 3 is 4. So sum is 4² +3² +4² = 16 +9 +16 = 41.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nRead input: the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the user provided examples where the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the input is given via standard input. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for example, the first input is:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nBut that's probably for testing purposes. The actual code should read from stdin. So for example, the code should read the first line as n, h, m, then m lines of l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. For example, in Python, using input().split() etc.\n\nBut the code needs to process multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input and output, the first example has input as a single case, and the output is a single value. But in the sample input, the input is given as a list of two elements, but perhaps that's for the purpose of the example. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, not from a list. So the sample input given in the problem is perhaps for the purpose of the example, but the actual code should read from stdin.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead n, h, m from the first line.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmax_heights = [h] * n.\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor height in max_heights:\n\n    sum += height ** 2\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, but in Python, the range is exclusive of the end. So for example, if l=1, r=3 (1-based), then the code would process l-1=0 to r=3 → range(0,3) → indexes 0,1,2 → which are positions 1,2,3 in 1-based. So that's correct.\n\nYes. So for example, if l=1 and r=3, then the code loops from 0 to 2 inclusive (since range(0,3) is 0,1,2).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me test the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nProcessing:\n\nmax_heights starts as [3,3,3]\n\nFirst restriction: l=1, r=1 → range(0,1) → i=0. Set to min(3,1) → 1. Now [1,3,3]\n\nSecond restriction: l=2, r=2 → range(1,2) → i=1. Set to min(3,3) → 3. No change. [1,3,3]\n\nThird restriction: l=3, r=3 → range(2,3) → i=2. Set to min(3,2) → 2. Now [1,3,2]. Sum is 1 +9 +4=14. Correct.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nInitial max_heights is [10,10,10,10]\n\nFirst restriction l=2, r=3 → range(1,3) → indexes 1 and 2. Set to 8. Now [10,8,8,10]\n\nSecond restriction l=3, r=4 → range(2,4) → indexes 2 and 3. Set to 7. So indexes 2 becomes min(8,7)=7. index 3 becomes min(10,7)=7. So array is [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 + 64 +49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=0. Output is 25.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, h=5. Restrictions:\n\n1 2 3\n\n1 1 4.\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitially [5,5]\n\nFirst restriction: l=1, r=2 → indexes 0 and 1. Set to 3. Now [3,3].\n\nSecond restriction: l=1, r=1 → index 0. Set to min(3,4) → remains 3. So sum is 3² +3² = 18.\n\nAnother case where a restriction is on a larger range, but another on a smaller. For example, n=3, h=5, m=2. Restrictions:\n\n1 3 4 → so all houses are set to 4.\n\nThen, restriction 2 2 3 → house 2 is set to 3. So the array is [4,3,4]. Sum is 16 +9 +16 = 41.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when a restriction's x_i is larger than h? Well, according to the problem statement, x_i is between 0 and h. So the code doesn't have to handle that. Because the input says that x_i is between 0 and h. So the code can safely assume that x_i is <= h. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is as described above.\n\nNow, write the Python code.\n\nRead n, h, m from input. Then read m lines. For each line, process l, r, x. Then for each i in l-1 to r-1 (wait, no. Wait, the code for the loop is:\n\nfor i in range(l-1, r):\n\nWait, the original code for the loop is:\n\nfor i in range(l-1, r):\n\nBut in Python, range is up to but not including the end. So if the original r is the end (inclusive), then for example, if the restriction is l=1, r=3 (1-based), then the code should process indexes 0, 1, 2 (i.e., 1-based 1,2,3). So the code should be range(l-1, r) → because for l=1, r=3, the range is from 0 to 3 (exclusive), which is 0,1,2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmax_heights = [h] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l-1, r):\n\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor height in max_heights:\n\n    sum += height * height\n\nprint(sum)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this code against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nOutput is 14. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput is 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=0. Output is 25.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, h=5, restrictions 1 2 3, then 1 1 4. Output is 3² +3² = 18.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a maximum value h, and each restriction imposes a constraint on the maximum height of houses within a specific range.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing an array `max_heights` where each element is set to the maximum allowed height `h`. This array will store the maximum allowable height for each house after considering all restrictions.\n2. **Apply Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the `max_heights` array to ensure that the maximum height in the specified range does not exceed the given restriction value. This involves iterating over the range specified by each restriction and adjusting the maximum allowable height for each house in that range.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the heights stored in the `max_heights` array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmax_heights = [h] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l-1, r):\n        if max_heights[i] > x:\n            max_heights[i] = x\n\ntotal = 0\nfor height in max_heights:\n    total += height * height\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is parsed to get the number of spots `n`, the maximum height `h`, and the number of restrictions `m`.\n2. **Initialization of Heights**: An array `max_heights` is initialized with each element set to `h`, representing the maximum height allowed for each house before considering any restrictions.\n3. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, the range `[l, r]` is processed. For each house in this range, the maximum allowable height is updated to the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height `x`.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: The total profit is calculated by summing the squares of the values in the `max_heights` array, which gives the maximum possible profit under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are applied efficiently, and the solution is computed in a straightforward manner, leveraging the constraints that `n`, `h`, and `m` are all up to 50, making the solution both efficient and easy to understand.",
