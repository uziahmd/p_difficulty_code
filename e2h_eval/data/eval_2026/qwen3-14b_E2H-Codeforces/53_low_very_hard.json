Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this problem. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and see which ones appear more than once. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me think: the maximum possible length of such a substring is up to 50, because if the string is of length N, then the maximum possible length where a substring can appear twice is floor(N/2). Wait, not exactly. For example, if the string is 'aaaaa', then the maximum is 4 (since 'aaaa' appears twice, overlapping).\n\nSo the approach could be to check for all possible lengths starting from the maximum possible down to 1, and for each length, check if there's a substring of that length that occurs at least twice. Once we find the maximum such length, we return it.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. For the given string, generate all possible substrings of length L, for varying L.\n2. Check if any of these substrings occurs at least twice.\n3. Find the maximum L for which this is true.\n\nBut how to efficiently implement this?\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, the input is a single string. Wait, looking back at the example input: the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, the sample input shows ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but the problem says that the input is a string. Oh, maybe that's a mistake in the example. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: the first input line contains the string. So the example input is probably not a list, but perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. For example, maybe the actual input is a single string, like 'abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz' are different test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. So the example input is probably a list of test cases, but the actual input is one string.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\nInput: first input line contains the string. So for example, for the first sample input, the input is 'abcd', and output is 0. For 'ababa', output is 3, etc.\n\nSo the code needs to read a single string from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the example given is perhaps showing multiple test cases, but the actual code will process one string at a time.\n\nSo now, the code needs to process one string, and find the maximum length of a substring that occurs at least twice.\n\nSo, how to proceed.\n\nThe brute-force approach would be:\n\nFor each possible length L, starting from the maximum possible (which is len(s) // 2, but maybe even higher? Wait, no. For example, if the string is of length 2, the maximum possible L is 1. Because a substring of length 2 can't occur twice. So the maximum possible L is floor(len(s)/2). Wait, for len(s) = 5, the maximum possible L is 2. Because for example, in 'aaaaa', the substring 'aa' occurs 4 times. But for L=3, the substring 'aaa' occurs 3 times. So for len(s) = 5, the maximum possible L is 3? Wait, no. Because the length of the substring can be up to len(s) - 1. For example, if the string is 'aaaaa', then the substring of length 4 occurs twice. So for len(s) = 5, the maximum L is 4, but that's only possible if the substring occurs twice. So the maximum possible L to check is len(s) - 1. However, for that L, there's only one possible substring (the entire string except one character), but it can't be present twice. So for example, for len(s) = 5, the maximum L that could have two occurrences is 2. Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nFor a string of length N, the maximum possible L for which there are two occurrences is N-1. But that would require that the substring of length N-1 appears twice. Which is impossible unless the string is something like 'aaaaa', where the substring of length 4 is 'aaaa' and occurs twice. But how? The first occurrence is positions 0-3, the second is 1-4. So yes, overlapping. So for N=5, L=4 is possible. So the maximum possible L to check is N-1. But for some strings, that's possible, for others not.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate",
