Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to create an N x N board where the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during their traversal according to the given rules. If it's not possible, we return -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the movement rules and how the fees are calculated. \n\nSo the process is: starting from cell 1 (which is already visited), each move chooses the next unvisited cell with the smallest number that's reachable in one move. If there are no such cells, the figure teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, paying a fee of 1 vun. This repeats until all cells are visited.\n\nThe goal is to arrange the numbers on the board such that the rook's total fees are less than the queen's.\n\nLet me think about how the rook and queen move. The rook moves in straight lines (same row or column), while the queen can move any direction (like a bishop and rook combined). So the queen has more possible moves. However, the order in which cells are visited depends on the numbers in them. \n\nThe key is to arrange the numbers so that the rook's path requires fewer teleportations than the queen's. But how?\n\nLet me look at the example given for N=4. The output is a specific arrangement where the rook pays 1 vun and the queen pays 2. How does that happen?\n\nIn that example, the queen's path had two teleportations. The rook's path had one. So the arrangement must be such that the queen gets stuck more often, requiring more teleportations. \n\nHmm. So perhaps we can design a numbering where the queen's movement is constrained, leading to more teleportations. For the rook, maybe the path allows it to reach the next minimal numbers without teleporting as much.\n\nBut how to construct such a board? Let's think about the general approach.\n\nFirst, note that for N=1, the answer is -1 because both pay zero. For N=2, maybe there's no solution? Or maybe there is. But the sample shows that for N=4, there is a solution.\n\nThe problem says that for N=1, output is -1. For other N, perhaps we can find a way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the numbering. The idea is to arrange the numbers so that the rook's movement can reach the next minimal numbers in its path, while the queen might have to teleport more.\n\nWait, but how do the movement patterns differ? For example, the rook can only move along rows and columns. The queen can move diagonally as well. So, when the queen has more options, but the numbers are arranged in such a way that the minimal next number is not reachable via queen's movement, but is reachable via rook's movement. Or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe arrange the numbers in such a way that the queen's path requires more teleportations than the rook's. How?\n\nLet me think of a way to create a numbering where the queen's path has more teleport steps. For example, if the queen's movement is blocked by already visited cells, but the rook's movement is not.\n\nBut how to structure that?\n\nAlternatively, think about the order in which cells are visited. The path is determined by the numbers. So, the first step is from 1. The next step is the minimal number reachable from 1 via the piece's movement. Then from there, again the minimal reachable number, etc.\n\nSo, for the rook and queen, their paths will be different based on their movement capabilities.\n\nTo make the rook's fee less than the queen's, we need the rook's path to have fewer teleportations. So, perhaps arrange the numbers such that the rook can reach the next minimal numbers in its path more often, while the queen cannot.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn idea: arrange the numbers so that the rook can traverse in a way that covers all cells without needing to teleport except once, while the queen needs to teleport more.\n\nBut how to design such a numbering?\n\nLooking at the sample for N=4. The board is:\n\n4 3 6 12\n\n7 5 9 15\n\n14 1 11 10\n\n13 8 16 2\n\nLet me see the path for the rook. Starting at 1 (which is at position (3,2) assuming rows and columns start at 1?), then the next steps are:\n\nAfter 1, the rook can move along row or column. The next minimal number would be 3 (in cell (1,2)), but wait, maybe not. Let me check the actual positions.\n\nWait the sample output is:\n\nRow 1: 4 3 6 12 \n\nRow 2: 7 5 9 15 \n\nRow 3: 14 1 11 10 \n\nRow 4: 13 8 16 2 \n\nSo the position of 1 is (3,2). The next steps for the rook would be looking for the minimal unvisited number reachable via same row or column.\n\nAt the start, the rook is at 1. The unvisited cells are all except 1. The minimal number is 2, but is 2 reachable from 1? Let's see: 2 is at (4,4). The rook can only move along row 3 or column 2. The cell (4,4) is not in row 3 or column 2. So the rook can't reach 2 directly. So the next step is to look for the minimal number reachable from 1 via rook's movement. Let's see:\n\nIn row 3: the numbers are 14, 1, 11, 10. The other numbers in row 3 are 14, 11, 10. But 1 is already visited. So the next possible numbers in row 3 are 14, 11, 10. In column 2, the numbers are 3 (row 1), 5 (row 2), 1 (row 3), 8 (row 4). So the unvisited ones are 3,5,8. The minimal among these is 3. So the rook moves to 3 (cell (1,2)).\n\nThen from 3 (row 1, column 2), the rook can move along row 1 or column 2. The unvisited numbers in row 1 are 4, 6, 12. But 4 is in row 1, column 1. Column 2 has 5, 8 (since 3 is now visited). The minimal unvisited number is 4 (row 1, column 1)? Wait, but the rook can move along row 1 (so cell (1,1) is 4, which is unvisited). So the next minimal is 4? But the current minimal unvisited is 2, but that's not reachable. So the next step is to choose between the reachable ones. The minimal is 4, then 3 is already visited. Wait, the rook is at 3. The unvisited numbers are 2,4,5,6,7, etc. But the reachable ones are those in same row (row 1) or column (column 2).\n\nIn row 1, the unvisited numbers are 4 (cell (1,1)), 6 (cell (1,3)), 12 (cell (1,4)). In column 2, the unvisited numbers are 5 (row 2, column 2), 8 (row 4, column 2). The minimal among these is 4, 5, 6, etc. The smallest is 4. So the rook moves to 4 (cell (1,1)).\n\nThen, from 4 (row 1, column 1), the rook can move along row 1 or column 1. The unvisited numbers in row 1 are 6 and 12. In column 1, the numbers are 7 (row 2, column 1), 14 (row 3, column 1), 13 (row 4, column 1). The minimal among these is 6 (row 1, column 3) and 7 (row 2, column 1). So the minimal is 6. So the rook moves to 6 (row 1, column 3). Then from there, the next step would be to check reachable cells. Row 1 has 12, column 3 has 9 (row 2, column 3) and 11 (row 3, column 3). The minimal unvisited is 5? Wait, no. Let me think again. The current cell is 6 (row 1, column 3). The unvisited numbers include 2,5,7, etc. But the reachable cells are in row 1 (12) and column 3 (cells (2,3)=9, (3,3)=11, (4,3)=16). So the minimal among these is 5? No, 5 is not in row 1 or column 3. So the reachable numbers are 12, 9, 11, 16. The minimal is 9. So the rook moves to 9 (row 2, column 3). \n\nFrom there, the rook can move along row 2 or column 3. Row 2 has 7 (cell (2,1)), 5 (cell (2,2)), 9 (visited), 15 (cell (2,4)). Column 3 has 6 (visited), 9 (visited), 11 (cell (3,3)), 16 (cell (4,3)). The unvisited numbers in row 2 are 7,5,15. The minimal is 5. So the rook moves to 5 (row 2, column 2). \n\nNow, from 5 (row 2, column 2), the rook can move along row 2 (cells 7, 15) or column 2 (cells 8 (row 4, column 2)). The minimal unvisited number is 7 (row 2, column 1) or 8. Which is smaller? 7 is smaller. So the rook moves to 7 (row 2, column 1). \n\nThen from 7 (row 2, column 1), the rook can move along row 2 (cells 5 (visited), 9 (visited), 15) or column 1 (cells 4 (visited), 14 (row 3, column 1), 13 (row 4, column 1)). The unvisited numbers are 15, 14, 13. The minimal is 13? No, 14 is 14, 13 is 13. So the minimal is 13. But can the rook reach 13? It's in column 1 (row 4). So yes. So the rook moves to 13 (row 4, column 1). \n\nNow, from 13 (row 4, column 1), the rook can move along row 4 (cells 8, 16, 2) or column 1 (cells 4 (visited), 7 (visited), 14 (row 3, column 1)). The unvisited numbers are 8, 16, 2, 14. The minimal is 2 (cell (4,4))? But is that reachable? The rook can move along row 4. So yes. So the next step is 2. But wait, the minimal unvisited number is 2. But in the sample explanation, the rook's path after 13 is to go to 2. Then after that, the next steps would be... Well, after visiting 2, the rook would check for reachable cells. But 2 is in row 4, column 4. The unvisited cells are 8, 16, 14, etc. So the rook can move along row 4 or column 4. Row 4 has 8, 16, and 2 (visited). Column 4 has 12 (visited), 15 (row 2), 10 (row 3), 2 (visited). So the reachable cells are 8 (row 4, column 2), 15 (row 2, column 4), 10 (row 3, column 4). The minimal among these is 8. So the rook moves to 8 (row 4, column 2). \n\nThen from 8 (row 4, column 2), the rook can move along row 4 (cells 16, 2 (visited)) or column 2 (cells 3 (visited), 5 (visited), 1 (visited), 8 (current cell)). So the reachable cells are 16 (row 4, column 3?) Wait, row 4 has cells 13 (col 1), 8 (col 2), 16 (col 3), 2 (col 4). So row 4's unvisited cells are 16 (col 3) and 2 (already visited). So the rook can move to 16 (col 3). The minimal is 16. So it moves there. Then from 16, the rook can move along row 4 (only 16 and 2, but 2 is visited) or column 3. Column 3 has 6 (visited), 9 (visited), 11 (row 3, col 3), 16 (current). So unvisited cells in column 3 are 11. So the rook moves to 11 (row 3, column 3). \n\nFrom there, the rook can move along row 3 (cells 14, 1 (visited), 11 (current), 10) or column 3 (cells 6 (visited), 9 (visited), 11 (current), 16 (visited)). The unvisited numbers are 14, 10. The minimal is 10. So the rook moves to 10 (row 3, column 4). From there, row 3 has 14 (col 1), 1 (visited), 11 (visited), 10 (current). Column 4 has 12 (visited), 15 (row 2, col 4), 10 (current), 2 (visited). So the reachable cells are 15 (row 2, col 4) and 14 (row 3, col 1). The minimal is 14. So the rook moves to 14 (row 3, col 1). \n\nNow, from 14 (row 3, col 1), the rook can move along row 3 (cells 14, 1 (visited), 11 (visited), 10 (visited)) or column 1 (cells 4 (visited), 7 (visited), 14 (current), 13 (visited)). So no new cells. Therefore, the rook must teleport to the next minimal unvisited cell. The unvisited cells are 15 and 16? Wait, let's check which cells are visited. \n\nAt this point, the rook has visited 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 5, 7, 13, 2, 8, 16, 11, 10, 14. The remaining unvisited cells are 15 and maybe others? Let me recount. The numbers from 1 to 16. Let's see: \n\nVisited: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16. Missing are 12, 15. \n\nSo the next step is to teleport to the minimal unvisited, which is 12. But 12 is in row 1, column 4. So the rook teleports there, paying 1 vun. Then from 12, the rook can move along row 1 (cells 4 (visited), 3 (visited), 6 (visited), 12 (current)), or column 4 (cells 12 (current), 15 (row 2, column 4), 10 (visited), 2 (visited)). So the reachable cells are 15. So the rook moves to 15 (row 2, column 4). Then from there, the rook can move along row 2 (cells 7 (visited), 5 (visited), 9 (visited), 15 (current)) or column 4 (cells 12 (visited), 15 (current), 10 (visited), 2 (visited)). So no new cells. So the rook teleports again? Wait, but after moving to 15, the only unvisited cell is 12 and 15? No, after teleporting to 12, then moving to 15, then all cells are visited except 15? Wait, no. After teleporting to 12, the unvisited cells were 12 and 15. Once 12 is visited, then the next step is moving to 15. Once 15 is visited, all are done. So the rook pays 1 vun (when teleporting from 14 to 12). \n\nSo the total for the rook is 1 vun. \n\nFor the queen, the example says she pays 2. So the idea is that the queen's path requires two teleportations. \n\nSo how to design such a numbering? The sample seems to have a specific pattern. Maybe we can find a way to arrange numbers in a spiral or some pattern that allows the rook to have more reachable steps than the queen.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following approach: arrange the numbers such that the rook's path is a single connected path that covers all cells, requiring only one teleportation, while the queen's path requires more. But how?\n\nAnother thought: for the rook, the movement is restricted to rows and columns. So, if the numbers are arranged in such a way that the rook can always reach the next minimal number in the same row or column. For example, arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can move along rows and columns, visiting numbers in order, but the queen might have to teleport more because the next minimal number is not reachable via queen's movement.\n\nBut how to arrange that?\n\nLet me think about a grid where the numbers are arranged in a snake-like pattern, but with certain properties. For example, arrange the numbers so that each row is filled in order, but the rows are connected in a way that allows the rook to move between them. But perhaps that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the rook's path as moving through rows and columns, visiting numbers in increasing order, but ensuring that the queen's path has more steps where the next number is not reachable via queen's movement.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the example again. The queen's path starts at 1, then goes to 3 (same as rook?), but then perhaps the queen can reach 2 directly. Wait, the queen can move diagonally. Let me check the positions.\n\nIn the sample, 1 is at (3,2). The number 2 is at (4,4). The queen can move diagonally from (3,2) to (4,3) to (4,4), but since the queen can move any number of squares, she can go directly from (3,2) to (4,4) if there's a diagonal path. Wait, the difference in row and column is 1 and 2. So (3,2) to (4,4) is a diagonal of 1 row and 2 columns, which is not a diagonal. So the queen cannot move directly from (3,2) to (4,4). So the queen can't reach 2 from 1. So the queen would have to look for the next minimal number reachable. \n\nBut perhaps the queen's movement allows her to reach more cells than the rook, but in the sample arrangement, the queen's path ends up requiring more teleportations.\n\nSo the key is to arrange the numbers so that the queen's path has more instances where the next minimal number is not reachable via queen's movement, thus requiring teleportations, while the rook's path has fewer such instances.\n\nBut how to construct such a grid?\n\nAn alternative approach is to find a way to arrange the numbers such that the rook's path is a single continuous path (with minimal teleportations) and the queen's path has more breaks.\n\nOne possible way is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook can traverse the entire grid in a snake-like pattern, where each next number is in the same row or column. For example, arrange the numbers in a way that each row is filled left to right, and then the next row is filled right to left, etc. However, the queen can move diagonally and thus may have more options, but perhaps the arrangement can be such that the queen's path requires more teleportations.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, think about the following pattern: place the numbers in such a way that the rook can move in a spiral, but the queen's movement is blocked. However, this is vague.\n\nAnother idea: the rook's path can be designed to have all numbers in the same row or column as the previous step. For example, arrange the numbers in a way that they form a single row/column path. For example, the first row is 1, 2, 3, ..., then the second row is N^2, N^2-1, ... but this may not work for the queen.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following approach for constructing the board:\n\n- Place the number 1 in the center (or some position).\n- Then arrange the numbers in a way that each next number is adjacent (in rook's movement) to the previous one. This would allow the rook to move without teleporting except once. However, the queen may have more options, but perhaps the arrangement can be such that the queen's path requires teleporting more.\n\nBut how to arrange such a sequence?\n\nThis seems similar to creating a Hamiltonian path for the rook's movement. For example, the rook can move through the grid in a way that each step is to a new cell in the same row or column. Such a path exists for any N ≥ 2. For example, you can traverse the grid row by row, left to right, and then when you reach the end of a row, move to the next row's first cell (same column). However, this would require that the next number is in the same column as the previous. For example, if you have row 1 filled with 1,2,3,..., then row 2 filled with N+1, N+2, ..., then the rook can move from 3 (end of row 1) to N+1 (start of row 2) via column 3. But this would require that N+1 is in column 3. Which would only be the case if the rows are filled in a certain way. \n\nWait, maybe arranging the numbers in a row-wise manner. For example, for N=4:\n\nRow 1: 1 2 3 4\n\nRow 2: 8 7 6 5\n\nRow 3: 9 10 11 12 \n\nRow 4: 16 15 14 13 \n\nBut then, the rook can move from 4 (row 1, column 4) to 5 (row 2, column 4) via column 4. Then from 5 to 6 (row 2, column 3), then to 7, then to 8 (row 2, column 1). Then from 8 to 9 (row 3, column 1). And so on. This would form a continuous path for the rook, requiring no teleportations. However, the queen would have even more options, but maybe the queen's path would also have no teleportations. Thus, this would not satisfy the condition that the rook's fees are strictly less than the queen's. So this approach may not work.\n\nSo, this suggests that the way the numbers are ordered is crucial. Perhaps we need a specific arrangement where the queen's path requires more teleportations.\n\nLet me think of the sample again. The sample for N=4 has the number 1 in the middle of the grid. The numbers are arranged in a way that creates a path that requires the rook to teleport once, while the queen has to teleport twice. \n\nHow was that achieved? Maybe by placing the numbers such that the queen's path has more steps where the next minimal number is not reachable via queen's movement, but the rook's path can reach it.\n\nPerhaps the key is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can reach the next minimal number in its path, but the queen cannot. For example, arrange the numbers such that the next minimal number is in the same row or column as the current position for the rook, but not in the same row, column, or diagonal for the queen.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nMaybe arrange the numbers in such a way that the next minimal number is in the same row or column as the current position, but not in the same diagonal. However, this seems difficult to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following approach: create a numbering where the rook's path is a single path that covers all cells, but the queen's path is split into multiple segments requiring teleportations. \n\nBut how to construct such a numbering?\n\nAnother idea: arrange the numbers so that the queen's path requires teleporting when the next minimal number is not in the same row, column, or diagonal. For example, if the numbers are arranged in a way that the next minimal number is in a different row, column, and diagonal from the current position. But the rook can reach it via row or column.\n\nFor example, suppose the current position is at (i,j), and the next minimal number is at (i, k) (same row) or (k, j) (same column). Then the rook can reach it, but the queen can't (if it's not in the same row, column, or diagonal). But how to ensure that?\n\nThis seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, think of the following pattern: place the numbers in a way that the rook can always move to the next number in the same row or column, but the queen can't. For example, arrange the numbers in a row-wise order, but with the next number in the same row or column. However, this would allow the queen to reach it as well. \n\nThis line of thinking isn't yielding progress. Maybe I should think of the problem differently. \n\nWhat is the minimal possible number of teleportations for the rook and queen? How can we ensure that the rook's is less?\n\nIn the sample, the rook has 1 teleportation, and the queen has 2. So, the idea is to create a scenario where the queen's path has more teleportations. \n\nWhat if we can arrange the numbers such that the queen has to teleport more times than the rook? How?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nConstruct the board such that the queen's path requires teleporting whenever possible, but the rook's path can avoid teleporting except once. \n\nFor example, arrange the numbers in a way that the queen's movement is limited, but the rook's is not. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the queen's movement is more flexible, so she can reach more cells. However, if the next minimal number is not reachable by the queen, she has to teleport. Whereas the rook may be able to reach it. \n\nSo, the idea is to arrange the numbers such that the next minimal number after each step is reachable by the rook but not by the queen. \n\nThis would mean that the rook can proceed without teleporting, while the queen has to teleport. \n\nBut how to arrange such numbers?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the next number is in the same row or column as the current position, but not in the same diagonal. For example, if the current position is (i,j), and the next number is (i, k) where k != j ± (some value). \n\nBut how to ensure that for all steps?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, maybe it's possible to create such a numbering for larger N.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the rook's path as being a single path where each next number is in the same row or column as the current. For example, arrange the numbers in a spiral-like path that moves row-wise and column-wise. \n\nOnce such a path is created, the rook would not need to teleport except possibly once. For example, if the last step of the path requires teleporting to the last unvisited cell. \n\nMeanwhile, the queen's path could have more steps where the next number is not reachable via queen's movement, leading to more teleportations. \n\nSo, how to create such a path?\n\nLet me think of a way to generate a sequence of numbers where each consecutive number is in the same row or column as the previous one. This is similar to creating a Hamiltonian path for the rook. \n\nFor example, for a grid of size N x N, arrange the numbers in a way that each step moves to the same row or column. One possible way is to fill the grid row-wise, but alternate the direction of the rows. For example:\n\nRow 1: 1 2 3 4 \n\nRow 2: 8 7 6 5 \n\nRow 3: 9 10 11 12 \n\nRow 4: 16 15 14 13 \n\nThis way, the rook can move from the end of row 1 (4) to the end of row 2 (5) via column 4. Then from 5 to 6 (same row), then to 7, then to 8 (same column as 4?), then to 9 (same column as 8, row 3). This seems to form a continuous path. \n\nIf this is the case, then the rook would not need to teleport at all. However, the queen would have a path that also doesn't require teleporting. Hence, this would not help us achieve the desired result. \n\nBut what if we modify this arrangement to have some points where the queen cannot reach the next number, but the rook can?\n\nFor example, suppose the next number is in the same row or column but not in the same diagonal. Let's say the current position is (i,j) and the next number is in the same row but not in the same diagonal. Then, the queen can move to it via the row, so she would not need to teleport. So this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, what if the next number is in the same column but not in the same diagonal? Same thing. \n\nSo this approach may not work. \n\nLet me think of the sample again. The sample has the number 1 at (3,2). The next number for the rook is 3 (at (1,2)), which is in the same column. The queen can move from (3,2) to (1,2) via column, so she can reach it. So why does the queen have to teleport more? \n\nAh, because in the queen's path, the next minimal number may not be reachable. For example, after visiting 1, the queen's next move would be to find the minimal unvisited number that is reachable. Let's imagine the queen's path for the sample.\n\nQueen starts at 1 (3,2). The unvisited numbers are 2-16. The minimal is 2, but is it reachable? As discussed earlier, it's not. So the queen looks for the next minimal reachable number. What's the minimal reachable number from (3,2) via queen's movement?\n\nReachable cells are those in same row, same column, or diagonals. \n\nRow 3: cells with numbers 14, 1, 11, 10. Unvisited are 14, 11, 10.\n\nColumn 2: cells with 3,5,1,8. Unvisited are 3,5,8.\n\nDiagonals: from (3,2), the diagonals are cells where row - column = 3-2 = 1, or row + column = 5. \n\nSo for row - column = 1: cells (i,j) where i-j=1. These are (1,0) invalid, (2,1), (3,2), (4,3). So (2,1) is 7, (4,3) is 16. \n\nFor row + column = 5: (i,j) where i + j =5. These are (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1). (1,4) is 12, (2,3) is 9, (4,1) is 13. \n\nSo the unvisited cells reachable from (3,2) are:\n\nRow 3: 14, 11, 10.\n\nColumn 2: 3,5,8.\n\nDiagonals: 7, 16, 12, 9, 13.\n\nThe minimal among these is 3 (from column 2). So the queen moves to 3 (same as the rook). Then from there, the queen can move to 2? Let's see. \n\nAt position (1,2), the queen can move to any cell in same row, column, or diagonal. The minimal unvisited number is 2 (cell (4,4)), but is it reachable? \n\nRow 1: cells 4, 6, 12. Column 2: 5, 8, 1 (visited). Diagonals: for (1,2), row - column = -1. So cells where i-j = -1 are (2,3), (3,4), etc. Also, row + column = 3. \n\nSo, for cell (4,4), the difference is 4-4=0. Not sure. To check if (1,2) can reach (4,4) via queen's move: the difference in rows is 3, columns is 2. Since 3 != 2, it's not a diagonal. So the queen cannot move directly from (1,2) to (4,4). Hence, the next minimal number for the queen is not reachable. So she has to look for the next minimal reachable number. \n\nThe unvisited numbers are 2,4,5,6,7, etc. The reachable numbers from (1,2) are:\n\nRow 1: 4, 6, 12.\n\nColumn 2: 5, 8.\n\nDiagonals: (i-j) = -1: cells like (2,3) (which is 9), (3,4) (10). Also, row + column = 3: (1,2) itself, (2,1) (7), (0,3) invalid. \n\nSo the reachable unvisited numbers are 4, 6, 12, 5, 8, 9, 10, 7. The minimal is 4. So the queen moves to 4. Then from there, she can move to 2? Let's see. \n\nAt (1,1), the queen can move to any cell in row 1, column 1, or diagonals. The unvisited numbers include 2,5,6,7, etc. The minimal is 2, but is it reachable? \n\nRow 1: 6, 12. Column 1: 7, 14, 13. Diagonals: row - column = 0 (for (1,1)), so cells (i,j) where i=j. These include (2,2)=5, (3,3)=11, (4,4)=2. So the queen can move from (1,1) to (4,4) via diagonal? Because (1,1) to (4,4) is a diagonal of length 3. Yes. So the queen can reach 2 from (1,1) via diagonal. So she moves to 2. \n\nBut in the sample explanation, the queen's path includes teleporting once to 2. Wait, but according to this, the queen can reach 2 from (1,1) directly. So why does the queen pay a fee in the sample?\n\nAh, perhaps my analysis is incorrect. Let me recheck.\n\nWhen the queen is at (1,1), the unvisited numbers include 2, which is at (4,4). The queen can move directly to (4,4) because it's on the diagonal (i=j). So the queen would move to 2, not needing to teleport. \n\nBut in the sample explanation, the queen's path has a teleportation step. So why is that?\n\nLooking back at the sample explanation:\n\nQueen's path is 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5 → ... \n\nWait, after visiting 4 (cell (1,1)), the next step is to go to 2 (cell (4,4)), which is reachable via queen's movement. So the queen moves there. Then from 2, the next minimal unvisited number is 5. Is 5 reachable from",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an N x N board where a rook pays strictly fewer vuns than a queen during their traversal based on specific movement rules.
