Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x, but each card is a single integer.\n\nSo, the approach here is to calculate the total sum of the found cards. Then, we need to find how much more we need to add (or subtract) to make the total sum zero. But since we can only use cards with values between -x and x, we need to figure out the minimal number of cards required to reach that.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the sum of the found cards is S. We need to add some cards so that the total sum becomes zero. So the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards whose sum is T, with each card's value between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers in that range, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. For example, if T is zero, then no cards are needed. Otherwise, we need to find how to make T with as few cards as possible.\n\nEach card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, for the minimal number of cards, we want to use the maximum possible per card. So for example, if T is positive, we can take as many x as possible, and then maybe one more card for the remainder.\n\nWait, but the sum of the new cards is T. So let's take absolute value of T. Let me think. Suppose T is positive. Then, the minimal number of cards is ceiling(T / x), but wait, because each card can contribute up to x. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards: two 2s and one 1. But wait, but 2+2+1=5. However, since each card can be any value between -x and x, maybe there's a better way? Wait, no. Because the maximum per card is x. So to get T, the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). But wait, if T is exactly divisible by x, then it's T/x. Otherwise, it's (T//x) + 1.\n\nBut wait, let's take an example. Suppose T is 3, x is 2. Then, 3/2 is 1.5. So we need 2 cards. For example, 2 + 1. But 1 is allowed since it's within the range. So yes. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). But wait, what if T is negative? Then the same logic applies, but since we can take negative numbers. For example, T is -3, x is 2. Then, the minimal number is 2 cards: -2 and -1. So again, the absolute value of T divided by x, rounded up.\n\nSo the general formula would be: the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, let me check.\n\nWait, for example, if T is 4 and x is 2. Then 4/2 is 2, so two cards. Which is correct. If T is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so ceil(2.5) is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCompute the sum of the found cards, S. Then T is -S. If T is zero, answer is zero. Else, compute the absolute value of T, then divide by x, take the ceiling of that.\n\nBut wait, how to compute the ceiling in Python? Well, for integers a and b, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b - 1) // b.\n\nYes. So for example, 5 + 2 -1 =6, divided by 2 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo for |T|, the minimal number of cards is (|T| + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut let's test some examples.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nSample 1: Input is 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So |T| is 2. x is 2. So (2 + 2 -1) // 2 = 3//2 = 1. Which matches the sample output of 1.\n\nSample 2: input is 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. T is 4. |T| is 4. x is 3. (4 +3 -1)/3 = 6/3=2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nAnother example: if sum is 0, then answer is 0. If sum is 1 and x is 1, then |T|=1, so (1 +1-1)//1 =1. Which is correct. If sum is 3, x is 2: (3 +2-1)/2=4/2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n\n2. Read the list of numbers.\n\n3. Compute the sum S of the list.\n\n4. Compute T = -S.\n\n5. If T is 0, output 0.\n\n6. Else, compute |T|, then calculate (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if x is 0? No, the problem says x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nIn Python, read the input. For example, the first line is two integers n and x. Then the second line is n integers.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the first line as n and x.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute sum_S = sum(list).\n\nT = -sum_S.\n\nif T == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_T = abs(T)\n\n    min_cards = (abs_T + x -1 ) // x\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but let's check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nsum is 2. T is -2. abs_T is 2. x is 2. (2 +2-1) //2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSample 2: sum is -4. T is 4. abs_T=4. x=3. (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if sum is 5, x is 2. (5 +2-1)/2 =6/2=3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nWhat if sum is 3, x is 3. Then (3 +3-1)/3 =5/3=1.666 floored to 1. Which is correct. Because one card with 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: sum is 4, x is 3. (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2. Which is correct. 3+1=4. Two cards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this formula works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nBut wait, the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input is given as two lines. Wait, looking at the example input:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\nWait, but that's probably a list of test cases. But in the actual problem, the input is one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and x. The second line contains the list of numbers. So for each test case, the input is two lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given here, perhaps the user is showing two separate test cases. For example, the first input is '3 2\\n-1 1 2' which is one test case, and the second is '2 3\\n-2 -2' which is another. The outputs are '1' and '2' respectively.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So in the code, we need to read two lines. For example, in Python, the code would read:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple test cases? The problem says that the input is for a single test case. Because the problem says \"the first line contains two integers n and x...\", etc. So the code should process one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the user shows two test cases. But that's probably just for the example. So the code should read one test case.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and x from the first line.\n\nRead the next line as the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_S = sum(nums).\n\nT = -sum_S.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_s = sum(nums)\n\nt = -sum_s\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    print( (abs_t + x -1 ) // x )\n\nWait, but let me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2. nums are -1, 1, 2. sum is 2. t is -2. So abs_t is 2. (2 +2-1) //2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=2, x=3. nums are -2, -2. sum is -4. t is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 =6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x is 2. (5 +2-1)/2 =6/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x is 3. (3 +3-1)/3 =5//3=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 4, x is 3. (4 +3-1)/3 =6//3=2. Correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nWhat about when x is larger than the absolute value of T?\n\nFor example, sum is 1, x is 5. Then T is -1. So abs_t is 1. (1 +5-1)/5 =5/5=1. Which is correct, one card of -1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is a given integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sum Calculation**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Target Sum**: Determine the target sum needed to balance the found cards to zero. This target sum is the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the maximum absolute value allowed on the cards (x). The formula used is `(abs(target_sum) + x - 1) // x`, which effectively computes the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_s = sum(nums)\nt = -sum_s\nif t == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n    print((abs_t + x - 1) // x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on a card). The second line contains the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum of Found Cards**: Calculate the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n3. **Determine Target Sum**: Compute the target sum needed to balance the total sum to zero. This is done by negating the sum of the found cards.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: If the target sum is zero, print 0. Otherwise, use the formula `(abs(target_sum) + x - 1) // x` to determine the minimum number of cards required. This formula ensures that we use the ceiling of the division, which gives the minimum number of cards needed considering the maximum value constraint on each card.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in constant time, making it optimal for the given problem constraints.",
