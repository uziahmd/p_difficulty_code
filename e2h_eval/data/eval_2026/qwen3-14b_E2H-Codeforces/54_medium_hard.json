Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me recall some geometry here. In a regular polygon with n sides, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle between two adjacent sides. However, when we choose three points, the angle formed depends on how many steps apart the points are.\n\nWait, the problem says that the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 lying on the sides. So for example, if we have a regular polygon, and we pick three vertices v1, v2, v3, then the angle at v2 depends on how many edges are between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. But since the polygon is regular, the angle would be determined by the number of steps between the vertices.\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose we fix v2 as a certain vertex. Then, the other two vertices v1 and v3 must be such that they are located at some positions around the polygon. For example, in a regular polygon, if we pick v2, and then select v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between v2 and v1 clockwise, and m steps between v2 and v3 clockwise, but since the polygon is regular, maybe the angle depends on the number of edges between them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle is determined by the number of sides between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon. Because when you pick three vertices, the angle at v2 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angles (angles from the center of the polygon to two adjacent vertices) are 360/n degrees. So, for any two vertices, the central angle between them depends on how many steps apart they are.\n\nBut how does that relate to the angle at v2? Let's take an example. Let's consider a square (n=4). If we take vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at vertex 2 is 90 degrees. But if we take vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 is 45 degrees. Wait, how?\n\nWait, in a square, the internal angle at each vertex is 90 degrees. But when you take three vertices where two are adjacent and one is across, like 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 would be formed by the lines from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4. Since the square's sides are 90 degrees, but the line from 2 to 4 is a diagonal. So the angle between the side 2-1 and the diagonal 2-4 would be 45 degrees. Because in a square, the diagonal splits the 90-degree angle into two 45-degree angles. So that's why the angle at 2 in that case is 45 degrees.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps between v1 and v3. Let me think of a general formula. Suppose that in a regular n-gon, we pick three vertices v1, v2, v3. Let's assume that when moving clockwise from v2, v1 is k steps away, and v3 is m steps away. But since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. Wait, perhaps the angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3, excluding v2. Let me think of another example.\n\nIn a regular pentagon (n=5), if I take three consecutive vertices 1,2,3. The angle at 2 is the internal angle of the pentagon, which is (5-2)*180/5 = 108 degrees. Now, if I take vertices 1,2,4. What's the angle at 2? Let's imagine the regular pentagon. The points 1,2,4: the lines from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4. How many steps between 1 and 4? Well, going clockwise from 1 to 4 is 3 steps. But maybe the angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3 when going through the polygon. Let me think of the formula.\n\nI remember that in a regular polygon, the measure of an inscribed angle (angle formed by three vertices) depends on the arc between the two points. For example, in a circle, the central angle for an arc is twice the inscribed angle. But here, the polygon is regular, so it's inscribed in a circle. So, maybe the angle at v2 can be determined based on the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nLet me think. Suppose the polygon is inscribed in a circle. The angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. The angle between these two chords depends on the arc between v1 and v3. Let me denote the arc length between v1 and v3 as k steps. For example, if there are k edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2, then the central angle for that arc is (k * 360)/n degrees. Then, the angle at v2 would be half of that? Wait, no. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended at the circumference is half the central angle. But in this case, the angle at v2 is not necessarily an inscribed angle. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nIf I have three points on a circle A, B, C, then the angle ABC is an inscribed angle. The measure of angle ABC depends on the arc AC that does not contain B. The measure is half the central angle of that arc. So, if the arc AC (not containing B) is θ degrees, then angle ABC is θ/2 degrees.\n\nBut in our case, the polygon is regular, so all vertices lie on a circle. So, the angle at v2 (vertex B) is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Let me think. Suppose that the arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 has k edges. Then, the central angle for that arc is (k * 360)/n degrees. Then, the angle at v2 is half of that. Wait, no. Because the arc that is opposite to the angle. For example, in the square case, when we have vertices 1,2,4. The arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain 2 is 2 steps (since the square has 4 vertices, the arc from 1 to 4 going counter-clockwise is two edges (1-2-3-4?), no. Wait, in a square, the arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain 2 would be the arc going the other way. Let me think again. The arc that doesn't contain v2 (which is 2). So, in the case of 1,2,4, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is the arc from 1 to 4 passing through 3, which is two edges (steps between 1 and 4 is 3 steps clockwise, but if we go counter-clockwise, it's 1 step? No, in a square, the distance between 1 and 4 is 1 step if you go counter-clockwise (from 1 to 4 directly?), but that's not possible. Wait, the square's vertices are arranged in order 1,2,3,4. The arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is the arc from 1 to 4 going counter-clockwise, which is just one edge (from 1 to 4?), but that's not possible. Oh wait, no. The square is a 4-gon. So between 1 and 4, there are two arcs: one that goes through 2 and 3 (length 3 steps?), and the other that goes directly from 1 to 4 (but that's one step if you consider the other direction). Wait, no. The arc between two points can be measured in terms of steps between them. For example, between 1 and 4 in a square, the minimal number of steps is 1 (if you go counter-clockwise from 1 to 4), but if you go clockwise, it's 3 steps. But the arc that does not contain v2 (vertex 2) would be the arc that goes from 1 to 4 without passing through 2. Which would be the counter-clockwise arc (from 1 to 4 directly), which is one step. So the central angle for that arc is 360/4 * 1 = 90 degrees. Then the angle at v2 would be half of that, which is 45 degrees. Which matches the example earlier. So yes, the formula seems correct.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is equal to (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Wait, because the central angle is (k * 360)/n, then the inscribed angle is half of that, which is (k * 180)/n. So the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nBut what is k? Let's think. For the example where v1 is adjacent to v2 and v3 is two steps away from v2. Let's say the polygon is a pentagon (n=5). Suppose v2 is the vertex, v1 is the previous vertex (so one step counterclockwise), and v3 is two steps clockwise from v2. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be... Let me see. The total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 would be (n - (steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2))? Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think that for any three vertices v1, v2, v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is determined by the number of steps between them. Let me think of the following: suppose that in the polygon, between v1 and v3, there are m steps in one direction (the shorter path), and (n - m) steps in the other direction. The arc that does not contain v2 would be the one that is longer or shorter depending on where v2 is. But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the angle at v2, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not include v2 is (k) steps, and this k can be determined as follows: when you fix v2, the positions of v1 and v3 must be such that they are on either side of v2. For example, if v1 is k steps counterclockwise from v2 and v3 is l steps clockwise from v2, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be (k + l) steps. Because if you go from v1 counterclockwise to v2, then clockwise to v3, that's the arc that includes v2. But the other arc (the one that doesn't include v2) would be the rest of the polygon. So the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is n - (k + l) steps. But since the angle depends on that arc, then the angle is ((n - (k + l)) * 180)/n degrees. Wait, but how do we determine k and l?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is (m), and m can be calculated as follows. Let me think of the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2. Suppose that when you move clockwise from v2, the first vertex is v2+1, etc. So, if I pick v1 to be i steps away from v2 in one direction (say, counterclockwise), and v3 to be j steps away in the other direction (clockwise), then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be (i + j) steps. Wait, no. Because if you go from v1 to v3 via the other side (not passing through v2), then the number of steps is i + j. Because if you move from v1 counterclockwise i steps to reach v2, then move clockwise j steps to reach v3, that's the path that passes through v2. The other path (the arc that doesn't contain v2) would be the rest of the polygon, which is n - (i + j) steps. But that's only if i + j < n. Otherwise, the arc would be shorter. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, the angle depends on the arc that is opposite to v2. So, for the angle at v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 must be the arc that is longer than the arc that contains v2. Or maybe not. Wait, in the example where the square has vertices 1,2,4. Then, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is 1 step (directly from 1 to 4). The arc that contains 2 is 3 steps. So in that case, the angle is determined by the smaller arc. Wait, but according to the formula earlier, the angle is (k * 180)/n, where k is the number of steps in the arc that doesn't contain v2. So in that case, k is 1, and (1*180)/4 = 45 degrees, which matches the example. So the formula holds.\n\nSo, for any three vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. But how to compute k?\n\nAlternatively, since the polygon is regular, for any two vertices v1 and v3, there are two arcs between them. The angle at v2 depends on which arc is chosen. But in our case, since v2 is the vertex of the angle, the arc that does not contain v2 must be the one that is considered. So, for the angle to be formed, v1 and v3 must be on different sides of v2. That is, they must be on opposite sides of v2. Otherwise, the arc that doesn't contain v2 would be the same as the arc that contains v2. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nIf v1 and v3 are both on the same side of v2, then the arc between them that doesn't contain v2 would be the arc that goes around the other side of the polygon. For example, if v1 and v3 are both adjacent to v2 (say, v1 is previous and v3 is next), then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 would be the rest of the polygon. So, in that case, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is n - 2 steps. Then the angle at v2 would be ((n-2) * 180)/n. Which for a triangle (n=3) would be (1 * 180)/3 = 60 degrees. Which matches the first example.\n\nSo, the key is that the angle at v2 depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Let's call this number k. So, the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nNow, how to find k for a given v2, v1, v3. Let me think. For any three distinct vertices, the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 can be considered. Let me imagine that the polygon is numbered in clockwise order. For example, for a square, the order is 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nSuppose that v2 is fixed. Then, for any two other vertices, v1 and v3, they can be positioned in different ways. For example, v1 could be i steps counterclockwise from v2, and v3 could be j steps clockwise from v2. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 would have (i + j) steps. Because if you go from v1 counterclockwise to v2 (i steps), then clockwise to v3 (j steps), that's the arc that contains v2. The other arc (the one that doesn't contain v2) would have (n - i - j) steps. So, k = n - i - j. Therefore, the angle would be ( (n - i - j) * 180 ) / n degrees.\n\nBut wait, in the example where v1 is adjacent to v2 (i=1), and v3 is adjacent to v2 (j=1), then k = n - 1 - 1 = n-2. So the angle is (n-2)*180/n. For n=3, that gives 1*180/3=60 degrees, which is correct. For n=4, (4-2)*180/4 = 2*45 = 90 degrees, which is the internal angle of the square. Which makes sense. So that formula seems to hold.\n\nAnother example: the square case with v2=2, v1=1, v3=4. Here, i=1 (counterclockwise from v2 to v1?), or wait, need to be precise. Let me think of the positions. Let's say v2 is 2. The counterclockwise direction from v2 would be towards 1, and clockwise would be towards 3. So for v1=1, i=1 (steps counterclockwise from v2 to v1). For v3=4, which is two steps clockwise from v2 (since 2 → 3 → 4). So j=2. Then, k = n - i - j = 4 - 1 - 2 = 1. Then the angle is 1 * 180 /4 = 45 degrees. Which is correct. So that formula works.\n\nSo, the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n, where k = n - i - j, and i and j are the steps from v2 to v1 (counterclockwise) and to v3 (clockwise), respectively. But since i and j can vary, we can find that for any choice of i and j (i ≥ 1, j ≥ 1, and i + j ≤ n-1?), the angle would be ( (n - i - j) * 180 ) / n.\n\nBut since i and j are steps from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, the sum i + j can range from 2 (when i=1, j=1) up to n-1 (when i=1, j=n-1, but that would make k= n - 1 - (n-1) = 0, which would give angle zero, but that's not possible). Wait, but k must be at least 1, because v1 and v3 can't be the same as v2. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here.\n\nWait, when i and j are steps from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, then i and j must be ≥ 1, since v1 and v3 are distinct from v2. Also, since the polygon is cyclic, the maximum value for i + j would be n-1. Because if i + j exceeds n-1, then the arc that doesn't contain v2 would be shorter. But how?\n\nActually, for any i and j ≥ 1, the value of k is n - i - j. But if i + j > n-1, then k becomes negative. Which can't be. So perhaps my formula is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of i and j as the minimal steps between v2 and v1, and between v2 and v3. But that may not capture the correct scenario. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for k is (number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2) = (n - (distance between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2)).\n\nBut how to compute that distance?\n\nAlternatively, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (i + j), where i is the steps from v2 to v1 counterclockwise and j is the steps from v2 to v3 clockwise. Then the arc that doesn't contain v2 would be n - (i + j) steps. But that requires that i + j ≤ n-1. Otherwise, the arc that contains v2 would be longer than the one that doesn't. But since we are considering the arc that does not contain v2, perhaps the correct k is (n - (i + j)) if that is positive, otherwise ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think of the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2. Let's say that the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is k. Then, the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees. Our goal is to find k such that this angle is as close as possible to a.\n\nBut how to find possible values of k? For a given n, the possible values of k can be from 1 to n-2. Because the minimal arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 can be 1 step (when v1 and v3 are adjacent) up to n-2 steps (when v1 and v3 are as far apart as possible without including v2).\n\nWait, for example, in a square (n=4), the maximum possible k is 2 steps. Because if you choose v1 and v3 such that they are opposite each other (but not containing v2). For example, if v2 is 1, then v1 could be 2 and v3 could be 4. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is 2 steps (from 2 to 3 to 4). Then k=2, angle is 2 * 180 /4 = 90 degrees. Which is the internal angle of the square. Which makes sense.\n\nSo, for any n, the possible values of k are integers from 1 to n-2. Because if k is n-2, then the arc between v1 and v3 is n-2 steps, which would imply that v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other (since the arc between them is n-2 steps, which is the same as going the other way around the polygon for 2 steps). Wait, not sure. But regardless, the possible k values are integers between 1 and n-2. Because for any three distinct vertices, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be at least 1 step and at most n-2 steps.\n\nSo, for each possible k (from 1 to n-2), the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. Our task is to find the k that makes this angle as close as possible to a. Once we find the optimal k, we can then find any triplet of vertices that corresponds to that k.\n\nSo, the steps for solving the problem would be:\n\n1. For the given n and a, compute the possible angles for each k in 1..n-2.\n2. Find the k that makes the angle closest to a.\n3. Once the optimal k is found, select any triplet of vertices that corresponds to that k.\n\nBut how to compute the optimal k?\n\nLet me think. The angle for a given k is angle_k = (k * 180) / n. We want to find the k that minimizes |angle_k - a|.\n\nBut since k is an integer between 1 and n-2, we can compute the optimal k by finding the k that is closest to (a * n)/180.\n\nLet me see. Let's rearrange the equation angle_k = a. Solving for k:\n\nk = (a * n)/180\n\nBut since k must be an integer, the optimal k is the integer closest to (a * n)/180. However, since k must be in [1, n-2], we need to clamp it to that range.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, n=3, a=15. The possible k is 1 (since n-2=1). The angle is (1 * 180)/3 = 60 degrees. Which is the only possible option, hence output any triplet.\n\nIn the second sample input, n=4, a=67. The ideal k would be (67 *4)/180 ≈ 1.488. So the closest integer is 1 or 2. Let's compute the angles:\n\nk=1: 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. Difference is 67-45=22.\n\nk=2: 2*180/4=90. Difference is 90-67=23. So 45 is closer. Hence, the answer is k=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nIn the third sample input, n=4, a=68. Ideal k is 68*4/180 ≈ 1.511. So closest is 2 (since 1.511 is closer to 2 than 1). For k=2, angle is 90, difference is 22. For k=1, difference is 23. So the answer is k=2.\n\nSo the approach is to compute the target k as (a * n) / 180, then check floor and ceiling of that value, and choose the one that gives the minimal difference.\n\nBut since k must be an integer between 1 and n-2, we need to compute the best candidate among the floor and ceiling, and also ensure that they are within the valid range.\n\nOnce the optimal k is found, the next step is to find three vertices that form this angle.\n\nHow to find the vertices? Let's say we have chosen k. Then, for any vertex v2, we can choose v1 and v3 such that the arc between them (not containing v2) is k steps. For example, for a given v2, we can choose v1 to be v2-1 (previous vertex) and v3 to be v2 + k + 1 (but need to adjust for wrap-around).\n\nWait, earlier we had that k = n - i - j, where i is the steps from v2 to v1 counterclockwise (i ≥1), and j is the steps from v2 to v3 clockwise (j ≥1). So, i + j = n -k. Since k is fixed, we can choose i and j such that i + j = n -k. For example, choosing i=1 and j = n -k -1. Then, the steps between v2 and v1 is 1, and between v2 and v3 is (n -k -1) steps.\n\nBut for any i and j that sum to (n -k), the angle would be correct. So, for simplicity, we can choose i=1 and j = n -k -1. Then, v1 is the previous vertex (v2 -1), and v3 is the vertex that is j steps clockwise from v2. Let's see.\n\nLet me take an example. For n=4, k=1. Then, i + j = n -k = 4 -1 =3. So i=1, j=2. So v1 is v2-1, and v3 is v2 + 2 steps clockwise. For example, if v2 is 2, then v1 is 1, and v3 is 2+2=4. Which gives the triplet 1 2 4, which forms the angle of 45 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4, k=2. Then, i + j = 4-2=2. So i=1, j=1. Then v1 is v2-1, and v3 is v2+1. So, for v2=2, v1=1, v3=3. The angle is (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo, for any k, we can choose v2 as any vertex, and then set v1 as v2-1, and v3 as v2 + (n -k -1) steps clockwise. However, we need to handle the wrap-around. For example, if v2 is 1, then v2-1 would be n (since the numbering is circular). Similarly, adding steps to v2 must wrap around modulo n.\n\nSo, to construct the triplet, we can choose any v2. For example, choosing v2=1. Then, v1 is 1-1 = n. And v3 is 1 + (n -k -1) steps. Let's compute that:\n\nv3 = 1 + (n -k -1) = n -k.\n\nSo, for example, if n=4, k=1, then v3 =4 -1 =3. Wait, but earlier example had v3 as 4. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nEarlier, when k=1 and n=4, i +j =3. Choosing i=1 and j=2. So j is steps from v2 clockwise. So for v2=2, j=2 steps clockwise would be 2 →3 →4. So v3 is 4. But according to the formula above, when v2=2, then v3 would be 2 + j steps, where j = n -k -i. Wait, no. Earlier, i=1 and j= n -k -i. Wait, i + j = n -k. So j = n -k -i. So if i=1, then j= n -k -1. So for v2=2, j=4 -1 -1 = 2. So steps clockwise from v2 is 2 steps. So v3 is 2 + 2 steps. But since the numbering is 1-based, adding steps clockwise:\n\nFor example, in a 4-gon, the vertices are 1, 2, 3, 4. Starting from 2, adding 1 step clockwise is 3, adding 2 steps is 4. So yes, v3 is 4. Which matches the example.\n\nBut according to the formula above, when v2 is 1, then v3 is 1 + (n -k -i) steps. Wait, but in the case where v2 is 1, i=1 (steps counterclockwise from v2 to v1), which would be v1 = 1 -1 = 4 (assuming n=4). Then j = n -k -i = 4 -1 -1 = 2 steps clockwise from v2=1. So steps clockwise: 1→2→3. So v3 is 3. So the triplet is 4, 1, 3. The angle is (k * 180)/n = 1 * 180 /4 =45 degrees, which is correct. So the triplet 4 1 3 is a valid solution. Which is one of the possible answers in the sample input.\n\nThus, for any k, choosing v2 as 1, v1 as n (since v2-1 mod n is n if v2 is 1), and v3 as (v2 + (n -k -1)) mod n. Wait, but how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given k, the triplet can be constructed as follows:\n\nv2 is any vertex (e.g., 1).\n\nv1 is v2 - 1 (mod n), but since the vertices are numbered from 1 to n, if v2 is 1, then v1 is n.\n\nv3 is v2 + (n -k -1) steps clockwise. Since the steps from v2 is (n -k -1) steps. So, for example, if v2 is 1, then v3 is 1 + (n -k -1) steps. But since the steps are in the clockwise direction, adding (n -k -1) steps to v2's position.\n\nBut how to compute this? For example, in code, for a given v2 (like 1), the v3 is (v2 + (n -k -1) -1) %n +1 ?\n\nWait, let's think of the vertices as being numbered from 1 to n. Adding m steps clockwise from v2 would take us to (v2 + m) if it's within 1..n. But if it exceeds n, we need to wrap around. For example, adding 2 steps to 4 in n=4 would be (4 + 2) mod 4 = 6 mod 4 = 2. But that's not correct. Wait, adding 1 step to 4 would be 1, adding 2 steps would be 2.\n\nSo, the formula for adding m steps clockwise from v2 is (v2 + m -1) %n +1.\n\nYes. Because, for example, v2=4, m=1: (4+1-1) mod4 +1 =4 mod4 +1= 0 +1=1. Which is correct. For m=2 steps: (4+2-1) mod4 +1 =5 mod4 +1=1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSo, for v2, adding m steps clockwise is (v2 + m -1) %n +1.\n\nIn our case, m is (n -k -1). So:\n\nv3 = (v2 + (n -k -1) -1) %n +1 = (v2 + n -k -2) %n +1.\n\nBut since v2 is 1, substituting:\n\nv3 = (1 + n -k -2) %n +1 = (n -k -1) %n +1. Since n -k -1 is between 1 and n-2 (since k is between 1 and n-2), then mod n is same as the value. So:\n\nv3 = (n -k -1) +1 = n -k.\n\nSo, for v2=1, v3 is n -k.\n\nSo, the triplet is (v1, v2, v3) = (n, 1, n -k).\n\nBut wait, in the example where n=4, k=1, then v3 is 4 -1 =3. So triplet is 4, 1, 3. Which is correct. And the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nAnother example: n=4, k=2. Then v3 is 4-2=2. So triplet is 4, 1, 2. Which is the same as 4 1 2. Which is one of the sample outputs for the third test case (when a=68, which required k=2).\n\nSo, this seems to work. Thus, for any k, the triplet can be constructed as (n, 1, n -k). However, we need to ensure that the three vertices are distinct. Let's check:\n\nv1 =n, v2=1, v3 =n -k.\n\nSince k is between 1 and n-2, n-k ranges from n-1 (when k=1) down to 2 (when k =n-2). So, for example, when n=4 and k=1, n-k=3. So triplet is 4,1,3. All distinct.\n\nYes. So, this triplet is always valid.\n\nTherefore, once we find the optimal k, we can output the triplet (n, 1, n -k). But there are multiple possible triplets. For example, in the first sample input, any triplet is acceptable. So, the code can choose this triplet.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read n and a.\n\n2. Compute the target k as (a * n) / 180. Since a and n are integers, but the division may not be exact.\n\n3. Find the integer k that is closest to this value, and lies in the range [1, n-2].\n\n   - Compute the ideal value: target = a * n / 180.0\n\n   - The candidates are floor(target) and ceil(target), but need to check if they are in the valid range. Also, if target is exactly integer, then that is the best.\n\n   - For example, if target is 1.5, then candidates are 1 and 2. Compare which gives a smaller difference.\n\n   - Also, need to check if the candidates are within 1 and n-2.\n\n   - Additionally, there could be cases where the ideal k is outside the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves calculating the optimal angle using geometric properties of regular polygons and then determining the corresponding vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Angle in Regular Polygon**: The angle formed at a vertex in a regular polygon can be determined based on the number of steps between two other vertices along the arc that does not include the vertex itself. This angle is calculated using the formula: `angle = (k * 180) / n`, where `k` is the number of steps between the two vertices along the arc.\n\n2. **Finding Optimal k**: The value of `k` that makes the angle closest to `a` can be derived by solving `k = (a * n) / 180`. We then check the nearest integers around this value to find the optimal `k`.\n\n3. **Constructing the Vertices**: Once the optimal `k` is found, we construct the vertices using a fixed pattern. The vertices are chosen such that the middle vertex is always the first vertex (to simplify calculations), and the other two vertices are determined based on the calculated `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n    \n    # Calculate target k\n    target = a * n / 180.0\n    candidates = []\n    \n    # Generate possible k values to check\n    k_floor = int(target)\n    k_ceil = k_floor + 1\n    for k in [k_floor, k_ceil]:\n        if 1 <= k <= n - 2:\n            candidates.append(k)\n    # Also check if target is integer\n    if target == int(target):\n        candidates = list(set(candidates))\n    else:\n        # Ensure both candidates are within range\n        pass\n    \n    # Check if any candidates are out of range, add boundaries if needed\n    if not candidates:\n        candidates.append(1)\n        candidates.append(n-2)\n    else:\n        # Remove duplicates and ensure they are in range\n        candidates = list(set(candidates))\n        for k in candidates:\n            if not (1 <= k <= n-2):\n                candidates.remove(k)\n        if not candidates:\n            candidates.append(1)\n    \n    # Now evaluate which k gives minimal difference\n    best_k = None\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for k in candidates:\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Choose the smaller k if there's a tie\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    \n    # Now construct the triplet\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = n\n    v3 = n - best_k\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n\n2. **Calculating Target k**: The target `k` is derived from the formula `k = (a * n) / 180`.
