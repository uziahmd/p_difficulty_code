In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and we need to determine how many more tiles she needs to add to have at least one of these.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible cases. For each of the three given tiles, we need to check if they can form a mentsu already, or if adding one or two tiles would allow that.\n\nBut wait, since she can draw any tiles, including duplicates, the problem is to find the minimal number of draws required. Let's break it down.\n\nLet me think about all possibilities:\n\nCase 1: The existing three tiles already form a mentsu. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: They can form a mentsu by adding one tile. Then answer is 1.\n\nCase 3: Otherwise, need to add two tiles. Or maybe even three? Wait, no. Because the minimal would be either 0, 1, 2, or maybe even more?\n\nWait, for example, if the current tiles are all different suits and numbers, then what's the minimal steps?\n\nLet me think about the worst case. Suppose the three tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a triplet, she would need to add two more tiles of the same as one of them. For example, adding two more 1m's to make a triplet. That would take two draws. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to form a sequence with one more tile? But since they are all different suits, no. So in this case, the answer would be 2.\n\nWait but maybe there's a better way. For example, if she adds one tile to make a triplet. Like, if she has two of a kind, then adding one more. But in this case, the initial three are all unique. So for example, if she has two tiles of the same, then adding another would make a triplet. But in this case, the initial three are all different. So for example, if the three are 1m, 1p, 2s. Then, she can't form a triplet unless she adds two more tiles. But maybe there's a way to form a sequence? Well, sequences require three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So in this case, perhaps adding one tile to form a sequence. For example, if the tiles are 1m, 2m, 3m, then that's a sequence. But if the original three are 1m, 2p, 3s, then she can't form a sequence unless she adds two tiles. So in that case, the answer is 2.\n\nSo the minimal steps can be 0, 1, or 2. Wait, but what about when you need to add two tiles? Let's think of an example where adding two tiles is needed. Like, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, adding one more 2m or 3m would form a triplet or sequence. Wait, for triplet, she needs three same. So adding another 1m would make a triplet. Or adding 2m and 3m for a sequence. So in that case, the minimal is 1 (adding another 1m). So in that case, the answer is 1.\n\nSo the problem is to check for all possibilities of whether the current tiles can be extended into a mentsu with minimal draws.\n\nNow, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, check if the existing three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, check if there's a way to form a mentsu by adding one tile. If yes, return 1.\n\nOtherwise, return 2. Because in the worst case, adding two tiles can form a triplet (if there are two same tiles, add one more) or a sequence (like if there are two consecutive, adding one more).\n\nWait, but maybe there are some cases where even adding two tiles isn't enough. Wait no, because with three tiles, adding two more gives five tiles. But for a mentsu, you need three. So for example, if the existing three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, adding 3m would form a sequence. So that's one tile. So in this case, the answer is 1.\n\nSo the key is to check for all possibilities.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if there's a way to add one tile to form a mentsu. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, return 2.\n\nBut how to check for these conditions?\n\nLet's think about checking if the current three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nFor a triplet: all three tiles must be same. So, for example, 1m, 1m, 1m.\n\nFor a sequence: the three must be in the same suit, and their numbers are consecutive. For example, 1m, 2m, 3m. But the order doesn't matter. So for the three tiles, we can check if they are in the same suit, and when sorted, their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo first, for the current three tiles, check if they form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nIf not, then proceed to check for possible additions.\n\nNow, when considering adding one tile, we need to see if there's a way to have a triplet or sequence with four tiles (original three plus one added). But since the added tile can be any, how do we check that?\n\nBut perhaps, for the current three tiles, we can check all possibilities of what adding a tile could do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think about possible scenarios where adding one tile would form a triplet or sequence.\n\nFor example, for triplet: if there are two same tiles, then adding one more would form a triplet. So for example, if the original three are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding another 1m would form a triplet.\n\nFor sequence: if there are two tiles in the same suit, consecutive numbers, then adding one more to complete the sequence. Like, if original is 1m, 2m, 3m: already a sequence. But if original is 1m, 2m, 4m, then adding 3m would make a sequence.\n\nBut also, if the original three have two tiles in the same suit, but not consecutive. Like 1m, 3m, 5m. Then adding 2m and 4m would form a sequence. But that requires adding two tiles. So for this case, adding one tile is not sufficient. So in this case, the answer would be 2.\n\nBut how to check for all possible scenarios where adding one tile would help.\n\nSo, for the case of adding one tile, we need to check whether any of the following is possible:\n\nEither:\n\n- There exists a triplet that can be formed by adding one tile. For example, if there are two tiles of the same type, then adding one more would form a triplet.\n\nOR\n\n- There exists a sequence that can be formed by adding one tile. For example, if there are two tiles in the same suit with numbers that are consecutive, and adding the third.\n\nBut how to check that.\n\nLet me think about the triplet case first.\n\nFor the triplet case, the original three tiles may have two of a kind. For example, two 1m and one 2m. Adding another 1m would form a triplet.\n\nSo for the original three, count the frequency of each tile. If any tile occurs twice, then adding one more of that tile will form a triplet. So in this case, the answer is 1.\n\nBut if the original three have all distinct tiles, then adding one tile can't form a triplet (since you need two same tiles to start with). Wait, no. Suppose the original three are all different. Then adding one tile would make four tiles. For example, if the original three are 1m, 2m, 3m. Then, adding another 1m would not form a triplet. But if the original three are 1m, 2m, 3m, then they already form a sequence. So in this case, the answer is 0.\n\nWait, but in the original three, if there are two same tiles and one different, then adding one more same tile would form a triplet. For example, original is [1m, 1m, 2m]. Adding 1m gives a triplet.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, the original three must have at least two of the same tile. So, for the original three, check if any tile occurs at least two times. If so, then adding one more would form a triplet. So in that case, answer is 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the original three have three different tiles, but adding a tile that creates a triplet. For example, if original is [1m, 2m, 3m], but that's already a sequence. So no need to add anything. But if original is [1m, 1p, 1s], then adding one more of any of those would create a triplet. But in this case, the original three can't form a triplet, but adding one tile can. So in this case, the answer is 1.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, if there's at least two same tiles, then adding one more gives a triplet.\n\nBut for the case where there are exactly two same tiles. So, for example, two 1m and one 2p. Then, adding another 1m would form a triplet. So this is possible.\n\nSo, for the triplet possibility, the answer is 1 if there are two same tiles in the original three.\n\nBut what if the original three have three different tiles, but two of them are same. Like, [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then, adding one more 1m would form triplet. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, the condition is that there is at least two same tiles in the original three. Then, adding one more would make a triplet. So that's a possibility.\n\nBut for the sequence case, it's more complicated.\n\nThe original three tiles may have two in same suit and numbers that can form a sequence with adding one.\n\nFor example, if the original three are [1m, 2m, 4m]. Then, adding 3m would form a sequence. So the answer is 1.\n\nOr, original is [1m, 3m, 4m]. Then adding 2m would form a sequence.\n\nOr, original is [2m, 3m, 4m], which is already a sequence. Answer is 0.\n\nSo, for the sequence case, we need to check if there's a way to add one tile to make a sequence. How to check this?\n\nFirst, the three original tiles must have at least two in the same suit. Because a sequence requires three in same suit.\n\nSo, let's group the original three tiles by their suit.\n\nFor each suit, check the numbers present.\n\nFor example, suppose the original three tiles are [1m, 2m, 3s]. Then, in suit m, there are two tiles (1 and 2), and in s, one tile. So for the m suit, we can check if adding a tile can form a sequence.\n\nFor the m suit, the numbers are 1 and 2. So adding 3m would form a sequence (1,2,3). Or adding 0m? No, since numbers are from 1-9. So only possible to add 3m. So in this case, adding 3m would make a sequence. So the answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: original is [1m, 3m, 5m]. Then, the numbers in the same suit are 1,3,5. To form a sequence, need three consecutive numbers. So adding 2m and 4m would form a sequence. But that requires two tiles. So in this case, the answer would be 2.\n\nBut for the case where the original three have two in same suit, and the numbers are consecutive, but missing one. For example, [1m, 2m, 4m]. Adding 3m would form a sequence.\n\nSo, for the sequence case, the steps would be:\n\nCheck for each suit that has at least two tiles. For each such suit, collect the numbers of the tiles in that suit. Then, check if adding one tile can make a sequence.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nLet me think: suppose in a suit, there are two numbers, say a and b. Let's sort them. So, sorted as x and y. Then, to form a sequence, there are two possibilities:\n\nEither:\n\n- x and y are consecutive, and we can add x-1 (if x>1) or y+1 (if y <9). For example, if x=2 and y=3, then adding 1 or 4 would make a sequence. But wait, if we have two tiles (2 and 3), adding 1 would give 1,2,3. Or adding 4 would give 2,3,4. So in that case, adding one tile would form a sequence. So for this case, the answer is 1.\n\nOr, if x and y are not consecutive. For example, x=1 and y=3. Then, adding 2 would form a sequence. So in this case, adding one tile.\n\nBut if x and y are two apart, like 1 and 4, then adding 2 or 3 would not form a sequence. Wait, adding 2 would give 1,2,4. Not a sequence. Adding 3 would give 1,3,4. Also not. So to form a sequence, we need to have three consecutive numbers. So if there are two numbers, then the third must be such that they form three consecutive numbers. So for example, if the two numbers are 1 and 3, then adding 2. If they are 1 and 4, then adding 2 and 3 would be needed. But that requires adding two tiles.\n\nSo, for the case where in a suit, there are two numbers, the possible ways to form a sequence with adding one tile is when the two numbers are consecutive, or differ by 2 (so that adding the middle one would make a sequence). Wait, no. For example, if two numbers are 1 and 2, then adding 3 would make a sequence. Or if two numbers are 2 and 3, adding 1 would make a sequence. Or if two numbers are 1 and 3, adding 2 makes a sequence. So in any case, if the two numbers are consecutive or differ by 1 (wait, no, consecutive numbers are difference of 1). Wait, the two numbers are 1 and 3, which differ by 2. Adding 2 makes a sequence. So in that case, the two numbers are not consecutive, but adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nSo for two numbers in the same suit, the possible scenarios where adding one tile can form a sequence is when the two numbers are either:\n\n- x and x+1 → adding x+2 or x-1 (but x-1 can't be less than 1).\n\nWait, no. For example, if the two numbers are 2 and 3. Then, adding 1 (to form 1,2,3) or adding 4 (to form 2,3,4). Either way, adding one tile.\n\nSimilarly, if the two numbers are 1 and 2, adding 3.\n\nIf the two numbers are 1 and 3, adding 2.\n\nIf the two numbers are 2 and 4, adding 3.\n\nIf the two numbers are 3 and 5, adding 4.\n\nSo in all cases where the two numbers are in the same suit and differ by 1 or 2, adding one tile can form a sequence. Wait, but if they differ by more than 2, like 1 and 4. Then adding 2 and 3 would be needed. But that's two tiles.\n\nSo for the case where in a suit, there are two numbers, the maximum difference between them is 2. Then adding one tile can form a sequence. Else, adding one tile can't.\n\nSo, for a given suit, if there are two numbers, then check if the maximum difference between them is <= 2. If yes, then adding one tile can form a sequence. If not, then can't.\n\nBut what if there are three numbers in the same suit? For example, original three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, the numbers are 1, 2, 4. So, in that case, there are three numbers. But they are not a sequence. However, adding 3m would make a sequence (1,2,3,4). But since we need three consecutive numbers, the existing numbers are 1,2,4. Adding 3 would form 1,2,3,4. So in that case, there are multiple sequences possible (1,2,3) or (2,3,4). So adding one tile (3) allows for a sequence. So for this case, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but in this case, the original three tiles have three numbers in the same suit. How do I check that adding one tile can form a sequence?\n\nIn this case, the three numbers are 1, 2, 4. So when sorted, they are [1,2,4]. The maximum gap between consecutive numbers is 2 (between 2 and 4). So, adding 3 would bridge that gap, allowing for a sequence.\n\nSo in this case, even though there are three numbers, adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nSo how to check this?\n\nWell, for the case where there are three numbers in the same suit. For example, sorted numbers [a, b, c]. We need to check if there's a way to add one tile to form a sequence.\n\nA sequence is three consecutive numbers. So, for example, if the numbers are [1,2,4], adding 3 gives 1,2,3,4. So sequences [1,2,3] and [2,3,4].\n\nBut how to check if the existing numbers can be part of a sequence with one addition.\n\nThe way to check is to see if there's a pair of consecutive numbers, and the third is either one step before or after.\n\nAlternatively, the three numbers may have two consecutive numbers, and the third is one away from that pair. For example, 1,2,3 → already a sequence. Or 1,2,4 → adding 3. Or 1,3,4 → adding 2. Or 2,3,4 → already a sequence. Or 1,3,5 → adding 2 and 4 would be needed, but that's two tiles.\n\nSo for the case where there are three numbers in the same suit, how can we check if adding one tile would form a sequence?\n\nWe can check if the numbers can form a sequence with one missing. For example, the numbers are [1,2,4]. Then, the sequence [1,2,3] is missing 3. Or [2,3,4] is missing 3. So adding 3 would allow forming a sequence.\n\nAnother example: numbers [1,3,4]. Missing 2. Adding 2 would allow [1,2,3] or [2,3,4].\n\nAnother example: numbers [1,2,3]. Already a sequence. So no need to add.\n\nAnother example: numbers [1,2,5]. Then, the gaps are between 2 and 5. Adding 3 and 4 would be needed. But that's two tiles. So in this case, adding one tile can't form a sequence.\n\nSo how to check if the existing three numbers in the same suit can be made into a sequence with adding one tile?\n\nThe approach is to check if the three numbers have exactly one gap of 1 (i.e., two consecutive numbers, and the third is not adjacent). Or, if the three numbers are such that there's a gap of 2, but the other numbers are consecutive.\n\nAlternatively, for three numbers, check if the maximum number minus the minimum is 2. For example, [1,2,3] → max - min is 2. So that's a sequence. If the max - min is 3, then there's a gap. For example, [1,2,4] → max - min is 3. Then, adding 3 (the missing number) would form a sequence.\n\nWait, but for [1,3,4], max - min is 3. Adding 2 would form a sequence.\n\nBut for [1,2,4], max - min is 3. Adding 3 would form a sequence.\n\nSo if the max - min is 2, then it's already a sequence. If it's 3, then there's a possibility of adding one tile. If it's more than 3, then adding one tile can't form a sequence.\n\nSo for three numbers in the same suit, if max - min is 2, then it's already a sequence. If it's 3, then adding one tile can form a sequence. If it's more than 3, then adding one tile can't.\n\nBut what if the numbers are [1,3,5], max - min is 4. Then adding one tile can't form a sequence. So the answer would require adding two tiles.\n\nSo, putting this all together:\n\nFor the case of checking if adding one tile can form a sequence:\n\nFor each suit in the original three tiles:\n\n- Collect all the numbers in that suit.\n\n- If the count is 3 (all three in same suit):\n\n   - Check if they form a sequence. If yes, then answer is 0.\n\n   - Else, check if the max - min is 2 (then adding one tile would not be needed, but already a sequence?), or if max - min is 3. For example, [1,2,4] → max - min is 3. Then adding 3 would form a sequence. So in that case, answer is 1.\n\n   - Wait, for the case of three numbers in same suit, but not forming a sequence, but max - min is 3. Then adding one tile can form a sequence. So yes.\n\n   - If max - min is 4 or more, then adding one tile can't form a sequence.\n\n- If the count is 2 (two numbers in same suit):\n\n   - Check if the two numbers can form a sequence with adding one tile. Which is possible if their difference is <= 2. For example, numbers 1 and 2 (difference 1) → add 3 or 0 (but 0 invalid). So add 3. Or numbers 1 and 3 (difference 2) → add 2. Or numbers 1 and 4 (difference 3) → can't add one tile to form a sequence.\n\nSo for two numbers in same suit, if their difference is <= 2, then adding one tile can form a sequence. Else, no.\n\n- If the count is 1 (only one tile in that suit), then adding two tiles can form a sequence. But since we are checking for adding one tile, this is not possible.\n\nSo, for the sequence case, we can check for all suits in the original three tiles. If any of the above conditions are met, then adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nSo, putting all together, the algorithm is:\n\nCheck if the original three tiles form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if there's a way to form a triplet or sequence by adding one tile. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, return 2.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, parse the input. The input is three strings. Let's take them as a list, for example, tiles = ['1s', '2s', '3s'].\n\nThen, for checking if the current three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nCheck for triplet: all three are same.\n\nCheck for sequence: all three are same suit, and when sorted, numbers are consecutive.\n\nFor example, for the three tiles, check if all suits are same, and the numbers sorted are [x, x+1, x+2].\n\nSo, for the triplet check:\n\nif tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2], then yes.\n\nFor the sequence check:\n\nCheck if all suits are same. If not, no. Else, extract the numbers, sort them, check if they are consecutive.\n\nSo, for example, numbers = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n\nif numbers[1] == numbers[0]+1 and numbers[2] == numbers[1]+1 → yes.\n\nIf either of these is true, return 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for the case of adding one tile.\n\nCheck for triplet possibility: if any tile occurs at least two times in the original three. Because adding one more would form a triplet.\n\nFor example, tiles are ['1m', '1m', '2m'] → two 1m. So adding one more 1m would form a triplet.\n\nSo, check if any of the tiles appears at least twice. If yes, then possible to form a triplet by adding one tile. So answer is 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the original three have two same tiles, but adding one tile can also form a sequence? For example, tiles are ['1m', '1m', '2m']. Adding a 3m would form a sequence. But the code would check for triplet possibility (yes) and return 1. Which is correct, since the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, for the triplet possibility, if there's any tile that appears at least two times, then adding one more would form a triplet. So that's a candidate for answer 1.\n\nThen, check for sequence possibility. For this, we need to check all suits in the original three tiles.\n\nSo, for each suit, collect the numbers in that suit.\n\nFor example, for tiles ['1m', '2s', '3m'], the suits are m, s, m. So for suit m, numbers are [1,3]. For suit s, numbers are [2].\n\nSo, for each suit, check:\n\nif the count is 3 → already checked earlier.\n\nif count is 2 → check if the two numbers can form a sequence with adding one tile. As discussed, if their difference is <= 2.\n\nif count is 1 → nothing to do here.\n\nSo, for example, for suit m with numbers [1,3], difference is 2 → possible to add 2 → answer 1.\n\nIf any of these checks pass, then answer is 1.\n\nSo, combining the triplet and sequence possibilities.\n\nSo, if either the triplet possibility is true (there are two same tiles) or the sequence possibility is true (some suit has two numbers with difference <=2, or three numbers with max-min=3), then answer is 1.\n\nElse, answer is 2.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\nFirst, check if current tiles form mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if any of the following is true:\n\n- There is at least two same tiles (so adding one more can form triplet).\n\nOR\n\n- There exists a suit in the original three where:\n\n   a) the count of tiles in that suit is 2, and the two numbers differ by at most 2.\n\n   OR\n\n   b) the count of tiles in that suit is 3, and the max - min is 3 (so adding one tile can fill the gap).\n\nIf any of these is true, then answer is 1. Else, answer is 2.\n\nWait, but for case b), when the count is 3, but max - min is 3. For example, numbers 1,2,4. Then, adding 3 would form a sequence. So that's possible.\n\nSo, for each suit in the original three, check for the following:\n\nIf the count is 2:\n\n   numbers are x and y. Check if |x - y| <= 2 → yes.\n\nIf the count is 3:\n\n   sorted numbers are a, b, c. Check if c - a == 2 → already a sequence (already checked earlier, so no). Or if c - a == 3 → then adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nSo, for example, if the three numbers are 1, 2, 4 → c - a is 3. So adding 3.\n\nSo, in code, for each suit:\n\ngrouped_tiles = group by suit.\n\nfor each suit_group in grouped_tiles.values():\n\n   if len(suit_group) == 3:\n\n       sorted_numbers = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in suit_group])\n\n       if sorted_numbers[2] - sorted_numbers[0] == 3:\n\n           return 1 (possible to add one tile)\n\n   elif len(suit_group) == 2:\n\n       nums = [int(t[0]) for t in suit_group]\n\n       if max(nums) - min(nums) <= 2:\n\n           return 1 (possible to add one tile)\n\nSo, for any of these conditions, then answer is 1.\n\nSo, combining all of this.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef min_tiles_needed(tiles):\n\n    # check if already mentsu\n\n    if is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n        return 0\n\n    # check if can form with one tile\n\n    if can_form_with_one(tiles):\n\n        return 1\n\n    else:\n\n        return 2\n\nNow, implement is_mentsu(tiles):\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    # check same suit\n\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n\n    if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    # same suit, check numbers\n\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n\nThen, can_form_with_one(tiles):\n\ndef can_form_with_one(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet possibility: any tile occurs at least two times?\n\n    counts = {}\n\n    for t in tiles:\n\n        counts[t] = counts.get(t, 0) + 1\n\n    for key, val in counts.items():\n\n        if val >=2:\n\n            return True\n\n    # check sequence possibility\n\n    # group by suit\n\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for t in tiles:\n\n        groups[t[1]].append(t)\n\n    for suit, suit_tiles in groups.items():\n\n        # process each suit group\n\n        if len(suit_tiles) < 2:\n\n            continue\n\n        if len(suit_tiles) == 2:\n\n            nums = [int(t[0]) for t in suit_tiles]\n\n            if max(nums) - min(nums) <= 2:\n\n                return True\n\n        elif len(suit_tiles) == 3:\n\n            nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in suit_tiles])\n\n            if nums[2] - nums[0] == 3:\n\n                return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but for the case where the suit has three tiles, and the max - min is 3. For example, 1,2,4. Then, adding 3 would form a sequence. So, yes.\n\nBut what if the three numbers are 1, 3, 4. Then, max - min is 3. Adding 2 would form a sequence. So yes.\n\nSo this condition captures that.\n\nSo, the can_form_with_one function returns True if either triplet possibility exists (any tile appears at least twice) or the sequence possibility exists (as per the above).\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the three tiles have two in same suit, but with numbers differing by 3. For example, 1m, 4m, 5p. Then, the suit m has two tiles (1 and 4), difference is 3. So can't form a sequence with adding one. But the triplet possibility is no, because there are only two same tiles (but in different suits? No. Wait, in this example, the three tiles are 1m, 4m, 5p. The counts for tiles are 1m once, 4m once, 5p once. So, no tile appears twice. So can_form_with_one would check the suit m group. It has two tiles, 1 and 4. Difference is 3, which is more than 2. So returns false. So can_form_with_one returns false, leading to answer 2.\n\nWhich is correct. Because to form a triplet, need two same tiles. But here, there are none. To form a sequence, need to add two tiles. For example, add 2m and 3m to form 1,2,3. Or add 5m and 6m to form 4,5,6. But that requires two tiles.\n\nSo the answer would be 2.\n\nAnother example: input is ['3p', '9m', '2p'] → the example given in the problem. The output is 1.\n\nOriginal tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\nCheck if is_mentsu: no.\n\nCheck can_form_with_one:\n\nTriplet possibility: check if any tile appears twice. The tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p → 2p and 3p are different. So counts are all 1. So triplet possibility is false.\n\nSequence possibility: group by suit.\n\nSuit p has two tiles: 3p and 2p. So numbers are 2 and 3. Difference is 1. So yes. So can_form_with_one returns True. So answer is 1.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nAnother example: input ['1s', '2s', '3s'] → already a sequence. So answer 0.\n\nAnother example: ['1m', '1m', '2m'] → triplet possibility is true (two 1m). So can_form_with_one returns true. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: ['1m', '1m', '3m'] → triplet possibility is true. So answer 1. But also, the suit m has three tiles. The sorted numbers are 1, 1, 3. The max - min is 2. So in the can_form_with_one function, the code for the suit group with 3 tiles checks if max - min is 3. In this case, it's 2, so no. But the triplet possibility is already handled. So the code returns True.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about the case where the original three tiles have two in same suit, but numbers are 1 and 3. So adding 2 would form a sequence. So can_form_with_one returns True.\n\nAnother case: original three are 1m, 3m, 5m. So, in the same suit. The max - min is 4. So, in the can_form_with_one function, for the suit group with 3 tiles, the code checks if max - min is 3. Which is not. So returns false. Triplet possibility is no (each tile occurs once). So can_form_with_one returns false. So answer is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, because adding two tiles (e.g., 2m and 4m) would form a sequence.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe input is three strings. For example, the sample input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nWait, no. Wait the input is three strings. Wait the input is given as a single line, with three strings. For example, the first example input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's not correct. Wait, the actual input is a single line with three strings. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nThe input is three strings, like \"1s 2s 3s\" (but that's three tiles, but the input is three strings. Wait, no. Wait the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ... etc.\n\nAh, so the input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n1s 2s 3s\n\nBut the sample input shows:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases. For example, the first input is three tiles: 1s, 2s, 3s. The second input is three tiles: 9m, 9m, 9m. The third input is three tiles: 3p, 9m, 2p. And the outputs are 0, 0, 1 respectively.\n\nSo, the code should read a single line of input, split into three strings. For example, the input line is something like:\n\n1s 2s 3s\n\nBut for the sample input, perhaps the input is three separate lines? No. The problem says that the input is a single line with three strings. So, for example, the input could be:\n\n\"1s 2s 3s\"\n\nBut that's three tiles, but the input is three strings. Wait, no. Wait, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid meld (mentsu) in her hand. A valid meld can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Meld**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid meld. This can be done by checking if they form a triplet or a sequence.\n2. **Check for Possible Meld with One Additional Tile**: If the existing tiles do not form a valid meld, check if adding one more tile can form a valid meld. This involves checking:\n   - **Triplet Possibility**: If there are at least two identical tiles, adding one more of the same tile will form a triplet.\n   - **Sequence Possibility**: If there are two tiles in the same suit with numbers that can form a sequence when one more tile is added.\n3. **Default Case**: If neither of the above checks is satisfied, the minimum number of tiles needed is 2.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    tiles = sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()\n    \n    def is_mentsu(tiles):\n        # Check for triplet\n        if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n            return True\n        # Check for sequence\n        suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n        if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n            return False\n        nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n        return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n\n    def can_form_with_one(tiles):\n        # Check for triplet possibility\n        counts = {}\n        for t in tiles:\n            counts[t] = counts.get(t, 0) + 1\n        for key, val in counts.items():\n            if val >= 2:\n                return True\n        # Check for sequence possibility\n        groups = defaultdict(list)\n        for t in tiles:\n            groups[t[1]].append(t)\n        for suit, suit_tiles in groups.items():\n            if len(suit_tiles) < 2:\n                continue\n            if len(suit_tiles) == 2:\n                nums = [int(t[0]) for t in suit_tiles]\n                if max(nums) - min(nums) <= 2:\n                    return True\n            elif len(suit_tiles) == 3:\n                nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in suit_tiles])\n                if nums[2] - nums[0] == 3:\n                    return True\n        return False\n\n    if is_mentsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n    elif can_form_with_one(tiles):\n        print(1)\n    else:\n        print(2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **is_mentsu Function**: This function checks if the given three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence.\n- **can_form_with_one Function**: This function checks if adding one tile can form a valid triplet or sequence. It checks for possible triplets by looking for duplicate tiles and for possible sequences by analyzing the suits and their numerical values.\n- **Main Logic**: The main function reads the input, checks for existing melds, and then checks if adding one tile can form a meld. If neither is possible, it defaults to needing two additional tiles. This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of tiles required using logical checks and grouping by suits.",
