For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C. So each note has a position, and the distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones from the first to the second, moving forward in the sequence.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. Between C and D is 2, etc. But since the notes are cyclic, if I have a note that's before another in the list, like H and C, the distance from H to C is 1 semitone. But when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the minimal way? No, no. Wait the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Because C to C# is 1, D is 2, D# 3, E is 4. So the distance from X to Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? Wait no, because if Y is after X, then it's Y's position minus X's. If Y is before X, then it's (Y's position + 12 - X's position). Because the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. For example, the distance from E to C would be 8 semitones. Because E to F is 1, F to F# 2, etc., up to C. So the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? No, wait. Let me think. Let's assign each note an index. Let's say C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Then, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y + 12 - X). Or equivalently, (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if Y is less than X, then (Y - X) would be negative. But the distance is supposed to be the number of semitones when you go from X up to Y. So for example, if X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones. Which is correct. So the formula for distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y - X + 12). Which can also be written as (Y - X) % 12, but only if we consider that the distance is the minimal number of semitones when moving forward. Wait, no. Because (Y - X) mod 12 gives the same result as (Y - X + 12) % 12. But for example, if Y is 0 (C) and X is 4 (E), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. Wait no, because if Y is larger than X, then (Y - X) mod 12 is just Y - X. So that's correct. So the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured from the lowest to the upper. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So that's exactly (Y - X) mod 12. Because when Y is smaller than X, (Y - X) is negative, but mod 12 makes it positive. So the distance is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semit",
