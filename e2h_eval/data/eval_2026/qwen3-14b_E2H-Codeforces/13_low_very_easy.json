For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to represent the notes and calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order of 12 elements. So, I should assign each note a numerical value based on their position. Like, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, and so on up to H (which is B in some notations, but according to the problem statement, H is the 12th note). Wait, the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, that's 12 notes. Let me count: C (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4), F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11). Then after H comes C again. So each note can be mapped to a number from 0 to 11.\n\nSo the first step is to create a dictionary that maps each note to its corresponding index. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, etc. Then, for any two notes, the distance between them is (y - x) mod 12, but wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. Wait, the problem says: \"the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. So, for example, between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me check: C to C# is 1, C to D is 2, etc. So C to D is 2 semitones. Wait, but the example says C to E is 4 semitones. Let me count: C to C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4). Yes, so that's 4 semitones. So the distance from X to Y is (y - x) mod 12, but since the distance is taken as the number of semitones when moving upwards. But if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (y - x). If X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (y - x + 12) mod 12? Wait no, because the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's see: E to C. Since the notes are cyclic. Let me think: if you go from E upwards to C, that's E to F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8). So yes, 8 semitones. So the distance between E and C is 8. But if we take (y - x) mod 12, where x is E (4) and y is C (0), then (0 - 4) mod 12 is 8. So that's correct. So the distance between X and Y is (y - x) mod 12. Wait, but when you have X and Y, the distance is the number of semitones from X to Y when moving upwards. So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 -4 +12) = 8. So the formula is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + 12). Which can be written as (y -x) % 12. Wait, no. Because (y -x) mod 12 would be (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (y - x) mod 12. But wait, in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is taken as from the lower to upper. So for example, when you have X and Y, the distance is (y -x) mod 12. But if you have X and Y, and you want to find the distance from X to Y, it's (y -x) mod 12. So for example, if X is C and Y is E, that's 4. If X is E and Y is C, then (0 -4) mod ",
