You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number with some given digits from a sequence to make the maximum possible number. Hmm.\n\nSo the problem says that each element in the sequence s can be used at most once. And I can choose any subset of them. The goal is to maximize the number a after replacements. Oh right, and the replacements can be done in any order, but each replacement uses one element from s.\n\nLet me think about the approach. To maximize the number, I should replace the leftmost digits as high as possible. Because the leftmost digits have higher weight. For example, if I have a number like 1024 and s is 010, then the best is to replace the first 1 with 1 (no change?), wait no. Wait the s is '010', which is digits 0, 1, 0. So the example input is a=1024 and s=010. The output is 1124. Oh right, because they replaced the second digit (0) with 1. So the idea is to replace the earliest possible digits with the largest possible digits available.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think:\n\nFirst, we need to sort the sequence s in descending order. Because we want to use the largest digits first. Then, for each position in a, starting from the left, we check if there's a digit in s that is larger than the current digit. If so, replace it with the largest possible available digit, and remove that digit from s. Otherwise, move to the next digit.\n\nWait, but the s is a list of digits. So for example, if s is sorted in descending order, then for each digit in a from left to right, we check if the current digit can be replaced by the largest available digit. If the current digit is less than the largest available, we replace it, and take that digit out of s. Otherwise, we leave it as is.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because replacing a digit with a larger one as early as possible gives the maximum increase.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the s in descending order. So that we can greedily take the largest available digit first.\n\n2. Iterate through each digit in a from left to right.\n\n3. For each digit in a, check if there's a digit in s that's larger than the current digit. If yes, replace it with the largest possible (the first element in the sorted s), and remove that element from s. Else, leave it as is.\n\nBut wait, how to efficiently check and replace? Let's think about the data structures. Since s is sorted in descending order, for each digit in a, we can check if the first element in s is larger than the current digit. If so, replace and remove that element. Otherwise, skip.\n\nBut since the s is sorted, once we have a digit in a that is less than the first element of s, we can replace it. Because the first element is the largest possible. So the algorithm would be:\n\nSort s in descending order.\n\nFor each position i in a's digits:\n\n   if s is not empty and current digit < s[0], then replace current digit with s[0], and pop the first element from s.\n\nElse, do nothing.\n\nThis way, we process the digits left to right, replacing each with the largest possible available digit.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nLet me test this logic against the example.\n\nFirst example input: a is 1024, s is '010' → sorted in descending order is ['1','0','0'].\n\nProcessing each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is '1'. Compare with s[0] which is '1'. Since 1 is not less than 1, we don't replace. So leave it as '1'.\n\nSecond digit is '0'. Compare with s[0] '1'. 0 < 1 → replace. So replace with '1', and s becomes ['0','0'].\n\nThird digit is '2'. Compare with s[0] '0' → 2 > 0, so no replacement.\n\nFourth digit is '4' → same as above. No replacement.\n\nResult is 1124. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example given in the input is the second case: a is 987, s is '1234567'. So sorted s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1'].\n\nProcessing each digit:\n\nFirst digit is '9'. Compare with s[0] '7' → 9 is larger. So no replacement.\n\nSecond digit is '8' → compare with '7' → 8 is larger. No replacement.\n\nThird digit is '7' → compare with '7' → equal. So no replacement. So the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we aim to maximize the value of a given integer `a` by replacing its digits with a sequence of digits `s`, ensuring that each digit in `s` is used at most once. The strategy involves greedy replacement starting from the leftmost digit of `a`, using the largest available digits from `s`.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Sort `s` in Descending Order**: \n   This allows us to always use the largest available digit first, maximizing the impact of each replacement.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Digits of `a` from Left to Right**:\n   For each digit in `a`, compare it with the largest available digit in the sorted list `s`. If the current digit is smaller than the largest available digit in `s`, replace it and remove that digit from `s`.\n\n3. **Construct the Resulting Number**:\n   After processing all digits of `a`, construct the resulting number from the modified digits.\n\nThis approach ensures that the most significant digits (leftmost) are replaced with the largest possible values, thereby maximizing the overall number.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    \n    a = input[0].strip()\n    s = input[1].strip()\n\n    # Sort the digits of s in descending order\n    s_sorted = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n    \n    result = []\n    s_idx = 0\n\n    for digit in a:\n        if s_idx < len(s_sorted) and digit < s_sorted[s_idx]:\n            result.append(s_sorted[s_idx])\n            s_idx += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(digit)\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation**\n\n- **Input Reading**: The code reads the input as two separate lines, one for the number `a` and one for the sequence `s`.\n- **Sorting**: The sequence `s` is sorted in descending order so that we always try to use the largest available digit.\n- **Greedy Replacement**: As we iterate over the digits of `a`, we check if the current digit can be replaced with a larger digit from `s`. If so, we perform the replacement and move to the next digit in `s`.\n- **Output**: Finally, the resulting digits are joined into a string and printed.\n\nThis solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where `n` is the length of the sequence `s`. The rest of the operations are linear, making the algorithm suitable even for large inputs up to 10⁵ characters.",
