There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given this rule about the players' previous game counts differing by at most one. Hmm.\n\nSo the problem says that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by no more than one. And the winner has to win all their games. So I need to figure out the maximum possible number of games the winner can have, given n players.\n\nLet me think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the first game is between 1 and 2, then the winner (player 1) has 1 game. Then player 3 hasn't played yet. So the next game is between player 1 (1 game) and player 3 (0 games). The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's allowed. Hence, answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the sample output is 2. Why can't the winner play 3 games? Let's see. Let's imagine the winner plays 3 games. That would require that each time, the opponent's game count is within one. Let's think. Let's say the winner plays 3 games. So first, he plays someone (game count 1). Then, he needs to play another game. The opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. Suppose he beats someone else. Then, for the third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the structure of the tournament is such that the winner has to face opponents who have played a certain number of games. Let me think recursively. Maybe the maximum number of games the winner can play is related to the Fibonacci sequence? Because each time, the number of players required to reach a certain number of games for the winner might follow a pattern.\n\nLike, for example, if the winner plays k games, then each time he plays, he must have opponents that are in a state where their game counts are within one. So for the first game, the opponent is a player who has 0 games. Then, after that, the winner has 1 game. For the next game, the opponent can be someone with 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the winner needs to have opponents that have as many games as possible. So maybe the structure is such that each time, the winner's path requires that there are enough players to form a tree where each step allows for the next game.\n\nAlternatively, think about the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have k games. Let's denote f(k) as the minimal number of players required so that the winner can play k games. Then, the problem becomes finding the maximum k such that f(k) ≤ n.\n\nWhat's f(k)? Let's think:\n\nFor k=0, it's impossible since there's no game. But for k=1, you need 2 players. So f(1)=2.\n\nFor k=2: The winner plays two games. The first game is against someone (so 2 players). Then, the second game must be against someone who has played 0 or 1 games. But how can that happen? Let's think. The winner has played one game. To have a second game, he must face an opponent who has played 0 or 1 games. For example, in the case of n=3, the winner plays two games. So for k=2, the minimal number of players is 3. So f(2)=3.\n\nWait, but for k=2, how do you get that? Let me think again. The winner plays two games. The first game is against one player. Then, the second game is against another player. But how can that player have played 0 or 1 games? Well, if that player is someone who has not played before. But in that case, the winner's first game was against player A, then the second game is against player B. But how does that work? Because in that case, the second game's opponent has 0 games. So the difference is 1 (since the winner has 1 game). That's allowed.\n\nBut for that scenario, the total players is 2 (the winner and player A) plus player B, making 3 players. So yes, f(2) = 3.\n\nNow for k=3. How can the winner play three games? Let's think. The first game is against someone. Then, the second game must be against someone who has played 0 or 1 games. Let's say the winner plays against someone else. Then, for the third game, the opponent must have played",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given the constraint that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight here is recognizing that the problem can be approached using a recursive strategy based on the Fibonacci sequence. The idea is to find the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games. This minimum number of players follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the previous two terms.\n\n1. **Recursive Insight**: Let `f(k)` represent the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play `k` games. The recurrence relation is:\n   - `f(0) = 1` (no game needed, only one player)\n   - `f(1) = 2` (two players for one game)\n   - `f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)` for `k > 1`\n\n2. **Binary Search**: Since the number of players `n` can be very large (up to 10^18), we use binary search to efficiently determine the maximum number of games `k` such that `f(k) <= n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef max_games(n):\n    # Precompute the Fibonacci-like sequence until it exceeds n\n    fib = [1, 2]\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_val)\n    \n    # The maximum k is the index of the last value in fib that is <= n\n    # Since fib[0] corresponds to k=0, fib[1] to k=1, etc.\n    # So the answer is len(fib) - 1\n    # However, we need to check if the last element is <= n\n    if fib[-1] > n:\n        return len(fib) - 2\n    else:\n        return len(fib) - 1\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Sequence**: We generate a sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games. This sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence starting with `f(0) = 1` and `f(1) = 2`.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: Instead of generating all possible values up to `n`, we use a loop to generate the sequence until the next value exceeds `n`. This allows us to efficiently determine the maximum number of games the winner can play by checking the length of the generated sequence.\n\n3. **Edge Handling**: If the last computed value in the sequence exceeds `n`, we adjust the result to the previous index, ensuring we do not exceed the available number of players.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using a linear sequence generation and ensures optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
