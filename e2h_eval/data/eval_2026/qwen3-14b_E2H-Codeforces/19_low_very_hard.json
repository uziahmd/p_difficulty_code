The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are:\n\n1. The districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So the initial structure is a tree.\n2. After removing k districts, the remaining n - k districts must form a connected subtree.\n3. We need to maximize the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute more. So ideally, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nWait, but how do we balance between keeping high-numbered districts and ensuring connectivity? Because if we have a high-numbered district, but it's connected through lower ones, maybe we need to decide which ones to remove.\n\nLet me think: since the sum is maximized when we keep the largest possible numbers, perhaps the optimal strategy is to keep the largest (n - k) districts, but in a way that they form a connected subtree. However, just keeping the largest ones may not be connected. For example, if the largest districts are spread out in the tree, we might need to remove some lower ones to connect them.\n\nBut how can we find which districts to remove?\n\nAn alternative approach: think of this as selecting a subtree with (n -k) nodes, such that the sum of 2^i is maximum. Since 2^i is strictly increasing, the optimal solution would be to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but ensuring connectivity.\n\nSo perhaps the problem reduces to selecting the highest possible nodes, and then ensuring that they are connected. But how?\n\nAnother thought: since the sum is maximized by keeping the highest-numbered districts, maybe we can start by trying to keep the highest (n -k) districts and check if they form a connected subtree. If they do, then we can just remove the others. If not, we need to find which districts to remove to make them connected.\n\nBut how to check if the highest (n -k) districts are connected? Well, perhaps we can model this as a graph problem where we need to select a subset of nodes that includes the highest possible ones and forms a connected component.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use a greedy approach. Since higher-numbered districts are better, we can try to keep the largest ones and remove the smaller ones, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that? Let's think of the tree as being rooted at some node. Maybe we can perform a traversal and prioritize keeping higher-numbered nodes.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm or some kind of priority-based selection. Let's think of the problem as building a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and then pruning the lower ones.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the optimal set of districts to keep is a subtree that includes all the districts from some set S where S has size (n -k), and S contains the largest possible numbers. However, the problem is that these nodes might not be connected. So we need to find the maximum subset S of size (n -k) that is connected, and which has the maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nBut how to find such a subset?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the tree. Since the tree is connected, and we need to choose a connected subset of (n -k) nodes. To maximize the sum, we should prefer nodes with higher numbers. Therefore, the optimal subset is the one that includes the (n -k) highest-numbered nodes, but connected. However, if those nodes are not connected, we need to remove some lower-numbered nodes and include higher ones.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to remove?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we want to remove the smallest possible number of nodes (but exactly k) such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. But since we have to remove exactly k, maybe we can think of the problem as selecting the nodes to keep, which are (n -k) in number, connected, and with the maximum sum.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a problem where we need to select a subtree of size m = n -k. The sum is maximized when the subtree includes the largest m nodes possible. However, if those nodes are not connected, we need to find the minimal number of nodes to add (from lower-numbered ones) to connect them, but that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can perform a process similar to the following: we want to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So, starting from the highest",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight here is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we should prioritize keeping them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since the fan count for district `i` is `2^i`, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: After selecting the highest-numbered districts, we need to ensure they form a connected subtree. If they don't, we need to remove some lower-numbered districts to maintain connectivity while maximizing the fan count.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Starting from the highest-numbered node and performing a depth-first search (DFS) to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n2. Removing the lowest-numbered nodes that are not part of the connected subtree formed by the highest-numbered nodes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    m = n - k\n    included = [False] * (n + 1)\n    removed = []\n\n    # We want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible\n    # Start from the highest node and perform a DFS to mark included nodes\n    # But we need to ensure that we have exactly m nodes\n\n    # First, try to include the highest possible nodes\n    # We can use a priority queue approach, but here we'll do a greedy DFS starting from the largest\n\n    # Let's collect all nodes in a list and sort them in descending order\n    nodes = list(range(1, n+1))\n    nodes.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # We'll use a visited array to track which nodes are included\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    count = 0\n\n    def dfs(u, parent):\n        nonlocal count\n        if visited[u]:\n            return\n        visited[u] = True\n        count += 1\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if v != parent:\n                dfs(v, u)\n\n    # We need to find the maximum set of nodes that includes the highest ones and forms a connected component\n    # We start with the highest node and expand as much as possible\n\n    # Try to include the highest node first\n    start = nodes[0]\n    dfs(start, -1)\n    if count >= m:\n        # Now, we need to remove the smallest nodes not in the included set\n        # But since we may have more than m nodes, we need to trim down to m\n        # However, the initial DFS includes the largest possible connected component starting from the highest node\n        # So we need to remove the smallest nodes not in this component\n        included_nodes = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if visited[i]]\n        if len(included_nodes) > m:\n            # We need to remove some nodes from the included_nodes, but which ones?\n            # Since we need to keep the largest m nodes, we can sort included_nodes in descending order and keep the first m\n            included_nodes.sort(reverse=True)\n            included_set = set(included_nodes[:m])\n            # Now, the nodes not in included_set are to be removed\n            # Also, nodes not in the original included_nodes (from the initial DFS) must be removed\n            # Wait, no.

These nodes form the optimal set to maximize the fan count.\n4. **Determine Removals**: The nodes not in the selected top `m` are marked for removal and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the fan count by prioritizing higher-numbered districts while maintaining connectivity through a depth-first search traversal.",
