The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every two districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nSo the key here is to maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, the higher-numbered districts have much larger values. So our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring the remaining districts are connected.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure connectivity? Because if we just keep the highest possible districts, maybe they are not connected. For example, if the tree is structured such that higher-numbered nodes are in separate branches. So we need to find a connected subtree with (n - k) nodes, which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nThis seems similar to finding a subtree of size (n -k) that maximizes the sum of 2^i. But how?\n\nLet me think: Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible numbers, perhaps we can approach this by greedily selecting the largest nodes, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut how to do that? One approach might be to start with the highest-numbered node and then include as many higher-numbered nodes as possible, making sure that the subtree remains connected.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as choosing which nodes to remove. Since we need to remove k nodes, perhaps we can model this as selecting the nodes to keep, which are n -k in number, forming a connected subtree, and maximizing their sum.\n\nBut how to select those nodes efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the tree. Since the sum depends on the node numbers, the optimal strategy would be to keep the highest possible nodes. However, they need to be connected. So perhaps we can perform a process where we start from the highest node and then build up the connected component by including as many high nodes as possible.\n\nAnother idea: The problem resembles finding a tree with certain constraints. Since the tree is connected, and we want to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible, perhaps we can perform a priority-based selection. For example, using a priority queue (max-heap) approach, but considering the nodes' importance and their connections.\n\nWait, here's an approach inspired by Krusky's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. Let me think:\n\nWe can model this as a problem where we want to select a subset of nodes of size (n -k), connected, with maximum sum. Since each node's value is 2^i, which is unique and increases with i, the optimal subset would be the (n -k) largest nodes, but connected. However, if those nodes are not connected, we have to remove some lower ones and include others to maintain connectivity.\n\nBut how to find the subset?\n\nAn alternative approach: Since the nodes with higher numbers have higher values, we want to keep them. However, if they are not connected, we need to remove some lower-numbered nodes that are necessary to connect them. Wait, but maybe the way to do this is to start with all nodes except the smallest k, but then check if they are connected. If not, we need to remove some of the lower ones and include some higher ones. But that seems complicated.\n\nAnother thought: Since the tree is connected, the minimal way to keep a connected subset is to have a spanning tree. But here, we need to choose a subset of nodes (size s = n -k) that is connected. How to choose them optimally?\n\nLet me consider that the optimal subset must contain the highest possible nodes. So perhaps we can do a greedy approach where we start with the highest node and then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the existing subset.\n\nWait, but how to do that? For example, suppose we have a tree where node 6 is connected to node 2, which is connected to node 1, and node 2 is connected to node 3, etc. If we want to keep the largest nodes, say 6,5,4, then we need to make sure that they are connected. If they are not connected, we need to include some other nodes.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as removing k nodes. The nodes we remove should be the ones with the smallest numbers, but only if they are not necessary for the connectivity of the higher-numbered nodes. However, how to determine which nodes are necessary?\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe we can model this as a problem of choosing which nodes to remove, starting from the smallest ones. Because if we can remove the smallest nodes first, that allows us to keep the larger ones. But how to ensure that after removal, the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nWe can think of the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts' contestants to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. Given the exponential growth of fan numbers with district numbers, our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since the number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`, higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more. Thus, we aim to retain the highest-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the retained districts form a connected component. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered district and iteratively adding the next highest-numbered districts that are connected to the current component.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n\n    # We need to select (n - k) nodes with maximum values, connected.\n    # Strategy: Start from the largest node, then use BFS/DFS to collect as many large nodes as possible.\n    # But we need to find which nodes to remove.\n\n    # We will use a priority queue (max heap) approach, but since Python's heapq is min-heap, we invert the values.\n    # However, the key is to select the nodes to keep, ensuring connectivity.\n\n    # Let's think of it as building a subtree with (n -k) nodes, starting with the largest nodes.\n    # We can use a greedy approach with BFS or DFS.\n\n    # Step 1: Find all nodes that are not to be removed.

This helps in collecting the largest possible districts while maintaining connectivity.\n3. **Tracking Kept Nodes**: Nodes are added to the set of kept nodes until we have exactly `n - k` nodes. The remaining nodes are marked for removal.\n4. **Output**: The districts to be removed are sorted and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by keeping the highest possible districts while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining districts.",
