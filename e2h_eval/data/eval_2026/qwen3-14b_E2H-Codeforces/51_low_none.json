Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is to take the first two strings (guest and host), concatenate them, then check if the third string (pile) is a permutation of that concatenated string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to count the frequency of each character in the combined guest+host string, and compare it with the frequency in the pile string.\n\nFor example, if guest is \"SANTA\" and host is \"CLAU\", then combined is \"SANTACLAU\". The pile should have exactly those letters. So, for each character in the combined string, the count should match the pile's count.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input.\n2. Combine the first two into a single string.\n3. Check if the combined string and the third string have the same character counts.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nWe can use the collections.Counter class. Counter creates a dictionary-like object with counts of each element. So, if we create Counter for the combined string and Counter for the pile, then compare them. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both Counters have the same keys and same counts, then they are equal.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where the lengths are different? Like, if the combined length is not equal to the pile's length. For example, if guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → yes. But if pile is \"A\", then the lengths differ, so the counts can't be same. So the Counter comparison would automatically handle that, since the counts would differ. So the code should work.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ → let's count letters.\n\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let's see. Let me check the counts.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly compare them.\n\nIn the first sample, the output is YES.\n\nSecond example:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL\nHost: JOULUPUKKI\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nWait, the sample says that in the second case, there's a missing P and an extra L. So the code would detect that. Because Counter would have different counts.\n\nThird example: guest is BABBONATALE, host is FATHERCHRISTMAS. Combined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let's see, the combined length is len(\"BABBONATALE\") + len(\"FATHERCHRISTMAS\") → let's compute:\n\nBABBONATALE is 10 letters? Let me count: B A B B O N A T A L E → that's 11 letters? Wait, maybe I should not get into that. The code will handle it.\n\nBut in the sample, the pile has an extra L. So the Counter would have an extra L in the pile, so the counts would differ.\n\nSo the code would return NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when the combined string and the pile have same length but different characters? For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → yes. But if pile is \"AA\", then the counts would be different. So the code would return NO.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is three lines. But in the sample input given, the input is a list of three elements. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is three lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Character Count Comparison**: Use a character count comparison to check if the pile of letters can be rearranged to form the combined names. This is efficiently done using Python's `collections.Counter` which counts the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile. If the counts match, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three lines from input\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Combine guest and host names\n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    # Compare the character counts\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure proper handling of input.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to form the expected set of characters.\n- **Character Counting**: Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile. If these counts match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, hence the output is \"YES\". If they do not match, the output is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact presence and count of each character, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
