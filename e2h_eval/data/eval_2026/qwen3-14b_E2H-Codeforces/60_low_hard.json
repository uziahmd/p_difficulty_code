Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about Morse code representations and counting the number of valid sequences of English letters that can be formed from substrings of a growing string S. Each time we append a 0 or 1 to S, we have to compute the answer after each step.\n\nThe key points here are:\n\n- Each English letter is represented by a Morse code string of length 1-4, made of 0s and 1s. But there are 4 invalid codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". All others are valid.\n\nSo, for any substring of S, if it's a valid Morse code (i.e., not in the invalid list and length between 1-4), then it represents a letter. The task is to count all possible non-empty sequences of such letters. However, the sequences are formed by concatenating these letters, but each letter is represented by a substring of S. Wait, no. Wait the problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So each such sequence is a collection of letters whose Morse code representations are substrings of S. But how? For example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\". Each of these substrings that are valid Morse codes (i.e., not in the invalid list) corresponds to a letter. Then, the sequences are all possible ways to split the substrings into valid Morse code letters. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Hmm, perhaps each sequence is a collection of letters where their concatenation forms a substring of S. Or maybe each individual letter's Morse code is a substring of S. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the note.\n\nIn the first sample, S is \"111\". The valid substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\" (each of which is valid). The sequences are all possible combinations of these letters. For example, \"T\" is one letter, \"TT\" is two letters (each T's code is \"1\"), so their concatenation would be \"11\", which is a substring of S. So the count includes all possible ways to split the entire S into valid Morse code letters, but also any possible substrings that can be split into valid codes?\n\nWait, no. The problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So for example, if a substring of S is a valid Morse code (i.e., corresponds to a letter), then that's a single-letter sequence. Also, if there's a way to split a substring into multiple letters (each of which is valid), then each such split counts as a sequence. But how do we count all possibilities?\n\nWait, the note in the first sample says that after appending three 1s, the answer is 7. The explanation lists 7 different sequences. Let's look at that:\n\nThey have:\n\n- \"T\" (1)\n- \"M\" (11)\n- \"O\" (111)\n- \"TT\" (1+1 = 11)\n- \"TM\" (1+11 = 111)\n- \"MT\" (11+1 = 111)\n- \"TTT\" (1+1+1 = 111)\n\nSo each of these sequences corresponds to a way of splitting a substring of S into valid Morse code letters. However, each of these sequences is counted once. But how do we count all possible such sequences?\n\nWait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So each such sequence is a sequence of letters, where the concatenation of their Morse codes is a substring of S. But each of these sequences is considered as long as their combined Morse code is a substring of S. So for example, if the substring \"11\" is present in S, then it can represent either the letter 'M' (as a single letter) or two Ts (as two letters). Both are counted as separate sequences.\n\nTherefore, the total count is the sum over all possible substrings of S (each of which is a valid Morse code string) of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters. Wait, but that seems computationally heavy. Because for every substring of S, we need to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a growing string `S` in Morse code after each modification. Each modification appends either a '0' (dot) or '1' (dash) to the string `S`, and we must compute the result after each modification.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: First, identify valid Morse code strings. These are all binary strings of length 1 to 4 except for the four invalid ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string `S`. This helps efficiently compute the number of valid sequences after each modification.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, use modulo $10^9 + 7$ to keep numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    S = []\n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    # dp[i] will represent the number of valid sequences ending at position i\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    total = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        c = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n        S.append(c)\n        current = ''.join(S)\n        \n        # Check all possible substrings ending at position i\n        # We need to check substrings of length 1 to 4\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i - l >= 0:\n                substr = current[-l:]\n                if substr not in invalid:\n                    # The number of sequences ending here is 1 (the substr itself)\n                    # plus the sum of dp[i - l] (the ways to form sequences before)\n                    if l == 1:\n                        add = 1\n                    else:\n                        add = dp[i - l]\n                    dp[i] = (dp[i] + add) % MOD\n        \n        # The total is the sum of all dp entries up to i\n        total = (total + dp[i]) % MOD\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, with the first line indicating the number of modifications.\n2. **String Construction**: The string `S` is built incrementally by appending each character ('0' or '1') as it is read.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string. For each new character added, we check all possible substrings ending at that position (lengths 1 to 4).\n4. **Validity Check**: Each substring is checked against the set of invalid Morse codes. If valid, it contributes to the count of valid sequences.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: All calculations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of valid sequences after each modification, leveraging dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations and ensure optimal performance.",
