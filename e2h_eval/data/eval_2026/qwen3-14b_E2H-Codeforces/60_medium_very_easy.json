Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending 0s and 1s. After each append, we need to calculate the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. But there are some forbidden Morse codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring that matches one of these four is invalid and shouldn't be counted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The key here is that each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4, not in the forbidden list) corresponds to a unique letter. So any substring of S that is a valid Morse code string contributes to the count. However, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". Wait, but sequences of letters. For example, if a substring is \"11\", which is a valid code (say for 'M'), then that's one letter. But if there's another substring that is \"1\" (say 'T'), then combining them as \"T\" followed by \"M\" would be a sequence of two letters. But how does that translate into the count?\n\nWait, the problem says \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Oh, right! So each such sequence is a way of splitting a substring of S into Morse code letters. For example, if the substring is \"111\", it can be split as \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" (three letters), or \"11\" + \"1\" (two letters), or \"1\" + \"11\" (two letters), or \"111\" (one letter). Each of these splits corresponds to a different sequence of letters. So the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S (each of which is a valid Morse code string) multiplied by the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse codes. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each sequence of letters is represented by some substring. So for example, if the substring is \"11\", which is a valid code, then that represents one sequence (a single letter). If there's a longer substring that can be split into multiple valid codes, like \"111\" can be split in multiple ways, each of which is a different sequence. So the total count is the number of all possible ways to split any substring of S into valid Morse codes, considering all possible substrings and their splits.\n\nBut how do we compute that efficiently?\n\nThis seems similar to dynamic programming problems where we track the number of ways to split a string up to a certain position. Let me think. Let's consider that for each position in the string S, we can track the number of valid sequences that end at that position. Then, for each new character added to S, we can check all possible prefixes ending at this position that form valid Morse codes, and add the number of ways from previous positions.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's say dp[i] is the number of valid sequences that can be formed using the first i characters of S. Then, when we add a new character (so the length becomes i+1), we can look back at positions j where the substring from j+1 to i+1 forms a valid Morse code. For each such j, we can add dp[j] + 1 (the +1 is for the case where the substring from j+1 to i+1 is a single letter). Wait, maybe the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k} (dp[k] + 1) for each k where the substring from k+1 to i is a valid code.\n\nWait, no. Because each valid code that ends at position i can be combined with previous sequences. For example, if there's a valid code ending at i of length l (so starting at i-l+1), then the number of sequences ending at i is equal to the number of sequences ending at i-l (if any) plus 1 (the new code itself). So the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum (dp[i - l] + 1) for each valid l (length of code, 1-4) where the substring ending at i of length l is valid.\n\nBut since the current code can be added to previous sequences. For example, if there's a valid code of length 1 at position i, then the number of sequences ending at i is dp[i-1] (the number of sequences up to i-1) plus 1 (the new code itself). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe total number of sequences up to position i is equal to the total number of sequences up to i-1 plus the number of new sequences that end at i. The new sequences that end at i are those that can be formed by splitting the substring ending at i into valid codes. For example, if the last code is of length 1, then the number of sequences ending at i is dp[i-1] + 1? No, perhaps dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (number of new sequences added by the current position).\n\nAlternatively, the standard approach for counting the number of ways to split a string into valid codes is to use dynamic programming. Let's think of dp[i] as the number of valid splits for the first i characters. Then, for each i, we check all possible lengths l (1-4) such that the substring ending at i of length l is valid. Then dp[i] = sum(dp[i - l] for each valid l) + (if the substring of length l is valid, then adding 1 for the case where the entire substring is taken as a single code? Or maybe not. Wait, the initial condition is that dp[0] = 1 (empty string has one way to split, which is nothing). Then, for each i, dp[i] = sum over l=1 to 4 (if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then dp[i - l]).\n\nWait, that's the standard approach. For example, in the problem of climbing stairs where you can take 1 or 2 steps, etc. So in this case, the number of ways to split the first i characters is the sum over all possible valid codes that end at i, and for each such code, the number of ways is dp[i - l], where l is the length of the code.\n\nBut in our problem, we need to count all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid codes. Wait, no. The problem says that the sequences are represented by some substring of S. So each such sequence is a way of splitting a substring of S into valid codes. Therefore, the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S of the number of ways to split that substring into valid codes.\n\nWait, that's a different problem. Because the original approach (the dp[i] as the number of splits for the first i characters) counts the number of splits for the entire string up to i. But here, we need to count for all possible substrings of S, the number of splits of that substring into valid codes. So the total answer is the sum for all possible substrings of S, of the number of ways to split that substring into valid codes.\n\nThat sounds computationally expensive. For example, if S has length n, then there are O(n^2) substrings. For each substring, we need to compute the number of ways to split it into valid codes. But with m up to 3000, and each S being built step by step, this approach would be too slow.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to track this. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that whenever a new character is added to S (so the length increases by 1), we can find all possible substrings that end at this new position and compute their contributions to the total count. For example, when the string is S = s_1 s_2 ... s_n, after adding the nth character, we can look at all possible substrings that end at position n. Each such substring is s_k ... s_n for k ranging from 1 to n. For each of these substrings, we can compute the number of ways to split them into valid Morse codes and add that to the total.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following. Let's maintain a dp array where dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the first i characters of the current string S into valid codes. Then, the total number of sequences is the sum of dp[i] for i from 1 to len(S), because each dp[i] counts the number of ways to split the first i characters into valid codes. But wait, that's not correct. Because the dp[i] counts the number of ways to split the entire first i characters into valid codes. But the problem requires counting all possible substrings, not just the entire string. So this approach would miss the substrings that are not the entire string.\n\nHmm. So the total answer is the sum for all possible substrings of S, of the number of ways to split that substring into valid codes. How can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAnother idea: For each position i in the string, and for each possible length l (from 1 to 4), if the substring ending at i with length l is valid, then we can add the number of ways to split the substring up to i - l, and then add 1 (the case where the substring is taken as a single code). Wait, but this seems similar to the standard problem of counting the number of ways to split the entire string. However, here, we need to count all possible substrings, not just the entire string.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this with a dynamic programming approach where we track for each position i, the number of ways to split all substrings ending at i. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have a variable total that accumulates the answer. For each new character added, we look back at possible positions where a valid code could end here. For example, when adding the new character to make the string length n, we check for each possible l (1-4) whether the substring of length l ending at n is valid. For each such l, we can add the number of ways to split the substring ending at n - l (i.e., the number of ways to split the part before this code) and then add 1 (for the case where this code is a single letter). But how does this contribute to the total?\n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose we have a string of length 3, and the new character makes it length 3. For l=1, the substring is the last character. The number of ways to split this substring is 1 (just the code itself). For l=2, if the substring is valid, then the number of ways is the number of ways to split the first 1 characters (if any) plus 1 (the code itself). Wait, no. For the substring of length 2 ending at position 3, the number of ways to split it is dp[1] + 1? Or is it the value of dp[1] (the number of ways to split the first 1 characters) plus 1 (the new code)?\n\nWait, in the standard problem, the number of ways to split the first i characters is dp[i] = sum_{l} (dp[i - l] if the substring of length l ending at i is valid). But for the substring of length l ending at i, the number of ways to split that substring is dp_substring, which is the same as the dp[i] in the standard problem but for the substring. However, since the substring is from position (i - l + 1) to i, perhaps we can model this with a different DP.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let's define for each position i, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. Let's call this array ways. So ways[i] is the number of ways to split the substring s[1..i] into valid codes. Then, the total answer is the sum of ways[i] for all i from 1 to current length. However, that's only considering the entire prefix. But the problem requires considering all possible substrings. For example, if the entire string is of length 3, the substrings are s[1], s[2], s[3], s[1-2], s[2-3], s[1-3]. Each of these substrings contributes their own ways.\n\nSo if we can find for each possible substring [a..b], the number of ways to split it into valid codes, then the total answer is the sum of all those numbers. However, computing that directly for each step is O(n^2) per step, which for m=3000 steps would be O(m^3) time, which is too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: For each new character added to the string, we can compute for all possible substrings that end at this new position. For example, when the new character is added, making the string length n, the new substrings that end at n are [n], [n-1, n], [n-2, n], [n-3, n], provided that the length is at least 1. For each of these substrings, we can compute the number of ways to split them into valid codes. Then, adding these to the total.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each new character, checking the substrings ending at the new position, and for each such substring, compute the number of ways to split it into valid codes.\n\nNow, how to compute this efficiently. Let's think of for each position i, and for each possible length l (up to 4), we check if the substring ending at i of length l is valid. Then, the number of ways to split that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i - l, plus 1 (if the substring is valid). Wait, no. For example, the substring from i - l + 1 to i. To split it, we can take the code of length l (which is valid) and then add the number of ways to split the substring before that. But the substring before that is from 1 to i - l. However, this is only for the entire substring. But in our case, the substring is from a to i. So perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, and for each possible l (1-4), if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of ways to split that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i - l, plus 1 (the case where the entire substring is taken as one code). However, this would only account for the ways that include the current code. But how to track this?\n\nLet me think of a dynamic programming array, say, dp[i], which represents the number of ways to split the substring ending at position i. For example, dp[i] is the number of ways to split the substring s[1..i], but this is the same as the standard problem. However, if we want to compute the number of ways for all possible substrings, perhaps we can use a similar approach but track for each position i, and for each possible start position j, but that's again O(n^2) which is too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: For each position i, the number of ways to split all substrings that end at i is equal to the sum over l (valid lengths) of (dp_prev + 1), where dp_prev is the number of ways to split the substring ending at i - l. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nFor example, if I have a substring ending at i of length l. Let's call this substring s. The number of ways to split s into valid codes is equal to the number of ways to split the substring s[1..i-l] (if l is the length of the code) plus 1. Wait, no. Because the substring s is of length l. So if l is 1, then the number of ways is 1. If l is 2 and the substring is valid, then the number of ways is 1 (the whole substring) plus the number of ways to split the first part (but there's no first part here, since the substring is of length 2). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me take an example. Let's say the substring is of length 3, and it can be split into valid codes. For example, suppose the substring is \"111\". The valid codes are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\". So the number of ways to split this substring is:\n\n- Take \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" → 1 way.\n\n- Take \"1\" + \"11\" → 1 way.\n\n- Take \"11\" + \"1\" → 1 way.\n\n- Take \"111\" → 1 way.\n\nTotal 4 ways.\n\nBut according to the standard dynamic programming approach, for the entire string of length 3, dp[3] would be the sum of dp[2] (if the code of length 1 is valid) + dp[1] (if the code of length 2 is valid) + dp[0] (if code of length 3 is valid). Assuming that all are valid, dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] + dp[0]. Let's assume dp[0] = 1 (base case). Then dp[1] = dp[0] = 1 (since code of length 1 is valid). dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0] (if codes of length 1 and 2 are valid). So dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2. dp[3] = dp[2] + dp[1] + dp[0] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4, which matches the example. So yes, the standard approach works.\n\nSo the number of ways to split a substring of length l ending at position i is given by the same dynamic programming approach. But how can we compute this for all possible substrings?\n\nIf we can maintain for each position i, the number of ways to split the entire string up to i, then for each new character added, we can compute the new dp[i], and the total answer would be the sum of all dp[j] for j from 1 to i. But this is only considering the entire prefixes. However, the problem requires considering all possible substrings, not just the prefixes. So this approach would not work.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is equivalent to considering all possible substrings, and the total number of ways is the sum over all possible substrings of the number of ways to split that substring. How can we model this?\n\nLet me think of another dynamic programming approach. Let's define for each position i, the number of ways to split all substrings that end at i. Let's call this array ways. Then, the total answer is the sum of all ways[i] for each i.\n\nHow to compute ways[i]?\n\nFor each i, we look back at possible lengths l (1-4). For each l, if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i - l (ways[i - l]) plus 1. Wait, no. Because ways[i - l] is the sum of all ways for substrings ending at i - l. But the current substring of length l is a new substring that can be added. For example, if the substring ending at i is of length l, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i - l, and then adding the current code. Wait, no. For example, if the substring is of length l, then the number of ways to split it is equal to the number of ways to split the part before it (if any) plus 1. But the part before is the substring ending at i - l. However, that's not directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, for the substring that ends at i and has length l, the number of ways to split it is equal to the dp value of the substring. Which is computed as follows: for the substring of length l, the number of ways is the same as the dp[l] for that particular substring. But how to track that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's another way. Let's think about the contribution of each new character. When we add a new character to the end of S, making it length n, we can look at all possible substrings that end at n and have length between 1 and 4. For each such substring, we can compute the number of ways to split it into valid codes, and add that to the total answer.\n\nSo for each new step, the total answer increases by the sum of the number of ways to split all new substrings that end at the current position.\n\nSo for example, after adding the i-th character, we check for l in 1..4:\n\n- if the substring ending at i with length l is valid, then we compute the number of ways to split this substring and add it to the total.\n\nBut how do we compute this number of ways for each such substring?\n\nLet's think of a dynamic programming table that tracks for each position i, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. Let's call this dp[i]. Then, dp[i] is the sum of dp[i - l] for each valid l (if the substring ending at i of length l is valid) plus 1 (the case where the entire substring is considered as one code).\n\nWait, this seems familiar. For example, if the current position is i, then dp[i] = sum (dp[i - l] for all l where the substring of length l ending at i is valid) + 1? Or is it sum (dp[i - l] for all valid l) ?\n\nWait, in the standard problem where the entire string is considered, dp[i] = sum (dp[i - l] for l where the substring ending at i of length l is valid). And the base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty string). So for example, if the current substring is of length l, then dp[i] = dp[i - l] + ... ?\n\nLet me take the example where the current substring is of length 1. Then dp[1] = dp[0] = 1. Which represents the one way to split the substring of length 1 (as a single code). Similarly, if the substring of length 2 is valid, then dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0], assuming that both l=1 and l=2 are valid. But dp[0] is 1, which represents the case where we take the entire substring of length 2 as a single code. So the formula is dp[i] = sum (dp[i - l] for l in 1..4 if the substring ending at i of length l is valid). And the base case is dp[0] = 1.\n\nSo, with this dp array, the number of ways to split the substring ending at position i is dp[i]. However, this is the number of ways to split the entire first i characters of the string. But in our problem, we need to count all possible substrings. However, if we can maintain for each position i, the value of dp[i], and then for each new character, add to the total the value of dp[i], but how does that account for all substrings?\n\nWait, no. Because dp[i] is the number of ways to split the entire first i characters. But the substrings that end at i are all the substrings [k..i] for k from 1 to i. However, the dp[i] is only for the entire first i characters. So that's not directly helpful.\n\nBut here's an idea: The total number of valid sequences is the sum over all possible substrings [a..b] of the number of ways to split [a..b]. Now, each such substring [a..b] can be considered as the first b characters of a modified string that starts at a. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For each position i, when we add a new character, we can compute the number of ways to split all substrings that end at i. Then, the total answer is the sum of all these values for all positions up to the current one.\n\nSo, for example, after adding the i-th character, the new substrings that end at i are [i], [i-1, i], [i-2, i], [i-3, i], provided that the length is >= 1. For each of these substrings, we need to compute the number of ways to split them into valid codes. The sum of these is the amount added to the total answer in this step.\n\nNow, how to compute the number of ways to split each of these substrings?\n\nLet's take the substring [j..i], where j = i - l + 1, for l from 1 to 4. For each such l, if the substring is valid, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the dp value of the substring [j..i], which can be computed using the same dynamic programming approach as before, but for this specific substring.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently? We need to find for each possible substring [j..i], the number of ways to split it. But maintaining this for every possible [j..i] is O(n^2) time and space, which for m=3000 would be 9 million operations, which may be manageable.\n\nBut how can we compute this for each possible [j..i]?\n\nLet's think of another dynamic programming array. Let's define for each position i, and for each possible length l (1-4), we check if the substring ending at i of length l is valid. If so, then we can compute the number of ways to split that substring as follows:\n\nFor the substring of length l ending at i, the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i - l (if any) plus 1. Wait, no. Because the substring of length l can be split in ways that depend on the previous splits. For example, if the substring is of length l, then the number of ways to split it is equal to the same as the dp value for that substring. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, and for each possible l (1-4), we can compute the number of ways to split the substring ending at i with length l. Let's call this value ways_l[i]. Then, for each i, the total contribution to the answer is the sum of ways_l[i] for all l where the substring is valid.\n\nBut how to compute ways_l[i]?\n\nWell, for a substring of length l ending at i, the number of ways to split it is equal to the number of ways to split the substring of length l-1 (if possible) plus the number of ways to split the previous parts. Wait, perhaps this is getting too tangled.\n\nLet's think recursively. For a substring of length l ending at i, the number of ways to split it is the sum over all valid splits. For example, if the first code is of length k (1<=k <= l), then the rest of the substring (from k+1 to l) must be split. But this seems like the same as the standard problem, but for the substring of length l.\n\nBut since the substring is of length l, we can precompute for all possible l (1-4) whether they are valid. Then, for each such valid l, the number of ways to split the substring is equal to the number of ways to split the entire substring of length l.\n\nBut how to compute this for each possible substring ending at i?\n\nHere's an alternative approach. Let's maintain a dp array where dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the entire first i characters of the string. Then, for any substring [a..b], the number of ways to split it is equal to the dp[b - a + 1] computed for the substring [a..b]. But this isn't directly helpful unless we can find a way to map this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the dp array as being for the entire string, and for each new character added, we can compute the new dp[i], and then the total number of ways for all substrings is the sum of dp[1], dp[2], ..., dp[i], but this is only for the prefixes. But the problem requires all substrings, not just prefixes. So this approach is not sufficient.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be rephrased. Since any substring [a..b] can be considered as the entire string of length b - a + 1, and the number of ways to split it is the same as the dp value computed for that string. But how can we track this for all possible substrings?\n\nThis seems impossible with a simple dp array. So perhaps we need to find a way to compute for each new character added, the number of new substrings that end at this position and are valid, and compute their contributions using the same dp approach.\n\nLet me think of the following. When we add a new character to the string, the new substrings that end at this position are those of lengths 1 to 4. For each of these lengths l, we check if the substring is valid. For each such valid substring, we need to compute the number of ways to split it into valid codes.\n\nTo compute this, we can use a dynamic programming approach for each possible substring. However, since the substrings are small (up to length 4), perhaps we can compute this on the fly.\n\nLet me think. For example, when we have a substring ending at position i with length l (say l=3), we can compute the number of ways to split this substring using a helper function. Let's say the substring is s. We can compute the number of ways to split s as follows:\n\nInitialize a dp array for this substring. For example, for the substring s of length l, we can compute dp_sub[0] = 1, and for each position j in 1..l, dp_sub[j] = sum of dp_sub[j - k] for k in 1..4 if the substring ending at j of length k is valid.\n\nBut since the maximum length is 4, this would be very fast for each substring. So for each new character added, we look at the possible l (1-4), check if the substring is valid, and for each valid l, compute the number of ways to split that substring using this helper function. Then, add that number to the total.\n\nBut this approach would be O(4 * m * 4) = O(16m) time, which is acceptable for m up to 3000.\n\nLet me see. For each of the m steps, when adding the new character, we look back up to 4 positions. For each of these possible substrings (up to 4 in number), we check if it's valid. For each valid one, we compute the number of ways to split it using the helper function.\n\nThe helper function for a substring of length l would take O(l) time. Since l is at most 4, this is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Maintain the current string S as it's being built.\n\n- Maintain a total answer variable that accumulates the sum of all valid sequences.\n\n- For each new character added to S:\n\n   - For l in 1 to 4:\n\n      - Check if the substring ending at the current position with length l is valid. This requires checking that the substring is not in the forbidden list.\n\n      - If it is valid, compute the number of ways to split this substring into valid codes using a helper function.\n\n      - Add this number to the total answer.\n\n   - Output the current total modulo 1e9+7.\n\nBut wait, this would be incorrect because the same substring might be counted multiple times. For example, if the substring of length 2 is valid and the substring of length 3 is also valid, then when we add the third character, both are considered. However, the helper function for each substring would count the ways for that particular substring, and adding them all would give the correct total.\n\nYes. Because each new substring that ends at the current position is considered once. For example, when the string is \"111\", after adding the third '1', the substrings ending at position 3 are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\". Each of these contributes their respective number of ways. The total is the sum of all such contributions across all steps.\n\nBut how to compute the number of ways for a given substring? Let's think of the helper function. For a given substring s, the number of ways to split it into valid codes is computed as follows:\n\nInitialize dp_sub[0] = 1 (base case for empty string). For each position j from 1 to len(s):\n\n   dp_sub[j] = sum of dp_sub[j - k] for k in 1..4 where the substring s[j -k + 1 ... j] is valid.\n\nSo for example, for the substring \"111\", the helper function would compute dp_sub[1] = dp_sub[0] = 1 (since \"1\" is valid). dp_sub[2] = dp_sub[1] (since \"1\" is valid) + dp_sub[0] (since \"11\" is valid). So dp_sub[2] = 1 + 1 = 2. dp_sub[3] = dp_sub[2] (if \"1\" is valid) + dp_sub[1] (if \"11\" is valid) + dp_sub[0] (if \"111\" is valid). So dp_sub[3] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. Which matches the earlier example.\n\nSo the helper function would return dp_sub[len(s)] as the number of ways to split the substring s.\n\nThus, for each valid substring ending at current position, we can compute this value.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this helper function efficiently for each substring. Given that the maximum length of the substring is 4, this is feasible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute the forbidden set: {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}.\n\n- For each step, build the current string S.\n\n- For each new character, append it to S.\n\n- Then, for l in 1 to 4:\n\n   - if the current length of S is >= l, then check the substring of length l ending at the current position.\n\n   - if this substring is not in the forbidden set:\n\n      - compute the number of ways to split this substring using the helper function.\n\n      - add this number to the total.\n\n- Output the total after each step.\n\nBut wait, this approach would count each substring once when it is added. However, when a longer string is added, it may contain multiple substrings that were already counted in previous steps. For example, when the string is \"111\", the substring \"1\" was added in step 1, \"1\" again in step 2 (but the second '1' is part of the substring [2,2], and the third '1' adds [3,3], [2,3], [1,3]. But according to this approach, each time a new character is added, we consider all possible new substrings ending at that position. This ensures that all substrings are considered exactly once.\n\nYes. For example, the substring [1..1] is considered when the first character is added. The substring [1..2] is considered when the second character is added. The substring [1..3] is considered when the third character is added. Similarly, the substrings [2..2], [2..3], [3..3] are considered in step 2 and 3. Thus, each substring is processed exactly once when the last character of the substring is added. Therefore, this approach will correctly accumulate all possible substrings.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, the forbidden set:\n\nforbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\nThen, for each new character added, we check for l in 1 to 4:\n\ncurrent_length = len(S)\n\nfor l in 1 to 4:\n\n   if current_length >= l:\n\n       substring = S[-l:]\n\n       if substring not in forbidden:\n\n           compute the number of ways for this substring and add to total.\n\nNow, the helper function for the substring:\n\ndef count_ways(substring):\n\n    n = len(substring)\n\n    dp = [0]*(n+1)\n\n    dp[0] = 1\n\n    for j in range(1, n+1):\n\n        for k in range(1, 5):\n\n            if k > j:\n\n                continue\n\n            s = substring[j - k : j]\n\n            if s not in forbidden:\n\n                dp[j] += dp[j -k]\n\n                dp[j] %= MOD\n\n    return dp[n]\n\nWait, but this function would check for all k from 1 to 4, but for each j, k can't be larger than j. So for j=1, k can be 1. For j=2, k can be 1 or 2, etc.\n\nBut for the substring, the code is checking if the substring of length k ending at j is valid. However, in the helper function, the substring is passed as a parameter, and for each position j in the substring, we check the last k characters.\n\nBut in the code above, the substring is passed, and for each j (the current position in the substring), we look back k steps. For example, j ranges from 1 to n (length of substring). For each j, we check for k=1 to 4. If the substring of length k ending at j is valid, then add dp[j -k]",
