            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending 0s and 1s. After each append, we need to calculate the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. But there are some forbidden Morse codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring that matches one of these four is invalid and shouldn't be counted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The key here is that each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4, not in the forbidden list) corresponds to a unique letter. So any substring of S that is a valid Morse code string contributes to the count. However, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". Wait, but sequences can be multiple letters. For example, if S is \"111\", then substrings like \"1\" (T), \"11\" (M), \"111\" (O), and also combinations like \"1\" followed by \"1\" (so TM, which would be the substring \"11\" again?), but wait, maybe the way to think about it is that each possible way to split the string into valid Morse code parts counts as a different sequence. Oh right! Because for example, the string \"111\" can be split as \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" (TTT), or \"1\" + \"11\" (TM), or \"11\" + \"1\" (MT), or \"111\" (O). Each of these splits represents a different sequence of letters, and each of those splits corresponds to different substrings. But the problem says \"some substring of S in Morse code\". Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each sequence of letters is represented by some substring of S. So for example, the sequence \"T\" is represented by the substring \"1\", which is present. The sequence \"TM\" is represented by the substring \"11\", which is present. But how do you count all possible sequences? Because each valid split into Morse code letters (each part being a valid code) corresponds to a sequence. However, the problem says that the sequences are represented by some substring of S. Wait, perhaps the problem is not about splitting the entire string S into valid Morse codes, but rather considering all possible substrings of S that are valid Morse codes. Each such substring represents a single letter, and sequences of letters are formed by concatenating multiple such substrings. But that seems complicated. Wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the note.\n\nIn the first sample, after appending \"111\", the answer is 7. The note lists the possibilities. For example, \"TT\" is a sequence where each T is represented by \"1\". But how does that correspond to a substring? Well, the substring \"11\" is present. But the sequence \"TT\" is two letters, each represented by their own Morse code. But the substring \"11\" would represent a single letter (M), but the sequence \"TT\" is two letters. How does that fit?\n\nWait, the note says that the sequences are represented by some substring. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is that each sequence of letters is represented by a concatenation of Morse codes. For example, the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the Morse code \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", which is the same as the Morse code for M. But that's conflicting. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each letter is represented by a Morse code string. So a sequence of letters would be represented by the concatenation of their Morse code strings. So the sequence \"TT\" would be represented by \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\", which is the same as the Morse code for M. So the substring \"11\" in S can represent both the single letter M and the sequence TT. However, according to the note, they are considered as separate sequences. So the problem is counting all possible sequences of letters, where each letter is represented by its Morse code, and the concatenation of their Morse codes forms a substring of S. So for example, the substring \"11\" can be interpreted as either one letter (M) or two letters (T and T). Thus, each possible way to split the substring into valid Morse code parts (each part being of length 1-4, not forbidden) contributes to the count. Therefore, the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S (each of which is a valid Morse",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code. The Morse code strings are represented using '0' for dots and '1' for dashes, with certain forbidden strings that do not correspond to any English letter.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Forbidden Strings**: Maintain a set of forbidden Morse code strings which are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of valid Morse code substrings and their contributions to the total count of sequences.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, use modulo $10^9 + 7$ for all operations.\n4. **Efficient Updates**: After each character is appended to the string `S`, check all possible substrings ending at the current position to determine if they form valid Morse code strings and update the count accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    commands = input[1:]\n    \n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    S = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # empty string\n    total = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        c = commands[i - 1]\n        S.append(c)\n        current = ''.join(S)\n        new_dp = 0\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i - l >= 0:\n                substring = current[-l:]\n                if substring in forbidden:\n                    continue\n                if l <= len(current):\n                    new_dp += dp[i - l]\n        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + new_dp) % MOD\n        total = dp[i]\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations `m` and the subsequent operations (each being '0' or '1').\n2. **Forbidden Strings**: A set of forbidden Morse code strings is maintained for quick lookup.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array is used where `dp[i]` keeps track of the number of valid sequences up to the i-th character.\n4. **Substring Checks**: For each new character added to `S`, we check all possible substrings ending at the current position of lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid (not forbidden), it contributes to the count of valid sequences.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: All calculations are done modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of valid sequences after each modification to the string `S`, leveraging dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.",
