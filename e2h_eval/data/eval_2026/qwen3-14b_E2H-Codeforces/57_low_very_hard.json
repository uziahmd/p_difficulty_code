His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in the Olympiad based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores for all participants, but not their names. So, the task is to determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have, considering that his total is at least x. \n\nThe key points here are:\n\n- The participants are sorted by the sum of their points from both tours. Higher sums come first.\n- If there are ties (same total points), the jury can assign the ranks in any way. So for the best case, we want to arrange the ties so that Vasya is as high as possible. For the worst case, arrange them to be as low as possible.\n\nThe input gives us n participants, and for each, their a_i (first tour) and b_j (second tour). But the problem is that the a and b arrays are given in arbitrary order. Wait, no: the second line is the first tour points for all participants, and the third line is the second tour points. However, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i, and their second tour score is b_i? No, wait. Wait, the input says that the second line is a1...an (participants' points in first tour), third line is b1...bn (points in second tour). But the participants are in arbitrary order. So for example, the first participant's first tour is a1, but their second tour is b1. But maybe the actual pairing is not known. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the results of both tours, but they are not linked. So the teacher knows that each participant took part in both tours, but the data is given as two separate lists. So, for example, the first participant's first tour score is a1, and their second tour score is some b_i. But how are they paired?\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So the second line is the first tour's points for all participants, and the third line is the second tour's points for all participants. However, the problem does not specify that a_i and b_i belong to the same participant. Oh wait, no! Because each participant has a first tour and a second tour score. So the a array and b array are for the same set of participants. But the order is arbitrary. So for example, the first participant's first tour is a_1, and their second tour is b_1. But the problem says that the teacher has the results of both tours, but the data is in arbitrary order. So, the teacher has the list of first tour scores (a1...an) and the list of second tour scores (b1...bn), but the actual pairing between a_i and b_i is unknown. However, the problem says that Vasya is present in the Olympiad. So there exists some i and j such that a_i + b_j >= x. But since the teacher doesn't know which a and b belong to Vasya, he needs to consider all possibilities where Vasya's total is at least x, and find the best and worst possible rank he could have.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but the problem is that the results have only points, no names. So the teacher knows that there are n participants, each with a first tour score and a second tour score. However, the a and b arrays are given in arbitrary order. So, for example, for each participant, their first tour score is some a_i, and their second tour score is some b_j. But the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to which participant. So when trying to compute the best and worst possible positions for Vasya, we need to choose a pairing of a's and b's such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >= x, and then determine the best and worst possible ranks that Vasya could have in that scenario.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But since the teacher doesn't know which a and b belong to Vasya, the teacher has to imagine all possible pairings of a and b for the participants. However, the problem says that the actual participants have their first and second tour scores, but the a and b arrays are given in arbitrary order. So the teacher knows that for each participant, there is a unique a_i and a unique b_j (since each participant took both tours). But the problem is that the a and b arrays are given",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves considering all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to find the optimal scenarios for Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have given that his total score from both tours is at least `x`. The participants are sorted by their total scores, with ties handled arbitrarily by the jury.\n2. **Best Possible Rank**: To determine the best possible rank, we maximize Vasya's total score by pairing the highest scores from the first tour with the highest scores from the second tour.\n3. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we minimize Vasya's total score by pairing the lowest scores from the first tour with the lowest scores from the second tour.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Using sorting and binary search, we can efficiently compute the number of participants who could have a higher or equal total score than Vasya in both scenarios.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort a and b\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Best case: Vasya gets maximum possible sum\n    # So pair largest a with largest b\n    # Find the maximum possible sum that is >=x\n    # For best rank, we want as many people as possible to have sum less than Vasya's max possible\n    # So find the max possible sum for Vasya, then count how many people can have sum >= that\n    # Wait no. For best rank, we want Vasya's sum to be as high as possible, so that he can be placed as high as possible.\n    # So in best case, we choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya (a_i + b_j where a_i is max and b_j is max)\n    # Then, count how many participants have sum >= that value. But since the jury can arrange ties, the best possible rank is 1 if there is at least one participant with sum >= that value, but if all have sum less, then it's 1.\n    # Wait, no. The best possible rank is determined by the number of participants who have a total score strictly greater than Vasya's total. If there are k such participants, then Vasya's best possible rank is k+1. However, if there are participants with the same total as Vasya, the jury can place him before them, thus making the best possible rank as low as possible.\n    # So for best case, we want Vasya's total to be as high as possible. Let's consider the maximum possible sum he can have: max_a + max_b. Then, count how many participants can have sum >= this value. But since we can choose any pairing for other participants, the actual number of people with sum >= this value is zero, because the maximum sum for others would be when they take the next highest a and b. Wait, no. The other participants' total scores are not fixed. Because the pairing is arbitrary. So to find the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya has the maximum possible sum (a_i + b_j), and other participants are paired in a way that minimizes the number of people with sum >= Vasya's sum. That would be the best possible rank for Vasya.\n\n    # For best rank:\n    # We can take the maximum possible sum for Vasya, which is a_sorted[-1] + b_sorted[-1]\n    # Then, find how many participants can have sum >= that value. But since the other participants can be paired in any way, the minimal number of people that can have sum >= Vasya's sum is zero. Wait, no. For example, if Vasya has the maximum possible sum, then no one else can have a higher sum than that. Because the other participants' maximum possible sum is also a_sorted[-1] + b_sorted[-1], but if Vasya is one of them, then others can't have more than that. So in this case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\n    # Wait, this seems conflicting with the first sample input. In the first sample, all participants have sum 2. So Vasya can be placed first or last. So the best rank is 1.\n\n    # Therefore, for best rank, the answer is 1, because we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is the highest possible, and others are lower. Or, if multiple people have the same sum as Vasya, the jury can place him first.\n\n    # So the best possible rank is always 1. Wait, but what if there is someone else who has a higher sum? No, because we can choose the pairing for Vasya to have the maximum possible sum. For example, if Vasya takes the highest a and highest b, then no one else can have a higher sum than that. Because others would be paired with lower a or lower b.\n\n    # Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\n    # Now for the worst possible rank: we need to minimize Vasya's total sum (but it must be >=x). Then, count how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than that. Since the jury can arrange the ties, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1.\n\n    # So the steps are:\n\n    # Find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x. How?\n    # We need to find the minimal possible sum s such that s >=x, and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = s. Then, for this s, count how many participants can have sum > s (since those will be ranked above Vasya regardless of tie-breaking). Then the worst possible rank is that count + 1.\n\n    # But how do we find the minimal possible s >=x for Vasya?\n\n    # To find the minimal s >=x, we can try to pair a_i and b_j such that their sum is as small as possible but still >=x. So for this, we can sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order, and for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal s is the minimal among all such a_i + b_j.\n\n    # However, since we need to find the worst possible scenario for Vasya, we should consider the minimal s that is >=x. Because if Vasya's sum is as small as possible, then more people can have higher sums than him, leading to a worse rank.\n\n    # So the approach for worst rank:\n\n    # 1. Find the minimal possible s (>=x) that Vasya can have. This is done by finding the minimal a_i + b_j >=x. Once we have this s, we need to count how many participants can have a sum > s. Because in the worst case, all those participants are ranked above Vasya, and Vasya is placed after them.\n\n    # However, how do we compute the number of participants that can have sum > s? Because the other participants can be paired in any way. So for the worst case, we need to maximize the number of participants whose sum is > s.\n\n    # To compute this, we can consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) and count how many pairs have sum > s. But since we can pair the participants in any way, the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j > s. However, since each participant must be paired with exactly one a and one b, we need to find the maximum number of such pairs. But this is equivalent to the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > s, given that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\n    # This is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j > s, with each element used exactly once. To maximize this number, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, and then pair them greedily. For each a_i in ascending order, find the largest b_j that hasn't been used yet and a_i + b_j > s. This is similar to the two-pointer technique.\n\n    # So the steps for the worst case:\n\n    # 1. Find the minimal s >=x that Vasya can have. This is done by checking for each a_i, the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s is the minimal of all such a_i + b_j.\n\n    # 2. Once s is determined, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s. This is done by using the two-pointer approach on the sorted a and sorted b arrays.\n\n    # However, there's a problem here. Because the minimal s may not be unique. For example, there might be multiple pairs that sum to the same s. So to ensure that Vasya's s is the minimal possible, we need to find the minimal s such that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x.\n\n    # Let's proceed step by step.\n\n    # First, find the minimal s >=x. To do this, we can sort a and b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i in a, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s is the minimal among all these a_i + b_j values.\n\n    # To find the minimal s, we can use a two-pointer approach. Sort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order. For each a_i, we can find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s is the minimal of all these a_i + b_j.\n\n    # But perhaps a better way is to find the minimal possible s by checking all possible pairs, but that would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\n    # Instead, we can use a two-pointer approach to find the minimal s. Let's think:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order.\n\n    # Initialize i = 0, j = n-1. For each a_i, we find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Since b is sorted, we can find the minimal j for each a_i.\n\n    # However, this approach may not work directly. Let's think again.\n\n    # To find the minimal s >=x, we can iterate through each a_i, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s across all these would be the minimal possible s.\n\n    # For example, for a_i, the minimal b_j is the first b_j in the sorted list where b_j >= (x - a_i). Since the list is sorted, we can use binary search for this.\n\n    # So, the plan is:\n\n    # 1. Sort a in ascending order.\n    # 2. Sort b in ascending order.\n    # 3. For each a_i in a, compute the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. This can be found using binary search on b.\n    # 4. For all such possible a_i and corresponding b_j, collect the sum s = a_i + b_j. The minimal s is the minimal among all these possible sums.\n\n    # Once we have the minimal s (let's call it min_s), we need to compute how many participants can have sum > min_s. This is the maximum number of participants that can be paired with sum > min_s. This will give us the worst possible rank for Vasya as (count + 1).\n\n    # Now, how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > min_s?\n\n    # This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j > min_s, with each a and b used exactly once. To maximize this count, we can use a greedy approach:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i (from left to right), pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet and satisfies a_i + b_j > min_s. This approach ensures that we use the largest b elements first, allowing more a elements to be paired with them.\n\n    # So, let's implement this:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Use two pointers: i starts at 0 (a's start), j starts at 0 (b's start). For each a_i, check if a_i + b_j > min_s. If yes, count +=1, and move both pointers. Else, move the a pointer.\n\n    # Wait, no. Let me think again. If we sort a in ascending and b in descending, then for each a_i, we can try to pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet. So:\n\n    # Initialize i = 0 (a's start), j = 0 (b's start). But since b is sorted in descending order, the first element is the largest. So for each a_i, we can check if a_i + b[j] > min_s. If yes, then we can pair them, increment count, and move both i and j. If not, then this a_i cannot be paired with any b_j (since all remaining b_j are smaller or equal to the current one), so we move i.\n\n    # Wait, no. Because if a_i is too small, even with the largest available b_j, their sum is <= min_s, then this a_i cannot be paired to contribute to the count. But if a_i is large enough, then pairing with the largest available b_j may allow the sum to be > min_s.\n\n    # So the algorithm is:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order.\n    # Initialize i = 0 (for a), j = 0 (for b).\n    # count = 0\n    # while i < n and j < n:\n    #     if a[i] + b[j] > min_s:\n    #         count +=1\n    #         i +=1\n    #         j +=1\n    #     else:\n    #         i +=1\n    # So this gives the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > min_s.\n\n    # Now, the code steps:\n\n    # First, find min_s:\n\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order.\n\n    # For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s for that a_i is a_i + b_j. The overall min_s is the minimum of all such values.\n\n    # However, it's possible that for some a_i, there is no b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. But the problem says that there exists at least one such pair (i,j), so we can safely proceed.\n\n    # Now, let's implement this.\n\n    # So:\n\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n\n    # Find min_s\n    min_s = float('inf')\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = x - ai\n        # find the smallest b_j >= target\n        # since b_sorted is sorted ascending, use bisect_left\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, target)\n        if idx < len(b_sorted):\n            s = ai + b_sorted[idx]\n            if s < min_s:\n                min_s = s\n        else:\n            # no such b_j, but problem says there is at least one pair\n            pass\n\n    # Now, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > min_s\n\n    # To do that, sort a in ascending, b in descending\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    count = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a_asc[i] + b_desc[j] > min_s:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    # The worst rank is count + 1\n    worst_rank = count + 1\n\n    # Best rank is always 1\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    print(best_rank, worst_rank)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: The best possible rank for Vasya is always 1 because we can pair his scores to achieve the highest possible total, ensuring he is at the top.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: We determine the minimal possible total score Vasya can have that is still at least `x`.

So the best rank is 1.\n\n    # Therefore, for best rank, the answer is 1, because we can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is the highest possible, and others are lower. Or, if multiple people have the same sum as Vasya, the jury can place him first.\n\n    # So the best possible rank is always 1. Wait, but what if there is someone else who has a higher sum? No, because we can choose the pairing for Vasya to have the maximum possible sum. For example, if Vasya takes the highest a and highest b, then no one else can have a higher sum than that. Because others would be paired with lower a or lower b.\n\n    # Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\n    # Now for the worst possible rank: we need to minimize Vasya's total sum (but it must be >=x). Then, count how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than that. Since the jury can arrange the ties, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1.\n\n    # So the steps are:\n\n    # Find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x. How?\n    # We need to find the minimal possible sum s such that s >=x, and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = s. Then, for this s, count how many participants can have sum > s (since those will be ranked above Vasya regardless of tie-breaking). Then the worst possible rank is that count + 1.\n\n    # But how do we find the minimal possible s >=x for Vasya?\n\n    # To find the minimal s >=x, we can try to pair a_i and b_j such that their sum is as small as possible but still >=x. So for this, we can sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order, and for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal s is the minimal among all such a_i + b_j.\n\n    # However, since we need to find the worst possible scenario for Vasya, we should consider the minimal s that is >=x. Because if Vasya's sum is as small as possible, then more people can have higher sums than him, leading to a worse rank.\n\n    # So the approach for worst rank:\n\n    # 1. Find the minimal possible s (>=x) that Vasya can have. This is done by finding the minimal a_i + b_j >=x. Once we have this s, we need to count how many participants can have a sum > s. Because in the worst case, all those participants are ranked above Vasya, and Vasya is placed after them.\n\n    # However, how do we compute the number of participants that can have sum > s? Because the other participants can be paired in any way. So for the worst case, we need to maximize the number of participants whose sum is > s.\n\n    # To compute this, we can consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) and count how many pairs have sum > s. But since we can pair the participants in any way, the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j > s. However, since each participant must be paired with exactly one a and one b, we need to find the maximum number of such pairs. But this is equivalent to the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > s, given that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\n    # This is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j > s, with each element used exactly once. To maximize this number, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, and then pair them greedily. For each a_i in ascending order, find the largest b_j that hasn't been used yet and a_i + b_j > s. This is similar to the two-pointer technique.\n\n    # So the steps for the worst case:\n\n    # 1. Find the minimal s >=x that Vasya can have. This is done by checking for each a_i, the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s is the minimal of all such a_i + b_j.\n\n    # 2. Once s is determined, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > s. This is done by using the two-pointer approach on the sorted a and sorted b arrays.\n\n    # However, there's a problem here. Because the minimal s may not be unique. For example, there might be multiple pairs that sum to the same s. So to ensure that Vasya's s is the minimal possible, we need to find the minimal s such that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x.\n\n    # Let's proceed step by step.\n\n    # First, find the minimal s >=x. To do this, we can sort a and b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i in a, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s is the minimal among all these a_i + b_j values.\n\n    # To find the minimal s, we can use a two-pointer approach. Sort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order. For each a_i, we can find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s is the minimal of all these a_i + b_j.\n\n    # But perhaps a better way is to find the minimal possible s by checking all possible pairs, but that would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\n    # Instead, we can use a two-pointer approach to find the minimal s. Let's think:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, and b in ascending order.\n\n    # Initialize i = 0, j = n-1. For each a_i, we find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Since b is sorted, we can find the minimal j for each a_i.\n\n    # However, this approach may not work directly. Let's think again.\n\n    # To find the minimal s >=x, we can iterate through each a_i, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s across all these would be the minimal possible s.\n\n    # For example, for a_i, the minimal b_j is the first b_j in the sorted list where b_j >= (x - a_i). Since the list is sorted, we can use binary search for this.\n\n    # So, the plan is:\n\n    # 1. Sort a in ascending order.\n    # 2. Sort b in ascending order.\n    # 3. For each a_i in a, compute the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. This can be found using binary search on b.\n    # 4. For all such possible a_i and corresponding b_j, collect the sum s = a_i + b_j. The minimal s is the minimal among all these possible sums.\n\n    # Once we have the minimal s (let's call it min_s), we need to compute how many participants can have sum > min_s. This is the maximum number of participants that can be paired with sum > min_s. This will give us the worst possible rank for Vasya as (count + 1).\n\n    # Now, how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > min_s?\n\n    # This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j > min_s, with each a and b used exactly once. To maximize this count, we can use a greedy approach:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i (from left to right), pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet and satisfies a_i + b_j > min_s. This approach ensures that we use the largest b elements first, allowing more a elements to be paired with them.\n\n    # So, let's implement this:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Use two pointers: i starts at 0 (a's start), j starts at 0 (b's start). For each a_i, check if a_i + b_j > min_s. If yes, count +=1, and move both pointers. Else, move the a pointer.\n\n    # Wait, no. Let me think again. If we sort a in ascending and b in descending, then for each a_i, we can try to pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet. So:\n\n    # Initialize i = 0 (a's start), j = 0 (b's start). But since b is sorted in descending order, the first element is the largest. So for each a_i, we can check if a_i + b[j] > min_s. If yes, then we can pair them, increment count, and move both i and j. If not, then this a_i cannot be paired with any b_j (since all remaining b_j are smaller or equal to the current one), so we move i.\n\n    # Wait, no. Because if a_i is too small, even with the largest available b_j, their sum is <= min_s, then this a_i cannot be paired to contribute to the count. But if a_i is large enough, then pairing with the largest available b_j may allow the sum to be > min_s.\n\n    # So the algorithm is:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order.\n    # Initialize i = 0 (for a), j = 0 (for b).\n    # count = 0\n    # while i < n and j < n:\n    #     if a[i] + b[j] > min_s:\n    #         count +=1\n    #         i +=1\n    #         j +=1\n    #     else:\n    #         i +=1\n    # So this gives the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > min_s.\n\n    # Now, the code steps:\n\n    # First, find min_s:\n\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order.\n\n    # For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. The minimal s for that a_i is a_i + b_j. The overall min_s is the minimum of all such values.\n\n    # However, it's possible that for some a_i, there is no b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. But the problem says that there exists at least one such pair (i,j), so we can safely proceed.\n\n    # Now, let's implement this.\n\n    # So:\n\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n\n    # Find min_s\n    min_s = float('inf')\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = x - ai\n        # find the smallest b_j >= target\n        # since b_sorted is sorted ascending, use bisect_left\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, target)\n        if idx < len(b_sorted):\n            s = ai + b_sorted[idx]\n            if s < min_s:\n                min_s = s\n        else:\n            # no such b_j, but problem says there is at least one pair\n            pass\n\n    # Now, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > min_s\n\n    # To do that, sort a in ascending, b in descending\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    count = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a_asc[i] + b_desc[j] > min_s:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    # The worst rank is count + 1\n    worst_rank = count + 1\n\n    # Best rank is always 1\n    best_rank = 1\n\n    print(best_rank, worst_rank)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
