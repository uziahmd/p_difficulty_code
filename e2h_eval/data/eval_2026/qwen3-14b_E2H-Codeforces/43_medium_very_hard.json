He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to check if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nThe problem says that the string is built in three steps:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all 'a's, and there's at least one 'a'.\n2. B appends some number of 'b's. So after this step, there's at least one 'b' as well. So the string now has a bunch of a's followed by b's.\n3. C appends some number of 'c's. The number of c's must equal either the number of a's or the number of b's in the string at that point. Also, the c's are added to the end. So the final string should be a's followed by b's followed by c's. Also, the count of c's must be equal to the count of a's or the count of b's in the string before adding the c's.\n\nSo the first thing I need to check is the structure of the string. The string must consist of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. If there's any other order, like a c before a b, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the first step is to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So for example, if there's a 'c' before a 'b', that's not allowed. Similarly, if there's a 'b' after a 'c', that's also invalid.\n\nSo how can I check that? Well, I can check the order of characters. For example, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all 'a's. And the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all 'b's. So the string must be in the order a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then I need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nBut according to the process, when C adds the c's, the count of c's must equal either the count of a's (which is count_a) or the count of b's (which is count_b) in the string before adding the c's. Wait, but when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's is the same as in the current string. Because the c's are added after the a's and b's. So the count of a's and b's in the string before adding the c's is count_a and count_b. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but the count of c's is added after. So the total count_c is the number of c's added by C. Which is equal to either count_a (original a's) or count_b (original b's) at that time. So yes, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the original a's and b's are the ones in the string before adding the c's. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. So the condition is count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nBut also, the initial steps require that after A and B's steps, there is at least one a and one b. So the original string must have at least one a and one b. Because when B appends the b's, he makes sure that there is at least one b. So in the final string, there must be at least one a and one b. Because the c's are added after, so the a's and b's counts are the same as in the original string before adding c's. So in the final string, the count_a and count_b must be at least 1 each.\n\nSo putting this all together, the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So no interleaving. So the order must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\n2. The count of c's must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\n3. The count of a's must be >=1 and count of b's must be >=1.\n\nSo for example, the sample input:\n\nFirst example: aaabccc. So count_a is 3, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So count_c equals count_a (3). So that's valid. Also, the order is correct.\n\nSecond example: bbacc. The string is 'bba' followed by 'cc'? No. Wait, the string is 'bbacc'. So the order is 'bb' followed by 'a' then 'cc'? Which is invalid. Because the a comes after the b's. So the string isn't in the a* b* c* order. So that's why the output is NO.\n\nThird example: aabc. The string is a's followed by b's followed by c's. Count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 1. So count_c equals count_b. So valid.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\nFirst, check the order of the string. Are all a's first, then b's, then c's?\n\nHow to check that? For example, the string can be divided into three parts. So the first part is all a's. Then the next part is all b's. Then the next part is all c's. So the entire string must be in that order.\n\nSo for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b', etc.\n\nSo how can I check that?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and check that:\n\n- All characters before the first 'b' are 'a's.\n\n- All characters before the first 'c' are 'a's or 'b's (but after the first 'b's).\n\nWait, perhaps the way to do this is to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo the string can be divided into three parts:\n\n- All a's (possibly zero?), but wait, no. Because the initial step requires that A's string has at least one a. Then B appends at least one b. So in the string, there must be at least one a and one b. So the count_a and count_b must be >=1. So the string must have at least one a and one b. But the c's can be zero? No. Because C appends some number of c's. The problem says that C appends some number of c's. However, the note says that the number of c's can be equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. So if the number of c's is zero, that would imply that the count of a's or b's is zero, which is not allowed. But since C appends some number of c's, that number is at least 1? Or can it be zero?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nC appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend... the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both... \n\nSo the number of c's added is equal to the count of a's or the count of b's. So if the count of a's is zero, then that's not possible. But since A's original string has at least one a, and B appends some number of b's (so at least one), then the count of a's and b's in the string before adding the c's is at least one. Therefore, the count of c's added is equal to count_a or count_b, which is at least one. So the count of c's in the final string must be equal to count_a or count_b, which are >=1. So the count_c is >=1.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial string from A has some number of a's (at least one). Then B appends some number of b's (so at least one). So the string before C adds the c's has at least one a and one b. Then C appends some number of c's, which is equal to count_a or count_b. So count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. So count_c is at least 1. So the final string must have at least one c. So the original string must have at least one c. Therefore, the input string must have at least one c. Wait, but the problem says that the input string may have any of the letters. But according to the process, the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. Because:\n\n- A's string has at least one a.\n\n- B appends at least one b.\n\n- C appends at least one c (since count_c is equal to count_a or count_b, which are at least 1).\n\nTherefore, the input string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nWait, but what if the input string is 'aabb'? Then there are no c's. But according to the process, the C appends some number of c's. So the input string must have at least one c. So in that case, the answer is NO.\n\nSo that's another condition: the string must contain at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nWait, but let's see. For example, suppose the input is 'aabc', which is in the sample input. That's allowed. It has a's, b's, and c's. So the sample input's third example is 'aabc' which is valid.\n\nSo in our code, we need to check that:\n\ncount_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nBut also, the string must be ordered as a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\nSo first, let's check the order.\n\nHow to check that the string is in the order of a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nOne approach is to check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the order a < b < c. So each character is not less than the previous one. For example, the string 'aaabbbcc' is valid. But 'aabbc' is valid. However, 'abac' is invalid because after the a's, there's a b, then an a again.\n\nBut how to check that the string is in the correct order.\n\nAnother approach is to check that the first occurrence of 'b' is after all 'a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' is after all 'b's.\n\nSo for example, the string can be split into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's.\n\nSo, for example, in the string, all a's must come before any b's, and all b's must come before any c's.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCheck that the string is composed of a's followed by b's followed by c's.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWe can check that the string is in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be checked by looking for the first occurrence of 'b' and 'c'.\n\nLet me think:\n\nIf the string has a 'b', then all characters after the first 'b' must not have any 'a's. Similarly, if there's a 'c', then all characters after the first 'c' must not have any 'a's or 'b's.\n\nAlternatively, the string can be divided into three parts:\n\n- The first part is all a's. Then comes the b's. Then comes the c's.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be checked by checking that the characters are in order. So for each i from 1 to len(s)-1, s[i] must be >= s[i-1]. Because a comes before b, which comes before c. So if the string is in non-decreasing order, then the order is correct.\n\nYes! Because the string must be a's followed by b's followed by c's. So each character must be >= the previous one. So for example, 'aaabbbcc' is okay. 'aabbc' is okay. But 'abba' is not, because after the first b, there's an a again. So checking that the entire string is non-decreasing in terms of the characters would ensure that the order is correct.\n\nSo that's a simple way to check the order.\n\nSo, first, check that the string is non-decreasing. For example, for each i from 1 to len(s)-1, s[i] >= s[i-1].\n\nBut also, the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nSo, once the order is correct, then check that there is at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nBut wait, in the case where the string is all a's followed by all b's, but no c's. Then the order is correct, but there are no c's. Which would be invalid. So the code needs to check that the count of c's is at least 1, and similarly for a and b.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCheck that the string is non-decreasing (i.e., order is a's, then b's, then c's).\n\nCheck that the string contains at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nThen, check that the count of c's equals count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the count of c's is equal to count_a or count_b. Because when C appends the c's, the number of c's added is equal to the count of a's (before adding c's) or the count of b's (before adding c's). But in the final string, the count of a's is the same as before, and the count of b's is the same as before. The count of c's is exactly the number added, which is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, for example, if the string has count_c = count_a, then that's valid. Or if count_c = count_b.\n\nSo the code can check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nFirst, read the input string S.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck that the string is non-decreasing. How?\n\nFor example, for each i from 1 to len(S)-1, check that S[i] >= S[i-1]. If any of them is not, then return NO.\n\nThen check that the string has at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nThen check that the count of c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all those conditions are met, then return YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the count of a and b?\n\nBecause, for example, the string could have a's and b's, but in the process, the count of a's is the original count, and the count of b's is the original count. Because B appends some number of b's. So the count of a's is the original count, and the count of b's is the original count. So in the final string, the count of a's and b's are the same as in the initial steps.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in S\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's in S\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's in S\n\nThen, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nBut also, the count_a must be >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nSo, combining all these steps.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample: 'aaabccc'\n\nCheck order: a's followed by b's followed by c's. Yes.\n\ncount_a is 3, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nSo output is YES.\n\nSecond sample: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. So the third character is 'a', which is less than the previous 'b', so the order is invalid. So the code returns NO.\n\nThird sample: 'aabc' → order is a, a, b, c. Correct. count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 1. count_c equals count_b. So yes.\n\nAnother example: 'ab' → no c's. So invalid. Output NO.\n\nAnother example: 'abc' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1. count_c is equal to count_a (1) and count_b (1). So yes. So output YES.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1. So count_c is neither equal to count_a nor count_b. So output NO.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1, count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So no. But if the string is 'aabbc' → the code would check that count_c is 1. So it's not equal to 2 or 2. So output is NO.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c equals both. So yes.\n\nSo code would return YES.\n\nNow, what about a string that has all a's, then all b's, then all c's, but count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. But the count of a or b is zero? Well, no, because in the code we check that the count of a, b, and c are all >=1.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead S.\n\nCheck that the string is non-decreasing. If not, return NO.\n\nCheck that S contains at least one a, one b, and one c. If not, return NO.\n\nCheck that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. If yes, return YES, else NO.\n\nSo now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nImplementing the non-decreasing check:\n\nWe can loop through the string, checking that each character is >= the previous one.\n\nFor example:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        return False\n\nSo that's straightforward.\n\nThen, check that the counts are >=1.\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a <1 or count_b <1 or count_c <1:\n\n    return NO\n\nThen check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'?\n\ncount_a is 2, count_b is 2, count_c is 2. So count_c equals count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → count_a is 1, count_b is 1, count_c is 2. So count_c is not equal to either. So output NO.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabcc' → count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 2. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nBut the order is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'abbcc' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=2, count_c=2. count_c equals count_b. So yes.\n\nSo code would return yes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aaaabbbbcccc'? count_a is 4, count_b is 4, count_c is 4. So count_c equals both count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nSo code returns yes.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: 'abc' → yes.\n\nEdge case 2: 'abbbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 1, count_b is 3. So count_c is equal to count_a. So yes.\n\nEdge case 3: 'abcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So count_c is not equal to either. So no.\n\nEdge case 4: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So no.\n\nEdge case 5: 'aabbc' → same as above.\n\nAnother edge case: 'ac' → order is a followed by c. But there are no b's. So the count_b is zero. So the check for count_b >=1 would fail. So output is no.\n\nAnother edge case: 'abbc' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=2, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nSo code would return yes.\n\nNow, what about the string 'ba'? The order is not non-decreasing (b comes before a). So the code returns no.\n\nNow, what about 'abba'? The order is a, b, b, a. The third character is b, then a. So the code would detect that the third character is a, which is less than the previous b. So the order check fails.\n\nSo code returns no.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplementing the code:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nCheck the order.\n\nCheck counts.\n\nCheck the count_c == count_a or count_b.\n\nSo code in Python:\n\ndef check_string(s):\n\n    # Check order is non-decreasing\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    # Check counts of a, b, c\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a <1 or count_b <1 or count_c <1:\n\n        return False\n\n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        return True\n\n    else:\n\n        return False\n\nThen, the main function reads the input string, calls this function, and outputs YES or NO.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is a string. For example, in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but in the actual problem, the input is a single string. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S. So the input is a single string. However, the sample input shows a list of strings, but that's probably for the example. For example, the sample input is given as ['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc'], but the actual input is a single string. So the code should read a single string.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consists of a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 5000). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\nSo the code should read a single string from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided a list of strings. But that's probably for the example. So in the code, the input is read as a single string.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen, run the checks.\n\nBut then, in the sample input, the first example is 'aaabccc' which is correct.\n\nSo the code would return 'YES' for that.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabc' (third example). The code would check order is correct, counts are a=2, b=1, c=1. So count_c equals count_b. So returns yes.\n\nNow, what about the second sample input, 'bbacc'?\n\nThe code checks the order. Let's see:\n\nThe string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'.\n\nAt i=2, s[2] is 'a', which is less than s[1] 'b'. So the order check returns false. So returns no.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcc' → order is correct. counts a=2, b=2, c=2. So count_c equals count_a and count_b. So returns yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → counts c is 0. So returns no.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aaabbbcc' → counts a=3, b=3, c=2. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nBut the order is correct. So code returns no.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the C appends c's equal to the count of a or b. So in this case, the count of c is 2, which is not equal to 3 or 3. So no.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabcc' → count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 2. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nSo code returns no.\n\nNow, what about the string 'abbbc' → count_a is 1, count_b is 3, count_c is 1. So count_c equals count_a. So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aaaabbbbcccc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=4. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the string 'aaaabbbbc' → counts a=4, b=4, c=1. So count_c is not equal to a or b. So returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, reading from stdin, and outputting YES or NO.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the string.\n\nCheck if the order is non-decreasing.\n\nCheck if counts of a, b, c are all at least 1.\n\nCheck if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all conditions are met, print YES, else NO.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n\n    # Check order\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    # Check counts\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nif is_valid(s):\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'abba'? The order check would fail, as 'b' comes after 'a', then 'b' comes after 'b', then 'a' comes after 'b' which is less than 'b'. So the code returns false.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → order is correct. counts a=2, b=2, c=2 → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbc' → order is correct. counts a=1, b=2, c=1 → count_c equals a. So yes.\n\nSo code returns yes.\n\nBut let's think about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2, which equals count_a (2) and count_b (2). So code returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' but the count_c is 2, which equals count_a and count_b. So code returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabbc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=1. So count_c is not equal to either. So code returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3. So count_c equals count_a → yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order check fails → no.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1 → count_c equals count_b → yes.\n\nSo sample outputs are ['YES', 'NO', 'YES'] as expected.\n\nSo the code seems to handle the samples correctly.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'a' → but count_b and count_c are zero → returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → count_b is zero → returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → count_c is 2, count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So 2 is not equal to 1 or 1 → returns no.\n\nSo code returns no.\n\nSo code seems to be correct.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle all the cases. So this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. The string must be constructed such that it starts with some number of 'a's, followed by some number of 'b's, and then some number of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before the 'c's are appended.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must be in non-decreasing order of characters, i.e., all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. This ensures the correct sequence of appending.\n2. **Check Counts**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. This is necessary because each step of the process ensures that there is at least one of each character.\n3. **Check Validity of 'c' Count**: The count of 'c's must be equal to either the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n    # Check if the string is in non-decreasing order\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    \n    # Count the occurrences of each character\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if there's at least one of each character\n    if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1 or count_c < 1:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nif is_valid(s):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The loop iterates through the string to ensure that each character is not less than the previous one. This ensures that the string is in the form of 'a*' followed by 'b*' followed by 'c*'.\n2. **Count Check**: The counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are checked to ensure there is at least one occurrence of each character.\n3. **Validity Check**: The count of 'c's is compared against the counts of 'a's and 'b's to determine if it matches either, ensuring the string adheres to the problem's constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions in linear time relative to the length of the string, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limit of input size.",
