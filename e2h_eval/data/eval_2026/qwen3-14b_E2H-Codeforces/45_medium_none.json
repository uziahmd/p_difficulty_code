There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced bracket. But here, the structure is different because of the rule. The problem wants us to maximize the number of games the winner can play, given that rule.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays against player 3, they have played 1 game each (the first round). So that's allowed. But for n=4, the answer is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because if the winner plays three games, that would require them to have three rounds. But in a normal knockout, with 4 players, the winner plays 2 games (semis and final). But maybe the structure here is such that the maximum is 2. The note says that for n=4, you can't have the winner play 3 games. Because after two games, the winner would have played two games, but the other players would have played less. So the third game would require someone with 2 games (the winner) and someone with 0 (if they haven't played yet). But that's a difference of two, which is not allowed. So the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the problem seems to be related to finding the largest possible k such that the sum of the first k terms of a Fibonacci-like sequence is less than or equal to n. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think recursively.\n\nSuppose the maximum number of games the winner can play is k. To reach k games, the winner must have played in each round. Each time they play a game, they must have opponents who have played either the same number of games or one less. \n\nLet me think about how the players are structured. For the winner to play k games, they must have a path where each game they play is against someone who has played either the same number of games or one less. So, the structure might resemble a Fibonacci tree. \n\nFor example, let's consider that to have a player reach k games, they need to have a certain number of players in their path. Let's model this as follows: Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required to have a winner who plays exactly k games. Then, the maximum k for a given n is the largest value where f(k) ≤ n.\n\nWhat's f(k)? For the first case, f(1) = 2. Because to have a winner play 1 game, you need two players. For k=2, the winner has to play two games. Let's see: the first game, they play against someone. Then, for the second game, they need an opponent who has played either 1 or 0 games. But since the winner has already played once, the opponent must have played once (so they have to have won their previous game). So, how many players are needed? Let's think. The winner needs to have two opponents. Let's say the first game is against player A, and the second against player B. Player B must have played once before. So, to get to that, there must be another match that player B has won. So, for the second game, the winner's opponent must have come from a subtree that requires f(1) players. So, the total players would be f(1) + f(1) + ... ?\n\nWait, maybe f(k) is the sum of f(k-1) and f(k-2). Because for the winner to play k games, they must have played in the k-th game. For that game, their opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. But since the opponent must have reached the k-th round, perhaps the opponent's path requires that they have played k-1 games. Wait, maybe this is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think recursively. To have a player reach k games, they must have played in the k-th game. Let's imagine that in the k-th game, the winner's opponent has played (k-1) games. Because the opponent must have a number of games that differs by at most one. So, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. But to maximize the number of games, the opponent would have played k-1 games. So, the winner's path requires that they have a subtree where they have played k-1 games, and their opponent's subtree has played k-1 games. Wait, no. Because the winner's path would have had to have played k-1 games before the k-th game. So, for the k-th game, the winner has played k-1 games, and the opponent has played k-1 games. So, the total players required would be f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Wait, maybe that's the case. Let's think:\n\nFor example, to have a winner play 1 game: f(1) = 2.\n\nTo have a winner play 2 games: he must have played one game before, and then another. For the second game, his opponent must have played 1 game (since the winner has played 1 game already). So, the opponent must have a path where they played 1 game. That requires 2 players. So, the total players is 2 (for the winner's first game) plus 2 (for the opponent's path) minus 1 (since the opponent is the winner of their own subtree). Wait, maybe f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let's check for k=2. f(2) = f(1) + f(0). Wait, what is f(0)? Well, maybe f(0) is 1. Because if a player hasn't played any games, they are just one player. So, for k=1, the total is 2 = 1 + 1 (f(0) + f(0)?). Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the base cases.\n\nLet me think again. Let's model f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to have played k games. \n\nFor k=0, it's 1 player (no games). But that's probably not relevant here. \n\nFor k=1, you need 2 players. The winner plays once.\n\nFor k=2, the winner must have played two games. So, in the first game, he plays against someone. Then, in the second game, he plays against someone else. But that someone else must have played one game (so they have to have a path where they played one game). So, for the second game, the opponent's subtree requires f(1) players. However, the winner's first game's opponent is part of the first round. So, the total players would be f(1) + f(1) - 1? Or maybe f(2) = f(1) + f(1) - 1? Wait, no. Because the winner's first game is against someone. Then, the second game is against someone who has played once. So, the winner's first game requires 2 players (the winner and the first opponent). The opponent in the second game must have come from a subtree that requires f(1) players. So, the total players would be 2 (from the first game) + 2 (from the second game's opponent's subtree) - 1 (because the winner is part of both subtrees? No, maybe not. Because the winner is in the first subtree, and the opponent's subtree is separate. So, the total would be f(1) (for the first round) + f(1) (for the opponent's path) - 1? Because the winner is counted once in the first subtree and the opponent's subtree is another. Wait, maybe f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let's try to see for k=2.\n\nIf f(2) = f(1) + f(0). Assuming f(0) is 1, then f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3. Which matches the example where n=3 gives output 2. So for n=3, the maximum is 2. Which aligns with this. So, for k=2, f(k)=3.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3, f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 =5. So for n=5, the maximum is 3. Let's see if that makes sense. For example, with 5 players, the winner can play 3 games. Let's think:\n\nGame 1: winner plays against player 2 (winner has 1 game).\n\nGame 2: winner plays against someone who has played 1 game. Let's say player 3. Then, the winner has 2 games.\n\nGame 3: the winner needs to play against someone who has played 2 or 1 games. But how to get that? The opponent must have played 2 games. So, that opponent must have a path of two games. Which requires 3 players (as per f(2)=3). So, the total players would be 3 (from the previous f(2)) + 2 (from the previous f(1))? Wait, maybe the formula is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). So, for k=3, it's 3+2=5. So for n=5, the answer is 3. \n\nSo, the idea is that for each k, the minimal number of players required is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2), with base cases f(0)=1, f(1)=2. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum k such that f(k) ≤ n. \n\nBut what's f(k) here? Let's compute some terms:\n\nk | f(k)\n0 | 1\n1 | 2\n2 | 3\n3 | 5\n4 | 8\n5 | 13\n6 | 21\n... etc. \n\nSo this is the Fibonacci sequence starting with 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... So f(k) is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number if we start from F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, etc. Let me check:\n\nFibonacci numbers:\n\nF(0) = 0\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nF(6) = 8\n\nF(7) = 13\n\nF(8) = 21\n\nSo, for f(0) = 1 = F(2) + 1? Not sure. Alternatively, f(k) is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number if we start from F(0)=0, F(1)=1. Let's see:\n\nFor k=0, f(0) = 1. Which is F(2) = 1. Yes.\n\nk=1: f(1)=2 = F(3) + something? F(3)=2. So yes. So f(k) = F(k+2). Let's check:\n\nk=2: f(2) = 3. F(4)=3. Yes. k=3: f(3)=5=F(5)=5. Yes. So the formula is f(k) = F(k+2), where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence with F(0)=0, F(1)=1, etc.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤ n. \n\nBut wait, let's test with the sample input. \n\nSample Input 2: n=3. So, F(k+2) ≤ 3. Let's compute:\n\nk=1: F(3)=2 ≤3 → yes.\n\nk=2: F(4)=3 ≤3 → yes.\n\nk=3: F(5)=5>3. So maximum k is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nAnother sample: n=4. What is the maximum k?\n\nWe have F(k+2) ≤4.\n\nCheck for k=2: F(4)=3 ≤4. k=3: F(5)=5>4. So maximum k is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nAnother sample: n=10. The output is 4. Let's see. Let's find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤10.\n\nLet's compute F values:\n\nF(0)=0\n\nF(1)=1\n\nF(2)=1\n\nF(3)=2\n\nF(4)=3\n\nF(5)=5\n\nF(6)=8\n\nF(7)=13\n\nSo for k=4: F(4+2)=F(6)=8 ≤10. For k=5: F(7)=13>10. So maximum k is 4. Which matches the sample output of 4. \n\nYes! So this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n. \n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this for very large n (up to 1e18). So we need to precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the point where F(m) exceeds 1e18. Let's think about how many terms that would take. The Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. Let's see:\n\nF(0)=0\n\nF(1)=1\n\nF(2)=1\n\nF(3)=2\n\nF(4)=3\n\nF(5)=5\n\nF(6)=8\n\nF(7)=13\n\nF(8)=21\n\nF(9)=34\n\nF(10)=55\n\nF(11)=89\n\nF(12)=144\n\nF(13)=233\n\nF(14)=377\n\nF(15)=610\n\nF(16)=987\n\nF(17)=1597\n\nF(18)=2584\n\n...\n\nEach term is roughly 1.6 times the previous. So for 1e18, the number of terms would be around 80 or so. Because F(80) is around 2.34e16, F(85) is 21, 22, 23... so let's compute some more:\n\nLet me think of the Fib numbers:\n\nF(0) = 0\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nF(6) = 8\n\nF(7) = 13\n\nF(8) = 21\n\nF(9) = 34\n\nF(10) = 55\n\nF(11) = 89\n\nF(12) = 144\n\nF(13) = 233\n\nF(14) = 377\n\nF(15) = 610\n\nF(16) = 987\n\nF(17) = 1597\n\nF(18) = 2584\n\nF(19) = 4181\n\nF(20) = 6765\n\nF(21) = 10946\n\nF(22) = 17711\n\nF(23) = 28657\n\nF(24) = 46368\n\nF(25) = 75025\n\nF(26) = 121393\n\nF(27) = 196418\n\nF(28) = 317811\n\nF(29) = 514229\n\nF(30) = 832040\n\nF(31) = 1,346,269\n\nF(32) = 2,178,309\n\nF(33) = 3,524,578\n\nF(34) = 5,702,887\n\nF(35) = 9,227,465\n\nF(36) = 14,930,352\n\nF(37) = 24,157,817\n\nF(38) = 39,088,169\n\nF(39) = 63,245,986\n\nF(40) = 102,334,155\n\nF(41) = 165,580,141\n\nF(42) = 267,914,296\n\nF(43) = 433,494,437\n\nF(44) = 701,408,733\n\nF(45) = 1,134,903,170\n\nF(46) = 1,836,311,903\n\nF(47) = 2,971,215,073\n\nF(48) = 4,807,526,976\n\nF(49) = 7,778,742,049\n\nF(50) = 12,586,269,025\n\nF(51) = 20,365,011,074\n\nF(52) = 32,951,280,099\n\nF(53) = 53,316,291,173\n\nF(54) = 86,267,571,272\n\nF(55) = 139,583,862,445\n\nF(56) = 225,851,433,717\n\nF(57) = 365,435,296,162\n\nF(58) = 591,286,729,879\n\nF(59) = 956,722,026,041\n\nF(60) = 1,548,008,755,920\n\nF(61) = 2,504,730,781,961\n\nF(62) = 4,052,739,537,881\n\nF(63) = 6,557,470,319,842\n\nF(64) = 10,610,209,857,723\n\nF(65) = 17,167,680,177,565\n\nF(66) = 27,777,890,035,288\n\nF(67) = 44,945,570,212,853\n\nF(68) = 72,723,460,248,141\n\nF(69) = 117,669,030,460,994\n\nF(70) = 190,392,490,709,135\n\nF(71) = 308,061,521,170,129\n\nF(72) = 498,454,011,879,264\n\nF(73) = 806,515,533,049,393\n\nF(74) = 1,304,969,544,928,657\n\nF(75) = 2,111,485,077,978,050\n\nF(76) = 3,416,454,622,906,707\n\nF(77) = 5,527,939,700,884,757\n\nF(78) = 8,944,394,323,791,464\n\nF(79) = 14,472,334,024,676,221\n\nF(80) = 23,416,728,348,467,685\n\nSo for n up to 1e18, we need to generate up to F(85) or something like that. Let's see:\n\nF(85) is going to be way larger than 1e18. So generating all Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18 is manageable. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers F(m) until F(m) exceeds 1e18. For each m, store the value.\n\nOnce we have this list, for a given n, we find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤n. Then, the answer is k.\n\nWait, let me think again. For example, if n is 3, then F(4)=3. So k+2 =4 → k=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Generate all Fibonacci numbers until F(m) exceeds 1e18. Let's call the list fibs, where fibs[0] = F(0) = 0, fibs[1] = F(1) = 1, etc.\n\n2. For a given n, find the largest m such that F(m) ≤n. Then, the answer is (m-2). Because:\n\nWe want F(k+2) ≤n. So m =k+2. So k = m-2.\n\nBut wait, for example, when n=3, the largest m where F(m) ≤3 is m=4 (since F(4)=3). Then k=4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4. The largest m where F(m) ≤4 is m=4 (F(4)=3), since F(5)=5>4. So k=4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5. The largest m is 5 (F(5)=5). So k=5-2=3. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if n is between F(m) and F(m+1)? For example, n=4. F(4)=3, F(5)=5. So the maximum m is 4. So answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is to find the maximum m where F(m) ≤n. Then, the answer is m-2.\n\nBut how do we find this m? For a given n, we can iterate through the precomputed fibs list and find the largest m where fibs[m] <=n.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the list of fibs will be small (around 80 elements), so even a linear search is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate all fib numbers up to the first one exceeding 1e18.\n\nThen, find the largest m where fib[m] <=n.\n\nThe answer is m-2.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1? According to the problem statement, n starts from 2. So the input is n ≥2.\n\nBut for n=2, the fib numbers:\n\nLooking for m where F(m) ≤2. Let's see:\n\nF(3)=2. So m=3. Then answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct (as sample input 2 gives output 1).\n\nAnother example: n=10. The largest m where F(m) ≤10 is m=6 (F(6)=8). Because F(7)=13>10. So answer is 6-2=4, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nWe can precompute the fib numbers. Let's generate them in a list. Let's start with F(0) =0, F(1)=1, etc.\n\nBut for our purposes, we need to generate all F(m) up to 1e18.\n\nLet me write code to generate the list:\n\nInitialize a list, say fibs = [0, 1]\n\nthen while the last element is <= 1e18:\n\n   append next element (fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])\n\nOnce generated, for a given n, find the maximum m such that fibs[m] <=n.\n\nBut how to find m? Since the list is sorted, we can loop through the list until we find the first element larger than n. Then take the previous index.\n\nAlternatively, use binary search.\n\nBut since the list is small, even a linear search is acceptable.\n\nOnce we find the maximum m, then answer is m-2.\n\nBut let's test for n=2:\n\nfibs[3] is 2. So m=3. answer is 3-2=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3. m=4 (fibs[4]=3). answer is 4-2=2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nGenerate the fib list.\n\nFind the largest m where fibs[m] <=n.\n\nanswer is m-2.\n\nBut what if the n is less than 2?\n\nBut according to the input constraints, n ≥2.\n\nBut for example, n=2, the answer is 1.\n\nBut what about n=1? Well, the problem says n≥2.\n\nSo code:\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for n=1, but input is 2<=n<=1e18.\n\nSo, code:\n\nGenerate the list of fibs.\n\nThen, find the largest m where fibs[m] <=n.\n\nBut how to generate the fibs:\n\nLet me think. Let's start with a list, say:\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\n\nthen while the next number is <= 1e18:\n\n   append next number.\n\nBut for example, the code can be:\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_fib > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nBut in Python, for big numbers, it's okay.\n\nBut let's generate the list.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for the input n, we can iterate through the list to find the maximum m.\n\nBut for example, let's generate the list:\n\nLet me think of the code:\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    # generate fibs\n\n    fibs = [0, 1]\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n        if next_f > 1e18:\n\n            break\n\n        fibs.append(next_f)\n\n    # Now find the maximum m where fibs[m] <=n\n\n    # find the largest index m such that fibs[m] <=n\n\n    # since the list is in increasing order.\n\n    # We can loop through the list.\n\n    # Or use bisect.\n\n    # Let's use bisect.\n\n    import bisect\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) -1\n\n    if idx < 0:\n\n        # impossible, since n >=2, and fibs[0] is 0, fibs[1] is 1, fibs[2] is 1, etc.\n\n        # for n=2, the first element larger than 2 is fibs[3] = 2?\n\n        # Wait, the fibs list is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...]\n\n        # So for n=2, bisect_right returns index 4 (since fibs[3] is 2, and fibs[4] is 3. So bisect_right returns 4, subtract 1 gives 3. Which is correct.\n\n    m = idx\n\n    answer = m -2\n\n    print(answer)\n\nWait, but for example, when n is exactly a Fibonacci number. Let's take n=3. The fibs list includes 3 as fibs[4]. So bisect_right returns 5 (since fibs[4] is 3, and the next is 5. So bisect_right returns 5. Subtract 1 gives 4. Then answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nBut for n=2, the fibs list has [0,1,1,2,3,...]. So bisect_right(fibs, 2) would return 4 (since all elements before index 4 are <=2. The elements are 0,1,1,2,3. So bisect_right returns 4. Then idx is 4-1=3? Wait, no. Wait, bisect_right returns the insertion point. So for example, if the list is [0,1,1,2,3], and we search for 2, bisect_right returns 4, because the insertion point is after all elements equal to 2. So the index is 4. Then idx is 4-1=3? No, the code says:\n\nidx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) -1.\n\nSo for n=2, bisect_right returns 4. idx=3. m is 3. answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=3. bisect_right returns 5 (since fibs[4] is 3, and fibs[5] is 5. So the insertion point for 3 is 5. So idx is 5-1=4. answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4. The fibs list has 3, then 5. So bisect_right returns 5 (since 4 is between 3 and 5). idx=5-1=4. answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5. bisect_right returns 6 (since fibs[5] is 5, and the next is 8. So insertion point is 6. idx=5. answer is 5-2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nBut what about when n is less than 2? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 2.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. Output is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4. Output is 2.\n\nSample Input 10: output 4.\n\nAnother sample: n=2. Output is 1.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut there's a problem: the initial fibs list is [0,1], then we generate up to the next_f that exceeds 1e18.\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float. So perhaps better to use integers. Let's use 10**18.\n\nSo the code for generating the fibs:\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_f > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_f)\n\nBut what about when the next_f is exactly 1e18? It will be added. But for n=1e18, that is allowed.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut let's think about the case when n is 1. But according to the problem, n starts from 2.\n\nNow, what if n is 1? Well, the code would have idx = bisect_right(fibs, 1) -1. For example, the fibs list is [0,1,1,2, ...]. So bisect_right(fibs, 1) returns 3 (since the elements are 0,1,1,2...). So idx=3-1=2. answer is 2-2=0. But for n=1, which is not allowed, but the code would return 0. However, since the problem says n≥2, this is not a problem.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfibs = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_f > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_f)\n\nidx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n\nprint(idx - 2)\n\nWait, but what if the idx is 0 or 1?\n\nFor example, if n=2, then the fibs list includes 0,1,1,2,3, etc. So bisect_right returns 4, idx=3. 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nWhat if n=1? Well, the code returns 0-2=-2. But n is at least 2.\n\nBut for n=2, the code works.\n\nBut let's check for n=2.\n\nThe fibs list after generation would be [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, ...]. So bisect_right(fibs, 2) returns 4 (since the first element after 2 is 3). So idx=4-1=3. 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=1. The code would return idx=2 (bisect_right returns 3, subtract 1 is 2). 2-2=0. Which is wrong, but n is not allowed to be 1.\n\nNow, what about n=1?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is 2 ≤ n ≤ 1e18.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the code would output 0. But since the input is not allowed to be 1, that's not a problem.\n\nBut let's think about n=2, which is allowed.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2. Output is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=5. Output is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=10. Output is 4. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=8. The largest fib is 8 (fibs[6] = 8). So m=6. answer is 6-2=4. So for n=8, the answer is 4. Let's see:\n\nThe maximum number of games is 4. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nThe f(k) for k=4 is F(6) =8. So yes, the answer is 4. Which would require the winner to play 4 games. That would require a tournament structure that allows that. \n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut wait, the code may have a problem when the generated fibs list does not include the exact value. For example, if n is between two Fibonacci numbers. But the code finds the largest one that is less than or equal to n.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\nLet's run through each case:\n\nFor n=2:\n\nidx is 3 (bisect_right returns 4, minus 1 is 3). 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nn=3: idx is 4 (bisect_right returns 5, minus 1 is 4). 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nn=4: bisect_right finds the first element larger than 4 is 5 (fibs[5]=5). So idx=5-1=4. 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nn=10: the fibs list has 8 (fibs[6] = 8), then 13 (fibs[7]=13). So bisect_right returns 7, minus 1 is 6. 6-2=4. Correct.\n\nSo all samples pass.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in Python, the initial fibs list is [0,1], then we generate next_f.\n\nBut let's make sure that the code generates all necessary numbers.\n\nAnother test case: n=5.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves leveraging the properties of Fibonacci numbers to efficiently compute the result for very large values of n.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key constraint is that two players can only compete if the difference in their number of previously played games is at most one. This structure resembles a Fibonacci sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. Specifically, the k-th term in this sequence corresponds to the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number starting from F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.\n3. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to a value that exceeds 10^18, which is the upper bound for n.\n4. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: Use binary search to find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given n, which allows us to determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    fibs = [0, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n        if next_f > 10**18:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_f)\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(fibs, n) - 1\n    print(idx - 2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the point where the next number would exceed 10^18. This ensures we handle the upper constraint of the input efficiently.\n2. **Binary Search**: Using the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, we find the position where the given number of players `n` would fit in the Fibonacci list. This position helps us determine the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`.\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: The index found using binary search is adjusted to account for the offset in the Fibonacci sequence, giving us the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and leverages the properties of Fibonacci numbers to provide an optimal solution.",
