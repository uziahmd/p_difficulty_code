The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task to the next, considering the order of tasks. Since each task must be done in order, we have to process them sequentially.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each task, we need to compute the time it takes to get from the previous task's location to the current one. But since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise, the distance between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nWait, for example, if she is at house x and needs to go to house y, how much time does that take? Well, since movement is clockwise, the number of steps is (y - x) mod n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Wait, if x is 3 and y is 2 in a 4-house setup, moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4 = ( -1 +4 ) = 3. So yes, the formula is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + n). Or more generally, (y - x) % n? Wait, no. Because if y is greater than x, then (y -x) is positive. If y is less than x, then (y -x) is negative. But adding n and taking mod n would give the correct steps. But since the movement is clockwise, the minimal steps between x and y is (y -x) mod n. Wait, no. Wait, the distance between x and y when moving clockwise is (y -x) if y >=x, else (y -x + n). Which is equivalent to (y -x) % n if the modulus is positive. Wait, for example, if x=3, y=2, n=4: (2-3) = -1 mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance between x and y is (y -x) mod n. But wait, in the problem statement, the movement is only allowed clockwise, so the time to move from x to y is exactly that value.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the movement is along the ringroad, which is clockwise. So Xenia can't go backward. So the time between two points is the number of steps moving clockwise from x to y.\n\nSo for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to calculate the time between them, and sum them all up.\n\nBut what about the starting position? Initially, Xenia is at house 1. So the first task is at a_1. So the time from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Wait, no. Wait, for example, if n=4, starting at 1, moving to 3: steps are 1→2→3, which is 2 steps. (3-1) = 2. So yes. If a_1 is 1, then the time is 0. So for the first task, the time is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Or maybe (a_1 - 1) if a_1 >=1, but since a_1 is between 1 and n, the mod is not needed. Wait, but since the starting position is 1, and the first task is a_1, the time to get there is (a_1 - 1) steps if moving clockwise. Because moving from 1 to a_1 directly.\n\nBut if a_1 is 1, then 0 steps. So yes, that's correct.\n\nBut then for subsequent tasks, for example, the previous position is prev, and the current task is a_i. Then the time between prev and a_i is (a_i - prev) mod n? Wait, no. Because if prev is 3, a_i is 2, n=4. Then the steps are 3 →4 →1 →2: 3 steps. Which is (2 -3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. Correct. So yes, the formula is (current - previous) mod n. But since the mod can be negative, but in Python, the mod operator returns a non-negative result. Wait, in Python, (-1) %4 is 3, right? So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Initialize current position as 1.\n\n- For each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   - compute the distance from current position to a_i, which is (a_i - current) mod n.\n\n   - add that to the total time.\n\n   - update current position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the time between them is zero. So the code will handle that automatically.\n\nSo for example, in the second sample input:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the tasks are 2,3,3.\n\nSo initial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: distance is (2-1) mod 4 = 1. Total time is 1. Current position is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. Total time is 2. Current position is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-3) mod4=0. Total time remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: first sample input is 4 3, tasks are 3,2,3.\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3: distance is 3-1=2 steps. (mod4 gives 2). Total is 2. Now current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2: (2-3) mod4 is ( -1 ) mod4=3. So total becomes 2+3=5. Now current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-2)=1 mod4 is 1. Total is 5+1=6. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to process the list of a_i's, and compute the sum of (a_i - previous) mod n for each step, where previous starts at 1, then becomes a_1, then a_2, etc.\n\nSo the steps for code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nfor each ai in the list:\n\n   distance = (ai - current) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current = ai\n\nreturn total_time.\n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nBecause for each step, moving from current to ai, the minimal steps required is (ai - current) mod n. Because the movement is clockwise only.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this seems straightforward.\n\nNow, let's check edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=2, m=1, a1=1. So initial position is 1. The distance is (1-1) mod 2 = 0. So total time is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a = [2, 1]. Then:\n\nFirst step: current is 1, ai is 2: (2-1) mod2=1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond step: ai is 1. (1-2) mod2 = -1 mod2 = 1. total is 2. So total time is 2. Which is correct: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). So total 2 steps.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[3, 5]. Then:\n\nFirst step: 1 to 3: 2 steps. current is 3.\n\nSecond step: 5-3 = 2 mod5 is 2. total is 4. So total steps 2+2=4. Which is correct: 1→2→3 (2 steps), then 3→4→5 (2 steps). So total 4 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead input: first line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but for the actual code, we need to read from stdin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    diff = (ai - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's test the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3. (3-1) mod4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2. (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4 = 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3. (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 6. Which is correct.\n\nSample Output is 6. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nai=2: (2-1) mod4 =1. total=1. current=2.\n\nai=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total=2. current=3.\n\nai=3: (3-3)=0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: when a_i is same as previous. Like m=2, a=[2,2]. Then the steps are (2-1) modn (say n=5: 1 step), then (2-2) mod5=0. Total 1.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when the tasks are in reverse order, like n=5, m=3, a=[5,4,3]. Let's see:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 5: (5-1) mod5 is 4. total is 4. current is 5.\n\nSecond ai is 4: (4-5) mod5 is -1 mod5=4. total 8. current 4.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-4) mod5 is -1 mod5=4. total 12. So total steps 4+4+4=12.\n\nWhich is correct. Because moving from 5 to 4 is 4 steps (5→1→2→3→4?), no. Wait, moving clockwise from 5 to 4: since it's a ringroad. Wait, 5 is adjacent to 4 and 1. So moving clockwise from 5 to 4 is one step? Wait, no. Because the movement is clockwise. So from 5, moving clockwise, the next house is 1, then 2, etc. So to get from 5 to 4, you have to go all the way around. So steps would be 5 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4: 4 steps. Which is indeed (4 -5) mod5 = -1 mod5=4. So yes. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, what about the constraints? n and m up to 1e5. The code is O(m), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code is correct. Let me write it.\n",
