The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise, the distance between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the time between consecutive tasks.\n\nLet's say she is currently at position current_pos, and the next task is at next_pos. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the time is (next_pos - current_pos) mod n if next_pos is not equal to current_pos. Wait, no. Wait, if current_pos is 3 and next_pos is 2, then moving clockwise would require going through 4, 1, 2. Which is (n - current_pos + next_pos) steps? Or maybe (next_pos - current_pos + n) % n ?\n\nWait for example, n=4. current is 3, next is 2. The distance is 3 →4 →1 →2: that's 3 steps. (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. So yes, (next_pos - current_pos) mod n gives the correct number of steps. But since moving clockwise, when next is before current, we have to go around the circle.\n\nSo for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the distance between them, and sum all those distances.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in the order a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. However, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the time between them is zero. But she has to complete all previous tasks before doing the next. So even if two tasks are in the same house, she can do them consecutively without moving. So the time between them is zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Start at position 1.\n\n- For each task in order from a_1 to a_m:\n\n   - Compute the distance from current position to a_i.\n\n   - Add that distance to the total time.\n\n   - Update current position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the first task is a_1. So Xenia starts at 1, and moves to a_1. Then from a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nBut how do we compute the distance between current position and the next task's position?\n\nYes. So the initial position is 1. Then for each task in the list, compute the steps needed to get from the previous position to this task's position, add that to the total.\n\nSo for example, the first example input is 4 3, and the tasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nLet's walk through that:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance from 1 to 3: (3-1) = 2 steps. So total is 2. Now current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3. So add 3. Total now 5. Current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3: 1 step. Total becomes 6. So output is 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, the problem is to process the list of a_i's, and compute the sum of the distances between consecutive positions, starting from 1.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between current and next?\n\nThe formula is (next - current) mod n, but since moving clockwise. Wait, let's think again.\n\nIf current is 3, next is 2. The distance is (2 - 3 + n) % n. Which is ( -1 +4 ) = 3 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be written as (next - current) % n, but since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values, perhaps better to compute it as (next - current) % n, but since the movement is clockwise, the minimal steps is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n).\n\nAlternatively, the formula is (next - current) if next >= current else (next - current + n). But in code, how to compute that?\n\nWell, in Python, (next - current) % n would give the correct value. Because for example, (2 - 3) % 4 is (-1) %4 = 3. Which is correct. So yes, using (next - current) % n gives the correct steps. But wait, what if next is equal to current? Then the difference is zero, mod n is zero. Which is correct. So that's the way to compute the steps between current and next.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize current = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each a_i in the list:\n\n   delta = (a_i - current) % n\n\n   total_time += delta\n\n   current = a_i\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but why is that correct? Because for each step, moving from current to a_i, the minimal steps is (a_i - current) mod n. Because the movement is clockwise.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nNow let's test the second example.\n\nSecond example input is 4 3, and the tasks are 2,3,3.\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2. (2-1) mod4 is 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3. (3-2) mod4 is 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3. (3-3) mod4 is 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each ai in the list:\n\n   delta = (ai - current) % n\n\n   total_time += delta\n\n   current = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the list is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because in the input, m is given as 1<=m<=1e5.\n\nWait, the input says m can be 1. So the code will handle that.\n\nLet me think about some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=2, m=1, a1=1. Then the time is (1-1) mod 2 = 0. So total is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a = [1, 2]. Then first step is 1 to 1: 0. Then 1 to 2: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Total is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a = [2, 1]. First step: (2-1) mod2 = 1. Then (1-2) mod2 = ( -1 ) mod2 = 1. Total is 2.\n\nWhich is correct. Because moving from 1 to 2 (1 step), then from 2 to 1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut note that the input is read from stdin. So the first line is n and m, then the second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is given as '4 3\\n3 2 3', which would be n=4, m=3, and the list is [3,2,3].\n\nSo in Python, the code would read:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading inputs, there may be leading or trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace is okay.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operation with negative numbers returns positive. For example, (-1) %4 is 3. So yes, the code is correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nLet me check the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: (3-1) mod4 is 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod4 is (-1) mod4 = 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is 4 3, a is [2,3,3]. The code would compute:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst num 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond num 3: (3-2)=1 mod4 is 1. total 2. current is 3.\n\nThird num 3: (3-3) mod4 =0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The code would compute:\n\ncurrent =1.\n\nFirst num 2: (2-1) mod2 =1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond num 1: (1-2) mod2 = -1 mod2=1. total is 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when the same house is repeated. Like m=2, a=[1,1]. The code would compute:\n\ncurrent is 1. first num is 1: delta is 0. total 0. current is 1. Second num is 1: delta 0. total remains 0. So output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when n is 1e5 and m is 1e5? The code is O(m), which is acceptable.\n\nYes, the code should be efficient enough.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time taken to move between consecutive tasks, considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete tasks located at various houses in a specific order. Each task must be completed in sequence, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time.\n2. **Circular Distance Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise from one house to another can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. The distance from the current house to the next task's house is computed as `(next_house - current_house) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This ensures that the movement is always calculated in the clockwise direction.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, iterate through each task, compute the time required to move to the next task's house, and accumulate the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        delta = (num - current) % n\n        total += delta\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `current` set to 1 and initialize `total` time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location in the list:\n  - Calculate the distance from the current house to the next task's house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n  - Add this distance to the total time.\n  - Update the current position to the task's house.\n- **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that each movement is calculated optimally in O(1) time per task, leading to an overall time complexity of O(m), which is efficient for the given constraints.",
