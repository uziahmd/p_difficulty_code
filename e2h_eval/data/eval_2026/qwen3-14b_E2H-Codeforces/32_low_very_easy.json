    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to consider each element, remove it, compute the new max and min, and then find the minimum instability. But if we do this naively, it would be O(n^2) time, which isn't feasible for n up to 1e5. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, what's the original instability? It's max(a) - min(a). When we remove one element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nIf the element we remove is not the current max or min, then the max and min remain the same. So the instability remains the same as the original. But if we remove the max, then the new max is the second highest element. Similarly, if we remove the min, the new min is the second lowest. So maybe the optimal choice is to remove either the max or the min, but not sure.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are multiple instances of max or min. For example, if the array has multiple max elements, removing one of them would leave others, so the max remains the same. So in that case, removing a max element doesn't change the max. Similarly for min.\n\nSo the key idea here is that the minimal instability after removing one element can be achieved by considering two cases: when we remove the first occurrence of the min or max, or when we remove the first occurrence of the max or min. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the original array. Let's sort the array. Suppose the array is sorted. Then the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If I remove the first element (a[0]), then the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If I remove the last element (a[-1]), the new instability is a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal instability would be the minimum between these two options. But what if there are duplicates?\n\nWait, but for example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], as in the first example. When sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. The original instability is 6. If you remove 7, the instability is 3-1=2. If you remove 1, the instability is 7-3=4. So the best is to remove 7. So in this case, the answer is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 1, 1, 1], then removing any element gives instability 0. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If we remove 5, the instability is 4-1=3. If we remove 1, it's 5-2=3. But maybe if we remove 2, the instability is 5-1=4. Which is worse. So the best is to remove either 1 or 5. So the answer would be 3. So the minimal instability is min between (a[-2]-a[0], a[-1]-a[1]).\n\nSo in general, when the array is sorted, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between the instability when we remove the first element (so the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]) or when we remove the last element (a[-2] - a[0]). But wait, what if there are other elements that are not the first or last that could be removed to get a better result?\n\nWait, suppose the array is [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]. The original instability is 5. If I remove 4, the array becomes [1,2,5,6], instability is 5. If I remove 2, the array becomes [1,4,5,6], instability is 5. If I remove 5, the instability is 6-1=5. So no improvement. However, if I remove 1, instability is 6-2=4. If I remove 6, instability is 5-1=4. So the minimal is 4. Which is min between a[-2] - a[0] (5-1=4) and a[-1] - a[1] (6-2=4). So in this case, the answer is 4.\n\nSo the conclusion",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the minimum and maximum values after removing one element.\n2. **Evaluate Instability After Removal**: After sorting, the optimal removals to consider are either the first element or the last element. This is because removing these elements will affect the min or max of the array, respectively. \n3. **Calculate Minimum Instability**: By considering the two scenarios (removing the first element or the last element), we can compute the instability for both cases and take the minimum of these two values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    a.sort()\n    min_instability = min(a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1])\n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for calculating instability.\n2. **Instability Calculation**: \n   - Removing the first element (smallest) results in the instability being calculated as the difference between the second last element (new minimum) and the last element (maximum).\n   - Removing the last element (largest) results in the instability being calculated as the difference between the last element (new maximum) and the second element (minimum).\n3. **Efficiency**: Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, which is efficient given the constraints. The subsequent calculations are done in constant time, leading to an overall efficient solution.",
