The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints. The goal is to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the frog moves. The frog starts at 0. From position k, it can jump to k+a or k-b. But it can't go outside [0, x] during any of its jumps. So for each x, f(x) counts all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can jump forward (a steps) or backward (b steps), but can't go below 0 or above x. However, the frog can make multiple jumps. \n\nWait, but the frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a and subtracting b. However, since the frog can't step outside [0, x], the problem becomes finding all positions reachable through such operations, considering the boundaries.\n\nBut how to model this for arbitrary x? For example, when x is large enough, maybe the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a,b). Because normally, if there's no boundary constraints, the frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b. But here, the boundaries complicate things.\n\nWait, but the frog starts at 0. So the positions it can reach (without boundaries) would be all numbers of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But since a and b are positive integers, their gcd is important here. Let me think: the set of positions reachable by the frog (without boundaries) would be all multiples of d, where d = gcd(a, b). Because any linear combination of a and b is a multiple of d. However, since the frog can only add a or subtract b, perhaps the positions reachable are all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d, but also non-negative. Wait, no. Because the frog can only move in steps of +a or -b. So for example, if you have a=5 and b=3, then the frog can reach positions like 0, 5, 10, 5-3=2, 5+5=10, 2+5=7, etc. But the reachable positions might be all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod gcd(5,3)=1. So in that case, any integer can be reached. But that's not the case because the frog can't reach negative numbers. Wait, but if the frog can jump backward (subtract b), but can't go below zero. So maybe the reachable positions are those that are congruent to 0 mod d, and also can be expressed as some combination of adding a and subtracting b, but ensuring that during the process, the frog never goes below 0 or beyond x.\n\nBut for the problem, when x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d and within [0, x]. Because once the frog can reach a certain position, it can keep adding a steps to reach higher positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and is >=0. Because, for example, if d divides a and b, then the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d. But how?\n\nWait, the problem is similar to the classic coin problem. For example, if you have coins of denominations a and b, then the largest amount that cannot be formed is ab - a - b (if a and b are coprime). But in our case, the frog can use any combination of adding a and subtracting b. However, the frog can't go below zero. So perhaps the reachable positions are all numbers that are multiples of d, and greater than or equal to some value.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think about the problem again. The key is that for a given x, f(x) is the number of positions reachable under the constraints that the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nSo for each x, we need to find the count of positions that can be reached by the frog's movement, considering the boundaries.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute f(x) for each x individually. We need a formula or pattern that allows us to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me look at the examples. \n\nIn the first example, m=7, a=5, b=3. The output is 19. The explanation says that f(5) is 3. Let's see why. When x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and 5-3=2. Then from 2, can it jump to 2+5=7, which is beyond x=5, so not allowed. Or 2-3=-1, which is invalid. So the positions are 0, 2, 5. Hence f(5)=3. Similarly, for x=7, the frog can reach more positions. Like from 5, you can jump to 5+5=10 (invalid), or 5-3=2. From 2, you can jump to 2+5=7 (allowed). So 7 is added. Then from 7, you can jump to 7-3=4, which is allowed. From 4, you can jump to 4+5=9 (invalid) or 4-3=1. From 1, you can jump to 1+5=6 (allowed). Then from 6, jump to 6-3=3. From 3, jump to 3+5=8 (invalid) or 3-3=0. So the positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions. Hence f(7) is 8.\n\nSo for x=7, the frog can reach positions that are multiples of 1 (since gcd(5,3)=1) and within [0,7]. But why isn't it all numbers from 0 to 7? Because maybe the frog can't reach some numbers. For example, 0 is reachable. 1 is reachable via 2-3? Wait, 2 is reachable, then from 2 subtract 3 to get -1, which is invalid. So how does the frog reach 1? Oh, in the example, the frog can reach 1 by going from 6 (which is reachable) to 6-3=3, then from 3 to 3-3=0, but how to reach 1?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me re-examine the first example. How does the frog reach 1?\n\nThe frog starts at 0. Then jumps to 5 (0+5). From 5, it can jump to 2 (5-3). From 2, it can jump to 7 (2+5). From 7, it can jump to 7-3=4. From 4, it can jump to 4-3=1. So yes, 1 is reachable. So for x=7, 1 is included. So the positions are all numbers from 0 to 7 except maybe some. But since the gcd is 1, all numbers should be reachable. But wait, why isn't 0 to 7 all reachable?\n\nWait, in the example, f(7) is 8. But 0-7 is 8 numbers. So that's exactly all numbers. But according to the note, f(7) is 8, which matches. So in that case, when x is large enough, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 to x. But why?\n\nAh, because when x is large enough, the frog can reach any number that is congruent to 0 mod d (d=1 in this case), which is all numbers. So for x ≥ some value, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 to x. But how?\n\nWait, the problem is that even though the frog can reach any number that's congruent to 0 mod d, but when d=1, that's all numbers. But how does the frog reach them? For example, in the first example, the frog can reach 1. How?\n\nWell, the frog can reach 2, then 2 + 5*... Well, maybe the frog can reach any number once x is big enough. But how to find when that happens.\n\nBut let's think about the general case. Let's suppose that d = gcd(a, b). Then, the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, provided that the frog can reach it through some combination of adding a and subtracting b steps, without violating the boundaries. However, when x is sufficiently large, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and within [0, x]. \n\nBut how to determine what \"sufficiently large\" means. For example, if a and b are coprime, then the frog can reach any number ≥ (some value). But how to find that value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x ≥ some value, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and within [0, x]. Then, the function f(x) would be floor(x/d) + 1 (if d divides x) or something like that. But how to find that threshold.\n\nBut the problem requires handling x up to m=1e9, so we need an efficient way to compute the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x).\n\nLet me think of different cases:\n\nCase 1: a = b. Then, the frog can jump forward a steps or backward a steps. But starting at 0, the frog can only reach 0, because any forward jump would take it to a, then from there, it could jump back to 0, but if a is larger than x, then it can't. Wait, for example, a = b = 5. Then, the frog can jump from 0 to 5 (if x ≥ 5). But from 5, it can jump back to 0. However, if x is 5, then the frog can reach 0 and 5. If x is 6, then from 5, the frog can jump to 5 + 5 = 10 (invalid) or 5 -5 = 0. So the frog can't reach any other positions. Thus, for x ≥ 5, the frog can reach 0 and 5. Wait, but then for x=10, the frog can reach 0,5,10. Because from 5, it can jump to 10 (if x ≥10). So in this case, the frog can reach positions that are multiples of a (since a = b). So f(x) is the number of multiples of a between 0 and x, inclusive. Which is floor(x/a) + 1.\n\nBut in this case, the sum from 0 to m would be sum_{x=0}^m (floor(x/a)+1). Which can be computed with some math.\n\nBut how to handle this in general.\n\nSo the key seems to be to find for each x, the number of positions reachable by the frog. Let's think of two possibilities:\n\nIf the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (where d = gcd(a, b)) and within [0, x], then f(x) is equal to the number of such positions. But this is only true when x is large enough. Otherwise, when x is small, the frog may not be able to reach all such positions.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFind for each x, the number of positions in [0, x] that are multiples of d and can be reached by the frog's movement.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x ≥ (a + b) * something, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Then, for x larger than that, f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1. But how to find that threshold.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the problem in terms of the frog's movement. Since the frog can jump forward a steps or backward b steps. But the frog can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut when x is large enough, the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x. For example, if the frog can reach some number k, then it can reach k+a. So if the frog can reach some base positions, then it can reach all higher positions by adding a steps. However, the problem is whether the frog can reach all positions up to some value.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x is (a + b) * something. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be split into two parts:\n\n1. When x is less than some value (say, L), the frog can't reach all multiples of d. So we need to compute f(x) for x < L manually.\n\n2. When x >= L, f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nThen, the sum can be split into the sum for x < L and x >= L.\n\nBut how to find L, and how to compute f(x) for x < L.\n\nBut what's L? It's the minimal value where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. For example, in the first example where a=5, b=3, d=1. Then L is 5-3=2? Or some other value. But in that case, when x=7, which is larger than L, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7.\n\nBut how to find L in general.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and >= some value. Let's say that the minimal value that the frog can reach is 0. Then, once the frog can reach a certain number, it can reach all higher numbers by adding a steps. But how to ensure that the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut this depends on the ability to reach positions that are lower than x and allow adding a steps. For example, if the frog can reach a position k (which is a multiple of d), then it can reach k+a (also a multiple of d). But if k + a is <= x, then that's allowed. So if the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x - a, then adding a steps allows reaching all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how to ensure that the frog can reach all multiples of d up to some value.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of the coin problem. For example, with coins of denominations a and b, but here the frog can add a or subtract b. However, the frog can't go below 0.\n\nWait, but the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= 0. But how?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: once the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a. So if the frog can reach a position that is within [x - a, x], then it can reach x by adding a steps. But this depends on x being a multiple of d.\n\nBut for x to be reachable, it must be a multiple of d. So, the question is, for a given x (multiple of d), can the frog reach x.\n\nBut how to model this. For example, if x is a multiple of d, and x >= a, then the frog can reach x by jumping forward a steps multiple times. However, if x is less than a, then the frog can't reach it unless it's 0 or can be formed by subtracting b steps from some higher position.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe we need to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Once that is determined, then for x >= that value, the count is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find that value.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and >= (some value). Let's denote this value as S. Then, once x >= S, the frog can reach all multiples of d between 0 and x. For x < S, it can't reach all of them.\n\nBut how to find S.\n\nLet me think about the problem again. The frog starts at 0. From there, it can jump to a. Then, from a, it can jump to a + a, or a - b. So, the frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a and subtracting b steps. But since the frog can't go below zero, the positions must be non-negative.\n\nBut the key is that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and can be written as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that the intermediate steps don't go below zero or above x.\n\nBut perhaps for x large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. The minimal x where this is true would be when the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how to find that x. Maybe this is related to the concept of the Frobenius number, but since the frog can subtract steps, the problem is different.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of BFS. For each x, we can model the reachable positions. However, since m can be up to 1e9, this approach is not feasible for large x.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find that for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Or some similar condition.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= 0, provided that the frog can reach that position through some sequence of jumps. However, the frog can't reach a position if it requires going below 0 during the jumps.\n\nBut for example, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a. So, once the frog can reach a certain range of positions, it can reach higher positions by adding a steps. So, the problem is to find the minimal k such that all multiples of d from k onwards can be reached, and then for x >= k, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find this k.\n\nLet's take an example. For a=5, b=3. d=1. The minimal k is 0. Because the frog can reach all positions >=0. But how?\n\nIn the first example, when x=7, the frog can reach 0,1,2,...7. So for x >= 0, it's possible. So in this case, the minimal k is 0.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=2. d=2. Then, the frog can only reach 0, 2, 4, etc. But for x=2, the frog can reach 0 and 2. For x=3, it can still reach 0 and 2. For x=4, it can reach 0, 2, 4. So for x >=0, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/2) +1. So in this case, the minimal k is 0.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=2. d=1. What's the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of 1 (i.e., all integers) up to x. Let's see.\n\nThe frog starts at 0. From 0, it can jump to 3. From 3, it can jump to 3-2=1. From 1, it can jump to 1+3=4. From 4, jump to 4-2=2. From 2, jump to 2+3=5. From 5, jump to 5-2=3. And so on. So once the frog can reach 1, then it can reach all higher numbers by adding 3 steps. For example, 1 +3=4, then 4+3=7, etc. So once the frog can reach 1, it can reach all numbers >=1. But how to reach 1? It requires that from 3 (which is reachable), subtract 2 steps to reach 1. So the minimal x where this is possible is 3, but for x=3, the frog can reach 0, 3, and 1 (from 3-2). So for x >= 3, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 to x. Because once it reaches 1, it can add 3 steps to reach 4, then 7, etc. So for x >= 1, but how?\n\nWait, for x=1, the frog can't jump to 1. Because from 0, it can only jump to 3 (which is outside x=1). So for x=1, the frog can't reach 1. Only 0. So f(1) =1. For x=2, same thing. For x=3, the frog can reach 0, 3, and 1. So for x=3, f(x)=3. For x=4, the frog can reach 0, 3, 1, 4 (from 1+3), and 4-2=2. So for x=4, the reachable positions are 0,1,2,3,4. So f(x)=5. So for x >=3, the frog can reach all numbers up to x. So in this case, the minimal x where the frog can reach all numbers is 3. But how to find that.\n\nSo the problem seems to require finding the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d (which is 1 in this case) up to x. Once that x is found, for any x >= that value, f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this minimal x for general a and b.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal x is the maximum between a and (something related to b). Or perhaps it's related to the minimal number that can be reached by the frog.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as follows. The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and for which there exists some non-negative integers k and l such that:\n\nposition = k*a - l*b.\n\nBut since the frog can't go below 0 during any jump, but the problem allows the frog to take any path as long as during the jumps, it doesn't go outside [0, x]. However, the frog can reach a position even if during the journey it went beyond x, but that's not allowed. Wait, no. The frog's jumps must never go outside [0, x]. So the path must be such that all intermediate positions are within [0, x]. Therefore, the problem is more complex than just finding the existence of some combination of a and b.\n\nBut this seems very difficult to model. So perhaps the key is to realize that when x is large enough, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and within [0, x]. So the problem is to find for each x, the number of such positions, but for x < some threshold, it's different.\n\nBut how to find that threshold.\n\nLet's think of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and >=0. But to reach such positions, the frog needs to be able to reach them through some sequence of jumps that don't go out of bounds. However, if x is large enough, then the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x by using forward jumps and possibly some backward jumps to reach the necessary positions.\n\nFor example, in the case where a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any position >= (a*b - a - b) + 1, but this is the classic Frobenius problem. However, this is for the case where you can use any combination of adding a and b. In our case, the frog can only add a or subtract b. So the situation is different.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x is max(a, b) * something.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that there exists some non-negative integers k and l such that:\n\nposition = k*a - l*b.\n\nBut since the frog starts at 0, and can make any number of jumps, the question is whether such k and l exist for the given position. However, this ignores the constraints on the path (i.e., not stepping outside [0, x]).\n\nBut perhaps for x >= (some value), the path can be constructed in such a way that the frog doesn't go out of bounds. For example, once the frog has enough room to perform the necessary jumps, it can reach any multiple of d up to x.\n\nBut how to find that value.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0, provided that the position can be written as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But this is not correct because the frog can subtract b steps, but that would require that during the path, the frog doesn't go below 0.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0, but the way to reach it may involve going to higher positions first and then subtracting steps. For example, to reach 1 in the previous example (a=3, b=2), the frog jumps to 3 (k=1, l=0), then subtracts 2 steps to reach 1 (k=1, l=1). This path is allowed as long as x is at least 3.\n\nThus, for any multiple of d, say m, if there exists some integer k such that m = k*a - l*b, where l is such that during the path, the frog doesn't go below 0. But how to ensure that.\n\nBut perhaps, once x is large enough, the frog can reach any m that is a multiple of d and <=x. For example, if m is a multiple of d, then the frog can reach m by first jumping forward enough times to reach a position that is >= m + b, then subtracting b steps until it reaches m. This would require that x is at least m + b. But if x is large enough (like x >= m + b), then this is possible. However, m can be up to x, so this suggests that x needs to be large enough to allow this. \n\nBut this line of thinking is getting stuck. Let's try to find a way to model f(x) for general x.\n\nLet me consider the following approach:\n\nLet d = gcd(a, b). Let a' = a / d, b' = b / d. Then, since d is the gcd, a' and b' are coprime.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding positions that are multiples of d. Let me define y = x / d. Then, the problem becomes finding the number of positions in [0, x] that are multiples of d, and can be reached by the frog. Since the frog can only move in steps of a and -b, which are multiples of d, the positions are multiples of d. So we can divide everything by d and work with a' and b', which are coprime.\n\nSo now, the problem is equivalent to: the frog starts at 0, can jump +a' or -b', and can't step outside [0, y], where y = x/d. The number of reachable positions is the count of positions in [0, y] that are reachable by the frog. Then, f(x) is equal to this count multiplied by d? No, no. Because the original positions are multiples of d. So for each reachable position in the transformed problem (which is a number between 0 and y), the original position is k*d. So the count is the same as the count in the transformed problem.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving the same problem with a' and b' coprime, and x replaced by y = x/d. Let's focus on this transformed problem.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the number of reachable positions in [0, y] for the frog starting at 0, with jumps +a' or -b', and not stepping outside [0, y].\n\nSince a' and b' are coprime, the frog can reach any integer that is a linear combination of a' and b' with integer coefficients, but subject to the constraints of the path.\n\nBut again, how to find the number of reachable positions for a given y.\n\nLet me think of this transformed problem. Since a' and b' are coprime, any integer can be expressed as a linear combination of a' and b'. But again, the path must stay within [0, y].\n\nBut the frog can reach any integer that is >=0, provided that y is large enough. For example, once the frog can reach 1, then it can reach all numbers >=1 by adding a' steps. Because adding a' steps to any reachable number gives another reachable number.\n\nSo the key is to find the minimal value of y such that all integers from 0 to y are reachable. Once that y is found, for larger y, the number of reachable positions is y+1.\n\nBut how to find that minimal y.\n\nIn the transformed problem, since a' and b' are coprime, the minimal y is (a' -1) * (b' -1) ? Or something similar to the Frobenius number. Wait, the Frobenius number for two coprime integers a and b is ab -a -b. But that's the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, in our case, the frog can subtract steps, which allows for more flexibility. So the Frobenius number may not apply here.\n\nBut let's think of the following: the frog can reach any integer that is >= (some value), because once it can reach a certain number, it can add a' steps to reach higher numbers. So the problem is to find the minimal value of y such that all integers from 0 to y are reachable. Once this is found, for any larger y, the number of reachable positions is y + 1.\n\nBut how to find this value.\n\nLet me think of the example where a'=3, b'=2 (coprime). The minimal y is 3. Because for y=3, the frog can reach 0, 1, 2, 3. For y=1, the frog can reach 0 and 3 (but 3 is beyond y=1, so only 0). For y=2, the frog can reach 0 and 3 (again 3 is beyond y=2, so only 0). For y=3, it can reach 0, 3 (from 0 +a'), then from 3 subtract b'=2 to get 1. So 0, 1, 3. Then from 1, add a'=3 to get 4 (which is beyond y=3). So for y=3, the reachable positions are 0,1,3. So that's 3 positions, not all numbers up to 3. Wait, but earlier analysis said that for x=3 in the original problem, the frog can reach 0, 1, 3. So for y=3 (transformed problem), the count is 3. But the numbers up to y=3 are 0,1,2,3. So the frog can't reach 2 yet. How does it reach 2?\n\nAh, from 3, subtract b'=2 to get 1. From 1, add a'=3 to get 4 (invalid). Or from 1, subtract b'=2 to get -1 (invalid). So how to reach 2? It seems that the frog can't reach 2 in this case. But earlier analysis for the original problem (with a=3, b=2, x=4) allowed reaching 2. Wait, in the transformed problem, x was divided by d. Let me check.\n\nOriginal example: a=3, b=2, d=1. So y = x/d = x. For x=4, the transformed y is 4. The frog can reach 0, 1, 3, 4 (from 1+3), and 2 (from 4-2). So in the transformed problem, y=4, the reachable positions are 0,1,2,3,4. So for y=4, the count is 5, which is y+1. So the minimal y where this is possible is 4.\n\nBut how to find this minimal y.\n\nIn this case, it seems that the minimal y is (a' + b') - 1 = 3 + 2 -1 =4. Which matches the example. Another example: for a'=5, b'=3, the minimal y is 5+3-1=7. Which matches the first example where x=7 (transformed y=7) and f(x) was 8 (7+1).\n\nSo this suggests that the minimal y is (a' + b' - 1), and for y >= this value, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 to y. Hence, the count is y+1.\n\nBut why is this the case?\n\nLet me think: for y >= a' + b' - 1, the frog can reach any number from 0 to y. This is similar to the Frobenius number, but in reverse. Because the Frobenius number is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative combination of a' and b', but here, the frog can use both additions and subtractions. So the logic is different.\n\nBut assuming this is true, then for the transformed problem, the number of reachable positions for a given y is:\n\nif y < (a' + b' - 1): compute the number of reachable positions manually.\n\nelse: y + 1.\n\nBut how to compute the number of reachable positions for y < (a' + b' - 1).\n\nBut how to find this number. For small y, we can model it with BFS or dynamic programming. However, since a' and b' can be up to 1e5, and m can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nBut let's think of the following:\n\nFor the transformed problem, where a' and b' are coprime, and we want to find the number of reachable positions in [0, y], where y can be up to (a' + b' - 1) - 1 = a' + b' - 2. The maximum possible y for this part is around 2e5 (since a' and b' are up to 1e5).\n\nSo for this range, we can precompute all possible reachable positions using BFS, and for each possible y, store the count of reachable positions up to that y. Then, for larger y, the count is y+1.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me outline the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Compute a' = a / d, b' = b / d. Now, a' and b' are coprime.\n\n3. Compute the threshold Y = a' + b' - 1. For any y >= Y, the number of reachable positions is y + 1.\n\n4. For y < Y, compute the number of reachable positions using BFS or dynamic programming.\n\nOnce we have this, the original problem can be transformed into:\n\nFor each x, compute y = floor(x / d). Then, the number of reachable positions is:\n\nif y < Y: count[y]\n\nelse: y + 1\n\nThen, f(x) = this count.\n\nBut then, the sum from x=0 to m of f(x) is the sum over x of the count based on y = floor(x/d).\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nBut first, let's think about how to compute count[y] for y < Y. Let's proceed with the BFS approach.\n\nFor the transformed problem (a', b' coprime), the frog starts at 0, and can jump to k + a' or k - b', but must stay within [0, y]. However, since we're interested in all possible y up to Y = a' + b' - 1, we can precompute for all y up to Y the number of reachable positions.\n\nBut for each y, the reachable positions depend on the constraints of the path. However, since we're only interested in whether a position is reachable, regardless of the path, we can model this with BFS.\n\nWait, but for a given y, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by any sequence of jumps that never go outside [0, y]. So for a fixed y, we can perform BFS starting from 0, and mark all positions that are reachable.\n\nBut since Y is up to 2e5, and for each y up to Y, we can precompute the count, this might be feasible.\n\nBut doing this for every y up to Y would be O(Y^2), which is not feasible for Y up to 2e5.\n\nAlternative idea: For all possible y, the reachable positions are the same as the set of positions that can be reached by the frog in the infinite number line (without boundaries), and are <= y. But this is not correct because the frog may need to take a path that stays within [0, y].\n\nHowever, for y >= Y, we can assume that all positions up to y are reachable. For y < Y, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by the frog in the infinite number line, and are <= y. But how to find that.\n\nBut the frog can reach any position",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values from 0 to a given integer $ m $. The solution involves understanding the reachable positions based on the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the jump lengths and efficiently computing the sum using mathematical insights and dynamic programming.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump forward by $ a $ or backward by $ b $. The key insight is that the reachable positions are determined by the GCD of $ a $ and $ b $, denoted as $ d $. This means the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of $ d $.\n\n2. **Transforming the Problem**: By dividing $ a $ and $ b $ by $ d $, we reduce the problem to working with coprime integers $ a' $ and $ b' $. This simplifies the problem to finding reachable positions in terms of $ a' $ and $ b' $.\n\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: For sufficiently large values, the frog can reach all positions up to a certain threshold. This threshold is derived from the properties of coprime integers and is calculated as $ Y = a' + b' - 1 $.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming for Small Values**: For values below the threshold, we use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to precompute the number of reachable positions up to each value.\n\n5. **Efficient Summation**: Using the precomputed values for small thresholds and the formula for larger values, we efficiently compute the required sum over the range from 0 to $ m $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a_prime = a // d\n    b_prime = b // d\n    \n    if a_prime == 0 or b_prime == 0:\n        # This case shouldn't happen since a and b are positive\n        pass\n    \n    # Compute Y = a' + b' - 1\n    Y = a_prime + b_prime - 1\n    \n    # Precompute reachable counts for y in [0, Y]\n    # We'll use BFS for each y up to Y, but that's O(Y^2) which is too slow.\n    # Alternative: precompute all reachable positions for the infinite line, then for each y, count how many are <= y.\n    \n    # For the transformed problem (a', b' coprime), find all positions reachable by any sequence of jumps (without boundaries)\n    # Then, for a given y, the count is the number of those positions <= y.\n    \n    # However, the problem is that the path must not go out of [0, y], but for our purposes, if we can reach a position in the infinite line, it might be reachable in [0, y] for large enough y.\n    # But for small y, we need to know if the position is reachable without stepping out of bounds.\n    \n    # However, given time constraints, we'll use BFS for each y up to Y, but optimize it.\n    \n    # Instead, let's precompute for all positions up to Y + b_prime, then for each y, the count is the number of positions <= y that are reachable.\n    \n    # Let's perform BFS once for the infinite line, then check for each position whether it's reachable.\n    # However, the BFS needs to consider the possibility of reaching positions through any path, even if it goes beyond y.\n    # But for our purpose, we need to know which positions are reachable in general (i.e., there exists a path that doesn't go out of bounds when y is large enough).\n    \n    # So for the transformed problem, we can use BFS to find all positions that are reachable in the infinite line.\n    # Then, for y >= Y, all positions up to y are reachable.
