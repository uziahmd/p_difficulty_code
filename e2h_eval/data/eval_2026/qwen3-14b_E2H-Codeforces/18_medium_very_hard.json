The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the frog starts at 0, and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't step outside [0, x] for a given x. We need to compute f(x) for each x from 0 to m and sum them all. And given that m can be up to 1e9, we need an efficient way to compute this without iterating each x individually.\n\nFirst, let's understand what f(x) represents. For each x, f(x) is the number of distinct positions reachable by the frog, considering that all jumps must stay within [0, x]. The frog can reach some positions through various sequences of jumps. But how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the possible positions. Since the frog can only add a or subtract b, the positions must satisfy certain conditions. Let's consider the problem without the constraint of staying within [0, x]. Then, the positions reachable are those that can be written as (some combination of +a and -b steps). But since the frog starts at 0, the positions would be of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, with the constraints that during the journey, all positions are between 0 and x.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think about the problem in terms of linear combinations. The key here might be the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, any position reachable by the frog must be a multiple of d. Because each jump adds or subtracts multiples of a and b, which are multiples of d. So the reachable positions are all multiples of d.\n\nBut then again, the frog can't go beyond [0, x], so even if a position is a multiple of d, it's only counted if it's within [0, x].\n\nWait, but the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d, but under the constraint that during the jumps, they never go outside [0, x]. However, the problem says that the frog can reach a position if there exists a path that reaches it without stepping outside the interval. So perhaps the positions that are reachable are those that are multiples of d, and also can be expressed as some linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that the path doesn't go out of bounds. But how do we model that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frog can reach any multiple of d that is within [0, x], provided that it can be reached through some sequence of jumps. But how?\n\nLet me think about the case when the frog can move freely. Suppose that the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0. But that's not necessarily true because the frog starts at 0 and can only add a or subtract b. For example, if a=5 and b=3 (as in the first example), then d=1. So any integer is possible. But the frog can't reach negative numbers. Wait, but the frog can only jump to k+a or k-b. So for example, starting at 0, the frog can jump to 5 (0+5) or -3 (0-3). But since the frog can't step outside [0, x], the -3 is not allowed unless x is at least 3. So in the first example, when x is 5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and possibly other positions.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the minimal positions that can be reached, considering that the frog can't go below 0 or above x. However, for large x, maybe the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are within [0, x], but only after a certain point. Let's try to find some patterns.\n\nLet me take the first example: m=7, a=5, b=3. The output is 19. For x=5, f(5)=3. The positions are 0, 5, and maybe 2? Or wait, how?\n\nWait in the note, for x=5, f(5)=3. The positions are 0, 5, and 2 (since 5-3=2). Then for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. So three positions. Then for x=6, it can reach 0, 2, 5, 5+5=10 (but 10>6, so no). Or maybe 5-3=2 again. So maybe for x=6, the same positions as x=5, so f(6)=3. But for x=7, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7 (0+5+5=10 is too big, but maybe 5+3=8 (but 8 is larger than 7?), no. Wait, how does the frog reach 7?\n\nWait, perhaps the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 5+5=10 (but that's beyond x=7). But maybe 2+5=7? Oh! If the frog is at position 2, then adding a (5) would take it to 7. Which is within x=7. So yes, that's allowed. So for x=7, the positions would be 0, 2, 5, 7, and also 2+5=7. Also, from 5, subtracting b (3) gives 2, which is already counted. From 7, subtracting 3 gives 4. So is 4 reachable? Let's see. How to reach 4?\n\nWell, 0 +5 =5, then 5-3=2, then 2+5=7, then 7-3=4. So yes. So for x=7, the positions are 0,2,4,5,7, and maybe others?\n\nWait, let me think again. For x=7, the frog can reach:\n\n0 (start)\n\nFrom 0, can jump to 5 (0+5) or -3 (invalid).\n\nFrom 5, can jump to 10 (invalid) or 5-3=2.\n\nFrom 2, can jump to 2+5=7 or 2-3=-1 (invalid).\n\nFrom 7, can jump to 7+5=12 (invalid) or 7-3=4.\n\nFrom 4, can jump to 4+5=9 (invalid) or 4-3=1.\n\nSo now, 1 is reachable. From 1, can jump to 1+5=6 or 1-3=-2 (invalid). 6 is valid. Then from 6, jump to 6+5=11 (invalid) or 6-3=3. So 3 is reachable. Then from 3, jump to 3+5=8 (invalid) or 3-3=0 (already counted). \n\nSo for x=7, the positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions. Which matches the note's example where f(7)=8.\n\nSo the positions are all numbers from 0 to 7 that are congruent to 0 mod d (where d is gcd(5,3)=1). So all integers. But why can't the frog reach 1, 3, etc.?\n\nBecause the frog can reach them through sequences of jumps. So the problem seems to be that once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (which is 1 in this case) and are within [0, x], provided that they can be reached via some combination of a and b steps. But how do we determine which positions are reachable?\n\nThis seems similar to the classic coin problem, where you can make change for certain amounts. However, in this case, the frog can both add a and subtract b. So the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as (a * k) - (b * l), where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path taken to reach them never goes outside [0, x]. However, this seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this with BFS or dynamic programming. However, given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't do this for each x individually. So we need a mathematical formula or pattern.\n\nLet me think again. Let's suppose that the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are >= some value. For example, once the frog can reach a certain range, then for larger x, the number of reachable positions increases linearly. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog being able to reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and is within [0, x], but also satisfies some condition based on the steps.\n\nBut since d is the gcd of a and b, we can divide everything by d. Let me assume that a and b are coprime (since otherwise, we can divide them by their gcd). Let's say that d = gcd(a, b), and set a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since a' and b' are coprime.\n\nThe problem reduces to finding positions that are multiples of d. So, for the original problem, the positions reachable are all positions that are multiples of d and can be expressed as (a*k - b*l) for non-negative integers k, l. But since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, but the problem allows the frog to take any path that stays within [0, x].\n\nBut how to model the reachable positions?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and can be written as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that the path remains within [0, x]. But again, this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where nodes are positions, and edges represent jumps. Then, for a given x, the frog can reach all nodes that are reachable from 0 in this graph, but only considering nodes within [0, x].\n\nBut for large x, we need a way to compute f(x) efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the case where a and b are coprime. Let's say a=2, b=3. Then, the frog can reach positions like 0, 2, 5 (2+3), etc. But wait, how?\n\nWait, starting at 0:\n\nJump to 2 (0+2). Then from 2, can jump to 4 (2+2), or 2-3=-1 (invalid). From 4, can jump to 6 or 1. So 1 is reachable. From 1, can jump to 3 (1+2) or -2 (invalid). From 3, can jump to 5 (3+2) or 0 (3-3). From 5, can jump to 7 or 2 (5-3). Etc. So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5. So all numbers from 0 to 5 except maybe 0?\n\nWait, but how can the frog reach 1? It's 2-3= -1 (invalid), but the path from 0 to 2 to 4 to 1 (by subtracting 3). So yes. So for x >= 1, the frog can reach all positions >= 0, since once you can reach 1, then you can reach any higher number by adding a's. Wait, but a is 2 here. So maybe not. Wait, if you can reach 1, then adding 2 each time would get 3, 5, etc. But then how to reach 2?\n\nBut in this case, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, etc. So all integers >=0 except those that are congruent to something else? No, since a and b are coprime, any integer can be expressed as a combination. But the problem is that the frog can only add a or subtract b. So the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as (a * k) - (b * l), where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path remains within [0, x].\n\nBut this seems complex. However, if the frog can reach all positions >= some value, then for large x, the number of reachable positions is x + 1 (if d=1), but adjusted for the cases where x is small.\n\nBut how do we find this threshold?\n\nThis reminds me of the Frobenius problem, which for two coprime numbers a and b, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination with non-negative coefficients is ab - a - b. However, in our case, the frog can use both additions and subtractions. So perhaps the situation is different.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the frog can move forward by a or backward by b. So the problem is similar to being able to reach any position that is reachable via some sequence of these steps, but ensuring that the path never goes negative.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that once the frog can reach a position p, then it can reach p + a (by adding a) and p - b (by subtracting b), provided that those positions are within [0, x].\n\nBut for large x, the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d (since d is the gcd of a and b) and are greater than or equal to some value. For example, once the frog can reach a certain position, it can generate all higher positions by adding a's. However, since the frog can also subtract b's, maybe the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are >= some value.\n\nLet me think again with the example where a=5 and b=3. The gcd is 1. So all integers are possible. The frog can reach any integer once x is large enough. For example, once x is >= 5, then the frog can reach 5, then from 5, subtract 3 to get 2. Then from 2, add 5 to get 7. From 7, subtract 3 to get 4, then add 5 to get 9, etc. So for x >= 5, the frog can reach positions 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, etc., and then keep adding 5 and subtracting 3 as needed. But how does this allow the frog to reach every integer?\n\nWait, for example, 1. How can the frog reach 1? Let's see. Starting from 0, jump to 5. Then subtract 3 to get 2. Then subtract 3 again to get -1 (invalid). So that's not allowed. But earlier, in the first example, for x=7, the frog could reach 1. How? Because the path was 0 → 5 → 2 → 7 → 4 → 1. So, the path is allowed as long as all intermediate steps are within [0, x]. So in the case of x=7, the frog can reach 1.\n\nBut if x is less than 7, say x=5, then the frog can't reach 1. So the reachable positions depend on x. Therefore, the problem is that for small x, the frog can't reach all positions that are multiples of d, but once x is large enough, it can reach all of them.\n\nSo the plan is to find for each x, the number of positions that are multiples of d and are reachable via some path that stays within [0, x].\n\nBut how to compute this for all x up to m?\n\nLet me think about the general case. Let d = gcd(a, b). Let me divide a and b by d, so a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, a' and b' are coprime. The reachable positions are multiples of d. So, the problem reduces to considering positions divided by d. Let me define new variables: For any position k, it's reachable if k is a multiple of d, and (k/d) is reachable in the problem where a and b are replaced by a' and b', and the frog can jump +a' or -b'.\n\nSo, the problem becomes equivalent to solving the same problem with a' and b' coprime, and then multiplying the count by d. Wait, no. Because the original problem counts positions that are multiples of d. So, for the original problem, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of positions reachable in the transformed problem (with a' and b') multiplied by 1 (since each position in the transformed problem corresponds to a unique position in the original problem). So, the problem reduces to solving the case where a and b are coprime, and then multiplying the result by d? No, wait. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that in the transformed problem (with a' and b'), the frog can reach some positions. Each of these positions corresponds to a position of d * pos in the original problem. So, for example, if in the transformed problem, the frog can reach positions 0, 1, 2, then in the original problem, those correspond to 0, d, 2d, etc.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be simplified by considering the case where a and b are coprime. Let's proceed under that assumption. Then, for the general case, we can first compute the answer for a' and b', and then multiply the count by 1 (since each position in the transformed problem corresponds to exactly one in the original problem, but the count is the same). So the main problem is to solve for coprime a and b.\n\nNow, for a and b coprime, what is the structure of reachable positions?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the frog starts at 0, and can move forward by a or backward by b. The frog can reach a position k if there exists a sequence of steps that takes it from 0 to k, without ever going below 0 or above x (for a given x). But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the positions that the frog can reach. For example, if the frog can reach position k, then from there, it can jump to k+a or k - b, provided those positions are within [0, x]. But for large x, the frog can reach many positions.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that once the frog can reach a certain range, it can reach all positions beyond that. For example, once the frog can reach a position p, then for any position q >= p, if q ≡ p mod gcd(a, b) (which is 1 in this case), then q can be reached by adding a's. But since a and b are coprime, any integer can be expressed as a linear combination.\n\nBut again, the problem is that the frog can only add a or subtract b. So, for example, if the frog is at position k, then adding a gives k+a, and subtracting b gives k - b. However, the path to reach k must have been valid.\n\nBut perhaps for x ≥ some value, the frog can reach all positions that are ≥ some value. For example, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions ≥ (something). Then, for x ≥ that value, the number of reachable positions is x + 1 (since all positions from 0 to x are reachable). Wait, no. Because in the first example, with a=5 and b=3, for x=7, the frog can reach 8 positions. Which is more than x+1 (7+1=8, so yes). So that seems to fit. But for x=5, it's 3 positions. So when x is large enough, the number of reachable positions is x + 1. But how to find that threshold?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach all positions ≥ (a - b) or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The frog can reach any position that is ≥ (a - b) and is congruent to 0 mod d. But again, since a and b are coprime, d=1, so any integer.\n\nBut how to model the reachable positions for a given x?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of BFS. For each x, the maximum reachable positions is the number of positions that can be reached without going out of [0, x]. But since m is up to 1e9, we can't do BFS for each x. So we need to find a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me consider that for x >= some value, the number of reachable positions is x + 1. For example, in the second sample input, where a=1, b=2019. Since a and b are coprime (gcd(1,2019)=1). The frog can jump +1 or -2019. But since the frog starts at 0, it can jump to 1, then 2, etc. So for any x >=0, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Hence, f(x) = x+1, and the sum is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2. Which matches the sample input.\n\nSo in this case, once x is >=0, the frog can reach all positions. So for x >=0, the answer is x+1. So the threshold is zero here.\n\nIn the third sample input, a=100000 and b=1. The frog can't make any jumps because if it tries to jump -b (which is -1) from 0, that would be -1, which is invalid. And jumping +a would take it to 100000, but then from there, subtracting b (1) gives 99999, etc. However, the problem says that the frog can't make any jumps in any case. Wait, the third sample input is m=100, a=100000, b=1. The output is 101. Which suggests that for all x, f(x)=1. Because the frog can't make any jumps. Why?\n\nBecause the frog starts at 0. To jump to 0 + a = 100000. But if x is less than 100000, then this jump is invalid. For example, if x is 100, then the frog can't jump to 100000. Similarly, the other jump is 0 - b = -1, which is invalid. So the frog can't make any jumps. Therefore, the only reachable position is 0. Hence, for all x >=0, f(x) =1. So the sum is 101.\n\nSo in this case, the threshold is very high (like x >= 100000). But for x < 100000, the frog can't make any jumps. Hence, the number of reachable positions is 1.\n\nSo, the problem seems to depend on whether the frog can make any forward jumps (i.e., a <= x) or backward jumps (but since the frog is at 0, subtracting b would take it to -b which is invalid unless x >= b, but that's not possible here).\n\nSo, for the general case where a and b are coprime, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x if x is large enough. But how large is large enough?\n\nLet me think of the following. The frog can reach positions by adding a's and subtracting b's. However, the path must not go below 0 or above x. So for example, to reach position k, there must be some way to build it up by adding a's and subtracting b's, while never going out of [0, x].\n\nBut for large enough x, the frog can reach all positions. How to find that threshold?\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's think about the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Once x is larger than or equal to this threshold, the number of reachable positions is x+1. For smaller x, we have to compute the number of reachable positions.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the threshold T, such that for x >= T, f(x) = x+1. For x < T, f(x) is computed differently.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nAlternatively, think of T as the minimal value such that the frog can reach all positions from 0 to T. Then, for x >= T, f(x) = x + 1.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nLet me think of the problem where the frog can reach all positions >= some value. For example, in the classic coin problem, the largest unrepresentable number is ab - a - b. But that's for non-negative combinations. However, in this case, the frog can use both adding and subtracting steps.\n\nBut perhaps the threshold T is (a + b) - 1, or something similar. For example, in the first sample input, a=5, b=3. Then, T would be 5 + 3 -1 = 7. Which matches the first example where for x=7, f(7)=8 (x+1). So for x >= T, f(x) =x+1.\n\nBut let's check another example. Take a=2, b=3. Then, the threshold T is 2+3-1=4. For x=4, can the frog reach all positions from 0 to 4?\n\nLet's see:\n\nAt x=4, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4 (from 0+2, then 2+2=4). Also, from 2, subtract 3 gives -1 (invalid). So how to reach 1?\n\nAh, but to reach 1, the frog needs to go from 0 to 2 (allowed), then from 2 to 5 (invalid for x=4), so can't. Alternatively, can it reach 1 via another path?\n\nWait, if x is 4, then the frog can't jump to 5. So maybe the threshold is higher than 4. Hmm, this contradicts the previous idea. So perhaps my hypothesis about T being a + b -1 is incorrect.\n\nWait, but in the first example, T was 7 (a=5, b=3). And indeed, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. But how?\n\nIn that case, for example, position 1 is reachable via 0 → 5 → 2 → 7 → 4 → 1. But for x=7, this is allowed. However, if x were 4, the path from 2 to 7 would not be allowed. So for x=4, the frog can't reach 1, 3, etc.\n\nSo the threshold T is not a + b -1. What's the correct way to find T?\n\nAnother approach: For the frog to be able to reach all positions >= some value, it must be able to reach positions that allow moving up and down. For example, once the frog can reach a position p, then adding a's allows reaching higher positions, and subtracting b's allows reaching lower positions. However, the problem is that the frog can only subtract b if it's at a position >=b.\n\nSo, perhaps the threshold T is the minimal x such that the frog can reach x - b. Then, from there, it can subtract b to reach x - 2b, etc. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach all positions that are >= (b - a) and can be expressed as a linear combination. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of the ability to reach all positions beyond a certain point. For example, once the frog can reach a position p, and p >= b, then from p, it can subtract b to reach p -b. If p -b is >=0, then this allows the frog to reach p -b. If the frog can also reach p +a, then it can generate a sequence of positions.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps the key is to find the minimal x such that the frog can reach x - b. Once that is possible, then the frog can reach all positions from x - b onwards by subtracting b repeatedly. But how to find this x?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph and find the minimal x where the graph is connected. However, this seems impractical.\n\nLet me think of the case where a=2 and b=3. The frog can reach 0, 2, 4, 1 (from 2-3= -1 invalid, but if x >= 2+3=5, then the frog can reach 2+2=4, then 4+2=6 (if x >=6), then from 6 subtract 3 to reach 3. From 3, subtract 3 to reach 0, add 2 to reach 5, etc. So for x >= 5, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nLet's see: For x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4, 5 (from 0+2+2+1? No. Wait, how to reach 5? Starting from 0, jump to 2, then to 4, then to 4+2=6 (invalid for x=5). So can't reach 5. So how to reach 5?\n\nAlternatively, from 0, jump to 2, then to 5 (2+3? No, because the frog can only jump +a or -b. So from 2, the frog can jump to 2+2=4 or 2-3=-1 (invalid). So can't reach 5. So for x=5, the frog can't reach 5. So what's the problem here?\n\nAh, but the frog can't jump to 5 directly. So how can the frog reach 5? Maybe from a higher position. For example, from 5 + 3 = 8 (but that requires jumping to 5 first). So it seems impossible. So for x=5, the frog can't reach 5. So what's the threshold here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is when x is large enough to allow the frog to reach positions that can generate all others via adding a and subtracting b. For example, if the frog can reach a position p such that p >= b, then from p, it can subtract b to reach p -b, and so on. Also, if the frog can reach p, then from p, it can add a to reach p+a, and so on.\n\nSo the key is to find the minimal x such that the frog can reach a position p >= b, and then from there, the frog can generate all positions beyond p - b by subtracting b. However, this depends on the values of a and b.\n\nBut how to find this x?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nOnce the frog can reach a position p >= b, then it can subtract b to reach p -b. If p -b >=0, then this position is valid. Then, from p -b, it can add a to reach p -b +a. This way, the frog can generate positions in steps of a and subtract b. Since a and b are coprime, this should eventually allow reaching all positions beyond a certain point.\n\nSo, the minimal x where the frog can reach a position p >= b is important. Once that's achieved, then for x >= p, the frog can reach all positions from p - kb down to some value, and by adding a, reach higher positions.\n\nBut how to find this p?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog needing to reach a position that is at least b. For example, the frog can reach a by jumping once. So, if a >=b, then the frog can reach a, which is >=b. Then, from there, subtract b to reach a -b. If a -b >=0, then that's allowed. Then, from a -b, adding a gives a -b +a = 2a -b, etc.\n\nBut if a < b, then the frog can't reach a position >=b until it has added a several times. For example, if a=2 and b=3, then the frog can reach 2, 4, 6, etc. When x is >=6, then the frog can reach 6, subtract 3 to get 3, subtract 3 again to get 0, add 2 to get 2, etc. So for x >=6, the frog can reach 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, etc. But how to reach 1?\n\nHmm, this seems challenging. Perhaps for certain a and b, the frog can't reach all positions even for very large x. But this contradicts the earlier example where a=5 and b=3, which for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7.\n\nWait, but in the case of a=2 and b=3, what's the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions?\n\nLet me think: For x=5, the frog can't reach 1, 3, 5. For x=6, it can reach 6 (from 0+2+2+2). From 6, subtract 3 to reach 3. From 3, subtract 3 to reach 0. From 0, add 2 to reach 2, then add 2 to reach 4. From 4, add 2 to reach 6 again. So the reachable positions are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6. Still missing 1, 5.\n\nTo reach 5: from 3 (reachable), add 2 to get 5. Yes! So for x=6, the frog can reach 5. Because from 3, adding 2 gives 5, which is <=6. So for x=6, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. But what about 1?\n\nHow to reach 1? From 5 (reachable), subtract 3 to get 2 (already there). Or from 2, subtract 3 to get -1 (invalid). Or from 6, subtract 3 to get 3, then subtract 3 to get 0. No. So how to reach 1?\n\nIt seems impossible. So even for x=6, the frog can't reach 1. So what's the issue here?\n\nAh, because the frog can't reach 1. So even with large x, the frog may not be able to reach all positions. This suggests that my earlier assumption is incorrect.\n\nSo what is the correct way to model this?\n\nMaybe the problem is that the frog can only reach positions that are congruent to 0 mod gcd(a, b), but since a and b are coprime, all positions are allowed. But in this example, the frog can't reach 1, which is congruent to 1 mod 1 (which is 0 mod 1?), no. Wait, d=1, so all positions are allowed. So why can't the frog reach 1?\n\nBecause the frog can't reach it through any sequence of jumps that don't go out of [0, x]. So even though 1 is a multiple of d (which it is), it's not reachable due to the constraints of the jumps.\n\nThis indicates that the problem is more complex than just checking for multiples of d. There must be another condition.\n\nLet me think again. For the case a=2 and b=3, what positions can the frog reach?\n\nStarting from 0:\n\n0 → 2 → 4 → 6 → ... (adding 2 each time). Or from 2 → -1 (invalid). From 4 → 1 (4-3=1) if x >=1. So if x is >=1, then from 4, the frog can jump to 1. So for x >=4, the frog can reach 1.\n\nWait, for example, for x=4, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1, which is within x=4. So for x=4, the frog can reach 1. Then from 1, add 2 to get 3 (within x=4). From 3, add 2 to get 5 (invalid). From 3, subtract 3 to get 0. So the positions are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So for x=4, f(x) is 5. Which is x+1=5. So yes!\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that for x=4, the frog couldn't reach 1. But I was wrong. Because from 4, subtract 3 gives 1, which is allowed. So for x=4, the frog can reach 1. Then from 1, add 2 to get 3. From 3, add 2 to get 5 (invalid), but subtract 3 to get 0. So the reachable positions are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Which is 5 positions, x+1=5. So for x=4, it works.\n\nSo what about x=3? Can the frog reach 1?\n\nFor x=3: the frog can jump to 2, then from 2, can't jump to 4 (invalid), so can't reach 4. But from 2, can subtract 3 to get -1 (invalid). So the frog can't reach 1 for x=3. So for x=3, f(x)=3 (positions 0, 2, 3? Or 0, 2, 3, and 0+2=2",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line, given constraints on its jumps and the interval it must stay within. The solution involves analyzing the reachable positions based on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the jump lengths and using mathematical insights to efficiently compute the required sum over a large range.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either `a` steps forward or `b` steps backward. The positions it can reach are determined by the gcd of `a` and `b`, as all reachable positions must be multiples of this gcd.\n2. **Reduction to Coprime Case**: By dividing both `a` and `b` by their gcd, we reduce the problem to the case where `a` and `b` are coprime, simplifying further analysis.\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: For sufficiently large values of `x`, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to `x`. This threshold is determined by the maximum of `a` and `b`.\n4. **Efficient Summation**: Using the threshold, we compute the sum of reachable positions for values below the threshold using BFS and for values above the threshold using arithmetic progression formulas.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a_prime = a // d\n    b_prime = b // d\n\n    # Now, a_prime and b_prime are coprime\n\n    # If both a and b are zero?

The frog can reach positions that are multiples of d, and for each such position k*d, it can be reached if there exists a path from 0 to k*d without stepping outside [0, x].\n\n        # But since d is the gcd, we can divide everything by d. Let's define new variables:\n\n        # Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, a' and b' are coprime.\n\n        # The problem reduces to finding, for each x, the number of positions k such that k is in [0, x/d], and k is reachable in the problem with a'=a/d, b'=b/d.\n\n        # So, the original problem is equivalent to solving the problem with a' and b' coprime, and then scaling the result by d.\n\n        # Therefore, the number of reachable positions in the original problem for a given x is equal to the number of reachable positions in the transformed problem for x//d.\n\n        # This is a crucial insight!\n\n        # So, the original problem reduces to solving for the transformed problem with a' and b' coprime, and then for each x, the number of reachable positions in the original problem is equal to the number of reachable positions in the transformed problem for x//d.\n\n        # Thus, the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x) in the original problem is equal to the sum over x from 0 to m of g(x//d), where g(y) is the number of reachable positions in the transformed problem for y.\n\n        # Now, the transformed problem has a' and b' coprime. So, we need to compute g(y) for y from 0 to floor(m/d).\n\n        # Let's focus on solving this transformed problem for coprime a' and b'.\n\n        # For the transformed problem, we can compute the threshold T_transformed = a' + b' - 1. For y >= T_transformed, g(y) = y + 1.\n\n        # For y < T_transformed, we need to compute g(y) using BFS.\n\n        # Since a' and b' are up to 1e5, T_transformed is up to 2e5, which is manageable for BFS.\n\n        # So the steps are:\n\n        # 1. Compute d = gcd(a, b)\n        # 2. Compute a' = a/d, b' = b/d\n        # 3. Compute T_transformed = a' + b' -1\n        # 4. Compute max_y = m // d\n        # 5.
