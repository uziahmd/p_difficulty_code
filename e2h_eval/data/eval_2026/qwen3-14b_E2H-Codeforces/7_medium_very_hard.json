The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nThe problem says that the snowflake is constructed as follows:\n\n- Start with one vertex.\n- Then, connect it to k new vertices (k > 1).\n- Then, each vertex that has only one connection (i.e., leaves) gets connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once.\n\nSo the process is like building layers. The initial step creates a root node with k children. Then, each leaf (which are those k children) gets k new children. And this process can be repeated multiple times.\n\nLet me think about the number of nodes after each step. Let's model this.\n\nLet's say we have m levels of expansion. Let's think recursively.\n\nInitially, level 0: 1 node.\n\nAfter first expansion (level 1): 1 + k nodes. Because the root adds k children.\n\nBut then, each of those k nodes is a leaf. So the next expansion (level 2) would add k * k nodes. So total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n\nIf we do another expansion (level 3), each of the k^2 nodes (from level 2) is a leaf, so adding k^3 nodes. Total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k children to root) is the first expansion. Then, the second expansion (adding k children to each leaf of the first expansion) is required. So the minimal snowflake would have 1 + k + k^2 nodes. But for example, when k=4, the minimal is 1+4+16=21? Wait, but the example input says that for n=6, the answer is NO, and for n=13 it's YES. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample input includes n=6, output is NO. Let's think. For example, if k=2, then possible numbers are:\n\nLevel 0: 1\n\nLevel 1: 1+2 = 3\n\nLevel 2: 3 + 2^2 = 3 +4=7.\n\nBut if we stop here, then the total is 7. But the problem says that the second expansion (the step of adding to leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal is when you have two expansions. So for k=2, the minimal is 1 + 2 + 4 =7. So for n=6, which is less than 7, it's not possible. Hence sample input for n=6 is NO.\n\nAnother example is n=13. Let's see. Let's think for k=3. Let's see:\n\nIf we have 1 + 3 + 3^2 = 1+3+9=13. That's exactly n=13. So yes. So that's why sample input for 13 is YES.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since the step must be done at least once). Wait, no. Wait, the initial step is adding k children (so level 1), then the second step is adding k children to each of those leaves (level 2). So the minimal is m=2 steps (levels 0, 1, 2). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But maybe there are more steps. For example, if we do three steps, then the total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on.\n\nSo the general formula is that n can be written as sum_{i=0}^m (k^i) where m ≥ 2? No, wait. Because the initial step is adding k nodes (so the sum starts with 1 + k). Then, each expansion adds k^2, then k^3, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1? Let me think again.\n\nThe first expansion (after the initial node) is adding k nodes. Then, the second expansion is adding k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k^2. But that requires that the second expansion is done. So the number of terms in the sum is m+1, where m is the number of expansions. The first expansion (adding k) is the first expansion, then the second expansion (adding k^2) is the second. So the minimal is when there are two expansions (so sum up to k^2). Therefore, the formula is n = sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2? No, because sum from i=0 to m is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. For m=2, it's 1 +k +k^2. Which is the case when there are two expansions. So the problem says that the step (adding k children to leaves) must be done at least once. Which implies that the minimal is m=2, but the maximum is any m ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but the first expansion (adding k children) is the first step, and the second expansion (adding k^2 children) is the second step. So the total number of steps is m steps, where m ≥ 2. So the total nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i? No, wait. Let me think again. The initial node is 1. Then, the first expansion adds k nodes. Then, the second expansion adds k^2 nodes. Then third adds k^3, etc. So the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of expansions. Since the second expansion must be done at least once, m ≥ 1? Or m ≥ 2?\n\nWait, the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to leaves is done at least once. The initial step is adding k new nodes. Then, the step of adding to leaves (the first time) is done once. So the minimal is when m is 1 (the first expansion, which adds k nodes, and then the step of adding to leaves is done once, which is adding k^2 nodes). Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me rephrase the construction rules:\n\nThe snowflake is built as follows:\n\nStart with one vertex (call this level 0).\n\nThen, the initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. (level 1). So now, there are 1 + k nodes.\n\nThen, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., the leaves) is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo, after the initial step (level 1), we have to perform the expansion step once. So that step is adding k new nodes per existing leaf. Since the leaves are the k nodes from level 1, each of them adds k nodes. So that's k * k = k^2 nodes added. Now total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nSo the minimal snowflake has 1 + k + k^2 nodes. And then, if we do more expansions, each time adding k^m nodes, where m increases. So the total number of nodes can be written as sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2. Because for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. For m=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc.\n\nBut wait, the sum from i=0 to m of k^i is equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for example, for m=2, it's (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be expressed as (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and m≥2. Because for m≥2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. Wait, but m here is the number of terms minus one. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the sum is S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, then S is equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, that's 1 +k +k^2. So in the problem, m must be at least 2? Or m is the number of expansions?\n\nWait, the initial expansion (adding k nodes) is the first expansion. Then the second expansion (adding k^2 nodes) is the second. So the total number of expansions is m, and the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. But the problem says that the step (adding to leaves) must be done at least once. So the second expansion is required. Which means that m must be ≥ 2? Or m ≥1?\n\nWait, the initial expansion is the first step (adding k nodes). Then, the second step is the first time we add to leaves. So the total number of expansions is m steps. For example, m=1: sum is 1 +k. But that would not satisfy the requirement that the step (adding to leaves) is done at least once. Because the step is adding to leaves. The first expansion (adding k nodes) is the initial step. Then, the second expansion is adding to leaves. So for the minimal case, m must be at least 2. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2, which is when m=2 steps (the initial expansion and the first step of adding to leaves). Therefore, the problem requires that the sum S is 1 +k + ... +k^m where m ≥ 2. Wait, but m here is the number of steps. Let me think again.\n\nLet me rephrase the construction steps:\n\nThe initial step is creating the root (level 0). Then, the first expansion (step 1) adds k children. Now, there are 1 +k nodes. Then, the second expansion (step 2) adds k^2 nodes. Now, total is 1 +k +k^2. This is required. So the minimal case is when there are two steps (steps 1 and 2). So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. If there are more steps, like step 3, adding k^3 nodes. Then the sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the sum S can be written as sum_{i=0}^m k^i where m ≥ 2. Because when m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So for the problem, the question is: given n, does there exist integers k>1 and m ≥ 2 such that n equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m=2, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. So the problem requires that the sum is of the form (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some m ≥ 2 and k ≥2. Wait, but m is the maximum exponent. For example, if the sum is 1 +k +k^2, then m is 2, and the formula is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So m+1 = 3, which is the exponent.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to checking whether n can be written as (k^{d} -1)/(k-1) for some d ≥ 3 and k ≥2. Because d = m+1, and m ≥ 2 implies d ≥3.\n\nSo for example, for d=3, the formula is (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. Which is the minimal case.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be expressed as (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some integers d ≥3 and k ≥2.\n\nBut how do we check this for a given n?\n\nConstraints are n up to 1e18, and t up to 1e4.\n\nSo the approach is: for each test case n, check whether there exists d ≥3 and k ≥2 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that (k^d -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nSo for each n, we need to find if there exists some d ≥3 and k ≥2 such that this sum equals n.\n\nSo for each possible d (starting from 3 upwards), check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut since n is up to 1e18, we need to find an efficient way.\n\nLet's think about possible values of d. For each d, we can try to find if there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible d for a given n?\n\nFor example, for d=3, the minimum value is (2^3 -1)/(2-1) = 7. For d=3, the maximum possible k for which 1 +k +k^2 ≤n is sqrt(n). Similarly for higher d's.\n\nBut for each d, the possible k's are limited. For example, for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 = n. Solving for k gives us a quadratic equation. For larger d, the sum grows rapidly with k, so for a given d, the possible k's are limited.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFor each n, iterate over possible d (starting from 3 up to log_2(n)), and for each d, check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to find the possible d's?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible d. For d=3, the minimal sum is 7. For d=60, even with k=2, the sum is 2^60 -1/(2-1) = 2^60-1 which is around 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, d can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each n, we can iterate d from 3 up to 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18). For each d, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and d?\n\nThe sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1} = (k^d -1)/(k-1). So for given k and d, we can compute this value.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and d up to 60, we can compute this for each possible k and d.\n\nBut for each d, how do we find k?\n\nFor a fixed d, the function f(k) = sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i is strictly increasing with k. So for each d, we can perform a binary search on k (from 2 up to some upper bound) to see if there's a k such that f(k) = n.\n\nSo the steps for each n would be:\n\nCheck for all d from 3 to max_d (like 60):\n\n   low = 2, high = something (like n^(1/(d-1)) + 1)\n\n   perform binary search on k in [low, high], compute f(k) and see if it equals n.\n\nIf for any d and k, this holds, return YES. Else, NO.\n\nBut how to compute f(k) without overflow?\n\nSince n can be up to 1e18, and d up to 60, for k up to say 1e6, even for d=60, k^d would be way larger than 1e18. So during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow.\n\nAlternatively, for each k and d, compute the sum step by step, and stop if it exceeds n.\n\nSo for example, for a given k and d, compute the sum as:\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to d-1:\n\n   sum += k^i\n\nBut calculating k^i directly may be computationally expensive. However, since for each step, we can compute the sum incrementally. For example, sum starts at 0, then add 1 (k^0), then add k (k^1), then add k^2, etc. But for large exponents, this might take O(d) time per check, but since d is up to 60, and per test case, this is manageable.\n\nBut even better: since the sum is (k^d -1)/(k-1), but for k=1, it's d. However, since k ≥2, we can compute this formula. However, for large k and d, this could overflow. So perhaps, during the calculation, we can compute the sum incrementally, and if at any point the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo for each candidate k and d, we can compute the sum incrementally. Let's think of the following function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current_term = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current_term\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return -1  # or some value indicating overflow\n\n        current_term *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut for d up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nSo for each d, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound. What's the upper bound?\n\nFor a given d, the minimal sum for k=2 is (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1. So if n < 2^d -1, then there's no possible k for this d. So the upper bound for k can be found by considering that for the sum to be equal to n, k must be such that 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} =n. Since each term is positive and increasing, the maximum possible k is when the sum is dominated by the last term. For example, for d terms, the sum is at least k^{d-1} (since all terms except the first are added). So k^{d-1} ≤ sum =n → k ≤ n^(1/(d-1)).\n\nThus, for each d, the upper bound for k is n^(1/(d-1)) + 1.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and d up to 60, the upper bound for k is manageable. For example, for d=3, n=1e18, upper bound is (1e18)^(1/2) = 1e9. But binary searching from 2 to 1e9 would take about 30 steps per d. Considering that d can be up to 60, and t is 1e4, this would be 1e4 * 60 * 30 = 1.8e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n is 1: output NO (since k must be >1, and the minimal sum is 7 for d=3, k=2)\n\n   else:\n\n      for d in 3 to max_d (like 60):\n\n         low = 2\n\n         high = upper_bound (like n^(1/(d-1)) + 1)\n\n         perform binary search on k in [low, high] to find if there exists a k such that compute_sum(k, d) ==n.\n\n         if found, return YES.\n\n      also, check for d=2? Wait, no. Because d must be ≥3. Because for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which corresponds to m=2 steps (the required expansion steps). So for d=3, it's allowed.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis said that the sum is (k^d -1)/(k-1) for d ≥3. So for each d ≥3, check.\n\nBut what about cases where the sum is for d=2? Like, for example, if n=3 (which is 1 +2). But according to the problem statement, the step must be done at least once. So for d=2, the sum would be (k^2-1)/(k-1) =k+1. Which is 1 +k. Which would be the case where the expansion was done once (adding k children). But according to the problem, the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. So the initial expansion (adding k children) is the first step, but then the second step (adding to leaves) is required. So the minimal is sum for d=3 (1 +k +k^2). Thus, for d=2, the sum is not allowed. So we must not consider d=2.\n\nThus, the code must check for d ≥3.\n\nSo, for each n, we check for d from 3 up to max_d (say 60). For each d, perform a binary search for k in [2, ... ].\n\nNow, what about the case where d is larger than log_2(n) +1? For example, for d=60, the minimal sum is 2^60 -1. Which is about 1e18. So for n=1e18, d can be up to 60.\n\nSo for the code, the max_d can be up to 60.\n\nBut how to find the max_d for a given n?\n\nWell, for d, the minimal possible sum is 2^d -1. So for n, the maximum possible d is such that 2^d -1 <=n. So d_max can be up to log2(n+1). For example, for n=1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So setting d_max to 60 is sufficient.\n\nSo the code can loop d from 3 to 60.\n\nNow, for each d in 3..60:\n\n   compute the upper bound for k as floor(n^(1/(d-1))) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute n^(1/(d-1))? For example, for d=3, it's sqrt(n). We can compute this using binary search or math.pow, but since n can be up to 1e18, and d up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for integer roots, we can use binary search.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the math.isqrt function for square roots, but for higher roots, we need a way to compute the integer part of the root. However, since for binary search purposes, even if the upper bound is a bit larger than necessary, it's okay.\n\nSo for each d, the binary search for k would be between 2 and upper_bound, where upper_bound is something like n^(1/(d-1)) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute upper_bound?\n\nWell, for the sum to be equal to n, the sum is at least k^{d-1} (since sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} >=k^{d-1}).\n\nSo k^{d-1} <=n → k <=n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nThus, the upper bound can be set to n^{1/(d-1)} + 1. But how to compute this in Python?\n\nWe can use binary search to find the integer part of n^(1/(d-1)).\n\nAlternatively, for the binary search, we can start with low=2, high=2, and keep doubling until high^ (d-1) exceeds n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut for the purpose of binary search, perhaps it's easier to set high to something like n, but that could be too big. However, since for each d, the binary search is O(log n) steps, and with d up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each d, we can compute the upper bound as follows:\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, d) <n:\n\n   high *=2\n\nOnce we have high such that compute_sum(high, d) >=n, then perform binary search between low=2 and high.\n\nBut compute_sum(high, d) could be expensive. However, since for each d, the compute_sum is O(d) steps, and for high being up to n^(1/(d-1)), which for d=3 is sqrt(n), but for d=60, it's 2 (since 2^60 is about 1e18). So this approach is feasible.\n\nBut perhaps, for each d, the upper bound can be calculated as follows:\n\nWe can compute the maximum possible k for which k^{d-1} ≤n. Since k^{d-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nBut how to compute that in Python? Well, for example, using the math.pow function, but with care for integer precision.\n\nAlternatively, for the binary search for k, we can start with low=2 and high=2, and multiply by 2 until compute_sum(high, d) exceeds n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut compute_sum(high, d) is O(d) steps. For each d, this is acceptable.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor a given n, check for each d from 3 to 60:\n\n   find the possible k such that sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i =n.\n\nTo find k, perform a binary search between 2 and some upper limit.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement a helper function to compute the sum for given k and d, and check if it equals n. Also, during the computation, check for overflow (if the sum exceeds n, return early).\n\nSo for the helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return -1\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total if total ==n else -1\n\nWait, but the loop runs for d steps. For example, for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So the loop runs 3 times. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in Python, for very large k and d, this could take time. However, since d is up to 60, and per test case, this is manageable.\n\nSo for each d, we can perform a binary search on k. For example:\n\nfor d in range(3, max_d+1):\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    # find upper bound for high\n\n    while compute_sum(high, d, n) < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # Now binary search between low and high\n\n    left = 2\n\n    right = high\n\n    while left <= right:\n\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n        if s == n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif s <n:\n\n            left = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            right = mid -1\n\nBut wait, compute_sum returns -1 if the sum exceeds n. So in the binary search, if compute_sum returns -1, that means the sum is larger than n, so we need to adjust the search accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps, the helper function can return the actual sum if it is <=n, else return something larger than n. Let me think:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n + 1  # some value larger than n\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nThis way, during the binary search, if the computed sum is larger than n, it returns a value greater than n. So for example, during the binary search, if compute_sum returns a value greater than n, we know that k is too big.\n\nSo in the binary search:\n\nif compute_sum(mid, d, n) ==n → yes.\n\nelif compute_sum(...) <n → need to increase k.\n\nelse → decrease k.\n\nThis way, the binary search proceeds correctly.\n\nSo with that helper function, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nFor example, n=7 (d=3, k=2: 1+2+4=7). So returns YES.\n\nn=1: returns NO.\n\nn=3: for d=3, the minimal sum is 7. So no.\n\nn=13: 1+3+9=13 → yes.\n\nAnother case: n=15. For example, 1+2+4+8=15 (d=4, k=2). So yes. Which matches the sample input (for n=15, output is YES).\n\nNow, what about n=255? Let's see. 255 is 2^8 -1. So for d=8, k=2: sum is (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So yes. Hence sample input for 255 is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's see why.\n\nWe need to check for all d from 3 to 60. For example, let's see for d=3:\n\nsum is 1 +k +k^2 =n → k^2 +k +1 = 1e18. Solving for k: approximate sqrt(1e18) is 1e9. Let's check k= 999999999. Then k^2 is about 1e18. So 1e18 + 1e9 +1 ≈ 1e18. But the exact value would be 1e18. So perhaps there's no integer k for d=3. Similarly for other d's. So the code would check all possibilities and return NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the case where d is up to 60. Let's see what is the maximum possible d. For example, for k=2, the sum for d=60 is (2^60 -1)/(2-1) = 2^60 -1 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,975 which is about 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, this is larger than n. So for d=60, the minimal sum is 2^60-1 which is larger than 1e18. So for d=60, the possible k is 1, but k must be ≥2. So no solution.\n\nBut for d=59, the minimal sum is 2^59 -1. Which is about 5.7e17. Which is less than 1e18. So for d=59, perhaps there is a k=2. Let's compute the sum for d=59 and k=2: sum is 2^59 -1 / (2-1) = 2^59 -1. Which is 5.7e17, less than 1e18. So for d=59, trying k=2 gives sum 5.7e17. Then trying higher k. For example, k=3, sum is (3^59 -1)/2. Which is way larger than 1e18. So for d=59, there's no k that gives sum 1e18.\n\nThus, the code would check all possible d's and find no solution, hence output NO.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplement the helper function compute_sum, and for each test case, iterate d from 3 to 60, perform binary search for k.\n\nBut what about d=3, and for example, n=7. For k=2, compute_sum(2, 3, 7) returns 7 → yes.\n\nAnother case: n=6. For d=3, the minimal sum is 7. So no. For other d's, like d=4: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. For k=2, sum is 1+2+4+8=15>6. So no solution.\n\nSo code returns NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1 → NO\n\n2 → NO\n\n3 → NO\n\n6 → NO\n\n13 → YES (d=3, k=3)\n\n15 → YES (d=4, k=2)\n\n255 → YES (d=8, k=2)\n\n10101 → YES ?\n\nLet me think about 10101. For example, let's see if there is a d and k.\n\nLet's try d=3: solving 1 +k +k² = 10101 → k² +k +1 = 10101 → k² +k -10100 =0. Discriminant is 1 +4*10100 = 40401 → sqrt(40401) is 201. So k = (-1 +201)/2 = 200/2=100. So k=100. So yes. Thus, 10101 is YES.\n\nSo the code would find that.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000 (1e18). The code checks all possible d's and finds none.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nIn Python, for each test case, read n. Then, check if n can be expressed as (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some d ≥3 and k ≥2.\n\nBut for n=1, the answer is NO. For n=2, same.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n in test cases:\n\n   if n ==1 → output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      flag = False\n\n      for d in 3 to 60:\n\n          perform binary search for k in [2, ... ] to see if sum equals n.\n\n          if found, set flag=True and break.\n\n      if flag → YES else NO.\n\nBut how to handle the binary search for each d.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nBut for d in 3 to 60:\n\n   Now, for each d, we need to find if there's a k ≥2 such that compute_sum(k, d, n) ==n.\n\nImplementing the binary search for each d:\n\nBut for the binary search, first find the upper bound for k.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the upper bound for k as follows:\n\nWe can start with low=2, high=2. While compute_sum(high, d, n) <n, multiply high by 2. Once compute_sum(high, d, n) >=n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut compute_sum(high, d, n) can be computed as the helper function.\n\nBut in Python, for very large high and d, the helper function may take O(d) time. However, since d is up to 60, and for each test case, this is acceptable.\n\nOnce the upper bound is found, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n\n    if n ==1:\n\n        return False\n\n    max_d = 60\n\n    for d in range(3, max_d+1):\n\n        # Find k for this d\n\n        # Find upper bound for k\n\n        low_k = 2\n\n        high_k = 2\n\n        # Find high_k such that compute_sum(high_k, d, n) >=n\n\n        while True:\n\n            s = compute_sum(high_k, d, n)\n\n            if s >=n:\n\n                break\n\n            high_k *=2\n\n        # Now binary search between low_k and high_k\n\n        left = low_k\n\n        right = high_k\n\n        while left <= right:\n\n            mid = (left + right) //2\n\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n            if s ==n:\n\n                return True\n\n            elif s <n:\n\n                left = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                right = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut what if during the while True loop, the high_k is multiplied by 2 and compute_sum(high_k, d, n) is still less than n? For example, when n is very large and d is small. However, since for d=3, the maximum possible k is n^(1/2), and for d=3, the compute_sum for k= n^(1/2) would be O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nBut in practice,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and our task is to check if such a configuration exists for each given `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers of vertices. Each layer adds `k` new vertices to every leaf node from the previous layer. The total number of vertices after `d` layers (with `d ≥ 3`) can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(d-1)`.\n\n2. **Geometric Series Formula**: The sum of the first `d` terms of a geometric series with ratio `k` is given by `(k^d - 1) / (k - 1)`. We need to check if this sum equals the given `n` for some integer `k > 1` and `d ≥ 3`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Check**: For each possible value of `d` (from 3 up to 60, as higher values will exceed the maximum `n` of 1e18), perform a binary search on `k` to see if there exists a valid `k` that makes the geometric series sum equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(d):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return n + 1\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_d = 60\n    for d in range(3, max_d + 1):\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        low_k = 2\n        high_k = 2\n        while True:\n            s = compute_sum(high_k, d, n)\n            if s >= n:\n                break\n            high_k *= 2\n        # Binary search between low_k and high_k\n        left = low_k\n        right = high_k\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum Function**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series for given `k` and `d`, checking if it exceeds `n` to avoid overflow.\n- **is_possible Function**: This function checks for each possible depth `d` (from 3 to 60) if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`. It uses binary search to efficiently find `k`.\n- **main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case, and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on whether a valid snowflake configuration exists for the given number of vertices.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations using geometric series properties and binary search, making it feasible even for very large values of `n` up to 1e18.",
