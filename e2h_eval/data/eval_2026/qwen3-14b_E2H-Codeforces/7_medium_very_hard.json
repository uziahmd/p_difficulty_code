The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such graphs.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement to make sure I get the construction rules right.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the previous step) must be connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So the process is like building layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step.\n\nLet's consider the example given for k=4. The smallest snowflake would have:\n\n- Initial vertex: 1\n- First step: add 4 vertices connected to it. Now total is 1 + 4 = 5.\n- Then, each of those 4 vertices (each with degree 1) must be connected to 4 new vertices. So each adds 4, so 4*4=16. Total becomes 5 + 16 = 21. But wait, the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nWait the example input includes n=13 as a YES. Let me think again. Maybe the construction can be done with different numbers of steps. Let me try to model the possible numbers of vertices.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as being built in layers. The first layer is the root. Then, each time we add layers, each node in the previous layer (which has degree 1) gets k children. But the process requires that after the initial step (adding the first k nodes), we perform the step of adding k nodes to each leaf at least once. So the minimal case would be two layers.\n\nLet me model the number of nodes for a snowflake with m layers. Let me think of the layers as follows:\n\n- Layer 0: 1 node (the root)\n- Layer 1: k nodes connected to the root. So after this, total is 1 + k.\n- Then, for each subsequent layer, every node in the previous layer (which are leaves) gets k new children. So each layer adds k * (number of nodes in previous layer).\n\nBut how many layers are there? Let's say the snowflake is built with m layers. For example, for m=1, the snowflake has 1 + k nodes. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding k new nodes to each leaf must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first k nodes) is the first step, then the second step (adding k nodes to each of the leaves from the first step) is required. So the minimal number of layers is 2. Wait, perhaps the construction is as follows:\n\nThe initial step is creating the root and connecting it to k nodes. Then, the next step is to take all the leaves (those k nodes) and connect each to k new nodes. This is required to be done at least once. So the minimal case would be when you have two steps: initial step (layer 1) and then one more step (layer 2). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k*k. Let's check that for k=2, that would be 1+2+4=7. But if n is 7, then it's possible. But the sample input says that for n=6, the answer is NO. So for n=6, maybe there's no k that allows that.\n\nSo the formula for the total number of nodes depends on how many times we perform the expansion step. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me denote the number of layers as m. For m=1, the total is 1 + k. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So for m=1, that's not allowed. Wait, the initial step is adding the first k nodes. Then the expansion step is done once. So the minimal case is m=2 layers. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k*k.\n\nBut what if we do more expansion steps? Like, for example, after adding the second layer, we could do another expansion step. Let's see:\n\nFor m=3 layers:\n\nTotal nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3?\n\nNo. Because each expansion step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. Let's think:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node (root). It's not a leaf.\n\nLayer 1: k nodes. Each is a leaf. So after this step, the total is 1 + k.\n\nThen, the expansion step: each of the k leaves gets k new children. So layer 2 has k * k nodes. Now, the total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nNow, if we do another expansion step, then each of the layer 2 nodes (k^2 of them) are leaves, so each gets k children. So layer 3 adds k^3 nodes. Total becomes 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So the minimal number of expansion steps is 1. Which would give total nodes as 1 + k + k^2. However, the expansion steps can be done multiple times. So for any m ≥ 2, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m ?\n\nWait, no. Because each expansion step is applied to the leaves of the previous step. So each expansion step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the number of leaves after each expansion step.\n\nInitially, after the first step (connecting the root to k nodes), the leaves are the k nodes. Then, when we do the first expansion step, each of those k leaves gets k new children. So now, the leaves are those new nodes (k * k of them). Then, if we do another expansion step, each of those leaves gets k children, adding k^3 nodes, and the leaves become those.\n\nSo the total number of nodes after m expansion steps (with m ≥ 1) would be:\n\nTotal = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1} }) ?\n\nWait, because:\n\n- The initial step is 1 node (root). Then, the first expansion step adds k nodes (layer 1). Then the next expansion step adds k * k nodes (layer 2). Then next adds k * k^2 nodes (layer 3), etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1} } ), where m is the number of expansion steps. Since the expansion steps must be done at least once, m ≥ 1.\n\nWait, but for m=1, the expansion steps are done once. So the total is 1 + k * (1) = 1 + k? No, that's not right. Because the first expansion step is adding k nodes. Then the second expansion step would be adding k * k nodes. So for m expansion steps, the total would be 1 + k * (sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i) ) ?\n\nWait, sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i} equals (k^m -1)/(k-1). So the total is 1 + k * ( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )) ?\n\nWait let me think again. The initial step is the root. Then, the first expansion step adds k nodes (layer 1). Then, the second expansion step adds k * k nodes (layer 2). The third adds k * k^2 nodes (layer 3), etc. So for m expansion steps, the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m (k^i). Because:\n\nsum_{i=1}^m k^i = k + k^2 + ... +k^m = k*(k^m -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, sum from i=1 to m of k^i is equal to (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1). So the total number of nodes is 1 + [k^{m+1} -k]/(k-1).\n\nBut let me check for m=1: 1 + [k^2 -k]/(k-1) = 1 + [k(k-1)]/(k-1) ) = 1 +k. Which is correct. For m=2: 1 + [k^3 -k]/(k-1) = 1 + [k(k² -1)]/(k-1) ) = 1 +k(k+1) = 1 +k² +k. Which matches the earlier example. So yes, the formula for the total number of nodes when there are m expansion steps is 1 + (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1).\n\nBut that can be simplified. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1) = k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). So total nodes is 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). Alternatively, since 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1) can be written as [ (k-1) + k(k^m -1) ] / (k-1) ) ?\n\nNot sure. Let me think of it as:\n\nTotal nodes = 1 + k * ( (k^m - 1) / (k-1) )\n\nBut for the snowflake to be valid, the number of expansion steps m must be at least 1. So for any k>1, and m ≥ 1, the total number of nodes is given by that formula.\n\nSo our problem reduces to checking if for some k>1 and m≥1, the total number of nodes equals n.\n\nBut how can we check this efficiently for large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nThe approach is: For each n, check if there exists integers k>1 and m≥1 such that n = 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nAlternatively, simplifying the formula:\n\nLet me write the formula again:\n\nn = 1 + [k^{m+1} -k]/(k-1)\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\nMultiply both sides by (k-1):\n\n(n-1)(k-1) = k^{m+1} -k \n\n=> (n-1)(k-1) +k = k^{m+1}\n\n=> (n-1)(k-1) +k = k * (k^m) \n\n=> (n-1)(k-1) +k = k^{m+1}\n\nLet me simplify the left side:\n\n(n-1)(k-1) +k = (n-1)k - (n-1) +k = (n-1)k +k - (n-1) = k(n-1 + 1) - (n-1) = k*n - (n-1) \n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n(n-1)(k-1) +k = (n-1)(k-1) +k = (n-1)k - (n-1) +k = k(n-1 +1) - (n-1) = kn - (n-1) \n\nSo:\n\nkn - (n-1) = k^{m+1}\n\nWhich gives:\n\nk^{m+1} = kn - (n-1) \n\nSo:\n\nk^{m+1} = k n - n +1 \n\nHmm, that's an interesting equation. Let me factor the right-hand side:\n\nk n -n +1 = n(k -1) +1 \n\nSo:\n\nk^{m+1} = n(k-1) +1 \n\nThis seems important. So for some k>1 and m≥1, the equation must hold. \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether there exists k>1 and m≥1 such that k^{m+1} = n(k-1) +1.\n\nBut how can we find this for a given n?\n\nLet me think of possible approaches. For each n, we need to check if there exists some k>1 and m≥1 such that the above equation holds. \n\nBut for very large n (up to 1e18), trying all possible k's is impossible. So we need a way to check for possible k's efficiently.\n\nLet me think of possible values of k. For a given n, k must satisfy that k^{m+1} = n(k-1) +1. Let's rearrange this equation:\n\nn = (k^{m+1} -1) / (k-1) \n\nWait, because:\n\nk^{m+1} -1 = n(k-1) \n\nSo n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) \n\nBut (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. Which is the same as the sum from i=0 to m of k^i. \n\nSo, the original problem reduces to checking whether n can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with ratio k>1, and at least m+1 terms (since m ≥ 1 implies that the sum has at least 2 terms: m+1 ≥ 2 → m ≥1). Wait, m ≥1, so m+1 ≥ 2. So the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, which is a geometric series with m+1 terms. \n\nBut the original problem's snowflake requires that the expansion steps are done at least once, which corresponds to m ≥1. So the sum is of length m+1 ≥ 2 terms. \n\nSo the problem is equivalent to checking if n can be written as the sum of a geometric series with ratio k>1 and at least 2 terms. \n\nBut how can we check that for a given n?\n\nLet me think. For a given n, we need to check whether there exists integers k ≥2 and m ≥1 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n. \n\nBecause sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nSo the problem becomes: check if n can be written in this form for some k ≥2 and m ≥1. \n\nSo the question now is: for a given n, does there exist k ≥2 and m ≥1 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n?\n\nNow, how to check this for a given n?\n\nLet me think of possible approaches. For each possible k, find if there exists m such that the equation holds. However, for large n, trying all possible k's up to some limit is feasible.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible value of k for a given n?\n\nWell, for k ≥2 and m ≥1, the sum is at least 1 +k. For example, when m=1, sum is 1 +k. So for a given n, if there exists such a k, then k must be ≤ n-1 (since 1 +k ≤n → k ≤n-1). However, for larger m, k can be smaller. So trying all k up to sqrt(n) or something similar might be feasible.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, trying all k up to sqrt(n) would be O(1e9) in worst case, which is not feasible. Therefore, we need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible m, find if there exists a k such that the equation holds.\n\nWhat's the possible range of m? Let's think. For a fixed m, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. For m ≥1, the minimal value of the sum for given m is when k=2. So for m, the minimal sum is 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. So for a given m, if n < 2^{m+1} -1, then no solution exists for that m. Also, the maximum possible m for which 2^{m+1} -1 ≤n is log2(n+1) -1. So for example, for n=1e18, log2(n) is about 60. So m can be up to around 60. So the possible values of m are small (up to 60). \n\nTherefore, for each possible m (from 1 up to 60), we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. If for any m, such a k exists, then answer is YES.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n is 1. If yes, then answer is NO (since for m≥1, sum is at least 1+2=3, but n=1 can't be achieved).\n\n- Else, iterate m from 1 to up to 60 (since for m=60, 2^61-1 is way bigger than 1e18).\n\n- For each m, compute the equation (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. Solve for k.\n\nBut how to solve for k?\n\nWe can rewrite the equation as:\n\nk^{m+1} -1 = n(k-1)\n\n→ k^{m+1} -n k + (n -1) = 0.\n\nBut solving this equation for integer k ≥2 is challenging. However, for fixed m, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nLet me think. For fixed m, the sum S(k) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing with k. Because for k≥2, as k increases, S(k) increases. So for fixed m, we can perform a binary search on k to find if there exists a k ≥2 such that S(k) =n.\n\nBut how to compute S(k) for a given k and m?\n\nBut for large exponents, even m=60, k^m could be very big. However, since n is up to 1e18, for m up to 60, we can compute k^something and compare with n.\n\nBut for binary search, the upper bound for k can be determined. For fixed m, the minimal value of S(k) is when k=2. So if S(2) >n, then no solution for this m. Otherwise, the upper bound for k can be found. Also, since S(k) increases with k, for a given m, we can find the possible k.\n\nLet me think of how to find the upper bound for k in binary search.\n\nFor example, for m=1, S(k) = 1 +k. So for given n, k =n-1. So for m=1, check if n-1 ≥2 (since k≥2). So if n-1 ≥2 → n≥3, then k =n-1 is a solution. But wait, for m=1, the sum is 1 +k =n → k =n-1. So for any n ≥3, if we set m=1 and k=n-1, then yes. But wait, this would imply that for any n≥3, the answer is YES. But according to the sample input, n=3 is output NO. Wait, sample input says for n=3, output is NO. So this suggests that my reasoning is wrong. Let me check.\n\nWait, the sample input includes n=3, and the output is NO. But according to the previous logic, for m=1 and k=2 (since 1 +k =3 → k=2), which is allowed. Then why is the answer NO?\n\nAh! Because the snowflake requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. Let me go back to the construction rules.\n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes to the root. Then, the expansion step (adding k nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. So for the snowflake, the number of expansion steps is m ≥1. But the formula for the sum is sum_{i=0}^m k^i =n. Which for m=1 is sum 1 +k. Which would correspond to the snowflake with one expansion step. So that should be allowed. But according to the sample input, n=3 is a NO. Why?\n\nLet me check the sample input. The input includes n=3, and the output is NO. So according to the problem statement, for n=3, there's no possible k>1 that allows a snowflake.\n\nBut according to the formula, for m=1 and k=2, the sum is 1 +2=3. Which would imply that the snowflake can be constructed. But according to the sample, it's not possible. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh wait! The construction requires that the expansion step is done at least once. Let me re-examine the construction steps.\n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes to the root. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (the ones added in the first step) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So the expansion step is done once. So the total number of vertices is 1 +k +k^2. Because:\n\n- Initially, 1 node.\n\n- First step: add k nodes. Total is 1 +k.\n\n- Then, expansion step: add k^2 nodes. Total is 1 +k +k^2. \n\nWait, but according to the previous analysis, the sum is sum_{i=0}^m k^i. For m=1, that's 1 +k. Which would be the case if there was only one expansion step? Or is there a mistake in the mapping between the expansion steps and the sum?\n\nThis seems to be the crux of the problem. Where is the error in the previous reasoning?\n\nLet me re-express the construction steps:\n\nThe snowflake is built as follows:\n\nStart with one node.\n\nStep 1: connect the root to k new nodes. Now, the total is 1 +k. At this point, the expansion step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) is not done yet. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So after step 1, we must perform the expansion step once.\n\nSo the expansion step is done once. That is, after step 1, we take each of the k leaves (the ones added in step 1) and add k new nodes to each. So this adds k *k =k² nodes. Now the total is 1 +k +k². \n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k². Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i -k^0? No. Wait sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = 1 +k +k². Which is exactly the total nodes. So this corresponds to m=2. Because the expansion steps are done once. So earlier mapping between m and the number of expansion steps is incorrect.\n\nThis is a critical mistake. So the previous analysis was wrong. Let me re-express this.\n\nThe sum S = sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i. But the number of expansion steps is m-1? Or how?\n\nLet me think again. The construction steps:\n\n- Initial step (step 0): 1 node.\n\n- Step 1 (first expansion): add k nodes. Now, total is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So after step 1, we need to perform the expansion step once. So that would be step 2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes after step 1 is 1 +k. Then, after performing one expansion step (step 2), we add k² nodes, making the total 1 +k +k². \n\nThus, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m is the number of expansion steps plus 1? Or perhaps m is the number of expansion steps plus something else.\n\nAlternatively, the number of expansion steps is t ≥1. Then the total number of nodes is:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{t+1} k^i ?\n\nNo. Let me think for t=1 expansion steps:\n\nInitial step: 1 node.\n\nFirst expansion step (step 1): add k nodes. Now, total is 1 +k.\n\nSecond expansion step (step 2): add k² nodes. Now, total is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for t=1 expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k² = sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. Which is sum from i=0 to m=2. So m is t+1. So the number of expansion steps is t, and the sum is up to m = t+1.\n\nBut the problem requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. So t ≥1. Hence, m = t+1 ≥2. \n\nSo the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i where m ≥2. \n\nThus, the correct equation is: n = sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥2, k ≥2.\n\nAh! So this changes everything. Earlier, I thought m could be 1, but that's not allowed. Because m must be ≥2. \n\nThis explains why the sample input n=3 is a NO. Because for m=2, sum is 1 +k +k². For k=2, that is 1 +2 +4 =7. For k=1, which is not allowed, it's 3. So for n=3, there's no k≥2 and m≥2 that satisfies the equation. Hence, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the correct problem is to check whether n can be written as the sum of a geometric series sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥2 and k ≥2. \n\nSo the equation is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n, where m ≥2 and k ≥2. \n\nSo for the sample input n=6, let's check:\n\nCheck if there exists k and m ≥2 such that sum is 6. Let's see:\n\nFor m=2:\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² =6 → k² +k +1 =6 → k² +k -5=0. Discriminant is 1 +20=21. sqrt(21) is ~4.58. k is (-1 +4.58)/2 ≈ 1.79. Not integer. So no solution.\n\nFor m=3: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ =6. Try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>6. So no. k=1 not allowed. So no solution. So answer is NO, which matches the sample.\n\nFor n=13, the sample output is YES. Let's see:\n\nCheck possible m and k.\n\nFor m=2: 1 +k +k² =13 → k² +k -12=0 → solutions k=(-1 ± sqrt(1 +48))/2 = (-1 +7)/2= 3. So k=3. So yes. So for m=2, k=3. So answer is YES.\n\nThat's why n=13 is YES.\n\nSo the correct approach is to check for m ≥2, and k≥2, whether the equation holds.\n\nSo the previous approach of iterating over possible m (now m ≥2) and for each, perform binary search on k is correct.\n\nSo for each test case, n:\n\nIf n is 1, output NO.\n\nElse, for m from 2 up to max_m (where max_m is such that sum for k=2 is ≤n), check if there exists a k≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i =n.\n\nHow to compute max_m? For k=2, the sum is 2^{m+1} -1. We need 2^{m+1} -1 ≤n → m+1 ≤ log2(n+1). For n up to 1e18, m+1 can be up to 60, so m up to 59.\n\nSo for each test case, we can loop m from 2 up to 60, and for each m, perform a binary search on k to see if there's a solution.\n\nNow, for each m, the sum S(k) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. We can perform binary search on k ≥2.\n\nBut how to compute S(k) without overflowing? Since n is up to 1e18, and m is up to 60, k can be up to something like n^(1/(m+1)).\n\nBut during binary search, for each candidate k, we can compute S(k) and compare to n. However, computing k^{m+1} directly may lead to very large numbers, but since m is small (up to 60), and k can be up to something like 1e9 (for m=2, S(k)=k² +k +1 =n → k is about sqrt(n)), which for n=1e18 is 1e9, which is manageable with Python's arbitrary precision integers.\n\nSo the steps for each test case are:\n\nCheck if n is 1 → NO.\n\nElse:\n\nFor m in 2 to 60:\n\n   Compute the minimal possible sum for k=2. If sum_2 = (2^{m+1} -1)/(2-1) = 2^{m+1} -1. If this is larger than n, then skip this m (since for higher k, the sum will be even larger).\n\n   Else, perform binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound] to find if there exists a k where S(k) =n.\n\n   How to find upper_bound for k?\n\n   For a given m, the sum increases with k. For a given m, the minimal sum is when k=2. The maximum possible k can be found by considering that for k ≥2, S(k) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. Since this is greater than k^m, and we want S(k) =n, so k^m < n → k < n^(1/m). So upper_bound can be set to n^(1/m) + 1, but for practical purposes, during binary search, we can start with low=2, high= some value that is definitely larger than possible k.\n\nBut how to find high for binary search?\n\nWell, for a given m, the sum S(k) is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. For k ≥2, this sum is less than or equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) < k^{m+1}/(k-1). For k ≥2, k-1 ≥1, so S(k) < k^{m+1}.\n\nSo for S(k) =n → k^{m+1} >n → k> n^{1/(m+1)}.\n\nBut since S(k) increases with k, we can set the upper bound for binary search as n. Because for k ≥2, S(k) increases with k. For example, when k is very large, S(k) is roughly k^m, which for large k is much larger than n. So for binary search, the upper bound can be set to something like n, but in practice, it's better to find a tighter upper bound.\n\nBut for binary search purposes, even if the upper bound is high, it's manageable because m is small (up to 60), and for each m, binary search is O(log n) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each m from 2 up to say 60:\n\n   compute the minimal sum for k=2. If this is larger than n, then no solution for this m. Continue to next m.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search on k between 2 and some upper limit (like n) to find if there's a k where S(k) =n.\n\nOnce any m and k are found, return YES.\n\nIf after checking all m's no solution is found, return NO.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute S(k) for given k and m. Let's think about how to compute it efficiently and avoid overflow. In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nBut for large exponents, even m=60, and k=2, the sum is 2^61 -1, which is manageable.\n\nSo for a given k and m, compute S(k) = (k^{m+1} -1) // (k-1). But wait, this is only true if k !=1. Since k ≥2, this is valid.\n\nBut during binary search, for a given k and m, we can compute this sum, and compare to n. However, for very large k and m, this could take time. But since m is small, it's manageable.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, compute the sum incrementally. For example, sum = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. We can compute this as a loop, adding each term. But for m up to 60, this is trivial.\n\nBut for very large k and m, this could be slow. However, since m is small, even for k=1e18 and m=60, the sum would be 1 +k + ... +k^m, which is O(k^m). But during binary search, for each candidate k, we can compute this sum incrementally and check if it exceeds n. If during the computation, the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo for a given k and m, compute the sum step by step:\n\ncurrent_sum = 0\n\nterm = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to m:\n\n   current_sum += term\n\n   term *=k \n\nif current_sum ==n → yes.\n\nBut for large m and large k, this could take O(m) time per check. However, since m is up to 60, and per test case, for each m, binary search is O( log (upper_bound) ) steps, and for t=1e4 test cases, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, compute the formula (k^{m+1} -1) // (k-1). But for k=1, but since k ≥2, it's safe.\n\nBut for very large exponents, calculating k^{m+1} could be expensive. For example, when m=60, and k=1e9, then k^{61} is a huge number, but Python can handle it. However, for some cases, it might be better to compute incrementally and stop early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nSo perhaps the incremental approach is better for avoiding unnecessary computations.\n\nLet me think of code for checking if for a given k and m, the sum equals n.\n\ndef check(k, m, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current_term = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n\n        total += current_term\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return False\n\n        current_term *=k\n\n    return total ==n\n\nBut for example, when m=2, the loop runs 3 times (i=0,1,2). For each step, adding 1, then k, then k^2. So yes.\n\nSo this function returns True if the sum equals n.\n\nSo during binary search for a given m, we can use this function to check.\n\nNow, the binary search for a given m:\n\nlow =2\n\nhigh = ?\n\nInitially, high can be set to something like n. But for some cases, this can be too large. However, since for each m, the sum increases with k, we can find the upper bound.\n\nBut during binary search, even if high is large, the steps are manageable.\n\nSo for each m, perform binary search between low=2 and high= some upper limit. Let's think of how to find the upper limit.\n\nWe can find an upper bound for k as follows: since the sum for k is at least 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m ≥k^m. So for k^m ≤n → k ≤n^(1/m). So the upper bound can be set to n^(1/m) +1. However, in practice, during binary search, we can start with low=2 and high=2, and double high until the sum exceeds n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis approach is called exponential search. For example:\n\nInitialize low=2, high=2.\n\nWhile check(high, m, n) is False:\n\n   high *=2\n\nOnce we have a high where check(high, m, n) is False (meaning the sum for high is larger than n), then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut this may be more efficient than using a fixed high of n.\n\nBut for code simplicity, perhaps it's easier to use a fixed high. For example, for m up to 60, and n up to 1e18, the maximum possible k is when m=2, and sum is 1 +k",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and our task is to check if such a configuration exists for each given `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands in layers. Each layer adds new vertices connected to the previous layer's vertices. The structure can be represented using geometric series.\n2. **Geometric Series Insight**: For a valid snowflake, the total number of vertices `n` must be expressible as the sum of a geometric series with at least two terms (since the expansion step must be done at least once).\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Depths**: For each possible depth `m` (starting from 2 up to a reasonable upper limit), check if there exists a base `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid Base**: For each depth `m`, use binary search to determine if there exists a base `k` (where `k > 1`) such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_m = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18, which is larger than 1e18\n    for m in range(2, max_m + 1):\n        # Check if for k=2, the sum is <=n\n        # Compute sum for k=2\n        total = 0\n        current_term = 1\n        for _ in range(m + 1):\n            total += current_term\n            current_term *= 2\n            if total > n:\n                break\n        if total > n:\n            continue  # no need to check higher k for this m\n        # Binary search for k in [2, ...]\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound\n        while True:\n            total_k = 0\n            term = 1\n            for _ in range(m + 1):\n                total_k += term\n                term *= high\n                if total_k > n:\n                    break\n            if total_k < n:\n                high *= 2\n            else:\n                break\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            total_mid = 0\n            term = 1\n            for _ in range(m + 1):\n                total_mid += term\n                term *= mid\n                if total_mid > n:\n                    break\n            if total_mid == n:\n                return True\n            elif total_mid < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Trivial Case**: If `n` is 1, it's immediately impossible to form a valid snowflake.\n3. **Iterate Over Depths**: For each possible depth `m` (from 2 to 60), check if a valid geometric series sum can be formed.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid Base**: For each depth, use binary search to find a valid base `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.
