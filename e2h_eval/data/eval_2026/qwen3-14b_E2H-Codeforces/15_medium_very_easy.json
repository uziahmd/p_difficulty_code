They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, there's a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half, and each game eliminates one team. The results of each phase are determined by the string s. For each phase i (starting from 1?), if s_i is 0, the lower skill level wins; if it's 1, higher skill wins. We need to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nHmm. The key here is to figure out for each possible x, whether it can be the champion given the rules of the tournament structure and the string s.\n\nFirst, let's think about how the tournament works. Each round, teams are paired, and based on the phase's rule (s[i]), the winner is determined. The structure is like a binary tree. For example, in the first phase (phase 1?), there are 2^{n-1} games. Then phase 2 has 2^{n-2} games, etc., until phase n which has 1 game.\n\nWait, the string s has length n. So for each phase i (from 1 to n), the i-th character of s determines the outcome of that phase's matches.\n\nSo for each phase, when the matches are played, the winner is determined based on the skill levels. But the permutation p is given, and we need to find x such that there exists a permutation where x is the champion.\n\nBut how do we model this? Since the permutation p is arbitrary, but the tournament structure is fixed based on s, we need to find for each x, whether there's a way to arrange the other teams' skill levels so that x can win through all the rounds according to the rules of each phase.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the tournament as a series of rounds. For a team to reach the final, it must win each round. Each round's outcome depends on the current phase's rule.\n\nFor example, in the first phase (phase 1), the team must win against its opponent. The rule for phase 1 is determined by s[0] (assuming 0-based index). Then in phase 2, the team is in a new match, and the rule for that phase is s[1], etc.\n\nBut since the permutation can be arranged in any way, perhaps we can model the minimal and maximal possible skill levels that a team can have in order to reach the final.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each round, we can determine the constraints on the team's skill level. For instance, in each phase, depending on the rule (higher or lower wins), the team must have a skill level that is either higher or lower than all the opponents it faces in that phase.\n\nWait, but the opponents depend on the structure of the tournament. For example, in the first round, the team is paired with another team. The winner of that pair moves on. Then in the next round, that winner is paired with another winner from another pair, and so on.\n\nBut since the permutation can be chosen arbitrarily, perhaps for a given x, we can determine the minimum and maximum required values for x to be able to win each round.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For a team to be the champion, it must win all the rounds. Each round's match is determined by the phase's rule. Let's think about each round in terms of the required condition for x to win.\n\nIn the first phase (phase 1), the team must be in a pair. Depending on the rule (s[0]), the team must be either the higher or lower in skill than their opponent. But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the opponents in such a way that x can win. However, the opponents in subsequent rounds are determined by the previous rounds.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. The champion must pass through n rounds. Each round corresponds to a level in the tree. For example, in the first round (phase 1), there are 2^{n-1} matches. Each match is between two teams, and the winner proceeds to the next round. Then, in phase 2, there are 2^{n-2} matches, and so on.\n\nNow, for a team to be the champion, during each phase, it must win its match. The way it wins depends on the phase's rule. For example, during phase i (the i-th phase), the rule is s[i-1] (if the string is 0-based).\n\nSo for each phase, the team must be either the higher or lower skill in that match. However, the opponents in each phase are determined by the structure of the tournament. But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can choose the opponents' skills to be such that x can win each match.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of it as for each round, the team must be able to beat the opponent in that round. But since the opponents are chosen by us (as we can arrange the permutation), perhaps we can find for each round, what constraints are placed on x's skill.\n\nFor example, during phase 1 (first round), the team must be in a match. Suppose s[0] is '1', meaning that higher skill wins. Then, in order for x to win this match, x must be higher than the opponent. Since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the opponent to have a skill lower than x. However, in the next phase, the team will face another opponent. For example, in phase 2, the rule is s[1]. If s[1] is '0', then the team must have lower skill than the opponent in that match. But how can that be possible? Because if x is higher than the previous opponent, but now needs to be lower than the next opponent, which would require that the next opponent has a higher skill than x. But how can that be arranged?\n\nWait, but the permutation is such that all teams have unique skills. So, for x to be the champion, we need to arrange the other teams' skills in such a way that during each phase, x can win the match according to the phase's rule.\n\nSo, perhaps for each phase, we can determine the constraints on x's skill relative to the other teams in the bracket. For example, in the first phase, if the rule is '1', then x must be higher than the opponent. In the second phase, if the rule is '0', then x must be lower than the opponent in that phase. But that opponent is the winner of another match in the first phase. So, that opponent's skill must be higher than x (since in the second phase, the rule is '0', and x must lose to that opponent? Wait no. Wait, in the second phase, the rule is for that phase. So during the second phase, the match is between two teams that won their first phase matches. The rule for the second phase determines who wins. So for x to win the second phase match, x must be either higher or lower than the opponent, depending on the rule.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, perhaps we can arrange the other teams in such a way that x can pass through each round.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, during each phase, the team must be able to win its match. To do this, we can model for each phase the minimal and maximal possible skill that x must have relative to the other teams in its path.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the team must be the winner of that round's match, based on the rule. For the team to be the champion, it must be the winner of all rounds.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that in the first round, the team x must be matched against some other team. Depending on the rule, x must be higher or lower than that team. Let's say that in the first round, the rule is s[0]. If s[0] is '1', then x must be higher than the opponent. So, the opponent can be any team with a lower skill than x. Then, in the next round, the team x will face another team that also won their first-round match. The rule for the second round is s[1]. So, for x to win this match, it must be either higher or lower than that opponent, depending on s[1].\n\nBut how do we model the opponents in each round? Well, since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the opponents in each round such that x can win. However, the opponents in each round must be teams that have passed through their respective paths.\n\nFor example, in the first round, x's opponent can be any team with a skill less than x (if the rule is '1'). Then, in the second round, x's opponent must be a team that also won their first round match. For the second round, if the rule is '0', then x must have a lower skill than that opponent. So, that opponent must have a higher skill than x. But how can that be possible? Because in the first round, that opponent must have beaten their own opponent, which would require that they were higher (if the rule was '1') or lower (if the rule was '0') than their first-round opponent.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's think for each round i (from 1 to n), what constraints must x satisfy.\n\nLet me think about the entire tournament as a series of layers. For x to win, during each round, the rule of that round determines whether x must be the maximum or the minimum in the group of teams that reach that round.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the concept of \"minimum and maximum required\" for each round.\n\nSuppose that for each round, depending on the rule, the team must be either the strongest or the weakest in its bracket. For example, in the first round, if the rule is '1', then the team must be stronger than its opponent. So, in that bracket, it's the strongest. Then, in the second round, if the rule is '0', then the team must be weaker than its opponent. But that opponent must be the strongest in their bracket (if their first round rule was '1') or the weakest (if their first round rule was '0').\n\nThis seems too vague. Maybe we can model for each round, the minimal and maximal possible value that x must have.\n\nAnother idea: For x to be the champion, during each phase, it must be the winner of that phase's match. The way to ensure that is to have x be either the maximum or the minimum in the group of teams that reach that phase's match.\n\nBut how to model this across all phases?\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. The champion must pass through n rounds. For each round, the team must be the winner of that round's match, which depends on the rule of that round.\n\nLet me think of the rounds in reverse. Starting from the final round (the nth phase), then going back to the first.\n\nIn the final round (phase n), there's only one match. The rule is s[n-1]. For x to win this match, it must be either higher or lower than the opponent. But since the opponent is the winner of the other half of the bracket, how can we arrange that?\n\nBut since we can choose the permutation, perhaps for x to be the champion, during each phase, x must be the best (or worst) in its subtree.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\nFor each round i (from 1 to n), during that phase, the rule is s[i-1]. Let's imagine that during that phase, the team x must be the \"winner\" of that phase's match, which depends on the rule. So, for the team to proceed to the next round, it must be the maximum or the minimum in the group of two teams that meet in that phase's match.\n\nBut how do these groups form? For example, in the first phase, each group is two teams. In the second phase, each group is two teams that each won their first-phase matches. And so on.\n\nSo, for each phase i, the group of teams that reach that phase is 2^{n - (i-1)} teams. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the skill levels in such a way that for each phase, x is the required (max or min) in its group.\n\nLet me think of the constraints for x. For example, during phase 1, the rule is s[0]. If s[0] is '1', then x must be the maximum in its group of two teams. So, in that group, x is the maximum. Then, in phase 2, the rule is s[1]. Suppose s[1] is '0'. Then, x must be the minimum in its group of two teams (since in that phase, the lower skill wins). But that group consists of two teams that each won their first-phase matches. So, in phase 2, x is facing another team that was the maximum in its first-phase group. For x to be the minimum in the phase 2 group, x must be lower than that team. But that team was the maximum in their group. How can we arrange that?\n\nAh, but since we can choose the permutation, we can arrange the other teams such that this is possible. For example, in phase 2, the other team could be a team with a higher skill than x. But then, in phase 1, that team must have been the maximum in their group. Which requires that their group's other team had a lower skill than them.\n\nSo, for x to be able to pass through all the phases, we need to find for each phase i, whether x can be the required extremum (min or max) in its group of 2^{i} teams? Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire path that x takes through the tournament. For each phase, x must be the winner of its match, which depends on the rule of that phase. So, during phase i, the match is between two teams that have passed through the previous phases. For x to win, it must be either higher or lower than the other team in that match.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange the other teams' skills in such a way that x can win all matches. However, the constraints are that for each phase, the other teams must be arranged so that their presence allows x to win.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: For x to be the champion, during each phase i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. Let's define for each phase, whether x needs to be the minimum or maximum in the group of teams that reach that phase's match.\n\nFor example, in phase 1, if the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum of the two teams in its group. In phase 2, if the rule is '0', then x must be the minimum of the two teams in its group (since the lower skill wins). But for x to be the minimum in that group, the other team must be higher than x. However, that other team must have passed through phase 1's rule. Let's say that in phase 1, their rule was '1' (so they were the maximum in their group). Therefore, their group's other team had a lower skill than them. So, the other team in phase 2's match is a team that is higher than x (so x is the minimum in phase 2's group), but that team is the maximum of their own group in phase 1.\n\nSo, how can we model this for all phases?\n\nPerhaps for each phase, we can track the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to satisfy the rules up to that point.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's suppose that for the first phase, the rule is s[0]. If s[0] is '1', then x must be the maximum in its group of 2 teams. Therefore, x must be larger than the other team in that group. Since the permutation is arbitrary, we can choose that other team to be any value less than x. However, in the next phase, x will face another team that is the maximum of their group (if the phase 2 rule is '1') or the minimum (if the phase 2 rule is '0').\n\nBut how to model the constraints on x across all phases?\n\nAnother approach: For each phase, the team must be the winner of that phase's match. Let's think of the tournament as a series of decisions. For each phase, depending on the rule, the team must be either the minimum or maximum in the set of teams that reach that phase's match. Let me think of the tournament as requiring that for each phase i, the team x must be the minimum or maximum in a certain subset of teams.\n\nLet me think about the entire path. The team x must go through n phases. For each phase i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. Let's denote the required condition for phase i as follows:\n\nIf s[i-1] is '1', then during phase i, x must be the maximum among the two teams in that phase's match. So, in that match, x must be stronger than the other team.\n\nIf s[i-1] is '0', then during phase i, x must be the minimum among the two teams in that phase's match. So, x must be weaker than the other team.\n\nBut how does this affect the possible values of x?\n\nLet me think of the constraints as follows. For each phase, the team x must be either the maximum or the minimum in the group of teams that reach that phase. However, each phase's group is determined by the previous phases.\n\nBut perhaps, for each phase, we can determine a range of possible values that x must lie within.\n\nFor example, let's consider the first phase. Suppose s[0] is '1', so x must be the maximum in its group of two teams. So, in that group, x is the maximum. Therefore, x must be greater than the other team. However, the other team can be any value less than x. So, the minimal possible value for x is 2 (since there's at least one team with lower value), but the maximum is not constrained yet.\n\nThen, in phase 2, the rule is s[1]. Suppose it's '0', meaning that x must be the minimum in its group of two teams. So, the other team in the phase 2 match must be higher than x. However, that other team must have passed through phase 1. Since in phase 1, their rule was s[0], which was '1' (so they were the maximum in their group). Therefore, their group's other team was lower than them. So, the other team in phase 2 is a team that was the maximum in their group of two teams (from phase 1). Therefore, that team must be higher than their own group's other team. However, to have x be the minimum in phase 2's group, x must be lower than this other team. Therefore, this other team must be higher than x, and x must be higher than the other team in their own phase 1 group.\n\nSo, combining these conditions, x must be higher than some team (in phase 1), and lower than another team (in phase 2). How can we model this?\n\nThis seems like for each phase, there's a constraint on x's value. For example, in phase 1, if the rule is '1', x must be higher than some number of teams. In phase 2, if the rule is '0', x must be lower than some number of teams. But how to find the total constraints?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the tournament as requiring that x must be the \"winner\" of each round. For each round, depending on the rule, x must be the maximum or minimum in the group of teams that reach that round. The size of the group doubles each round. Wait, no. Each round halves the number of teams. So, for round i (starting from 1), the group size is 2^{n - (i-1)} teams. But the match in that round is between two teams, each of which came from the previous rounds.\n\nBut perhaps for each round, the number of teams that x must be compared against in that round depends on the rules up to that point.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For each round i (from 1 to n), there is a certain number of teams that x must be compared with. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire tournament as requiring that x must be the maximum or minimum in certain subsets of the teams. For example, during the first round (rule s_0), x must be the max or min of its pair. Then, during the second round (rule s_1), x must be the max or min of its new pair, which consists of two winners from the first round. And so on.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, it must be the max or min in each of these pairs, depending on the rule of that round. But how to model the constraints on x's value?\n\nHere's an idea inspired by the problem's sample input:\n\nLooking at the first sample input:\n\nn=3, s=101.\n\nThe output is 4 5 6 7.\n\nLet me think why. For x to be the champion, the rules are:\n\nPhase 1 (s[0] = '1'): higher skill wins.\n\nPhase 2 (s[1] = '0'): lower skill wins.\n\nPhase 3 (s[2] = '1'): higher skill wins.\n\nSo, for x to win:\n\nIn phase 1, x must be the max of its pair. So, x > opponent1.\n\nIn phase 2, x must be the min of its pair. So, x < opponent2.\n\nIn phase 3, x must be the max of its pair. So, x > opponent3.\n\nBut opponent2 is the winner of another pair from phase 1. Since phase 1 rule is '1', opponent2 must be the max of its pair. So, opponent2 > opponent2's opponent.\n\nSimilarly, opponent3 is the winner of phase 2's match, which depends on the rule of phase 2. Since phase 2 rule is '0', opponent3 must be the min of its pair. So, opponent3 < x (wait, no. In phase 2, the rule is '0', so the lower skill wins. So, during phase 2, the match between x and opponent2: the lower skill wins. So, since x is the one who wins, x must be the lower one. So, x < opponent2.\n\nBut opponent2 is the max of its phase 1 pair. So, opponent2 must be higher than someone else.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, there must exist some arrangement where:\n\n- x is higher than someone (opponent1) in phase 1.\n\n- x is lower than someone (opponent2) in phase 2. That someone (opponent2) must be higher than someone else (opponent2's opponent in phase 1).\n\n- x is higher than someone (opponent3) in phase 3. That someone (opponent3) must be the lower of their phase 2 pair. Which implies that opponent3 is lower than their phase 2 opponent, which would be someone else.\n\nSo, what is the minimal and maximal x can be?\n\nIn this scenario, x has to be higher than at least one team (opponent1), lower than at least one team (opponent2), and higher than at least one team (opponent3). Also, opponent2 must be higher than someone (opponent2's opponent in phase 1), and opponent3 must be lower than someone (their phase 2 opponent).\n\nBut how does this translate into constraints on x's value?\n\nLet's think of the total number of teams that must be less than x and greater than x.\n\nIn phase 1, x must be higher than at least one team. So, there's at least one team with lower skill than x.\n\nIn phase 2, x must be lower than at least one team. So, there's at least one team with higher skill than x.\n\nIn phase 3, x must be higher than at least one team. So, there's at least one team with lower skill than x.\n\nBut this is not sufficient. Because those teams may overlap. But since the permutation is arbitrary, we can choose the other teams' skills to satisfy these conditions.\n\nBut how to find the minimal and maximal possible x that can satisfy all these conditions?\n\nWait, but the problem says that x is a winning integer if there exists a permutation where x is the champion. So, for x to be a winning integer, it must be possible to arrange the other teams' skills such that x can pass through all the phases.\n\nSo, what's the minimal and maximal possible x can be?\n\nLet me think about the constraints for each phase.\n\nFor each phase i (from 1 to n), the rule is s[i-1]. Let's imagine that during phase i, x must be either the maximum or the minimum in its current match. For this to happen, during phase i, there must be a certain number of teams that are either higher or lower than x.\n\nBut since the permutation can be arranged, perhaps the constraints are that:\n\nFor each phase i, if the rule is '1', then x must be higher than all the teams that it would have faced in that phase's match. Wait, no. It just needs to be higher than the specific opponent in that phase's match. But since we can choose the opponents, perhaps for each phase, the rule tells us whether x must be higher or lower than the opponent in that phase's match.\n\nBut the opponents are determined by the structure of the tournament. However, since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the opponents such that x can win each match.\n\nSo, perhaps for each phase, the rule determines whether x must be higher or lower than the opponent in that phase. But since we can arrange the opponents, the only constraints are that:\n\n- For each phase where the rule is '1', there exists at least one team that is lower than x (so that x can win that match).\n\n- For each phase where the rule is '0', there exists at least one team that is higher than x (so that x can win that match).\n\nBut wait, this can't be right. Because for example, in the first sample input, the rules are '1', '0', '1'. So, for x to be the champion, it must have:\n\nIn phase 1: higher than someone.\n\nIn phase 2: lower than someone.\n\nIn phase 3: higher than someone.\n\nBut the sample output includes x=4,5,6,7. Let's see why. Let's take x=4. The total teams are 8. So, there are 7 other teams. To satisfy the conditions:\n\nPhase 1: x must be higher than someone. So, there is at least one team with skill <4.\n\nPhase 2: x must be lower than someone. So, there is at least one team with skill >4.\n\nPhase 3: x must be higher than someone. So, there is at least one team with skill <4.\n\nBut since x=4 is the fourth smallest, there are three teams smaller than it (1,2,3), and four teams larger (5,6,7,8). So, yes, there are enough teams to satisfy all conditions. But how does this relate to the actual tournament structure?\n\nBut this line of thinking suggests that the only constraints are that x must be neither the maximum nor the minimum in the entire set. However, the sample shows that for n=3, the answer is 4-7. Which are not the maximum (8) nor the minimum (1). But why isn't 2 included? For example, x=2.\n\nLet me check for x=2. For the sample input with s=101.\n\nPhase 1: rule is '1' (higher wins). So, x must be higher than someone. Since x=2, there are teams with lower skill (1) and higher (3-8). So, possible.\n\nPhase 2: rule is '0' (lower wins). So, x must be lower than someone. There are teams higher than 2. Possible.\n\nPhase 3: rule is '1' (higher wins). So, x must be higher than someone. There are teams lower than 2 (only 1). So, yes.\n\nBut according to the sample output, x=2 is not part of the answer. So, my earlier reasoning is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that there are additional constraints beyond just having enough teams higher or lower than x.\n\nSo, what's wrong with my previous reasoning?\n\nBecause in the tournament structure, the opponents in each phase are not arbitrary. For example, in phase 2, the opponent that x faces must have passed through phase 1. So, the opponent in phase 2 must be the winner of their phase 1 match. Which depends on the rule of phase 1.\n\nLet me think again for x=2 in the sample input.\n\nSample input: s = '101' (n=3). Rules are:\n\nPhase 1: higher wins (s[0] is '1').\n\nPhase 2: lower wins (s[1] is '0').\n\nPhase 3: higher wins (s[2] is '1').\n\nFor x=2 to be champion, it must pass through all three phases.\n\nPhase 1: x must be the higher of two teams. So, in phase 1, x's opponent must have a lower skill than x. Since x is 2, the opponent can be 1. So, x wins.\n\nPhase 2: x must be the lower of two teams. The opponent in phase 2 is the winner of another phase 1 match. Since phase 1 rule is '1', that opponent must be the higher of their two teams. So, their team's skill must be higher than their opponent. For example, if their opponent was 3, then the winner is 3, 4, etc. So, the opponent in phase 2 must be higher than x (which is 2). So, for x to win phase 2, x must be lower than that opponent. That's possible if the opponent is, say, 3.\n\nThen, phase 3: x must be higher than the opponent. The opponent is the winner of phase 2's other side. Let's think about that. In phase 2, the other side would have two teams that won their phase 1 matches. Let's say, for example, the other side's teams are 5 and 6. Their phase 2 match is under rule '0' (lower wins). So, the winner is the lower of the two. Suppose that team is 5. Then, in phase 3, x (2) must be higher than 5. But 2 is less than 5, so this is impossible. Hence, x=2 cannot be the champion.\n\nAh! Here's the crux. For x to win phase 3, the opponent in phase 3 must be lower than x. But the opponent in phase 3 comes from the other half of the bracket. For that opponent to be lower than x, there must be a way to arrange the teams such that this is possible.\n\nSo, in the case of x=2, during phase 3, the opponent must be lower than x. But x is 2, which is very low. How can the opponent in phase 3 be lower than x? Only if the opponent is 1. But in that case, during phase 1, 1 would have to be eliminated, but x=2 would have to have beaten someone else. However, if 1 is in the other half of the bracket, then during phase 3, it would be the opponent of x. But how can that happen?\n\nLet me try to construct a permutation where x=2 is the champion.\n\nPhase 1: x=2 must be in a group with 1. So, they play, and 2 wins (since phase 1 rule is '1').\n\nPhase 2: x=2 plays against someone who won their phase 1 match. Let's say that someone is 3. Since phase 2 rule is '0', the lower skill wins. So, 2 beats 3.\n\nPhase 3: x=2 plays against someone who won their phase 2 match. Let's think about the other half of the bracket. Suppose in that other half, the teams are 4,5,6,7,8. Wait, but there are only 8 teams total. Let me think of the entire bracket.\n\nThe initial bracket for 8 teams is:\n\nGroup 1: 1 vs 2 (x=2 is here)\n\nGroup 2: 3 vs 4\n\nGroup 3: 5 vs 6\n\nGroup 4: 7 vs 8\n\nPhase 1 winners are 2 (from group 1), 4 (group 2), 6 (group 3), 8 (group 4).\n\nPhase 2: groups are (2 vs 4), (6 vs 8). \n\nIn phase 2, rule is '0' (lower wins). So, 2 vs 4: lower wins. 2 is lower than 4, so 2 wins. 6 vs 8: lower wins, 6 wins. So, phase 2 winners are 2 and 6.\n\nPhase 3: 2 vs 6. Rule is '1' (higher wins). So, 6 wins. Thus, x=2 cannot be champion.\n\nSo, in this scenario, x=2 loses in phase 3. How can we arrange the bracket so that x=2 can win phase 3?\n\nFor x=2 to win phase 3, the opponent must be lower than x. So, the opponent must be 1. How can 1 reach phase 3?\n\nLet's try to arrange the bracket so that 1 is in the other half of the bracket.\n\nSuppose the initial bracket is:\n\nGroup 1: 2 vs 3 → 3 wins (because phase 1 rule is '1', higher wins. So 3 is higher than 2. Wait, but x=2 must win its phase 1 match. So this is not possible. Oh right, for x=2 to win phase 1, it must be higher than its opponent. So, the opponent must be someone lower than 2. So, the only option is 1. Hence, group 1 is 1 and 2. 2 wins.\n\nOther groups:\n\nGroup 2: 3 vs 4 → 4 wins.\n\nGroup 3: 5 vs 6 → 6 wins.\n\nGroup 4: 7 vs 8 → 8 wins.\n\nPhase 2: group 2 vs group 1 (2 vs 4). Rule is '0' (lower wins). 2 is lower than 4 → 2 wins.\n\nGroup 3 vs group 4: 6 vs 8 → lower wins. 6 wins.\n\nPhase 3: 2 vs 6. Rule is '1' (higher wins). 6 is higher than 2 → 6 wins. So, x=2 cannot win.\n\nBut what if in the other half of the bracket, the winner is 1?\n\nHow can 1 reach phase 3? For that, 1 must win all its matches.\n\nBut in phase 1, 1 can only win if the rule is '0' (lower wins). But in phase 1, the rule is '1' (higher wins). So, if 1 is in a group, it can only win if it's the higher of the two. But since 1 is the lowest, it can't be higher than anyone. Hence, 1 is eliminated in phase 1. Therefore, it's impossible for 1 to reach phase 3. Hence, the opponent in phase 3 for x=2 can't be 1. Hence, x=2 can't win phase 3.\n\nThus, x=2 is not a winning integer, even though there are teams both higher and lower than it.\n\nThis suggests that the constraints are more complex than just having enough higher and lower teams. We need to ensure that for each phase, there's a way to arrange the opponents such that the required conditions are met, taking into account the previous phases' rules.\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative idea: For each phase, the team must be able to win its match based on the rule. This depends on the number of teams that are required to be either higher or lower than x in certain parts of the tournament.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that for each round i, the team x must be able to win that round's match. For that, based on the rule of the round, x must be either the maximum or the minimum in its current group of teams. The size of the group depends on the round.\n\nBut how to model this for all rounds?\n\nLet's think of it as follows: For the team to be the champion, it must be the maximum or minimum in its bracket at each round. The brackets are determined by the tournament structure, but since we can choose the permutation, we can arrange the teams in such a way that this is possible.\n\nLet me think about the required number of teams that must be higher or lower than x.\n\nFor example, during the first phase, if the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum in its pair. Hence, there must be at least one team lower than x. For the second phase, if the rule is '0', x must be the minimum in its pair. Hence, there must be at least one team higher than x. For the third phase, if the rule is '1', x must be the maximum in its pair, hence at least one team lower than x.\n\nBut how does this affect the overall count?\n\nFor the first sample input, the rules are '1', '0', '1'.\n\nSo, the team x must have:\n\n- At least one team below it (phase 1).\n\n- At least one team above it (phase 2).\n\n- At least one team below it (phase 3).\n\nBut this is satisfied by x=4,5,6,7. For example, x=4 has 3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be the champion of a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The rules dictate whether the higher or lower skill level wins in each phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of $2^n$ teams and $n$ phases. Each phase halves the number of teams until one champion remains.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (either '0' for lower skill wins or '1' for higher skill wins). These rules determine the winner of each match in that phase.\n3. **Constraints on Winning Team**: For a team with skill level $x$ to be the champion, it must win all matches in each phase. This means $x$ must be either the maximum or minimum in its respective matches depending on the phase's rule.\n4. **Range Calculation**: For each phase, based on the rule, we calculate the minimum and maximum possible values that $x$ can take to satisfy all constraints across all phases.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    min_val = 1\n    max_val = (1 << n)  # 2^n\n    \n    # We need to find the range of x such that for each phase i (0-based), \n    # if s[i] is '1', then x must be the maximum in some subset, and if '0', the minimum.\n    # The idea is to track the required minimum and maximum for x through each phase.\n    \n    # Initialize the range of x as [1, 2^n]\n    low = 1\n    high = (1 << n)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            # In this phase, x must be the maximum in its group.
