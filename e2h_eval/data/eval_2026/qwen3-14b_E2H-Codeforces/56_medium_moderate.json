Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine if there's a perfect matching between R rebel spaceships and B bases such that no two connecting lines (from a spaceship to its base) intersect. And since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can check all possible matchings?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem correctly. The key is that for any two pairs in the matching, their connecting lines shouldn't cross. So, for example, if we have two pairs (A→B) and (C→D), the line segments AB and CD must not intersect.\n\nBut how do I check that? Well, for each possible perfect matching, I need to check that all the line segments in the matching are non-intersecting.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if R equals B. Because a perfect matching requires that the number of spaceships equals the number of bases. If R != B, then output No immediately. Oh wait, the input says that R and B are given, but the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So the first thing is to check if R equals B. Otherwise, it's impossible. For example, in the sample input, the first case is 3 3, which is okay. The second example is 2 1, so output No.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe second input is ['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']. So R is 2, B is 1. So the output is No because you can't have a perfect matching. So yes, first step: check if R == B. If not, output No.\n\nSo the first check is R == B. If not, output No.\n\nNow, assuming R == B, then we need to generate all possible permutations of assignments (each spaceship is assigned to a base, one-to-one). For each possible permutation, check if all the line segments between the spaceship and base in the permutation don't intersect with each other.\n\nIf there exists at least one permutation where this is true, output Yes; else, No.\n\nSo the problem reduces to generating all possible permutations of the bases (since each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned exactly one spaceship), and checking for each permutation whether the set of line segments are non-intersecting.\n\nBut how do I check if two line segments intersect?\n\nI remember that there's a computational geometry method for checking if two line segments intersect. Let me think about that.\n\nThe standard approach is to check if the two line segments AB and CD intersect. This involves checking if the orientation of the points changes, and also handling cases where the points are colinear.\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are on the same line. Wait, the input says that no three points are on the same line. Wait, the note says: \"It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\"\n\nWait, that's important. So for any two line segments (from the matching), they cannot be colinear, because that would require three points being on the same line. Wait, no. Wait, the input says that no three points are colinear. But the line segments are between a spaceship and a base. So if two different pairs (spaceship1 → base1) and (spaceship2 → base2) have their line segments overlapping, but that would require that the four points are arranged in some way. However, the input ensures that no three points are colinear. So for example, if two line segments share a common point (like if a spaceship is connected to a base, and another spaceship is connected to the same base), but that's not possible in a perfect matching. Because each base is assigned exactly once. So in a perfect matching, each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship, so the line segments are between distinct pairs.\n\nBut the input says that no three points are colinear. So for any two line segments in the matching, they can't be colinear. Because that would imply that three points (say, spaceship A, base B, and spaceship C) are colinear, but since the input says that no three points are colinear, that's not possible. So the line segments can't be colinear. Therefore, when checking for intersections between two line segments, we don't have to handle the case where they are colinear. That's helpful.\n\nSo, the problem of checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect can be simplified. Since the input ensures that no three points are colinear, any two line segments can either intersect at a single point (which is not an endpoint) or not. But since the line segments are between different pairs, and the endpoints are all unique, the only possible way for two line segments to intersect is if they cross each other in the middle.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nThe standard approach for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\n- Check if the orientation of A, B, C is different from the orientation of A, B, D. And similarly check for C, D, A and C, D, B. If that's the case, then the segments intersect. Also, need to handle cases where one of the endpoints lies on the other segment. But since the input says that no three points are colinear, that case can't happen. Because if, say, point C is on AB, then that would make three points (A, B, C) colinear, which is not allowed. So the input ensures that none of the endpoints lie on another segment. Therefore, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other in their interiors.\n\nTherefore, the check for intersection between two line segments AB and CD can be done by checking if the orientations of AB with C and D are different, and the orientations of CD with A and B are different. So, the standard 'do the segments intersect' function.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each permutation of the bases (since each spaceship is assigned to a base, and there are R! permutations when R = B):\n\n- For each pair of line segments (i.e., spaceship i assigned to base j, and spaceship k assigned to base l), check if the line segments between them intersect.\n\nIf any pair of line segments in the permutation intersect, then this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nIf any permutation is valid, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations? For R=10, that's 10! = 3.6 million permutations. Wait, 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments. How many pairs? For each permutation, there are R line segments. The number of pairs is R*(R-1)/2. For R=10, that's 45 pairs. For each pair, we check if they intersect. So for each permutation, 45 checks.\n\nSo total operations would be 3.6 million * 45 = about 163 million operations. Which may be acceptable for Python, but perhaps tight. However, given that R and B are up to 10, and the constraints are small, this approach is feasible.\n\nBut let's think about possible optimizations. For example, if during the checking of the permutation, we find that two line segments intersect, we can break early and proceed to the next permutation. So for each permutation, the checking can stop as soon as an intersection is found.\n\nNow, the first thing is to generate all permutations of the bases. But how to represent the data?\n\nLet me think about the input structure. The input is:\n\nFirst line: R and B.\n\nThen R lines for the spaceships (positions).\n\nThen B lines for the bases (positions).\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, R=3, B=3. Then the first three lines after R and B are the positions of the three spaceships. Then the next three are the positions of the bases.\n\nSo, for a permutation, each spaceship is assigned to a base. So, for example, if we have a permutation [0, 1, 2], then the first spaceship is assigned to the first base, second to second, third to third. But if the permutation is [1, 2, 0], then first spaceship is assigned to second base, etc.\n\nWait, the permutation is of the bases. So for each permutation, the i-th spaceship is assigned to the perm[i]-th base. Or perhaps, the permutation represents the assignment of bases to spaceships. So, for example, the permutation is a list where perm[i] is the index of the base assigned to the i-th spaceship.\n\nBut since the bases are given as a list, perhaps the code would read:\n\nspaceships = list of R points\n\nbases = list of B points.\n\nThen, for a permutation p (a list of length R, where each element is a unique index in 0..B-1), but since R=B, the permutation is a permutation of 0..R-1.\n\nWait, for example, if R = B = 3, then the permutation would be a permutation of [0, 1, 2], and for each spaceship i (0-based), the base assigned is bases[p[i]].\n\nSo, for each permutation, we can generate all the line segments between spaceship i and base p[i].\n\nOnce that's done, for all pairs of these segments, check if they intersect.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read R spaceship coordinates, then B base coordinates.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases (i.e., all possible ways to assign each spaceship to a base, one per base).\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   create a list of line segments (spaceship i to base p[i])\n\n   check all pairs of line segments in this list to see if any two intersect.\n\n   if any pair does, reject this permutation.\n\n   else, accept and return Yes.\n\nIf after checking all permutations none are valid, return No.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic.\n\nNow, the key part is implementing the line segment intersection check.\n\nLet me think about the orientation function. The orientation of three points (p, q, r) can be determined by the cross product of vectors pq and pr.\n\nThe formula is:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # clockwise or counterclockwise\n\nBut since the input ensures that no three points are colinear, we can ignore the 0 case. However, during the checking, the code should not have any such case.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking if two segments AB and CD intersect, the standard method is:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case: if the orientations are different for both segments\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases (but since no three points are colinear, we can ignore the ones where points are on the line)\n    # However, the problem says that no three points are colinear, so the following cases can't happen.\n    # So, perhaps the code can return False otherwise.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but what if one of the endpoints is on the other segment? For example, if C is on AB. But the input says that no three points are colinear. So if C is on AB, then A, B, C would be colinear. Which is not allowed. So the input guarantees that this can't happen. Therefore, the code can safely assume that the segments either cross each other (return True) or not (return False).\n\nThus, the function segments_intersect can be implemented as follows: check if the orientations are different for both segments.\n\nSo, for two line segments AB and CD, the function returns True if they intersect, else False.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nImplement the orientation function, and the segments_intersect function.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nBut first, the code needs to generate all permutations of the bases. For example, for R = B = 3, the permutations are all possible orderings of the bases. Each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships.\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, for the list of base indices (0 to B-1), generate all permutations of length R (which is equal to B).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nThen, read the input.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings, perhaps? Wait, the problem says that the input is read from stdin. So for the code, the input is read from stdin. For example, in the sample input, the first case is:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nSo, the first line is R and B. Then R lines for the spaceships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nSo, the code can read all lines, split into parts, and process accordingly.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nif R != B: print 'No' and exit.\n\nElse:\n\nread R lines of spaceship coordinates, store as list of tuples.\n\nread B lines of base coordinates, store as list of tuples.\n\ngenerate all permutations of the B bases (indices 0 to B-1). Since R=B, each permutation is a permutation of length R.\n\nfor each permutation in permutations:\n\n    create a list of line segments between spaceship i and base permutation[i]\n\n    check for all pairs of segments in this list if they intersect.\n\n    if any pair intersects, break and try next permutation.\n\n    else, return 'Yes'\n\nif no permutation found, return 'No'\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this.\n\nBut for each permutation, how to check all pairs of segments?\n\nFor example, for a permutation, the segments are:\n\nsegments = [ (spaceships[0], bases[p[0]] ), (spaceships[1], bases[p[1]] ), ... ]\n\nThen, for each i < j, check if segments[i] and segments[j] intersect.\n\nSo, for each permutation, loop over all i from 0 to R-1, j from i+1 to R-1, check if the two segments intersect.\n\nIf any of them do, then this permutation is invalid.\n\nNow, the code for that.\n\nNow, implementing the orientation and segments_intersect functions.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can code it as:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 0 if colinear, 1 if clockwise, 2 if counterclockwise\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nBut wait, the above code returns True if the general case is met. However, there are some edge cases where the segments might touch at endpoints. But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so for example, if two segments share an endpoint, that would require that the other point is colinear with the other two. Which is not allowed. So, for example, if A is connected to C, and B is connected to D, then the segments AC and BD can't share any endpoints, because that would imply that two points are same (but the input says no two points are same). So, the code can safely ignore those cases.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the spaceships and bases are all distinct points. So, for example, in the permutation, each spaceship is connected to a base. So, the segments are between distinct points. However, two different segments could have endpoints that are connected. For example, if spaceship A is connected to base X, and spaceship B is connected to base Y, but the line segments AX and BY could cross.\n\nBut the code above checks for any crossing between any two segments in the permutation.\n\nSo, the code for checking the permutation is:\n\ndef is_valid(perm, spaceships, bases):\n    n = len(spaceships)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            # get the two segments\n            A = spaceships[i]\n            B = bases[perm[i]]\n            C = spaceships[j]\n            D = bases[perm[j]]\n            if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                return False\n    return True\n\nBut wait, for each pair of segments (spaceship i to base perm[i], and spaceship j to base perm[j]), check if they intersect.\n\nIf any of them do, return False. Else, return True.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check all pairs.\n\nNow, in code.\n\nBut the problem is that for R=10, 10! is 3,628,800 permutations. For each permutation, checking 45 pairs. For each pair, four orientation checks.\n\nBut for Python, even with that, it's manageable. Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be optimized. For example, for R=10, the code will take O(10! * (10^2)) operations. Let's think about that. 10! is around 3.6e6, multiplied by 45 gives around 1.6e8 operations. For Python, which can handle about 1e6 operations per second, this could be slow. However, given that the constraints are small (R and B up to 10), perhaps it's manageable. Let's see.\n\nBut for R=10, the code may take a while. However, given that the problem says that R and B are up to 10, but the test cases may not have the worst case. For example, if R=10, but the answer is 'No', then all permutations are checked. But perhaps in practice, the code can pass within the time constraints.\n\nBut for the purposes of solving the problem, given that the constraints are small, this approach is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, spaceships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)], bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nThe sample output is 'Yes'.\n\nOne possible permutation is [0,1,2], which assigns spaceship 0 to base 0, spaceship 1 to base 1, spaceship 2 to base 2.\n\nCheck if any two segments intersect.\n\nSegments:\n\n(0,0) to (-2,1)\n\n(2,0) to (0,3)\n\n(3,1) to (2,2)\n\nCheck pairwise:\n\nBetween first and second: Do they intersect?\n\nLet me compute.\n\nA=(0,0), B=(-2,1); C=(2,0), D=(0,3).\n\nOrientation of A,B,C: \n\nval = (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x = -2 - 0 = -2\n\nC.y - A.y = 0 - 0 = 0? Wait, no. Wait, C is (2,0), so C's y-coordinate is 0. A is (0,0). So C.y - A.y = 0 - 0 = 0. \n\nSo val = (-2) * (0) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) = 0 - 1*2 = -2. So orientation is 2 (since val is negative).\n\nThen orientation of A,B,D: D is (0,3).\n\nB.x - A.x is -2, D.y - A.y is 3-0=3.\n\nB.y - A.y is 1-0=1, D.x - A.x is 0-0=0.\n\nval = (-2)*3 - (1)*0 = -6. So orientation is 2 again. So o1 and o2 are same. So the first condition is not met.\n\nSo segments_intersect returns False.\n\nSimilarly for other pairs.\n\nSo the code would return True for this permutation, hence the answer is Yes.\n\nNow, the second sample input is:\n\n2 1\n\nSo R != B, so output No.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Suppose the spaceships are (0,0) and (1,1). Bases are (0,1) and (1,0). Then, the possible permutations are [0,1] and [1,0].\n\nFor permutation [0,1], the segments are (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0). These are vertical lines. They don't cross. But they are colinear? No, the first segment is vertical line x=0 from (0,0) to (0,1). Second is vertical line x=1 from (1,1) to (1,0). So they don't cross. So this permutation is valid. Hence output is Yes.\n\nBut if the permutation is [1,0], then segments are (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These two segments cross each other. So for this permutation, the code would detect that they intersect, and thus reject it. However, since there exists another permutation, the answer is Yes.\n\nSo the code would find that.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code would generate permutations of the bases. For example, the bases are [ (0,1), (1,0) ].\n\nPermutation [0,1] would assign spaceship 0 to base 0, spaceship 1 to base 1.\n\nBut for the code, the permutation is a tuple of indices of the bases. So for the code, the bases are stored as a list, and the permutation is a permutation of the indices of the bases.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output No.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R lines of spaceship coordinates.\n\nRead B lines of base coordinates.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the B bases' indices (i.e., permutations of range(B)).\n\nFor each permutation in permutations:\n\n   check if all pairs of segments in this permutation are non-intersecting.\n\n   if yes, output Yes and exit.\n\nIf none found, output No.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, permutations are generated via itertools.permutations. For example, for B=3, permutations(range(3)) would generate all possible orderings.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    # Generate all permutations of the bases' indices\n    for perm in permutations( range(B) ):\n        # Check all pairs of segments in this permutation\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # Get the two segments\n                A = spaceships[i]\n                B = bases[ perm[i] ]\n                C = spaceships[j]\n                D = bases[ perm[j] ]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, for the permutation, perm is a tuple of length R (since B=R).

Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nA=(0,0), B=(-2,1), C=(3,1), D=(2,2).\n\nCheck orientations.\n\no1 = orientation(A,B,C) = ?\n\nval = (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x = -2 - 0 = -2.\n\nC.y - A.y = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nB.y - A.y = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nC.x - A.x = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\nval = (-2)*1 - 1*3 = -2 -3 = -5. So orientation is 2.\n\no2 = orientation(A,B,D). D is (2,2).\n\nval = (-2)*(2-0) - (1)*(2-0) ?\n\nWait, no. The formula is (B.x - A.x) * (D.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (D.x - A.x).\n\nSo:\n\nB.x - A.x = -2, D.y - A.y = 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nB.y - A.y = 1, D.x - A.x = 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nval = (-2)*2 - 1*2 = -4 -2 = -6. So orientation is 2. o1 and o2 are same. So no intersection.\n\nThen o3 and o4 for segment CD and points A and B.\n\nSegment CD is from C=(3,1) to D=(2,2).\n\nCheck orientation(C, D, A) and orientation(C, D, B).\n\nFor orientation(C, D, A):\n\nval = (D.x - C.x) * (A.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y) * (A.x - C.x)\n\nD.x - C.x = 2-3 = -1.\n\nA.y - C.y = 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nD.y - C.y = 2-1 = 1.\n\nA.x - C.x = 0 -3 = -3.\n\nval = (-1) * (-1) - 1 * (-3) = 1 +3 = 4. So orientation is 1.\n\norientation(C, D, B) is:\n\nB is (-2,1). So:\n\nval = (D.x - C.x) * (B.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y) * (B.x - C.x)\n\nD.x - C.x = -1.\n\nB.y - C.y = 1-1=0.\n\nD.y - C.y = 1.\n\nB.x - C.x = -2 -3 = -5.\n\nval = (-1)*0 -1*(-5) = 0 +5 =5. So orientation is 1.\n\nSo o3 and o4 are same (both 1). Thus, segments_intersect returns False.\n\nSo this pair does not cross.\n\nThen check i=1, j=2. Segments (2,0) to (0,3) and (3,1) to (2,2). Do they cross?\n\nA=(2,0), B=(0,3), C=(3,1), D=(2,2).\n\nCheck orientation(A,B,C) and orientation(A,B,D).\n\nFor orientation(A,B,C):\n\nval = (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x = 0-2 = -2.\n\nC.y - A.y = 1-0 = 1.\n\nB.y - A.y = 3-0=3.\n\nC.x - A.x = 3-2 =1.\n\nval = (-2)*1 -3*1 = -2-3=-5. So orientation is 2.\n\norientation(A,B,D): D is (2,2).\n\nval = (-2)*(2-0) -3*(2-2) = (-2)*2 -3*0 = -4. So orientation is 2. Same as before. So o1=o2, so no intersection.\n\nSo the code returns True for this permutation. Hence, the code outputs 'Yes'.\n\nSo the code works for the first sample.\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n2 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. So R != B, output 'No'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2, with the two spaceships and two bases arranged in a way that there's a valid permutation.\n\nBut what about if the two possible permutations both have crossing segments?\n\nFor example, spaceships are (0,0) and (2,2). Bases are (0,2) and (2,0). So the two possible permutations are [0,1] and [1,0].\n\nIn permutation [0,1], the segments are (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These are vertical lines, no intersection. So valid. So output is Yes.\n\nBut if the code checks this, it would return Yes.\n\nAnother case: R=2, B=2. Spaceships (0,0), (1,1). Bases (1,0), (0,1). Permutation [0,1] connects (0,0)-(1,0) and (1,1)-(0,1). These two segments cross. Permutation [1,0] connects (0,0)-(0,1) and (1,1)-(1,0). These are vertical lines, no cross. So code would find that permutation [1,0] is valid, and output Yes.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple permutations and some are valid?\n\nThe code returns as soon as it finds one valid permutation.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling of permutations. For example, when R=B=0? But the constraints say 1<= R, B <=10. So no.\n\n- The code uses permutations(range(B)), which is correct since B=R.\n\nAnother possible issue: in the code, for the permutation, the bases are accessed via perm[i], which is correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake: in the code, when reading the input, the code reads R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nSo the final code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting line segments intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments and verifying if any permutation results in non-intersecting line segments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Check**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If not, output \"No\".\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each possible permutation of the bases, generate a potential assignment of spaceships to bases.\n3. **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation, check if any pair of line segments (connecting a spaceship to its assigned base) intersect using computational geometry principles.\n4. **Orientation Calculation**: Use the cross product to determine the orientation of three points, which helps in checking if two line segments intersect.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        spaceships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    for perm in permutations(range(B)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                A = spaceships[i]\n                B_point = bases[perm[i]]\n                C = spaceships[j]\n                D_point = bases[perm[j]]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B_point, C, D_point):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Orientation Function**: This function calculates the orientation of three points using the cross product. It helps determine if points are clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear.\n2. **Segments Intersection Check**: Using the orientation values, this function checks if two line segments intersect by ensuring that the orientations of the endpoints of one segment relative to the other segment differ.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The code generates all permutations of base indices and checks each permutation for intersecting segments. If any permutation is found where no segments intersect, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible assignments efficiently given the constraints, leveraging permutations and geometric properties to validate each potential solution.",
