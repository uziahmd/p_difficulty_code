Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of the current string S after each modification. The catch is that some Morse code strings are invalid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the Morse code mappings work. Each valid Morse code string is of length 1-4, made up of 0s and 1s, except for four specific ones. So for any substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of those four), it contributes to the count. But the count isn't just the number of valid substrings; it's the number of sequences of letters. For example, if there's a substring \"11\" which is valid, that's one letter. But if there's another substring \"1\" (which is also valid), then each occurrence contributes. However, sequences like \"11\" can be part of longer sequences. Wait, but the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So each valid substring corresponds to exactly one letter, and the sequences are all possible concatenations of these letters. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the sequences are sequences of letters, each of which is represented by a substring of S. But the way the question is phrased, perhaps each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting a substring of S into valid Morse codes. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings could be:\n\n- \"1\" (valid) → one letter.\n- \"11\" (valid) → one letter.\n- \"111\" (valid) → one letter.\n- Also, the substring \"11\" can be split as two \"1\"s, leading to a sequence of two letters. But wait, how does that count?\n\nWait, the problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. Oh, right! So each such sequence is formed by taking a substring of S and parsing it into Morse code letters. But each such parsing would correspond to a sequence of letters. However, the same substring can be parsed in different ways. For example, if the substring is \"111\", it can be parsed as \"1\" + \"11\", \"11\" + \"1\", or \"111\" — three different sequences. Therefore, for each substring of S, we need to count the number of ways to split it into valid Morse code letters. Then sum all those counts over all possible substrings of S.\n\nBut the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each such sequence is a unique sequence of letters, and each occurrence of a substring that can be split in multiple ways counts as multiple sequences. For example, the substring \"111\" would contribute 3 sequences (as above). So the total answer is the sum over all possible substrings of S of the number of valid splits of that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nSo the challenge is, after each character is added to S, compute this total.\n\nNow, how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's consider that for each position in the string S, we track the number of ways to split the substring ending at that position into valid Morse code letters. Then, for each new character added, we can update this DP accordingly.\n\nLet me think of the DP approach. Suppose dp[i] represents the number of valid sequences for the first i characters of S. Then, when adding a new character, we can look back up to 4 steps (since Morse code letters are of length 1-4). For each possible length l (1-4), if the substring ending at i with length l is valid, then we can add dp[i - l] to dp[i]. However, we need to make sure that the substring is valid. Also, for the initial case, dp[0] = 1 (empty string, which is needed for the recurrence).\n\nWait, but the problem requires considering all substrings. Wait, no. Because the DP approach here counts the number of ways to split the entire string up to position i into valid Morse code letters. But the problem is not about splitting the entire string, but all possible substrings. So perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to consider for each position i, and for each possible length of the current Morse code string ending at i, how many sequences can be formed. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. The total number of sequences is the sum over all substrings of S of the number of valid splits of that substring into Morse code letters.\n\nFor example, if S is \"111\", the substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` after each modification. The Morse code representations of these letters are valid strings of length 1-4 composed of '0's and '1's, except for four specific invalid strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string `S`.\n2. **Valid Morse Code Check**: Maintain a set of invalid Morse code strings to quickly check if a substring is valid.\n3. **Efficient Updates**: For each new character added to `S`, update the DP array by considering all possible valid Morse code substrings ending at the current position. This involves checking substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at the current position and summing up valid contributions from previous DP states.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the numbers can be very large, use modulo $10^9 + 7$ to keep values within bounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    operations = input[1:]\n    \n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    S = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # empty string\n    \n    total = 0\n    result = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        S.append(operations[i - 1])\n        current_len = i\n        current_sum = 0\n        \n        # Check all possible lengths 1 to 4\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i - l < 0:\n                continue\n            substring = ''.join(S[i - l:i])\n            if substring in invalid:\n                continue\n            current_sum += dp[i - l]\n        \n        dp[i] = current_sum % MOD\n        total = (total + current_sum) % MOD\n        result.append(str(total))\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string `S`. This helps in efficiently computing the number of valid sequences as the string grows.\n- **Invalid Morse Codes**: A set of invalid Morse code strings is used for quick lookup to determine if a substring is valid.\n- **Updating DP Array**: For each new character added to `S`, we check substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at the current position. If a substring is valid, we add the number of valid sequences from the DP state before the start of this substring.\n- **Modulo Operation**: Ensures that the numbers remain manageable and prevents overflow by taking results modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required counts after each modification to the string `S`, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of 3000 operations.",
