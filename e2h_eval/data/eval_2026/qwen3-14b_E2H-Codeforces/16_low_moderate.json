Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how? Since each road is a line, the blocks are regions divided by these lines. The key here is that two blocks are adjacent if their common border is a segment of a road (so they share a part of a line). But how do I represent this in code?\n\nWait, but maybe instead of considering all possible blocks, which could be infinite, I can model the problem using a graph where each node represents a region (block) and edges represent adjacency. However, since there are infinitely many blocks, that approach isn't feasible directly.\n\nBut wait, here's an insight: The home and university are points not on any road. So, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between two regions (the ones containing home and university) where each step moves across a road. So perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node is a region, but since we can't track all regions, we need another way.\n\nAnother approach: think about the regions as being determined by the signs of the inequalities for each road. For example, each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The position of a point relative to a road can be determined by the sign of a_i x + b_i y + c_i. So, for each road, a point is on one side or the other. The combination of all these signs defines the region (block) that the point is in.\n\nNow, the key idea is that two regions are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road's sign. Because if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they share a common boundary (that road), hence they are adjacent. However, if they differ in more than one road's sign, then they are not adjacent (since moving across one road can only change one sign).\n\nWait, is that correct? Suppose you have two regions that differ in exactly one road. Then, they are separated by that road. So their common border is a segment of that road, which is non-zero length. Therefore, those two regions are adjacent. Conversely, if two regions share a common border, they must differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if they differ in more than one road's sign, then their boundaries would be different roads, but their intersection would be a single point (if two lines cross), which doesn't have a non-zero length segment.\n\nSo the adjacency between regions is equivalent to differing in exactly one road's sign. Therefore, the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a state represented by the signs of the equations for each road. But since there are n roads, the number of possible states is 2^n, which is way too big when n is 300. Wait, but n is up to 300, so 2^300 is impossible. That approach is not feasible.\n\nSo, how else can we model this? Well, the problem requires us to find the minimal steps between two regions. But since each step changes exactly one sign (crossing a road), perhaps we can model this as a BFS problem where each state is the set of signs for each road. However, with n=300, that's impossible because the state space is 2^300, which is way too big.\n\nBut wait, the actual problem is that the home and university are specific points. So, perhaps we can model the problem as a BFS where each node is the current position's sign configuration. However, even that seems impossible for n=300. So, there's a smarter way here.\n\nAlternative idea: The minimal steps between the home and university regions is equal to the minimal number of roads that separate them. Because each step crosses a road, so the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to get from the home region to the university region.\n\nBut how to compute that? Let me think. Let's consider that the home region is defined by a set of signs (for each road, whether the home point is on one side or the other). Similarly for the university. The difference between the two sets of signs is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. Let me call this the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. However, since each step can flip exactly one sign (by crossing a road), the minimal steps required would be the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides, divided by something? Or perhaps the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points, divided by something?\n\nWait, no. Suppose that the home and university are separated by k roads. Then, the minimal steps would be k, but only",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Regions**: The plane is divided into regions (blocks) by the given roads. Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. A point's position relative to each road can be determined by evaluating the sign of the linear equation defining the road.\n2. **Sign Configuration**: For both the home and university points, we determine their sign configuration relative to each road. This configuration helps identify which region (block) they belong to.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimal number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between the sign configurations of the home and university points. This is because each step involves crossing a road, which changes the sign for exactly one road.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n            idx += 1\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    def get_signs(x, y):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n        return signs\n    \n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1)\n    univ_signs = get_signs(x2, y2)\n    \n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, univ_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n    \n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home and university points, along with the equations of the roads.\n2. **Sign Calculation**: For each point (home and university), we calculate the sign of the value obtained by substituting the point into each road's equation. This gives us a sign configuration for each point.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The Hamming distance between the sign configurations of the home and university points is computed. This distance represents the minimum number of roads that need to be crossed to move from the home block to the university block, as each step corresponds to crossing a road (changing the sign for that road).\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps required using the Hamming distance, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
