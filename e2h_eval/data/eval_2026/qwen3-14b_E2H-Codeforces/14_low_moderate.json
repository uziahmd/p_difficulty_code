He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nWait, the key here is to find the possible n's such that when you compute the trailing zeros function (let's call it f(n)), it equals m. But how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the range of n's that could possibly have exactly m trailing zeros. Let's think about the function f(n). It's a non-decreasing function. As n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for example, when n increases by 1, sometimes f(n) increases by 1 (if the new n is a multiple of 5), or maybe more if it's a multiple of higher powers of 5.\n\nSo for a given m, there might be a range of n's where f(n) = m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I can find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count. But wait, since f(n) can jump by more than 1 when n crosses a multiple of higher powers of 5. For example, when n is 25, f(25) = 6 (since 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). But f(24) is 4 + 0 = 4. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps by 2. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros? Wait, but that's not possible. Let me check:\n\nWait, for n=24: 24/5 =4.8 → floor is 4, 24/25 is 0. So total is 4. For n=25, it's 5 + 1 =6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Therefore, the answer for m=5 would be zero. But how do I find that?\n\nSo the approach is: for a given m, find if there exists n such that f(n) = m. If yes, then find all such n's. But how?\n\nThe first step is to find the possible n's where f(n) equals m. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, the values of n that satisfy f(n)=m must form a contiguous range. However, sometimes there may be no such n. For example, when m is between two jumps.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the lower and upper bounds of n where f(n) equals m. But how?\n\nLet me think about binary search. For example, for a given m, we can find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest and largest n where f(n) equals m.\n\nWait, but how to find the possible range of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that for some n, f(n) = m. Then, the next number n+1 will have f(n+1) = m or m+1. Because adding 1 to n may add another multiple of 5, but only if n+1 is divisible by 5.\n\nSo the number of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros can be determined by finding the first occurrence where f(n) = m, and then checking how many consecutive numbers after that have the same value until the next increase.\n\nBut how to find this first occurrence?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal n such that f(n) = m, and the maximal n such that f(n) = m. Then, the count is max_n - min_n + 1. But how to find these?\n\nBut how do we find if there exists any n with f(n) = m?\n\nLet me",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The key insight is that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ can be calculated using the formula $ f(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots $ until the division results in zero.\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Use binary search to find the smallest and largest values of $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the range of possible $ n $ values.\n3. **Check Validity**: If no such $ n $ exists for the given $ m $, the result will be zero. Otherwise, compute the range of valid $ n $ values and output them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) <= m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low - 1\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_trailing_zeros(min_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    max_n = find_max_n(m)\n    result = []\n    for n in range(min_n, max_n + 1):\n        result.append(str(n))\n    print(len(result))\n    print(' '.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Count Trailing Zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing the integer divisions of $ n $ by increasing powers of 5.\n2. **Binary Search for Minimum $ n $**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros is at least $ m $.\n3. **Binary Search for Maximum $ n $**: This function similarly finds the largest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly $ m $.\n4. **Main Function**: Reads input, determines the valid range of $ n $ values, and prints the results. If no valid $ n $ is found, it prints 0.\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency by leveraging binary search to quickly narrow down potential values of $ n $, making the solution suitable even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
