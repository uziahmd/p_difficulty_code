He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where this count equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let me check why. For 5! it's 120 (one zero), and each subsequent number up to 9 adds more factors but not enough to increase the zero count. Wait, but 10! would add another 5 (from 10), so the count would be 2. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers.\n\nBut how do I find the range of n's that give exactly m zeros?\n\nThe approach I think is to first find the possible n's that would result in exactly m zeros. But how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimum n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are other numbers after that which also give the same count.\n\nBut how to find that? Maybe using binary search. Because the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. So for a given m, there's a range of n's where the count is exactly m.\n\nWait, but the count is non-decreasing. So for example, when you reach a multiple of 5, the count increases. So for example, the count for 5 is 1, for 6 it's still 1, until 10, which gives 2.\n\nSo for a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, in the sample, there are 5 numbers. How does that happen?\n\nLet me think. Let's say for m=1, the minimum n is 5, and the maximum n is 9. Because when n=10, the count becomes 2. So the numbers from 5 to 9 inclusive all have exactly 1 trailing zero. That's 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that for each m, there is a range of n's where the count is exactly m. But how to find that range?\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is equal to m.\n\n2. Find the largest n such that the number of trailing zeros is equal to m.\n\nIf there is no such n (like when m is 0, but according to the input constraints m starts at 1), then output 0.\n\nBut how to find these numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, why 5? Because when you have a number like 5, adding numbers up to 9 (which is 5+4) gives the same count. But maybe for some m, there's no solution. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Let me check.\n\nWait, let's compute for n=25: the count is 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. So for m=5, what's the possible n? Let's see:\n\nLooking for n where count_zeros(n) = 5.\n\nLet me check n=24: 24//5 is 4, 24//25 is 0. Total 4. So not enough.\n\nn=25 gives 6. So between 24 and 25, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So there's no n where count is 5. Therefore, for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nSo this shows that for some m, there are no n's. Hence, the problem requires checking whether such n exists.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor a given m, find the lower and upper bounds of n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about binary search. Let's first find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m",
    "response": "To solve the problem of finding how many positive integers `n` have exactly `m` trailing zeros in their factorial (`n!`), we need to understand the behavior of trailing zeros in factorials.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis count increases as `n` increases, but **not monotonically**. For example, between `n = 5` and `n = 9`, the count remains at 1. But at `n = 10`, it jumps to 2.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\nWe can use **binary search** to efficiently find the smallest and largest `n` that result in exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n\n- First, find the **smallest** `n` such that `count_zeros(n) >= m`.\n- Then, check if this value actually gives exactly `m` zeros.\n- If not, then there are **no** such values of `n`.\n- Otherwise, find the **largest** `n` that gives exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n- The range of `n` values that satisfy the condition is from the smallest to the largest.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- We define a helper function `count_zeros(n)` to compute the number of trailing zeros in `n!`.\n- Use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds for `n`.\n- Once the range is identified, collect all `n` values in that range.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) == m\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    left = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt >= m:\n            high = mid - 1\n            if cnt == m:\n                left = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    if left == -1:\n        return []\n\n    # Find the largest n where count_zeros(n) == m\n    low = left\n    high = 5 * m\n    right = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cnt = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cnt == m:\n            right = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        elif cnt < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    return list(range(left, right + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input)\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(result))\n    if len(result) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\nFor input `1`, the output is:\n\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nFor input `5`, the output is:\n\n```\n0\n```\n\nBecause no `n!` has exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- The `count_zeros(n)` function runs in O(log n) time.\n- Each binary search runs in O(log n) time.\n- Therefore, the overall complexity is O(log n) per query, which is efficient even for large inputs up to 100,000.",
