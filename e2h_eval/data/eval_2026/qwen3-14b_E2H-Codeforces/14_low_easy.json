He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how to find them?\n\nWait, the key here is that the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. However, when you pass a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1, but sometimes more (like when passing 25, which adds two 5s). So for example, when n increases from 4 to 5, the count jumps from 0 to 1. But when n increases from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s).\n\nBut for the problem, we need to find all n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. Let's think about how the count of trailing zeros changes with n. For each n, the count is non-decreasing. So for a given m, there might be a range of n's that give exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think of the approach. Let's first find the minimal n where the count is exactly m. Then check if there are other numbers after that which also have the same count.\n\nWait, but how do I find the possible n's?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's lie in a certain range. For example, suppose that for some n, the count of trailing zeros is m. Then, the next number (n+1) may have the same count or higher. So, the numbers that have exactly m trailing zeros would form a contiguous range. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think.\n\nFor example, take m=1. The numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all have exactly one trailing zero. Because 5! is 120, 6! is 720, etc. But when n reaches 10, the count becomes 2 (since 10/5=2, plus 10/25=0, total 2). So the numbers 5-9 are the ones with exactly 1 zero. So that's a range of 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=2. Let's see. For n=10, the count is 2. Then 11, 12, 13, 14, 15? Wait, 15's count is 3 (floor(15/5)=3, floor(15/25)=0). So for n=10, 11, 12, 13, 14, the count is 2. So that's 5 numbers again. But wait, 10 is the first number with count 2, and then up to 14, then 15 jumps to 3. So the numbers are 10-14, which is 5 numbers.\n\nWait, but what about when there's a jump of more than 1? Like when m is 5. Let's think. Let's say n=25. The count is floor(25/5) + floor(25/25) = 5 + 1 = 6. So when n=24, the count is floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 =4. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps by 2. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Because between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there are no solutions. Therefore, the answer would be 0.\n\nSo this suggests that for some m, there are no n's. For example, m=5 in this case.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how to find them?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the count of trailing zeros is m. Then check if there exists such an n. If not",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. Additionally, we must list these integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   until the division results in zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Range**: For a given $ m $, we use binary search to find the smallest and largest $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly $ m $. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the range of possible values for $ n $.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: If no valid $ n $ exists for the given $ m $, the result is zero. Otherwise, all integers within the found range are valid solutions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low if count_zeros(low) == m else -1\n\ndef find_max_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid\n    return low if count_zeros(low) == m else -1\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    min_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if min_n == -1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    max_n = find_max_n(m)\n    if max_n == -1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    k = max_n - min_n + 1\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(min_n, max_n + 1))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing up the integer divisions of $ n $ by powers of 5.\n\n2. **find_min_n(m)**: Uses binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly $ m $.\n\n3. **find_max_n(m)**: Uses binary search to find the largest $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly $ m $.\n\n4. **main()**: Reads the input value $ m $, determines the valid range of $ n $ values using the above helper functions, and prints the results. If no valid $ n $ is found, it prints 0.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $.",
