He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the main idea is: for a given m, find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how do we find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5! it's 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1 zero), etc. So all those numbers have exactly 1 trailing zero. But why is there 5 numbers here? Because when you reach 10, the count increases to 2. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So the numbers are 5-9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the approach would be to find the possible n's that result in exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how do we find them?\n\nFirst, we need to find the possible range of n's that could give exactly m zeros. Let's think about the function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. So for each m, there might be a range of n's that give exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find the starting and ending points of that range?\n\nWait, for example, for m=1, the starting n is 5, and the ending is 9. Then for m=2, it's 10-14? Wait, 10! has 2 zeros (from 5 and 10). Let me check:\n\nFor 10: floor(10/5) = 2, floor(10/25)=0. Total 2. So yes. Then 11! would also have 2 zeros. Up to 14. Then 15! would have 3 zeros (since 15/5=3, 15/25=0, total 3). So for m=2, the numbers are 10,11,12,13,14. So five numbers again. So perhaps for some m, there are 5 numbers, but maybe sometimes there are none?\n\nWait, but how do we find if there exists any n that gives exactly m zeros?\n\nThe first thing is to find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count.\n\nBut how do we find that?\n\nLet me think of binary search. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, we can find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count. However, there's a possibility that no n exists for a given m. For example, if m is 5, but maybe there's a jump from 4 to 6? Let's think.\n\nWait, let's take m=5. Let's see:\n\nFor n=24: floor(24/5) = 4, floor(24/25) = 0. Total 4. For n=25: floor(25/5)=5, floor(25/25)=1. Total 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there is no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer would be 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists n such that f(n) = m. And if so, how many such n's are there.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Find the minimal n where f(n) = m+1. Let's call this high.\n\n3. Then the numbers between low and high-1 would be the numbers that have exactly m zeros. So the count is high - low.\n\nBut wait, how do we find low and high?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower bound and upper bound of n's that produce exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. For example, for m=1:\n\nFind the smallest n where f",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many positive integers $ n $ exist such that $ n! $ (n factorial) ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If such integers exist, we must also list them in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n- **Trailing Zeros in Factorial**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This can be calculated using the formula:\n  $$\n  \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n  $$\n  until the division results in zero.\n\n- **Non-decreasing Property**: As $ n $ increases, the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is non-decreasing. So for any given $ m $, there may be a range of values of $ n $ that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n- **Finding Range**: For a given $ m $, we can find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = m $ and the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = m+1 $. The values between these two bounds will all have exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search for Bounds**:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = m $.\n   - Use binary search again to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = m+1 $.\n   - The number of valid $ n $ values is the difference between these two bounds.\n\n2. **Edge Case Handling**:\n   - If no such $ n $ exists (e.g., when $ m $ lies between jumps in trailing zero counts), then the result is 0.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if m == 0:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the first n where count is m\n    lower = find_min_n(m)\n    # Find the first n where count is m+1\n    upper = find_min_n(m + 1)\n\n    # Check if lower is valid\n    if count_trailing_zeros(lower) != m:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n\n    # The valid numbers are from lower to upper - 1\n    k = upper - lower\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower, upper))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Execution\n\n- **Input**: `1`\n- **Output**:\n  ```\n  5\n  5 6 7 8 9\n  ```\n\n- **Input**: `5`\n- **Output**:\n  ```\n  0\n  ```\n\nThis solution efficiently finds all possible values of $ n $ that satisfy the condition using binary search and handles edge cases such as when no valid $ n $ exists.",
