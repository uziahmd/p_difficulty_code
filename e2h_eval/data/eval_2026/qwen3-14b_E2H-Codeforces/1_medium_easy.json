    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So for example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The second ring would be the perimeter of a rectangle that's 2 cells in each direction smaller. Because for each ring, you subtract 2 from each side, so total of 4*(i-1) from the original dimensions.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), but wait, the perimeter formula for a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4, because each side is counted once. Wait, no. Wait, the perimeter in terms of cells: for a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*W + 2*H - 4. Because the four corners are counted twice if you just do 2*(W + H), so subtracting 4. For example, a 3x3 rectangle has perimeter 3*2 + 3*2 -4 = 6+6-4=8, which matches the first example input where output is 8.\n\nYes, so for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(current_width + current_height) - 4. But wait, the current_width and current_height are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1))? Or wait, for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Let me check the example.\n\nTake the first example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8, which matches the output.\n\nAnother example is the third input: 7 9 2. Let's see. For i=1, the rectangle is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Then for i=2, the rectangle is 7 - 4*(1) = 3, and 9 -4*(1) =5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Total is 28+12=40, which matches the sample output. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is to loop from i=1 to k, compute for each i the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), then sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a possible problem here. What if the dimensions become invalid? For example, if the w or h becomes less than 3? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. For that case, when i=1, the dimensions are w and h, which are at least 3. For i=2, the dimensions would be w-4*(1) = 3-4 = -1? But that's impossible. However, the input constraints ensure that k is such that for all i up to k, the dimensions are valid. Because the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me think: for example, if min(w, h) is m. Then the maximum possible k is floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's see for m=3, (3+1)/4=1, so k can be 1. For m=5, (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor is 1. So for k=1, the first ring is okay. For m=7, (7+1)/4=2, so k can be 2. Then for i=2, the dimensions would be m-4*(i-1) = 7-4*(1) = 3, which is okay. So the constraints ensure that for each i up to k, the dimensions are at least 3. So we don't have to worry about invalid dimensions.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nadd perimeter to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nSo the code would read w, h, k from input, then compute this sum.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example: 3 3 1 → 2*(3+3)-4 = 8 → correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4= 32-4=28 → correct.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5) -4 = 28 + 12 → 40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose w=5, h=5, k=2. Then for i=1, current_w=5, current_h=5 → perimeter 2*(5+5) -4= 16. For i=2, current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. Wait, but that would be 1x1. Then perimeter would be 2*(1+1) -4 = 4-4=0. But that's not possible. But according to the input constraints, k is floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For min(w,h)=5, (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code can proceed as described.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nRead input line as three integers. Then compute the sum.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h is less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. So the code is safe.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + (3+5)*2 -4 → 28 + 16-4 = 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's take w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5) -4 = 16. So output is 16.\n\nAnother test case: w=7, h=7, k=2. For i=1: 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7) -4 = 24. For i=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4= 8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nYes. So code works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it forms a border around an inner rectangle, starting from the edge and moving inward with each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that is progressively smaller. The first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle, the second ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that is 2 cells smaller in each dimension, and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle is calculated using the formula: `2 * (width + height) - 4`. This formula accounts for the four corners being counted twice when summing the sides.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We iterate through each ring from 1 to k, adjusting the dimensions of the rectangle for each subsequent ring and summing their perimeters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The dimensions of the plate (width `w`, height `h`) and the number of rings `k` are read from the input.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the adjusted width and height of the rectangle considering the inward shift of the ring.\n- **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, calculate its perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n- **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their respective perimeters, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
