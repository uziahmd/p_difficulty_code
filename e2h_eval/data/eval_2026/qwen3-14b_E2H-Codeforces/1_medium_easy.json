    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of gilded cells for each ring. The problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do I find the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm. Oh right, the perimeter of a rectangle. But wait, the perimeter formula for a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4, because each corner is counted twice if you just do 2*(w + h). Wait, no. Let me think. For a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the perimeter would be 2*m + 2*(n-2). Because the top and bottom rows have n cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (m-2) each. So total is 2*n + 2*(m-2) = 2*(n + m - 2). Alternatively, 2*(m + n) - 4. Yeah, same thing.\n\nSo for each ring i, the dimensions are (current_w, current_h) where current_w = w - 4*(i-1), current_h = h - 4*(i-1). Then the perimeter is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). But wait, wait. Wait, the perimeter formula for the rectangle. Let me check with example.\n\nTake the first example input: 3 3 1. So the first ring is the outermost. The rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter would be 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first sample output. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo for each ring, compute that perimeter. Then sum all perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each subsequent ring, the dimensions decrease by 4 each time. But wait, for the next ring, it's 2 cells away from the edge. So the first ring is the outermost, then the next is 2 cells in, which would be a rectangle of (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), where i starts at 1. So for i=1, it's original dimensions. For i=2, subtract 4 from each dimension. But wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for example, the second ring is the border of a rectangle that's 4 less in each dimension than the original. So for the second ring, the current_w is w-4*(2-1) = w-4, and same for h.\n\nBut we need to make sure that for each i, the current_w and current_h are at least 1. Because if the dimensions become zero or negative, that's invalid. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be up to 1. So for each i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h will be at least 3 - 4*(i-1) ?\n\nWait, let's take for example when i is 1, current_w is w, current_h is h. For i=2, current_w is w-4, current_h h-4. But for that to be valid, w-4 must be >= 3? Or maybe not. Because the problem says that the rings are added as long as possible. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. So the code doesn't have to check for that. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nAdd this perimeter to total.\n\nBut wait, wait. Let me check the second example. Input is 7 9 2. Output is 40.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nFirst ring: current_w =7, current_h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Second ring: i=2, current_w =7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2)= 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample. So yes.\n\nAnother sample: input 7 9 1 gives 28. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: input 3 3 1 gives 8, which matches.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to loop from 1 to k, compute for each i, the perimeter of the current rectangle, sum all those.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So for example, the minimum between w and h is at least 3. Let's see for the maximum possible k. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then k can be 1. For i=1, current_w is 3, current_h is h (which is >=3). So the perimeter is 2*(3 + h - 2) = 2*(h+1). Which is okay.\n\nBut when i increases, say for k=2, but min(w, h) is 3. Then for i=2, current_w is 3-4*(1) = -1. Which is invalid. But according to the input constraints, k is floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see for min(w, h) = 3, (3+1)/4 = 1, so floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as above.\n\nNow, let's test with the third sample input: 7 9 2. Which gives 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be 16. If k=2, then current_w =5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. Perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, that's a problem. But according to the input constraints, for k to be allowed, min(w, h) is 5. So (5 +1)/4 = 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo now, the Python code can be written as:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. Split into integers.\n\nCompute the sum as described.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into three integers.\n\nThen loop for each i from 1 to k, compute current_w and current_h, then perimeter, add to total.\n\nThen print total.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's check for when the current_w or current_h is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So for example, if min(w, h) is 5, then for k=1, the first ring is 5x5. For k=2, the min would be 5-4*(2-1) = 1. But the input constraints say that k is floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). For min(w, h) =5, (5+1)/4 = 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nTherefore, this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1 → 2*(3+3-2) = 8 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28 → correct.\n\nThird sample input: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40 → correct.\n\nYes. So the code should work.\n",
