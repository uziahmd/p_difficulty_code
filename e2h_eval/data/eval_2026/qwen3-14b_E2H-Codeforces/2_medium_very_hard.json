Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grid is n x n where n is odd. The diagonals are the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). All cells in these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check if all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check if all elements not on either diagonal are the same and not equal to 'd'.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, I need to iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, determine if it's on either of the two diagonals.\n\nFor a cell at (i, j) (assuming 0-based indices), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, check if it's on either of those.\n\nSo for all cells in the grid:\n\n- If it's on a diagonal, check that it's equal to the diagonal's character (which should be same for both diagonals).\n- Else, check that it's equal to the non-diagonal character, which is different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to get the diagonal's character? Well, the first diagonal's character can be taken from (0,0), but we need to check that all elements in both diagonals are same as that.\n\nWait, but maybe the two diagonals have different characters? No, according to the problem statement, both diagonals must have the same letters. So the first step is to check that all elements in both diagonals are same. So, for example, take the first element of the main diagonal (0,0) as the reference. Then check that all elements in the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are equal to this reference.\n\nBut wait, what if the anti-diagonal has a different character than the main diagonal? Then the answer is NO.\n\nSo first, collect all the elements on the diagonals and check that they are all the same. Then check that all non-diagonal elements are same and different.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Collect all the diagonal elements (both diagonals) into a set. If the size of this set is not 1, then return NO.\n\nWait, but the two diagonals may have overlapping elements. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when collecting all the elements from both diagonals, we need to make sure that each element is checked once. But even if there's overlap, the set will have the same value. So for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is also all 'x', then the set will have size 1. So that's correct.\n\nBut perhaps I should collect all the elements from both diagonals, check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal elements, check that they are all same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Iterate over each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it's on either diagonal. If yes, add to diagonal_chars. Else, add to non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut wait, for the first step, perhaps we can check that all the diagonal elements are same. How?\n\nLet me think. For each cell on the diagonals, check if they are equal to the first diagonal element (for example, the top-left corner). If any is different, then return NO.\n\nBut what if the first diagonal element is part of the anti-diagonal? Like in the case of n=3, the center cell is part of both. So for example, if the first cell (0,0) is 'a', and the anti-diagonal's first cell (0,2) is 'a', then the rest of the diagonals must be 'a'.\n\nBut perhaps the way to do this is:\n\nTake the first diagonal element (say, (0,0)), and check that all elements on both diagonals are equal to it. Because if the two diagonals have different characters, then this check would fail.\n\nSo let's proceed:\n\n- Get the first diagonal character (d_char) from (0,0).\n\nThen, for every cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nif (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n\n   if cell is not equal to d_char → return NO\n\nElse:\n\n   check if the cell is equal to the non_diagonal_char. But what is non_diagonal_char?\n\nWait, but the non-diagonal cells must all be same. So we need to collect all non-diagonal cells and check that they are all same and different from d_char.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nCollect all non-diagonal cells into a list. Check that all are same. Also, check that this value is different from d_char.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCheck that all diagonal cells are same (d_char).\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal cells are same (let's call it nd_char).\n\nCheck that d_char != nd_char.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal cells? For each cell not on the diagonals, collect their values. Then check that all are same.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nRead the grid as a list of lists.\n\nn = input integer.\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if (i == j) or (i + j == n - 1):\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                return NO\n\n        else:\n\n            add to non_diagonal list.\n\nOnce that's done, check that all elements in non_diagonal list are same. Also, check that this value is different from d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal elements? Well, since n is at least 3. For example, n=3, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So the non-diagonal elements are the other 8-1= 8- (number of diagonal elements). Wait, for n=3, the number of diagonal elements is 3 (main) + 3 (anti) -1 (overlap) = 5. So non-diagonal elements are 9-5=4. Which is 4 elements. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal elements.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nOnce we collect all non-diagonal elements, check if they are all same. Also, check that they are different from d_char.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal list is empty? Well, since n is odd and >=3. For n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal elements. For n=5, the number of diagonal elements is 5 + 5 -1 = 9. Total cells 25. Non-diagonal is 16. So no problem.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. So grid is a list of lists.\n\nCheck for all cells in the diagonals:\n\nIf any cell in the diagonals is not equal to d_char (grid[0][0]), then return NO.\n\nThen collect all non-diagonal cells. Check that they are all same. Also, check that their value is different from d_char.\n\nBut how to check that all non-diagonal cells are same?\n\nTake the first non-diagonal cell's value (if any) as nd_char. Then check that all other non-diagonal cells are same as nd_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For example, n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So no problem.\n\nBut what if all cells are on diagonals? For example, n=1? But the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nAfter checking the diagonals, collect all non-diagonal cells.\n\nIf there are no non-diagonal cells (but n is 3?), no, for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So the code can proceed.\n\nNow, for the non-diagonal cells:\n\nIf the list is empty, then no. But that's impossible.\n\nElse, take the first element as nd_char. Then check all elements in the list are equal to nd_char.\n\nAlso, check that nd_char != d_char.\n\nIf all that is true, then output YES, else NO.\n\nSo let's code this.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase 1: All diagonals are same, but non-diagonal elements are same but same as diagonals. Then output is NO.\n\nCase 2: All diagonals are same, but non-diagonal elements are not same. Then output is NO.\n\nCase 3: All diagonals are same, non-diagonal elements are same and different. Then YES.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, read the input.\n\nBut the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nThe input is given as a list of inputs, like:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nOutput:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is read from stdin. So in the actual code, the input is read from stdin. However, in the sample input, the first line is the number of test cases? Or is each input line a separate test case?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's given as a list of multiple test cases. But in reality, the code needs to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input shows that the user provided three different test cases. But the actual problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo, for each test case, the input is n followed by n lines. But in the sample input, the user provided three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? But the original problem's input format is not clear. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows that the input is a list of multiple test cases. But that's probably because the sample input is presented as a list of test cases for the purpose of the example. But in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case per run.\n\nWait, but the sample input and output are given as lists. For example, the first input line is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', which is a single test case. Then the output is 'NO', etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again. The input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n ... etc. So the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nThis suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each with their own n and grid.\n\nBut the problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem.\" So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous. But looking at the sample input, the first line is the first test case, which is a string that starts with '5' followed by 5 lines. Then another test case with '3' etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of n followed by n lines.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the code would read from stdin. So perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases, each of which starts with n, then n lines. But how to know when to stop? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is given as multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process until EOF.\n\nBut the sample input shows that there are three test cases. So the code should process all test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n. So perhaps the problem is expecting that there is only one test case. But the sample shows multiple test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of strings, which probably represents that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, in the problem's actual input, the code is supposed to read from standard input. For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the input is given as multiple test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, the code should read until EOF. For example, in the sample input, each test case is given as a block. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the code should process each of these test cases, and output the corresponding result.\n\nBut how to read them in Python?\n\nThe code would need to read all lines from stdin. But for each test case, the first line is n, then n lines follow.\n\nSo the code can read all lines first, then process them in groups.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nWell, perhaps the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process them accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps the code can read the input as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. Then, process each test case by taking the first line as n, then the next n lines as the grid. Then, after processing, the next line is the next test case's n, and so on.\n\nBut in Python, the standard way is to read from stdin via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, perhaps the code can read all the input at once, split into tokens, and process accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem is miswritten, and the actual input is multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample output shows that there are multiple outputs, which implies that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back at the problem's input and output description:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n ... \n\nEach of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nSo, the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user provided multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case. But that's not possible. Because in the sample input, the output is given as a list of answers for each input.\n\nTherefore, I think that the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. But how?\n\nIn programming competitions, it's common that the input consists of multiple test cases. For example, the first line is the number of test cases T, then T test cases follow. However, the problem's input description does not mention this. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is given in a way that each test case is given as a separate input, and the code is supposed to read until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nIn Python, for example, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them as per test cases. For example, the code can read all lines into a list, then process them sequentially.\n\nLet me think of the sample input as a list of test cases. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the code needs to process each of these test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, if you read via input(), then for each test case, you read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut how to know when to stop? Well, the code can read until there is no more input.\n\nSo the code could be structured as:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen process the lines as per test cases.\n\nBut for each test case, the first line is n, then n lines follow.\n\nSo, the code can have a pointer i starting at 0. While i < len(lines):\n\n   Read n = int(lines[i])\n\n   i += 1\n\n   grid = []\n\n   for _ in range(n):\n\n       grid.append(lines[i])\n\n       i += 1\n\n   process grid and output result.\n\nSo, in this way, the code can handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement's input description says that the first line is n. So perhaps the problem expects that there is only one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that the user provides multiple test cases, and the code must process them all.\n\nBut the problem's original description may have been written in a way that the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a critical point. Because if the code is supposed to process a single test case, then the sample input is incorrect. But given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, I think the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem statement's input says that the first line is n. So perhaps the problem is in a format where there are multiple test cases, but the problem statement didn't mention that. However, the sample input shows that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases for the purpose of the example, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. However, in the sample input, the first line is the first test case's n, and then the next n lines. Then the next line is the next test case's n, etc.\n\nBut how to know? Well, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three results. So the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code structure in Python would be to read all lines, and process them as per test cases.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, the code must be written to read from standard input. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nSo now, the code structure:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each test case by reading n, then n lines.\n\nNow, for each test case, process the grid.\n\nSo, now, the code.\n\nNow, for each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each of length n.\n\nThen, process the grid as per the problem.\n\nNow, the code steps for each grid:\n\nCheck if all diagonal elements are same (d_char), and all non-diagonal elements are same (nd_char), and d_char != nd_char.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j):\n\nCheck if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1). If yes, then it is a diagonal cell.\n\nElse, non-diagonal.\n\nNow, for the diagonal cells, check that they are all same as d_char (which is grid[0][0]).\n\nBut what if grid[0][0] is not part of the anti-diagonal? For example, in n=5, grid[0][0] is part of the main diagonal. The anti-diagonal starts at (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). So the center cell (2,2) is part of both diagonals. So grid[0][0] is part of the main diagonal, but not the anti-diagonal. So the code checks all diagonal cells (both diagonals) to be same as grid[0][0].\n\nBut what if the anti-diagonal's first element (0, n-1) is different from grid[0][0]? Then the code will detect that.\n\nSo, code steps for checking diagonals:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n        if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n\n            if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                return 'NO'\n\nSo, if any of the diagonal cells is not equal to d_char, then return NO.\n\nOnce that is passed, collect all non-diagonal cells. Check that they are all same and different from d_char.\n\nSo, collect all non-diagonal cells into a list. Then check:\n\nif the list is empty → no (but n >=3, so not possible)\n\nelse:\n\nnd_char = first element of list.\n\nfor each element in list:\n\n    if element != nd_char → return NO\n\nif nd_char == d_char → return NO\n\nelse → return YES.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal cells?\n\nWe can loop through all cells, and for those not on the diagonals, collect their characters.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can check during the first loop.\n\nBut for code clarity, perhaps better to collect the non-diagonal chars.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(non_diagonal_chars) == 0 → impossible.\n\nElse:\n\nnd_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n\nfor c in non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    if c != nd_char:\n\n        return 'NO'\n\nif nd_char == d_char:\n\n    return 'NO'\n\nelse:\n\n    return 'YES'\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nBut what about the case where there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3 and odd. So no.\n\nNow, testing sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) is x, (1,1) is x, (2,2) is x, (3,3) is x, (4,4) is x → all x.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,4) is x, (1,3) is x, (2,2) is x, (3,1) is x, (4,0) is x → all x. So diagonals are okay.\n\nNow non-diagonal cells. For example, cell (0,1) is o. Let's see if all non-diagonal cells are same.\n\nBut looking at row 2, cell (2,0) is s. Which is not on the diagonal. So non-diagonal cells include s. So the non-diagonal chars are not all same. Hence, output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond test case:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) = w, (1,1) = w, (2,2) = w → all w.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,2) = w, (1,1) = w, (2,0) = w → all w. So diagonals are okay.\n\nNon-diagonal cells:\n\ncells (0,1) = s, (1,0) = s, (1,2) = s, (2,1) = s. All are s. And s != w. So output YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e. So the third cell is e, which is different from x. Hence, returns NO. So output is NO.\n\nWhich matches sample.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nNow, handling multiple test cases. So code steps:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each test case.\n\nNow, in Python, the code can read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut how to read lines properly? For example, sometimes, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n letters. So each line is exactly n characters.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n\n            idx += 1\n\n        # process grid\n\n        # check diagonals\n\n        d_char = grid[0][0]\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if (i == j) or (i + j == n - 1):\n\n                    if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                        valid = False\n\n                        break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        # collect non-diagonal chars\n\n        non_diagonal = []\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if (i == j) or (i + j == n - 1):\n\n                    continue\n\n                non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\n        # check non-diagonal\n\n        if len(non_diagonal) == 0:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        nd_char = non_diagonal[0]\n\n        for c in non_diagonal:\n\n            if c != nd_char:\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, in the code above, after checking the diagonals, we have to check the non-diagonal. So in code:\n\nBut in the code, after checking the diagonals, if valid is True, then proceed to check non-diagonal.\n\nBut in the code, after checking the diagonals, the code proceeds to collect non-diagonal chars, then check if they are all same and different from d_char.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal list is empty? Well, for n >=3, it's not possible. For example, n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 cells. The total is 9, so non-diagonal is 4 cells. So len(non_diagonal) is 4. So code can proceed.\n\nBut for n=1, which is not allowed, but the code is given n >=3.\n\nSo code is okay.\n\nBut in code, for the non-diagonal, if the list is empty, then print NO. But that's redundant. However, for the code, perhaps it's better to have that check.\n\nBut in practice, for n >=3, the non_diagonal list is not empty.\n\nNow, test case 2:\n\nSample input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=3.\n\ngrid is ['xpx', 'pxp', 'xpe']\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0] = 'x'\n\nCheck for all cells on diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0: x → ok.\n\ni=0, j=2 (since 0+2=2 = 3-1=2 → yes. grid[0][2] is 'x' → ok.\n\ni=1, j=1: 'x' → ok.\n\ni=2, j=0: 2+0=2 → yes. grid[2][0] is 'x' → ok.\n\ni=2, j=2: grid[2][2] is 'e' → which is not equal to d_char 'x'. So valid becomes false. So print NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input 2:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nd_char = 'w'.\n\nCheck all diagonal cells:\n\n(0,0) = 'w', (0,2) = 'w' (i=0, j=2: 0+2=2 = 3-1=2 → yes.\n\n(1,1) = 'w' → yes.\n\n(2,0) = 'w' → yes.\n\n(2,2) = 'w' → yes. So all diagonals are 'w'.\n\nThen collect non-diagonal cells:\n\ncells (0,1) = 's', (1,0) = 's', (1,2) = 's', (2,1) = 's'. All are 's'. So nd_char is 's' which is different from 'w'. So output YES.\n\nThus code works.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about cases where the non-diagonal is empty? Well, no. So code is okay.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are all 'a's. The non-diagonal cells are (0,1) = a, (1,0) = b, (1,2) = b, (2,1) = a. So non-diagonal chars are [a, b, b, a]. So not same → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\nbaa\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are all a. non-diagonal cells are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) a. So non-diagonal chars are [a, b, a, a]. Not same → output NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same but same as diagonal. For example, grid:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen diagonals are all a. non-diagonal cells are all a. So nd_char is a, same as d_char. So output NO.\n\nSo code returns NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same and different. For example, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nDiagonals: (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) a, (2,0) a, (2,2) a. All a. non-diagonal cells are (0,1) b, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) b. Wait, (1,2) is part of the anti-diagonal? For n=3, i=1, j=2: i + j = 3 → n-1 is 2. So 3 != 2. So (1,2) is not on the diagonal. So non-diagonal cells include (1,2). So in this case, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1) b, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) b. So not all same. So code returns NO.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that in the code, the grid is read as lines[idx], which is a string. So for grid[i][j], it's accessing the j-th character of the i-th line.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code above, when reading the lines, it's possible that the lines may have leading or trailing whitespace. However, the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the code uses line.strip() to remove leading/trailing whitespace. However, if the input lines have leading or trailing spaces, that would cause errors. But according to the problem statement, the input lines are correct. So using line.strip() is safe.\n\nBut for example, if a line is 'xooox\\n', then line.strip() becomes 'xooox', which is correct.\n\nSo code is okay.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, reading from stdin and printing to stdout.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nThe code is as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n\n            idx += 1\n\n        # Check diagonals\n\n        d_char = grid[0][0]\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if (i == j) or (i + j == n - 1):\n\n                    if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n\n                        valid = False\n\n                        break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        # Check non-diagonal\n\n        non_diagonal = []\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if (i == j) or (i + j == n - 1):\n\n                    continue\n\n                non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n\n        if not non_diagonal:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        nd_char = non_diagonal[0]\n\n        for c in non_diagonal:\n\n            if c != nd_char:\n\n                valid = False\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        if nd_char == d_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the code uses 'continue' after checking the diagonals. Then, for non-diagonal, it checks if non_diagonal is empty. But for n >=3, this is not possible. However, in code, it's handled.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\nThe first test case:\n\nn=5, grid is:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nIn code, during the diagonal check, the cell (2,0) is 's', which is not on the diagonal. Wait, no. Wait, (i=2, j=0): i + j = 2 + 0 = 2. For n=5, n-1 is 4. So 2 != 4. So (2,0) is not on the diagonal. So during the diagonal check, it's not checked. So during the diagonal check, the code checks all cells on the diagonals. For example, in row 2, j=2 (i=2, j=2) is on the main diagonal. So grid[2][2] is 'x' (original grid: row 2 is 'soxoo' → indexes 0: 's', 1: 'o', 2: 'x', 3: 'o', 4: 'o'. So (2,2) is x. So during the diagonal check, all cells on diagonals are x. But during the non-diagonal check, the cell (2,0) is 's' which is added to non_diagonal. So the non_diagonal list includes 's', which is different from others. Hence, the code returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. Now, the code needs to be written as per the problem's instructions. The code should read from stdin and output to stdout, handling multiple",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The grid must have the same character on both diagonals, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all input lines at once and process them sequentially for each test case.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: For each test case, check if all characters on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Collect all characters that are not on either diagonal and ensure they are all the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n            idx += 1\n        \n        # Check diagonals\n        d_char = grid[0][0]\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if (i == j) or (i + j == n - 1):\n                    if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check non-diagonal characters\n        non_diagonal = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if (i == j) or (i + j == n - 1):\n                    continue\n                non_diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        \n        if not non_diagonal:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        \n        nd_char = non_diagonal[0]\n        for c in non_diagonal:\n            if c != nd_char:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        \n        if nd_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing. Each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of characters.\n2. **Diagonal Validation**: For each cell in the grid, check if it lies on either of the two diagonals. If any cell on these diagonals does not match the character at the top-left corner (which is considered the reference character), the grid is immediately deemed invalid.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Validation**: Collect all characters not on the diagonals. Check if all these characters are the same and ensure they are different from the diagonal characters. If these conditions are met, the grid forms an \"X\"; otherwise, it does not.\n\nThis approach ensures that both the diagonal and non-diagonal checks are performed efficiently, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
