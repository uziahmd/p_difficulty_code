Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. Let me think about the requirements.\n\nThe problem says that the paper forms an X if two conditions are met. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, different from the diagonals.\n\nSo, first, I need to check the diagonals. The main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All the cells in these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The input is n followed by n lines of n characters each. For example, in the sample input, the first case is 5x5 grid. The first line is 'xooox', etc.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Read n.\n2. Read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n3. Check for the two conditions.\n\nLet me think about how to check the diagonals. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for all cells in the grid, check if they are on either of these diagonals.\n\nFor the first condition: all the cells on both diagonals must be the same. So collect all the characters from the diagonals and check if they are all the same. But wait, there's overlap: the center cell (when n is odd) is part of both diagonals. So for example, in a 3x3 grid, the middle cell is on both diagonals. So when checking, we need to make sure that all the cells in the diagonals are the same. So collect all the characters from both diagonals, and check that they are all the same.\n\nBut then, the second condition is that all the other cells (non-diagonal) are the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Collect all the diagonal characters (from both diagonals) into a set. If the size of this set is not 1, then it's invalid. Because all diagonals must have the same letter. Wait, but the diagonals can have the same letter as each other. For example, if all diagonals are 'x', then the set would have size 1. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but the first condition says that on both diagonals all letters are the same. So that implies that all the letters in the main diagonal are same, and all letters in the anti-diagonal are same. But also, the main diagonal's letter must be same as the anti-diagonal's letter. Because otherwise, the two diagonals have different letters. So for example, if the main diagonal is 'a' and the anti is 'b', then that's invalid.\n\nSo the first step is to check that all the cells in the diagonals are the same. So collect all the cells from both diagonals, and check that they are all the same. Because if the main diagonal has all 'a's and the anti has all 'a's, then the set of all diagonal cells is {'a'}, which is size 1. But if the main is 'a's and the anti is 'b's, then the set would have size 2, which is invalid.\n\nSo that's the first check. Then, for the non-diagonal cells, collect all of them and check that they are all the same, and that they are different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. Iterate through each cell. For each cell, check if it is on either diagonal. Collect the characters of the diagonals into a set (diag_chars). Also collect the non-diagonal characters into another set (non_diag_chars).\n\nWait, but for the non-diagonal cells, they must all be the same. So collect all non-diagonal characters into a set. If the size is not 1, then invalid. Also, the diag_chars must have size 1, and non_diag_chars must have size 1, and the two sets must be different.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nSo:\n\ndiag_chars = set()\n\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check if len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != non_diag_chars.\n\nBut wait, what if the non_diag_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3. For example, n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells (each), but the center is overlapping. So total diagonal cells is 2n-1. For n=3, 5 cells. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal is 4 cells. So for n=3, non_diag_chars will have 4 elements. So in general, for n >=3, the non-diagonal cells are (n^2 - (2n-1)) cells. Which for n=3 is 9-5=4, which is correct.\n\nSo for the code, after collecting the diag_chars and non_diag_chars, check:\n\nif len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != non_diag_chars.\n\nIf yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if the non-diagonal cells are empty? Well, for n=1, but n is given as >=3. So no problem.\n\nBut let's test with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nLet me parse this. The grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: x (main)\n\ni=0, j=4: x (anti)\n\ni=1, j=1: x (main), j=3: x (anti)\n\ni=2, j=2: x (main), j=2: i=2, j=2 is main. For anti, i=2 + j = 2: j= 2? Wait, n is 5, so i + j = 4 (since n-1 is 4). For i=2, j=2: 2+2=4? No, 2+2=4? Yes. So (i=2,j=2) is on both diagonals. So that cell is included in both.\n\nSo for the main diagonal, cells (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). For anti, (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nSo the diagonal cells are:\n\nIn the first row, x (from main) and x (from anti). Then, in row 1, x (main) and x (anti). Row 2, x (main) and x (anti). Row 3, x (main) and x (anti). Row 4, x (main) and x (anti). Wait, but for row 2, the cell (2,2) is x, but in the grid, row 2 is 'soxoo'. So (2,2) is x. So the main diagonal cells are x, x, x, x, x. The anti-diagonal cells are x, x, x, x, x. So diag_chars is {x}.\n\nBut then, the non-diagonal cells. For example, in row 0, positions 1,2,3 (since 0 is on main, 4 is on anti). So the cells o, o, o. Then in row 1, positions 0, 2, 4. The cells o, o, o. Row 2: positions 0, 1, 3, 4. The cells s, o, o, o. So the non-diagonal cells include s, which is different from o. So the non_diag_chars would have s and o. So len(non_diag_chars) is 2, which makes the answer NO. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that case.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\nMain: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w. Anti: (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w. So all diagonals are w. So diag_chars is {w}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are:\n\nRow 0: position 1: s.\n\nRow 1: positions 0 and 2: s and s.\n\nRow 2: position 1: s.\n\nSo all non-diagonal cells are s. So non_diag_chars is {s}. And since s != w, the answer is YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals: main is (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e. So diag_chars is {x, e} (since the main diagonal has x, x, e). So the first check fails. So output is NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input. The first line is n. Then n lines follow. Each line is a string of length n.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nRead n. Then read n lines, perhaps via input().strip() for each line.\n\nBut note that the input may be given as a list of strings, but in the problem statement, the input is given as per standard input. So for example, in the sample input given, the first input is 5 followed by 5 lines. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings, but that's probably for the purpose of the example. In reality, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, process grid.\n\nNow, for each cell (i,j), check if it is on the diagonals.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\ndiag_chars = set()\n\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != non_diag_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if the non_diag_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, the non-diagonal cells are n^2 - (2n-1) = (n-1)^2 - 1. For n=3, it's 9-5=4 cells, which is non-zero. So for n >=3, non_diag_chars can't be empty.\n\nBut for example, when n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut what if the non_diag_chars is empty? Well, the code will check len(non_diag_chars) == 1, which would be false, so output NO.\n\nBut in our case, for n >=3, non_diag_chars is not empty. So the code is okay.\n\nBut let's think about the case when all non-diagonal cells are same as the diagonal. For example, if all cells are same. Then diag_chars is {a}, non_diag_chars is {a}, so the condition is diag != non_diag, which is false. So output NO. Which is correct, because the non-diagonal cells must be different from the diagonals.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut let's test for the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: the first input.\n\nThe diag_chars is {x}, non_diag_chars includes s and o. So len is 2. So output NO.\n\nSample 2: diag is {w}, non_diag is {s}. So output YES.\n\nSample 3: diag has x and e, so len is 2. So output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about a case where the diagonals are same, but non-diagonal has multiple letters?\n\nLike:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nThe diagonals are a, a, a, a, a. So diag_chars is {a}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: the middle cell is a (from the second row, j=1). Wait, for the grid:\n\nRow 0: a a a\n\nRow 1: a b a\n\nRow 2: a a a\n\nThe non-diagonal cells are the cells not on the diagonals. For example, (0,1) is on the main diagonal? No. i=0, j=1. i != j. i + j = 1, which for n=3 is 2? No. n-1 is 2. So 0+1=1 != 2. So (0,1) is not on the diagonal. So the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (0,2) is on the anti-diagonal? For n=3, i + j = 2. (0,2): 0+2=2, yes. So (0,2) is on the anti-diagonal. So (0,1) is not on any diagonal. So in this case, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). These are the cells not on diagonals.\n\nIn the example, row 1 is a b a. So (1,0) is a, (1,2) is a. (0,1) is a, (2,1) is a. So non_diag_chars is {a}. So the code would output YES? But the non-diagonal cells are all a, same as the diagonal. Which would make the condition fail. Because the non-diagonal must be different from the diagonal.\n\nIn this case, the code would check if diag_chars (a) and non_diag_chars (a) are different. Since they are same, the condition is false. So output is NO. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\nThe diagonals are a, b, a (main), and a, a, a (anti). Wait:\n\nMain diagonal is (0,0)=a, (1,1)=a, (2,2)=a. Anti-diagonal is (0,2)=a, (1,1)=a, (2,0)=a. So diag_chars is {a}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells: (0,1) = b, (1,0)=b, (1,2)=a, (2,1)=b. So non_diag_chars is {a, b}. So len is 2. So output NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, the code needs to read from stdin. So:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, as per the problem statement. So the code can read each line as input().strip(), but perhaps better to read as input().strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nBut the problem says that each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So each line is exactly n characters. So perhaps just read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut in Python, if the user enters a line with leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, the input is correct. So perhaps it's safe to read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut for example, if a line is 'xooox', then input().strip() is same as the original. So code can proceed.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_chars = set()\n\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != non_diag_chars:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if the diag_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3, so for i and j in range(n), the diagonals have at least 2n-1 elements. For n=3, 5 elements. So diag_chars can't be empty.\n\nBut in code, for example, if all the diagonals are same, then diag_chars is size 1.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input 2:\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid is:\n\nrow 0: 'wsw' → indexes 0,1,2: w, s, w.\n\nrow 1: 'sws' → s, w, s.\n\nrow 2: 'wsw' → w, s, w.\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0: main → w. i + j = 0 → 0 + 0 = 0, which is not equal to 2 (n-1 is 2). Wait, n is 3. So i + j == 2?\n\nYes.\n\nSo for i=0, j=0: i==j → yes. So added to diag_chars. Also, for i=0, j=2: i + j = 0 + 2 = 2 → yes. So added to diag_chars.\n\nSo for all cells on diagonals:\n\nmain diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) → w, w, w.\n\nanti-diagonal: (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) → w, w, w. So diag_chars is {w}.\n\nnon-diagonal cells are:\n\ncells not on diagonals. For example:\n\n(0,1): s → added to non_diag_chars.\n\n(1,0): s → added.\n\n(1,2): s → added.\n\n(2,1): s → added.\n\nSo non_diag_chars is {s}.\n\nThus, len(diag) is 1, len(non) is 1, and they are different. So output YES.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the third one:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nrow 0: x p x\n\nrow 1: p x p\n\nrow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nmain diagonal: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e → diag_chars is {x, e}.\n\nThus, len(diag_chars) is 2 → condition fails. Output NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when the non-diagonal cells are same as the diagonal?\n\nLike:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen, all cells are a. So diag_chars is {a}, non_diag_chars is {a}. So the condition is that diag and non_diag are different. So the code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct, since the non-diagonal cells must be different from the diagonal.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are a, and non-diagonal are b. So code returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code is written.\n\nBut what about when the non_diag_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So no.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Characters Collection**: Traverse each cell in the grid to check if it lies on either of the two diagonals (main diagonal or anti-diagonal). Collect characters from these diagonals into one set and characters from non-diagonal positions into another set.\n3. **Validation**: Check if both sets (diagonal and non-diagonal characters) have exactly one unique character each, and ensure that these characters are different from each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_chars = set()\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != non_diag_chars:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first input line is the integer `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n- **Character Collection**: We use two sets to collect characters from the diagonals (`diag_chars`) and non-diagonal positions (`non_diag_chars`). This helps in efficiently checking if all characters in these regions are the same.\n- **Validation Checks**: By ensuring that both sets contain exactly one unique character and that these characters are different, we confirm that the grid meets the criteria for forming the letter \"X\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
