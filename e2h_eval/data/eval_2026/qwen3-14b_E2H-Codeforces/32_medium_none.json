    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. So, I need to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to consider each element, remove it, compute the max and min of the remaining elements, and then find the minimum instability. But if I do this naively, for each element, it would take O(n) time, leading to O(n²) time overall. Since n can be up to 1e5, that's way too slow. So I need a more efficient method.\n\nWait, what's the key here? The instability of the array after removing one element depends on the max and min of the remaining elements. So, maybe if I can find for each possible removal, what the new max and min are, but without checking all possibilities.\n\nLet me think: the original array's max and min are known. If I remove an element that's not the max or min, then the max and min stay the same. But if I remove the max, then the new max is the second highest element. Similarly for removing the min.\n\nWait, but that's only if the element being removed is the current max or min. So, perhaps the optimal way is to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: Remove the maximum element. Then the new instability is (second_max - min).\n\nCase 2: Remove the minimum element. Then the new instability is (max - second_min).\n\nBut wait, there might be multiple maxima or minima. Like if there are multiple elements with the same max value. For example, in the first sample input, the array is [1,3,3,7]. The max is 7, and if we remove it, the new max is 3. But if there are two max elements, then removing one of them would leave the other, so the max remains the same. So, in that case, the instability would be (max - min) if we remove one of the max elements. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. The original max is 7, min is 1. If I remove one of the 3s, then the max is 7 and min is 1. So instability is 6. But if I remove 7, then the max is 3 and min is 1, instability is 2. Which is better.\n\nSo, the idea is that when you remove an element, the instability could be either:\n\n- If you remove the max, then the new max is the second max. But if there are multiple max elements, then removing one of them leaves others. So the max remains the same. So the instability would be (max - min) if there are multiple max elements. Wait, no. If the array has multiple max elements, then removing one of them would leave the rest. So the max is still the same. So the instability would be (max - min) if you remove one of the max elements. But if you remove the min, then the new min is the second min. But if there are multiple min elements, then removing one leaves others, so the min remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy would be to consider the following possibilities:\n\n- The minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n   a) the instability when removing the first occurrence of the max (so the new max is the second max, but if there are multiple max elements, maybe not?)\n\n   b) the instability when removing the first occurrence of the min (so the new min is the second min)\n\n   c) or maybe other possibilities where removing a non-max and non-min element doesn't affect the max and min, so the instability remains the same as the original.\n\nWait, but if the original instability is (max - min). If you remove an element that is neither the max nor the min, then the max and min remain the same. So the instability is the same as before. So, in that case, the minimal instability would be the minimum between (original instability minus some value), but how?\n\nWait, no. Suppose the original instability is (max - min). If you remove an element that's not the max or min, the max and min of the array remain the same. So the instability remains (max - min). Therefore, the minimal instability can be achieved either by removing a max, a min, or some other element. But if the original instability is already the best possible, then removing any element that's not a max or min would leave the instability the same. So, perhaps the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n- (max - second_min) when you remove the min.\n\n- (second_max - min) when you remove the max.\n\n- (original instability) if there are elements that are not max or min, so you can remove them and get the same instability.\n\nBut how do I know whether there are elements that are not max or min? Well, if n >= 3, then there are at least two elements that are not max or min. Wait, no. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3], then removing 2 would leave [1,3], which has instability 2. But if you remove 1 or 3, then the instability is 2 as well. So in this case, the original instability is 2. So removing any element gives instability of 2. So the minimal is 2.\n\nBut if the array is [1, 1, 2, 3], then the original instability is 3-1=2. If you remove 3, the instability is 2-1=1. If you remove 1, then the instability is 3-1=2. So in this case, the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the key is that the minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n- the instability when you remove the min (which is (max - second_min))\n\n- the instability when you remove the max (which is (second_max - min))\n\n- and the original instability (if there are elements that are not min or max, so that removing them leaves the instability same as original).\n\nBut how do I compare these options?\n\nSo, the steps I need to take:\n\nFirst, sort the array. Because once sorted, it's easier to find the min and max, and their positions.\n\nWait, but the array can be unsorted. However, for the purpose of finding the max and min, the sorted array can help. Let me think.\n\nOnce the array is sorted, the min is the first element and the max is the last. Then, if I remove the first element (the min), the new min is the second element, and the max is the last. The instability is (last - second). Similarly, if I remove the last element (the max), the new instability is (second_last - first). Also, if I remove any element in between, the min and max remain the same, so the instability is (last - first). So, the minimal possible instability would be the minimum between (last - second) and (second_last - first) and (last - first) if there are elements that can be removed which are not min or max.\n\nWait, but if the array is sorted, then the original instability is (last - first). If you remove an element that's not the first or last, then the instability remains (last - first). So, if there are elements that are not the first or last, then the original instability is a candidate. But if the array has only two elements, then removing one leaves one element, so instability is zero. But in that case, the original instability is (a[1] - a[0]) and after removing one element, the instability is zero.\n\nSo, for the general case:\n\nIf n == 2, then the answer is 0, because after removing one element, the array has one element, and instability is zero.\n\nElse:\n\nThe minimal instability is the minimum between:\n\n- (max_after_removing_min) = (sorted[-1] - sorted[1])\n\n- (max_after_removing_max) = (sorted[-2] - sorted[0])\n\n- (original instability) if there are elements that are not min or max. But in that case, the original instability is (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]). However, if there are elements that are not min or max, then removing them would leave the instability as (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]). So, the minimal possible instability is the minimum between the two options above and (original instability). But wait, in some cases, the original instability may be smaller than the two options. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Original instability is 3. If you remove the min (1), then instability is 3 (4-2=2?), wait no. Let me calculate:\n\nOriginal array [1,2,3,4]. After removing 1, the array is [2,3,4], instability is 4-2=2. After removing 4, the array is [1,2,3], instability is 2. So the original instability is 3. So the minimal is 2. So in this case, the minimal is the minimum between (4-2=2) and (3-1=2), and the original instability (3). So the answer is 2.\n\nSo the minimal is the minimum between the two options (removing min or max) and the original instability. But in this case, the original instability is higher than the two options. So the answer is min(2, 2, 3) = 2.\n\nBut in some cases, the original instability could be the minimal. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. Original instability is 7-1=6. If you remove 7, instability is 3-1=2. If you remove 1, instability is 7-3=4. The original instability is 6. So the minimal is 2. So the answer is min(4, 2, 6) = 2.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 2, 3]. Original instability is 2. Removing the min (1) gives instability 3-2=1. Removing the max (3) gives instability 2-1=1. So the answer is 1. Which is better than the original instability. So the minimal is min(1, 1, 2) = 1.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then original instability is 0. If you remove any element, the instability is 0. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the conclusion is that when n >= 3, the minimal instability is the minimum between (sorted[-1] - sorted[1]) and (sorted[-2] - sorted[0]).\n\nBecause when you remove the first element (min), the instability is (sorted[-1] - sorted[1]), and when you remove the last element (max), the instability is (sorted[-2] - sorted[0]). And if there are elements that are not min or max, then removing them gives the original instability (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]). But comparing the two options (removing min or max) and the original instability.\n\nWait, but what if the original instability is smaller than both options? For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Original instability is 4. If you remove the min (1), the instability is 4-2=2. If you remove the max (5), the instability is 4-1=3. So the minimal is 2. But the original instability is 4. So the answer is min(2, 3, 4) = 2. So the original instability is not the minimal here.\n\nBut what if the array is like [1, 2, 2, 3]. Original instability is 2. If you remove the min (1), the instability is 3-2=1. If you remove the max (3), instability is 2-1=1. So the answer is 1, which is better than the original instability.\n\nBut in another case, say the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Original instability is 5. If you remove the min, the instability is 5 (6-2=4?), no. Wait, the array is sorted as [1,2,3,4,5,6]. If you remove 1, the array becomes [2,3,4,5,6], instability is 6-2=4. If you remove 6, the array becomes [1,2,3,4,5], instability is 5-1=4. The original instability is 5. So the answer is 4, which is better than the original.\n\nSo, the minimal instability is the minimum between (sorted[-1] - sorted[1]) and (sorted[-2] - sorted[0]). Because when you remove the min or the max, and those are the two options that can reduce the instability.\n\nBut why don't we have to consider other possibilities, like removing some other element that's not the min or max, but maybe that helps?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. Original instability is 6. If I remove 3, the array becomes [1,4,5,7], instability is 6. If I remove 4, the array becomes [1,3,5,7], instability is 6. So removing those elements doesn't help. But if I remove the min (1), instability is 7-3=4. Or remove the max (7), instability is 5-1=4. So the minimal is 4.\n\nSo, in this case, the answer is min(4, 4, 6) = 4. So the two options of removing min or max are better than the original instability.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal possible instability is the minimum between the two options (removing min or max) and the original instability. But in the case where n >= 3, the original instability is (max - min), and the two options are (max - second_min) and (second_max - min). So the minimal is the minimum between those two options. Because the original instability is (max - min), which is larger than (max - second_min) if second_min is greater than min. Which is always true. Because the array is sorted, so sorted[1] is >= sorted[0], so (sorted[-1] - sorted[1]) <= (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]). Similarly, (sorted[-2] - sorted[0]) <= (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]).\n\nSo the original instability is (sorted[-1] - sorted[0]) and the two options are smaller than that. So the minimal possible instability is the minimum between (sorted[-1] - sorted[1]) and (sorted[-2] - sorted[0]).\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimum between (sorted[-1] - sorted[1]) and (sorted[-2] - sorted[0]).\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple minima or maxima?\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then sorted array is [1,1,1,1]. Then (sorted[-1] - sorted[1]) is 0. (sorted[-2] - sorted[0]) is 0. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: [1,1,3,3]. Original instability is 2. If you remove one of the 1s, the instability is 3-1=2. If you remove one of the 3s, instability is 3-1=2. But according to the formula, (sorted[-1] - sorted[1]) is 3-1=2. (sorted[-2] - sorted[0]) is 3-1=2. So the answer is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 2, 3]. Then sorted array is [1,2,2,3]. So the two options are (3-2) = 1 and (2-1) =1. So the answer is 1. Which is correct. Because removing the min (1) gives [2,2,3], instability 1. Removing the max (3) gives [1,2,2], instability 1.\n\nSo yes, this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- If n == 2, output 0.\n\n- Else, compute min between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, in the first example given in the problem statement:\n\nInput is [1,3,3,7]. Sorted array is [1,3,3,7].\n\nThen, (a[-1] - a[1]) = 7-3=4. (a[-2] - a[0]) = 3 -1=2. So the minimum is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is [1, 100000]. n is 2, output is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it.\n\nIf n == 2: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the two options (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]), take the minimum between them.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 3? For example, array [1,2,3]. Then, after removing the first element (1), the instability is 3-2=1. After removing the last element (3), instability is 2-1=1. The original instability is 2. So the answer is 1, which is the minimum of the two options. So the code would return min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) => 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 5, 5, 5]. sorted array is [1,5,5,5]. So the two options are (5 - 5) = 0 and (5 - 1) =4. So the answer is 0. Which is correct. Because removing the first element (1) gives [5,5,5], instability 0.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nSo the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nif n == 2: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\noption2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\nresult = min(option1, option2)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what about when there are multiple elements to remove that are not min or max. For example, in the case where the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], the original instability is 6. But when you remove 7, the instability is 3-1=2. Which is the option2 (a[-2] - a[0] = 3-1=2). So the code returns that. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, let's test the code against the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7\n\nsorted array is [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1 = 7 - 3 =4\n\noption2 = 3 -1=2. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\ninput is 2, 1 100000. output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=3, array [1,2,3]. options are 3-2=1 and 2-1=1. min is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, array [1,1,1]. options are 1-1=0 and 1-1=0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, array [1,2,3,4,5]. options are 5-2=3 and 4-1=3. So min is 3. Which is correct. Because removing the min (1) gives array [2,3,4,5], instability 3. Removing max (5) gives [1,2,3,4], instability 3. Which is the minimal possible.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array.\n\nSort it.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nBut wait, what about if there are multiple elements that are not min or max, and removing them gives a better result? For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The original instability is 5. If you remove 3, the instability is 6-1=5. But if you remove the min, you get 6-2=4, which is better. So the code handles that.\n\nBut what about if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The original instability is 5. If you remove 3, the instability is 6-1=5. If you remove 4, the instability is 6-1=5. So the code would compute option1 = 6-3=3 (since a[-1] is 6, a[1] is 3). option2 is a[-2] (5) - a[0] (1) =4. So the min is 3. Which is correct. So the code returns 3, which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n, then list.\n\nBut note that the input for the first example is given as ['4\\n1 3 3 7', '2\\n1 100000'], but the actual input is read from stdin. So in the code, we need to read the input properly.\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nThe second line is the array elements.\n\nSo the code should read n, then read the array.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\nBut for n=2, the code returns 0.\n\nElse compute the options.\n\nSo code:\n\nBut wait, for n=1? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 2.\n\nSo code:\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    a.sort()\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but in the code, for n=3, the code will sort and compute the two options.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, array [1,3,3,7]. After sorting [1,3,3,7]. option1 is 7 - a[1]=3 → 4. option2 is a[-2]=3 - a[0]=1 → 2. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2: n=2, output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1, 1, 100]. sorted is [1,1,100]. option1 is 100 - 1 =99. option2 is 1 - 1 =0. So min is 0. Which is correct. Because removing the 100 gives [1,1], instability 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, array [1, 100, 100]. option1 is 100 - 1 =99. option2 is 100 -1=99. So min is 99. But if you remove the 1, the instability is 100-100=0. Wait, why is that?\n\nAh, here's a problem. Wait, in this case, the code would compute option1 as a[-1] - a[1]. The sorted array is [1,100,100]. a[-1] is 100, a[1] is 100. So option1 is 0. option2 is a[-2] (100) - a[0] (1) = 99. So min(0,99) is 0. Which is correct. Because removing the min (1) gives [100,100], instability 0. So the code would return 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo why did I think earlier that the code would compute option1 as 99? Because I made a mistake in the example. Let me recheck:\n\narray is [1, 100, 100]. sorted array is [1, 100, 100]. So a[-1] is 100, a[1] is 100. So option1 is 100 - 100 = 0. option2 is a[-2] (100) - a[0] (1) = 99. So min is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 2, 100, 100]. sorted is [1,2,100,100]. option1 is 100 - 2 = 98. option2 is 100 - 1 = 99. So the min is 98. Which is the case when you remove the min (1), the instability is 100 - 2 = 98. Or if you remove the max (100), the instability is 100 - 1 = 99. So the code returns 98. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is calculated as the difference between its maximum and minimum values. When we remove one element, the instability of the resulting array can be minimized by considering the effect of removing either the minimum or the maximum element.\n2. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the minimum and maximum values, as well as their positions.\n3. **Key Observations**:\n   - If the array has only two elements, removing one will leave a single element, resulting in zero instability.\n   - For arrays with more than two elements, the minimum instability can be achieved by either removing the smallest element or the largest element. This is because removing the smallest element reduces the instability to the difference between the new minimum (second smallest element) and the largest element. Similarly, removing the largest element reduces the instability to the difference between the new maximum (second largest element) and the smallest element.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        a.sort()\n        option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n        option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of elements `n`, and the second line contains the array elements.\n2. **Handling Edge Case for n=2**: If the array has exactly two elements, removing either element results in zero instability.\n3. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array allows us to efficiently access the smallest and largest elements, as well as the second smallest and second largest elements.\n4. **Calculating Minimum Instability**:\n   - **Option 1**: Calculate the instability after removing the smallest element, which is the difference between the largest element and the second smallest element.\n   - **Option 2**: Calculate the instability after removing the largest element, which is the difference between the second largest element and the smallest element.\n5. **Result**: The minimum value between the two calculated instabilities is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability in O(n log n) time due to sorting, which is optimal for the given problem constraints.",
