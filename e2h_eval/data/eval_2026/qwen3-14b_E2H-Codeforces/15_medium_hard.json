They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can be champions given the structure of the tournament and the rules for each phase. \n\nSo, the setup is that there are 2^n teams, each with a unique skill level from 1 to 2^n. The tournament is structured in rounds, and each round's matches are determined by the previous winners. For each phase (there are n phases), the result of the matches depends on whether the character in the string s is 0 or 1. For example, if s_i is 0, then in that phase, the lower-skilled team wins each match. If it's 1, the higher-skilled one wins.\n\nThe task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x ends up as the champion.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model the tournament structure. Since each phase reduces the number of teams by half, the tournament has log2(total teams) = n phases. Each phase corresponds to a level in the bracket.\n\nBut how do we model the possible paths a team can take through the tournament to become champion? The key is to simulate the possible winners based on the rules of each phase.\n\nBut since the permutation p is arbitrary, except that it must be a permutation of 1 to 2^n, the challenge is to find for each x, whether there exists a way to arrange the teams such that x can win all the required matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\nWait, but how does the permutation p affect the tournament? Because the permutation determines the initial arrangement of the teams. For example, the initial bracket pairs are (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. But the actual skill levels of these teams are determined by p. So, the initial positions of the teams in the bracket matter. However, the problem allows us to choose any permutation p, so we can arrange the teams in such a way that x can reach the final.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like for x to be a winning integer, there must be a way to arrange the initial bracket such that x can win all its matches in each phase, considering the rules of each phase.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's imagine that in each phase, the way the matches are decided depends on the current phase's rule (s[i]).\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. The root is the final match. To reach the root, a team must win all matches along the path from the leaf to the root.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for x to be able to reach the root?\n\nAnother approach: For x to be the champion, during each phase, when it plays a match, it must win according to the rule of that phase. But the opponents in each phase depend on the initial arrangement of the teams. So, perhaps we can model for each possible x, the minimal and maximal possible values that x needs to have in each phase to ensure that it can win its matches.\n\nAlternatively, for each phase, the team must be able to beat all possible opponents that could come its way. But since we can arrange the permutation p, perhaps we can choose the opponents in such a way that x can win all matches.\n\nWait, but the permutation p defines the initial arrangement of the teams. So, for example, in the first phase, the initial matches are fixed as pairs of consecutive teams. However, the actual skill levels of those teams can be arranged by the permutation. So, for x to be able to win the tournament, we need to arrange the initial bracket such that in each round, x's opponents are such that it can win according to the phase's rule.\n\nSo, maybe we can model for each possible x, the minimum and maximum possible values that x can have in each round. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the team must win its match. Let's consider the rounds starting from the first (the earliest) to the last (the final round). \n\nFor example, in the first round (phase 1), there are 2^{n-1} matches. The winner of each match proceeds to the next round. Then, in the second round (phase 2), there are 2^{n-2} matches, etc., until the nth round (phase n) which has one match.\n\nEach phase i corresponds to the ith round. The rule for that phase determines whether higher or lower skill wins.\n\nSo, for x to be the champion, in each phase i, when it plays in that phase, it must win according to the rule of that phase. However, the opponents that x faces in each phase depend on the initial arrangement of the teams.\n\nBut since we can arrange the permutation p, we can choose the opponents that x faces in each phase. The question is, what constraints must x satisfy in order for there to exist a way to arrange the initial bracket such that x can win all matches in each phase.\n\nLet me think of it as building a tree of possible paths. For x to reach the final, it must have a path through the tournament where, in each phase, it beats its opponent according to the rule of that phase. And since the permutation can be chosen, we can arrange that the opponents in each phase are such that x can beat them.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a certain round (phase) and a certain \"position\" in the bracket. For example, in the first round, x is in a group of two teams. To proceed to the next round, x must beat its opponent. Then, in the next round, x is in a group of two teams again (the winner of the previous group and another winner from another group), and so on.\n\nBut since the permutation can be arranged, the problem becomes finding for x, whether there exists a path through the tournament where in each phase, x can win against the required opponents, given the rules of that phase.\n\nBut how can we model the possible opponents in each phase? Let's think about the constraints on x's value.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose n=1, s is '1'. Then there are two teams. The first (and only) phase is phase 1, where the higher skill wins. So the champion is the team with higher skill. So possible x is 2. Which matches the sample input where for n=1, s='1', output is 2.\n\nAnother sample input is n=2, s='01'. Output is 2 3. Let's think. For n=2, there are 4 teams. The tournament has 2 phases. Phase 1 (first round) has 2 games. Phase 2 (second round) has 1 game.\n\nIn phase 1, the rule is 0: lower skill wins. In phase 2, the rule is 1: higher skill wins.\n\nSo, to be champion, a team must first win in phase 1 (so it's the lower-skilled in its initial match), then in phase 2, it must be the higher-skilled in the final match.\n\nSo, for example, if x is 2: in the first phase, it can be paired with a team with higher skill (say 3 or 4). Then, in phase 1, since the rule is 0, x (2) would win. Then, in the second phase, it would face the winner of another match. Let's say the other match was between 1 and 4. Since phase 1 is 0, the lower-skilled (1) would win. Then, in phase 2, the rule is 1, so the higher between 2 and 1 is 2, which wins. So yes, x=2 is possible.\n\nSimilarly for x=3. Let's see. In phase 1, x=3 must be the lower-skilled in its match. So it must be paired with someone higher than 3 (i.e., 4). Then, in phase 1, 3 wins. Then, in phase 2, it must face the winner of another match. Suppose the other match is between 1 and 2. The lower-skilled (1) would win. Then, in phase 2, the higher between 3 and 1 is 3, so it wins. So x=3 can be champion.\n\nBut what about x=1? Let's see. In phase 1, x=1 must be lower-skilled than its opponent. But since it's the lowest, it can't be. So in phase 1, if x is 1, then it can't win. So x=1 can't be champion. Similarly, x=4: in phase 1, it's higher-skilled than any opponent, but the phase 1 rule is 0, so it would lose. So x=4 can't make it past phase 1. Hence, the output is 2 and 3.\n\nSo, for each x, we need to determine whether there exists a way to arrange the initial bracket such that x can win all the matches in each phase according to the rules.\n\nNow, how to model this for general n and s?\n\nAn approach is to think of the tournament as a series of rounds, and for x to be champion, in each round, x must be able to win against the opponent it faces. The opponents depend on the arrangement of the initial bracket, but since we can arrange the bracket, we can choose the opponents that x faces in each round.\n\nBut how to model the constraints on x's value for each round.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each round corresponds to a level in the tree. For example, in the first round (phase 1), each team is in a group of two. The winner proceeds to the next level (phase 2), which groups two winners into a group of two, etc.\n\nFor x to be champion, in each phase i (from 1 to n), during that phase, when x is in a match, it must win. The way to model this is to find for each phase i, what constraints on x's value are needed, given the rules of that phase.\n\nBut since the arrangement of the bracket can be chosen, perhaps we can find for each phase, the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have, considering the rules of that phase and the previous phases.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For each phase i (starting from the first to the last), during that phase, x is in a match where it must win. Depending on the rule (s[i-1], since the string is 0-based?), the winner is determined by comparing x's skill to the opponent's. But the opponent's skill depends on the arrangement.\n\nBut since we can arrange the bracket, we can choose the opponents for x in each phase. However, the opponents must be such that they can be arranged in the bracket in a way that they are the ones x faces in each phase.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of ranges. For x to be able to reach the final, during each phase i, it must be able to beat the opponent in that phase. Let's model for each phase i, what is the set of possible values that the opponent can have, given the rules of that phase, and the constraints from previous phases.\n\nFor example, during phase 1 (the first round), the rule is s[0]. If s[0] is 0, then x must have a lower skill than the opponent. But since we can choose the opponent, we can choose an opponent with higher skill than x. However, that opponent must be eliminated in phase 1. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can arrange that x's opponent in phase 1 is someone with higher skill (if s[0] is 0) or lower (if s[0] is 1).\n\nWait, but the opponent in phase 1 is another team. So, for x to win in phase 1, depending on the rule, the opponent must be either higher or lower than x. However, since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose the opponent's skill level as needed.\n\nBut after that, in phase 2, x will face another opponent. How can we model that?\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe there's a pattern here. Let's think of the tournament as a sequence of rounds. For x to reach the final, during each round i (1-based), x must be able to win against the opponent in that round. The opponent in round i is determined by the previous rounds.\n\nBut since the bracket can be arranged, perhaps for each round, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible values of x's opponents in that round, based on the rules of that round and previous rounds.\n\nAlternatively, for each round, we can model the constraints on x. Let's think recursively. For example, in the first round, the constraint is that x must have a certain relation to the opponent. Then, in the next round, the opponent is the winner of another match in the same bracket. But again, we can arrange the initial bracket so that the opponent in the next round is such that x can win.\n\nWait, but perhaps the key is to find for each round i, the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have, given the rules up to that round.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the possible range of x's skill in each round. For example, during the first round (phase 1), depending on the rule, x must be either the minimum or maximum in its initial pair. Then, during the second round (phase 2), x must be either the min or max in its new pair, which consists of the winner of the first round's group and another winner from another group. But since we can arrange the bracket, perhaps we can choose the other winner in such a way that x can win again.\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each round, we can compute the possible constraints on x's value.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of layers. For each layer (phase), the x must be able to win in that layer. Let's process the phases from the first to the last.\n\nLet me consider the first phase (phase 1). For x to proceed to the next round (phase 2), it must win in phase 1. Depending on the rule s[0], this means:\n\nIf s[0] is '0' (lower wins), then x must be the lower-skilled team in its initial match. Therefore, the opponent must have higher skill than x. So, in this case, x can be any value, provided that there exists at least one team with higher skill (which is always true except when x is the maximum possible). Wait, but since the permutation is arbitrary, we can arrange that the opponent of x in phase 1 is a team with higher skill. Therefore, for x to proceed, it must not be the maximum possible skill. Wait, no. Because if x is the maximum, then in phase 1, if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x would lose, since the opponent would have to be lower. But since x is the maximum, the opponent can't be higher than x. Therefore, for x to proceed in phase 1 under rule 0, x must not be the maximum. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can have x in a pair with someone else. Wait, no. If x is the maximum, then in phase 1, the rule is 0, then x can't win. So for x to proceed, in phase 1, if the rule is 0, x must be able to have an opponent with higher skill. But if x is the maximum, there is no such opponent. Therefore, x cannot proceed to phase 2. Thus, in this case, x cannot be the champion.\n\nBut this suggests that for each phase, there are constraints on x's value. So, for each phase i, depending on the rule, x must be either the minimum or maximum in the group of 2^{i} teams that it is part of during that phase. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Because each phase corresponds to a certain level of the tournament.\n\nAlternatively, for each phase i, during that phase, x is in a group of 2^{n - i + 1} teams? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each team starts in a leaf node. Each match is a node in the tree. The root is the final match. For x to reach the root, it must win all matches along the path from its initial leaf to the root.\n\nEach match along this path corresponds to a phase. For example, the first match (leaf's parent) is phase 1. The next match (grandparent) is phase 2, and so on. The total number of phases is n, since the depth of the tree is n.\n\nSo, for x to be champion, in each of the n matches along its path to the root, it must win according to the rule of that phase.\n\nNow, the question is, for each of these matches, what constraints does the rule impose on x's value, given that we can arrange the initial bracket.\n\nLet me consider that for each match in the path, the opponent is chosen in such a way that x can win according to the rule of that phase. But how can we model the possible opponents for each phase?\n\nFor example, in the first match (phase 1), the opponent is another team. For x to win, depending on the rule:\n\n- If the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be lower than the opponent. So the opponent must be higher than x. Since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose the opponent to be any higher value. But this requires that there exists at least one higher value (so x can't be the maximum).\n\n- If the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than the opponent. So the opponent must be lower than x. This requires that there exists at least one lower value (so x can't be the minimum).\n\nBut then, in the next phase (phase 2), x is in a match against the winner of another subtree. Again, the rule for phase 2 is s[1]. For x to win this match, the opponent must be either higher or lower than x, depending on the rule. However, the opponent is the winner of another subtree. How can we ensure that such an opponent exists?\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can arrange that the other subtree's winner is such that x can beat it. For example, if the rule for phase 2 is 0 (lower wins), then x must be lower than the opponent. But how can we arrange that the opponent is higher than x? Well, the opponent comes from another subtree. We can arrange that subtree's structure so that the winner is a team with higher skill than x. However, this depends on the rules of the previous phases in that subtree.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me think recursively. For each phase i (starting from 1 to n), during that phase, x must be able to win against its opponent. The constraints for x's value depend on the rules of the phases up to that point.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For each phase i, during that phase, the opponent is someone who has already won all previous phases (up to i-1) according to their rules. Therefore, for x to beat this opponent in phase i, x must be either higher or lower than the opponent, depending on the rule of phase i. However, the opponent's value is constrained by the rules of the previous phases.\n\nBut how can we model this? Perhaps for each phase i, we can track the possible range of values that x must have, given the rules up to that phase.\n\nLet me try to think of it as intervals. For example, for the first phase (i=1):\n\n- If the rule is 0, then x must be less than the opponent. Since the opponent is someone who can be chosen to be higher than x, the only constraint is that x is not the maximum. So the possible x's are [1, 2^n - 1].\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the opponent must have been chosen to be higher than x. But if x is the maximum, there's no such opponent. So x can't be the maximum. So the possible x's for phase 1 rule 0 are all values except the maximum.\n\nBut then, for the next phase (i=2), the opponent is someone who has passed phase 1. For example, if phase 1 rule is 0, then the opponent in phase 2 must have passed phase 1, which implies that during phase 1, they were the lower-skilled in their match. So, their value must be lower than their opponent in phase 1. But since we can arrange the bracket, perhaps the opponent in phase 2 can be any value that is higher than x (if phase 2 rule is 0) or lower than x (if phase 2 rule is 1).\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each phase i, during that phase, the team x must be able to beat its opponent. The opponent's value depends on the previous phases. However, since we can arrange the bracket, we can choose the opponents in such a way that they are as per our needs.\n\nThus, for each phase, we can model the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have, given the rules up to that phase.\n\nLet me think of this as building a range for x. Initially, before any phases, the possible x is [1, 2^n]. Then, for each phase, we update this range based on the rule of that phase.\n\nFor example:\n\nPhase 1 (i=1):\n\n- If rule is 0: x must be lower than the opponent. So, the opponent must be higher than x. But since the opponent is any team that can be arranged, the only constraint is that there exists a higher value. So x can be anything except the maximum. So the new range is [1, 2^n - 1].\n\n- If rule is 1: x must be higher than the opponent. So the opponent must be lower than x. So x can't be the minimum. New range is [2, 2^n].\n\nThen, for phase 2 (i=2), the rule is s[1]. Now, the opponent in phase 2 is someone who has passed phase 1. For that opponent, during phase 1, they must have won according to the rule of phase 1. So their value depends on the rule of phase 1.\n\nLet me think for phase 2.\n\nSuppose phase 1 rule was 0. So, the opponent in phase 2 has passed phase 1 by being the lower-skilled in their initial match. Therefore, their value is less than their initial opponent. But since we can arrange the bracket, perhaps we can choose that the opponent in phase 2 has a certain value.\n\nBut how does this affect the possible values of x?\n\nFor example, during phase 2, the rule is 0 (lower wins). So x must be lower than the opponent. But the opponent has passed phase 1 (rule 0), meaning that their value is lower than some other team. However, since we can arrange the bracket, we can choose the opponent in phase 2 to be any value that is higher than x. But how can we ensure that such a value exists?\n\nWait, but the opponent in phase 2 must have passed phase 1. For example, if phase 1 rule is 0, then the opponent in phase 2 must have been the lower-skilled in their initial match. Therefore, their value must be less than the value of their initial opponent. But since we can arrange the bracket, the initial opponent can be any value higher than the opponent in phase 2.\n\nBut how does this affect the possible values of x?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think for each phase i, the range of possible x is determined by the rules up to that phase. For example, for phase 1, we have a certain range. For phase 2, based on the rule of phase 2 and the previous phase's rule, we can adjust the range.\n\nPerhaps for each phase i, the range of x is constrained by the rules of the previous phases and the current phase. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me define for each phase i, the possible range of x's value. Let's assume that for phase i, the x must be able to win in that phase, and that the opponent in that phase must have passed all previous phases (phases 1 to i-1).\n\nLet me think of the possible range of x after processing the first k phases.\n\nFor example, after phase 1, the range is determined by the rule of phase 1. For phase 2, the rule of phase 2 will further constrain the range.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following idea: For each phase i, the possible x must be such that during phase i, it can beat an opponent that has passed the previous phases. The opponent's value depends on the rules of the previous phases.\n\nFor example, during phase i, the rule is r (0 or 1). For x to beat the opponent, the value of x must be either higher or lower than the opponent, depending on r. However, the opponent has passed the previous phases (1 to i-1), which may have imposed constraints on their value.\n\nLet me think of the opponent's possible values. Suppose that during the previous phases (1 to i-1), the opponent's value has been constrained in a certain way. For example, if all previous phases had rules that forced the opponent to be in a certain range.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nMaybe for each phase, we can track two values: the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have, given the rules up to that phase.\n\nLet me try to think with an example. Let's take the sample input where n=3 and s is '101'.\n\nThe string is of length 3. So, phases 1, 2, 3.\n\nPhase 1: rule is 1 (higher wins)\nPhase 2: rule is 0 (lower wins)\nPhase 3: rule is 1 (higher wins)\n\nWhat's the possible x's?\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nInitially, x can be any value from 1 to 8 (since 2^3=8).\n\nPhase 1: rule is 1. So x must be higher than its opponent. Therefore, x must be at least 2 (since there must be an opponent with lower value). So after phase 1, the range is [2, 8].\n\nPhase 2: rule is 0. So x must be lower than its opponent. But the opponent has passed phase 1, which requires that during phase 1, the opponent was higher than its own opponent. So what's the possible range of the opponent's value?\n\nWell, the opponent in phase 2 must have passed phase 1 (rule 1). That means during phase 1, the opponent was higher than their initial opponent. So the opponent's value must be in the range [2, 8] as well. But how does this affect the current phase?\n\nIn phase 2, x must be lower than the opponent. So the opponent must be higher than x. But the opponent is someone who passed phase 1 (so their value is >= 2). Therefore, for x to be able to find such an opponent, x must be less than some value in [2, 8]. Which is possible unless x is 8. But wait, no. Because the opponent can be any value higher than x. However, the opponent must have passed phase 1. But since phase 1's rule is 1 (higher wins), the opponent must have been higher than their initial opponent. However, the opponent's value can be any value >= 2, as long as there exists some initial opponent lower than them. So, for example, if x is 2, then the opponent can be 3, 4, ..., 8. All of which are valid. Therefore, for phase 2 rule 0, the x must be less than the opponent. So x can be any value in [2, 7], because if x is 8, there is no opponent higher than x (but the opponent's value can be up to 8, but x is 8. So if x is 8, the opponent must be higher than x, which is impossible. Hence, x cannot be 8. So after phase 2, the range is [2,7].\n\nNow phase 3: rule is 1 (higher wins). The opponent in phase 3 is the winner of the other half of the bracket. This opponent has passed phases 1 and 2. What is the possible range of this opponent's value?\n\nWell, during phase 1, the opponent was higher than its initial opponent (so >=2). During phase 2, the opponent was lower than its opponent (so the opponent in phase 2 must be lower than the opponent in phase 2. Wait, no. Phase 2's rule is 0 (lower wins). So during phase 2, the opponent must have been lower than their opponent. Therefore, the opponent in phase 3 must be someone who, during phase 2, was lower than their opponent. So their value is less than the value of their phase 2 opponent.\n\nBut how does this affect the possible value of the opponent in phase 3?\n\nLet me think. The opponent in phase 3 has passed phase 1 (rule 1) and phase 2 (rule 0). So during phase 1, they were higher than their initial opponent. During phase 2, they were lower than their phase 2 opponent. Therefore, their value must be between some range. For example, during phase 1, their value is >=2. During phase 2, their value is less than their phase 2 opponent. But since the phase 2 opponent is someone who passed phase 1 (so >=2), their value could be anything as long as it's higher than the phase 2 opponent's value. \n\nBut how to model this for x? For phase 3, rule is 1. So x must be higher than the opponent. Therefore, the opponent must be lower than x. But the opponent has passed phase 1 and phase 2. So the opponent's value must be in the range that allows them to pass both phases. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose the opponent's value to be any value that is lower than x. However, the opponent must have passed phases 1 and 2.\n\nSo, during phase 1, the opponent's value must be higher than their initial opponent. During phase 2, they must be lower than their phase 2 opponent. But since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps the opponent can be any value that is less than x, but also satisfies that during phase 1, they were higher than someone and during phase 2, they were lower than someone else.\n\nBut how to model the constraints on x for this to be possible?\n\nFor example, suppose x is 4. Then, during phase 3, the opponent must be lower than 4. So the opponent's value is in [1,3]. But this opponent must have passed phase 1 and 2. For phase 1, they must have been higher than their initial opponent. So their value must be >=2. For phase 2, they must have been lower than their phase 2 opponent. So their value can be anything as long as there exists someone higher than them in phase 2. For example, if the opponent's value is 2, then during phase 2, their opponent could be 3, 4, etc. So yes, possible. Therefore, for x=4, it's possible to have an opponent in phase 3 with value less than 4.\n\nBut what about x=7? For phase 3, the opponent must be less than 7. So the opponent can be any value from 1 to 6. But this opponent must have passed phases 1 and 2. For phase 1, their value is >=2. For phase 2, their value must be less than their phase 2 opponent. So for example, if the opponent is 6, during phase 2, they must have been lower than someone. That someone could be 7, 8, etc. So yes, possible. Therefore, x=7 can be champion.\n\nBut what about x=2? For phase 3, the opponent must be less than 2. That means opponent is 1. But during phase 1, the opponent (1) must have been higher than their initial opponent. However, 1 is the minimum, so there is no such initial opponent. Therefore, the opponent cannot be 1. Hence, x=2 cannot have an opponent in phase 3 that is less than 2. Therefore, x=2 cannot be champion. Wait, but this contradicts the sample input where for n=3 and s=101, the output is 4 5 6 7. So according to this reasoning, x=2 would not be in the output. Which aligns with the sample output.\n\nSo this suggests that the approach of tracking ranges for each phase is possible, but how to model it?\n\nLet me think again. For each phase, the constraints on x are based on the rules of that phase and the previous phases.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each phase i, during that phase, the opponent must have passed all previous phases. The constraints on the opponent's value are determined by the rules of those previous phases. So, for phase i, the rule determines whether x must be higher or lower than the opponent. The opponent's value is constrained by the previous phases. \n\nBut how can we model the possible range of the opponent's value for phase i?\n\nPerhaps for each phase i, we can find the minimal and maximal possible value that the opponent can have. Then, based on the rule of phase i, we can determine the constraints on x.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's define for each phase i, the minimal and maximal possible value that a team can have after passing all phases up to i. For example, after phase 1, the possible values are determined by the rule of phase 1. After phase 2, the possible values are determined by the rules of phase 1 and 2.\n\nLet me denote for each phase i, the minimal and maximal value that a team can have after passing phases 1 to i. Let's call this min_val[i] and max_val[i]. \n\nFor example, phase 1:\n\nif the rule is 1 (higher wins), then the team must have beaten its initial opponent by being higher. So the team's value must be at least 2 (since there must be a lower opponent). So min_val[1] = 2, max_val[1] = 2^n.\n\nIf the rule is 0 (lower wins), then the team must have beaten its initial opponent by being lower. So the team's value must be at most 2^n -1. So min_val[1] = 1, max_val[1] = 2^n -1.\n\nFor phase 2, the rule is s[1]. Let's think about what the possible range of a team that has passed phase 1 and phase 2 can be.\n\nFor example, if phase 1 rule is 1 (so min_val[1] = 2, max_val[1] = 8 for n=3), and phase 2 rule is 0 (lower wins). So during phase 2, the team must be lower than its opponent. The opponent has passed phase 1 (so is in [2, 8]). Therefore, the team's value must be less than the opponent's value. But the opponent's value is in [2, 8]. Therefore, the team's value can be in [2, 7], because the opponent can be higher than it. So for phase 2, the team's value must be in [min_prev, max_prev - 1], where min_prev and max_prev are the min and max of the previous phase. Wait, but this is assuming that the opponent can be any value in the previous phase's range. So, if the current team's value is x, then there must exist an opponent y in [min_prev, max_prev] such that x < y (for phase 2 rule 0). Which is possible as long as x < max_prev. So the new max_val for phase 2 is max_prev - 1. The min_val remains the same as min_prev, since x can be as low as min_prev (as long as there exists an opponent higher than x).\n\nWait, but what if min_prev is 2, and x is 2. There exists an opponent y (like 3) which is higher. So yes, possible. Hence, for phase 2 rule 0, the new min_val is min_prev, new max_val is max_prev - 1.\n\nSimilarly, if phase 2 rule is 1 (higher wins), then the team's value must be higher than the opponent's value. The opponent has passed phase 1, so their value is in [min_prev, max_prev]. So the team's value must be higher than some value in that range. Which requires that the team's value is at least min_prev + 1 (since there exists an opponent with value min_prev). Hence, new min_val is min_prev + 1, and max_val remains max_prev.\n\nSo this seems to be a pattern. For each phase i, based on the rule, we can update the min and max values as follows:\n\nIf the current rule is 0 (lower wins), then the team's value must be less than the opponent's value. The opponent's value is in the previous min and max range. So the team's value can be as low as the previous min, and as high as previous max - 1. Hence:\n\nnew_min = prev_min\nnew_max = prev_max - 1\n\nIf the current rule is 1 (higher wins), then the team's value must be greater than the opponent's value. The opponent's value is in the previous min and max range. So the team's value can be as low as prev_min + 1, and as high as prev_max. Hence:\n\nnew_min = prev_min + 1\nnew_max = prev",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can become the champion of a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The tournament structure is such that each phase halves the number of teams until only one remains. The rules for each phase dictate whether the team with the lower or higher skill level wins each match.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament has $2^n$ teams and $n$ phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half.\n2. **Skill Level Constraints**: For each phase, based on the rule (0 for lower skill winning, 1 for higher skill winning), we adjust the possible range of skill levels that can win the tournament.\n3. **Range Adjustment**: Track the minimum and maximum possible skill levels that can win the tournament through each phase. For each phase, update these ranges based on the rule:\n   - If the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), the current team must have a lower skill than its opponent, thus adjusting the maximum possible value.\n   - If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), the current team must have a higher skill than its opponent, thus adjusting the minimum possible value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 2 ** n\n    min_val = 1\n    max_val = total_teams\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        rule = s[i]\n        if rule == '0':\n            # Current team must be lower than opponent\n            # So max_val decreases by 1\n            max_val -= 1\n        else:\n            # Current team must be higher than opponent\n            # So min_val increases by 1\n            min_val += 1\n    \n    result = list(range(min_val, max_val + 1))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer $n$ and a string $s$ of length $n$ representing the rules for each phase.\n2. **Initial Range Setup**: Start with the full range of possible skill levels from 1 to $2^n$.\n3. **Iterating Through Phases**: For each phase, adjust the range based on the rule:\n   - If the rule is '0', the maximum possible skill level is reduced by 1 because the team must have a lower skill than its opponent.\n   - If the rule is '1', the minimum possible skill level is increased by 1 because the team must have a higher skill than its opponent.\n4. **Result Construction**: After processing all phases, the valid skill levels are those within the adjusted range, which are printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible skill levels that can become champions by iteratively adjusting the range based on the tournament rules, ensuring an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of phases.",
