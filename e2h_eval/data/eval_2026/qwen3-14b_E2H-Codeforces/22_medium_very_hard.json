After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, my task is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input starts with n and m, then n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the first student's marks for three subjects.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (columns), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if in any of the subjects they have the maximum mark for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, but how do I process the data? Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string of m characters. Then, for each column (subject), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in a subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nBut how to process the columns? For example, for the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThe subjects are columns 0, 1, 2 (assuming 0-based). Let's look at each column:\n\nSubject 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2. So any student with 2 in subject 0 is considered best here. Students 1 and 2 (if 0-based or 1-based? Well, the problem says \"student number 1\" in the note. So maybe the students are 1-based. But for code, it's easier to process as 0-based.)\n\nWait, but the actual student numbering doesn't matter for the code. The code just needs to count how many students have at least one subject where they have the max for that subject.\n\nSo for each subject, find the max value. Then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max of that subject.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n strings, each of length m. Let's store them as a list of lists. For example, for each row, convert the string into a list of integers.\n\nThen, for each subject (column), compute the maximum value. For example, for column j, iterate through all students' marks in that column and find the max.\n\nOnce we have the max values for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max of that subject. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nSo, the code structure could be:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line as a string, then convert each into a list of integers. For example, for the first line, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nThen, for each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( all the marks in column j )\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student, check for each of their marks in each subject. If any of their marks in a subject is equal to max_marks for that subject, then they are successful.\n\nNow, how to compute the max for each column?\n\nFor example, for the list of students' marks, which is a list of lists. Let's say students is a list where each element is a list of integers. So students[i][j] is the mark of student i in subject j.\n\nThen, for each column j, collect all students[i][j] for i from 0 to n-1, and take the max.\n\nOnce we have that, for each student, check for any j where students[i][j] == max_marks[j]. If at least one exists, count the student.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nThen compute max_marks for each column:\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    col_max = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > col_max:\n            col_max = students[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(col_max)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions. For each column j, get the max of [students[i][j] for i in range(n)].\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max_marks for that subject.\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break  # break out of the inner loop once found\n\nSo that's the idea.\n\nNow, test the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nstudents is:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\n\ncolumn 1: 2, 3, 1 → max is 3.\n\ncolumn 2: 3, 2, 2 → max is 3.\n\nSo max_marks is [2,3,3].\n\nNow for each student:\n\nStudent 0: his marks are 2,2,3. Check for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2 == 2 → yes. So he is successful. So count increases by 1.\n\nStudent 1: marks are 2,3,2. Column 1: 3 equals max (3). So yes. Count increases by 1.\n\nStudent 2: marks are 1,1,2. For column 0: 1 < 2. column1: 1 < 3. column2: 2 < 3. So no. Not successful. So total count is 2. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo students:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 → max 8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nSo max_marks is [9,1,8,2,8].\n\nNow check each student:\n\nstudent 0: has 9 in column 0 (max), so yes. Successful.\n\nstudent 1: in column 2, 8 equals max (8). Also, column4 has 8, which is max. So yes.\n\nstudent 2: check each column. column 1: 1 equals max (1). So yes. So all three students are successful. Hence output 3. Which matches the second sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if all students have same marks in all subjects? For example, n=2, m=1. All students have 5. Then max_marks is 5. Each student has 5 in the only subject, so both are successful. Output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. The student is successful (since they are the best in the only subject). Output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [1, 2], student 2 has [2, 1]. max_marks for column 0 is 2, column 1 is 2. So student 1 has 1 in column 0 (not max), but 2 in column1 (max). So he is successful. Student2 has 2 in column0 (max) and 1 in column1 (not). So both are successful. Output is 2.\n\nSo code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nRead input: the first line is n and m. Then n lines follow. But in the input example given, the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per standard input. So for example, the first input line is two integers, then n lines of m characters each.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read n lines, each line being a string of m characters.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    # convert to list of integers\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nThen compute max_marks for each column.\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max_marks for that subject.\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That should do it.\n\nLet me test the first sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nstudents is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for columns:\n\ncol0: 2,2,1 → 2.\n\ncol1: 2,3,1 → 3.\n\ncol2: 3,2,2 →3.\n\nso max_marks is [2,3,3].\n\nstudent 0: 2 (col0) is equal to max, so count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: 3 in col1 → count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: none. So total 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nstudents:\n\nstudent0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks:\n\ncol0: 9,1,1 →9.\n\ncol1: 1,1,1 →1.\n\ncol2:7,8,1 →8.\n\ncol3: 2,2,1 →2.\n\ncol4:8,8,1 →8.\n\nso for student0, in col0 (9 ==9) → yes.\n\nstudent1: in col2 (8 ==8) → yes.\n\nstudent2: in col1 (1 ==1) → yes.\n\nso count is 3. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 followed by 5. Then output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1, then 5 and 5. Then max is 5. Both students have 5, so both are successful. Output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Input:\n\n2 2\n\n99\n\n99\n\nmax_marks for each column is 9 and 9. Each student has 9 in both. So both are successful. Output is 2.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when reading input, sometimes there may be leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each line is exactly m characters. So input().strip() may not be correct? Because if the line is, say, '223' then input().strip() is same as the original. But if the line has leading or trailing whitespace, but according to the problem description, the input is correct. So perhaps the code can just read the line as input().strip().\n\nBut for example, if the input line is '223\\n', then input().strip() would be '223', which is correct. So the code is safe.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of students in different subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    marks = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(marks)\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is split into integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line is read as a string and converted into a list of integers representing the marks of each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark achieved. This is stored in the `max_marks` list.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, check if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If it does, the student is counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject, leading to an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
