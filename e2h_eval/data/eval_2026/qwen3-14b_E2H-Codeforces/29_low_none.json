Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where there are multiple substitution queries applied to a string, and then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle these substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. Directly applying each substitution step by step would be too slow because each substitution could replace a digit with a long string, leading to O(n * m) time where m is the length of the string after substitutions. That's probably not feasible for large cases.\n\nHmm, so what's the alternative? Maybe we can model the substitutions in a way that tracks how each original digit contributes to the final number. Since substitutions are applied in order, and each substitution replaces a digit with another string, perhaps we can represent the transformations using some kind of dynamic programming or memoization approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea: think about each digit in the original string and track how it's transformed through all the substitutions. But since substitutions can overwrite previous ones, we need to process the queries in reverse order. Wait, no. Let me think again. Each query replaces a digit with another string. But if a digit is replaced in a later query, that affects the substitutions. For example, suppose first we have a query replacing '2' with 'a', then another query replacing 'a' with 'b'. But wait, the queries are only for digits. Oh right, the queries are of the form di → ti. So ti can be any string, but di is a single digit. So when processing a query, say, replacing '2' with '00', then any occurrence of '2' in the current string is replaced with '00'. However, if a later query replaces '0' with something else, that would affect those '0's that were generated from the previous substitution.\n\nSo the substitutions are applied in sequence. The problem is that if we naively apply each substitution, the string can grow exponentially. For example, if each substitution replaces a digit with a longer string, then after n substitutions, the string length can be O(k^n), which is impossible to handle directly for large n.\n\nTherefore, we need a way to represent the transformations without actually expanding the string each time. How can we do that?\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a mapping for each digit. Suppose we have a mapping for each digit that tells us what it gets replaced with. However, since substitutions can be applied multiple times, and each substitution may change the replacement of a digit, we need to track the current replacement for each digit.\n\nBut even so, if we have a digit d that is replaced by a string t, and then later another substitution replaces a digit in t, how do we track that?\n\nWait, but the substitutions are processed in order. So for example, if we have a query that replaces '2' with '00', and then a query that replaces '0' with '11', then the original '2's would become '00' which then become '1111'.\n\nSo the key is that each substitution affects the current state of the string. Therefore, the order of processing the queries matters. But how can we model the effect of each substitution on the entire string without actually building the string?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model for each digit, the value it represents after all substitutions. However, since substitutions can be nested, perhaps we can model this with a recursive function. For example, when we process a substitution for digit d, we can note that any occurrence of d in the string will be replaced by the string t. But when we process the substitution, we need to know what t is, and what substitutions have been applied to the digits in t.\n\nWait, maybe we can use a memoization approach. Let's think of each digit as being replaced by some expression. For example, initially, each digit d maps to itself. Then, when a substitution is made, say, d → t, we can update the mapping for d to be t. However, when we want to compute the value of a digit, we need to expand all substitutions recursively. But how to compute the value efficiently?\n\nBut since the problem requires the final number mod 1e9+7, perhaps we can compute for each digit, the value that it represents modulo MOD, along with the length of the number (since when you replace a digit with a string, the way it contributes to the overall number depends on the position of the digits in the string). Wait, that's a good point. For example, if a digit d is replaced by a string s, then when that digit is part of the original string, the contribution of that substitution depends on the position of the digits in s. However, since the original string is processed left to right, and substitutions can be nested, perhaps we need to track for each digit, two things: the value of the string it",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently handle multiple substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly applying each substitution step-by-step would be inefficient due to potential exponential growth in the string length. Instead, we use a dynamic programming approach to track the value and length of each digit after all substitutions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: We maintain two arrays, `val` and `len`, where `val[d]` represents the numeric value of digit `d` after all substitutions, and `len[d]` represents the length of the string that digit `d` maps to.\n2. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since we are interested in the result modulo $10^9 + 7$, we ensure all operations are performed under this modulus.\n3. **Processing Queries in Reverse Order**: By processing substitutions in reverse order, we ensure that each substitution is applied correctly based on subsequent transformations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            line = ''\n        else:\n            line = input[idx].strip()\n        idx += 1\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n    \n    # Initialize val and len for each digit\n    val = [0] * 10\n    len_ = [1] * 10  # Initially, each digit maps to itself, length 1\n    \n    for d in range(10):\n        val[d] = int(str(d))\n    \n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        d = int(di)\n        # Compute the value and length of ti\n        current_val = 0\n        current_len = 0\n        for c in ti:\n            c_int = int(c)\n            current_val = (current_val * 10 + val[c_int]) % MOD\n            current_len += len_[c_int]\n        # Update the val and len for digit d\n        val[d] = current_val\n        len_[d] = current_len\n    \n    # Now compute the final result from the original string s\n    result = 0\n    power = 1  # This represents 10^length_so_far\n    for c in reversed(s):\n        d = int(c)\n        result = (result + val[d] * power) % MOD\n        power = (power * pow(10, len_[d], MOD)) % MOD\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `val` and `len_` arrays where each digit initially maps to itself.\n2. **Reverse Query Processing**: By processing queries in reverse order, we ensure that each substitution is applied based on the most recent transformations.\n3. **Value and Length Calculation**: For each substitution query, we compute the numeric value and length of the target string `ti` using previously computed values for its constituent digits.\n4. **Final Result Calculation**: After processing all queries, we compute the final numeric value of the original string `s` using the updated `val` and `len_` arrays, taking care to apply the correct powers of 10 based on the lengths of substituted strings.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation even for large input sizes by leveraging dynamic programming and modular arithmetic.",
