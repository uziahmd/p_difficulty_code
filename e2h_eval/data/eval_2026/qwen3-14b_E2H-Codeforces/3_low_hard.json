Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum radius d that the lanterns need to have so that the entire street of length l is illuminated. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. Each lantern at position ai can light up points within distance d. So, the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on [0, l] is within d of at least one lantern.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, I think the key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would require the largest d to cover it.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would be a candidate for d. Similarly, if the last lantern isn't at l, then the distance from the last lantern to l is another candidate.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance between the first lantern and 0. That's one candidate for max gap.\n3. Check the distance between the last lantern and l. Another candidate.\n4. Then check all consecutive pairs in the sorted list, compute their difference, and take half of that (since the worst case is the middle of the gap between two lanterns, which would be (gap)/2 away from each).\n5. The maximum among all these values is the minimal required d.\n\nWait, right. Because for two consecutive lanterns, say at positions a and b (sorted), the maximum distance from any point in between to the nearest lantern is (b - a)/2. Because the middle point is (a + b)/2. The distance from that point to either lantern is (b - a)/2. So for that gap, the required d must be at least that value. So the maximum of all such gaps divided by two, and also the first and last edges.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Initialize max_d as 0.\n- Check the first position: if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to a[0] is a candidate. Similarly for the end.\n- Then for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference, divide by two, and see if it's larger than current max_d.\n- The answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, the positions are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nCheck first position: 0, so no contribution. Last position is 15, which is the end of the street, so no contribution. Now check consecutive differences:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5. Current max is 1.5.\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0. Max remains 1.5.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0. Same.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5. Now max is 2.5.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5. So the max is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5.\n\nAfter sorting: [2,5]. \n\nCheck first position: 2 - 0 = 2. So candidate is 2.0.\n\nCheck last position: 5 is at the end, so no contribution. Then between 2 and 5, the gap is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max between 2.0 and 1.5 is 2.0, which matches the sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=1, l=10. The lantern is at 5. Then the max is max(5-0=5, 10-5=5, and no gaps between lanterns). So d is 5. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 0 and 10. Then the gap between them is 10, so half is 5. But the first and last positions are already at the ends. So the max is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 0 and 5. Then the first part is 0, so no contribution. The last part is 10-",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ that lanterns must have to ensure the entire street of length $ l $ is illuminated. The key insight is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns and consider the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the radius $ d $.\n3. **Check Consecutive Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them and determine the maximum distance required to cover the midpoint of this gap, which is half the gap size.\n4. **Determine Maximum Distance**: The required radius $ d $ is the maximum value among the distances calculated from the endpoints and the midpoints of the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    if a[0] > 0:\n        max_d = a[0]\n    \n    # Check the last lantern\n    if a[-1] < l:\n        current = l - a[-1]\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    # Check between lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in sequentially checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Endpoint Checks**: The first lantern might not be at the start of the street (0), and the last lantern might not be at the end of the street (l). These distances are crucial as they determine the necessary radius to cover the ends of the street.\n- **Consecutive Gaps**: The maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns determines the worst-case scenario where the midpoint of the gap requires the largest radius to be illuminated. This is because the midpoint of a gap between two lanterns is the farthest point from either lantern within that gap.\n\nBy considering these three aspects (start, end, and midpoints of gaps), we efficiently determine the minimum radius required to illuminate the entire street.",
