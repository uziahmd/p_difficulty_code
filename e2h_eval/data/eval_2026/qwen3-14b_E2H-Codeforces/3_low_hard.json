Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l. \n\nFirst, I should think about how the lanterns cover the street. Each lantern covers a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). But since the street is from 0 to l, the coverage can't go beyond those points. So for the entire street to be covered, there should be no gaps between the coverage areas of the lanterns.\n\nHmm, so maybe the approach is to sort the lantern positions first. Because if they are sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum required d for those gaps. Also, I need to check the ends of the street. Like, the first lantern's leftmost coverage needs to reach 0, and the last lantern's rightmost coverage needs to reach l.\n\nLet me think through an example. Take the second sample input: 2 lanterns at positions 2 and 5, with street length 5. The first lantern covers [0,4] (if d is 2), and the second covers [3,5]. The gap between them is from 4 to 3? Wait, no, the first covers up to 4, the second starts at 3. So overlapping. So the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns is the distance between them divided by two? Or maybe the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns is (current - previous) / 2. Because if two lanterns are placed at positions a and b (a < b), then the middle point between them is (a + b)/2. The distance between them is (b - a). The maximum distance from either lantern to that middle point is (b - a)/2. So for that gap, the required d would be (b - a)/2. \n\nBut also, the first lantern's left end (0) needs to be covered. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a1. So the required d must be at least a1. Similarly, the last lantern's position is an, and the distance from an to l is l - an. So the required d must be at least that. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the first lantern to 0, and from the last lantern to l. Those are initial candidates for d.\n3. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them, divide by two. The maximum of these values is another candidate for d.\n4. The answer is the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for the first part, the first lantern needs to cover 0. So the distance between 0 and a1 is a1. So d must be at least a1. Similarly for the last lantern. And between two consecutive lanterns, the worst case is the midpoint between them. Because if the two lanterns are spaced by s, then the maximum distance from either lantern to the midpoint is s/2. So that's the required d for that gap. \n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the max between:\n\n- the first lantern's position (since 0 to a[0] requires d >= a[0])\n- l - last lantern's position (since a[-1] to l requires d >= l - a[-1])\n- and the maximum (a[i] - a[i-1])/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nThen the answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1, l=10. The lantern is at position 5. Then the required d is max(5, 10-5) = 5. Which is correct. If the lantern is at 0, then d must be l, since the lantern can't cover beyond 0 + d. So for the case where there's only one lantern, the maximum between a[0] and l - a[0] is the answer.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo the algorithm steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first position: max_d = max(max_d, a[0] - 0).\n\nCheck the last position: max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through the sorted array, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2.0\n\nmax_d = max(max_d, current_required)\n\nFinally, return max_d.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nNow, let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example input",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ such that all points on a street of length $ l $ are illuminated by at least one lantern. Each lantern can illuminate points within a distance $ d $ from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius $ d $.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the midpoint gap. The maximum radius required to cover this gap is half the distance between the two consecutive lanterns.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required minimum radius $ d $ is the maximum value among the distances calculated from the endpoints and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0] - 0.0)\n    # Check the last lantern\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in sequentially checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns efficiently.\n- **Endpoint Checks**: The first lantern's position determines how far it needs to illuminate from the start of the street, and similarly for the last lantern from the end of the street.\n- **Midpoint Gap Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance from either lantern to the midpoint of the gap between them is half the distance between the two lanterns. This ensures that the entire segment between them is covered.\n- **Result Calculation**: The maximum of all these calculated distances gives the minimum radius $ d $ required to illuminate the entire street.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is $ O(n \\log n) $, making it suitable for the given constraints.",
