Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose total duration equals exactly x, and their combined cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, return -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Let's break down the requirements:\n\nEach voucher has a departure day (li), return day (ri), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j (i≠j) such that their durations add up to x. Also, they must not overlap. Non-overlapping means either the first ends before the second starts (ri < lj) or the second ends before the first starts (rj < li).\n\nThe challenge is to find such pairs efficiently given the constraints of n up to 2e5. A brute-force approach checking all pairs would be O(n²), which is way too slow for n=2e5. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each voucher, we can check if there exists another voucher that doesn't overlap with it and has a duration of (x - duration of current voucher). But how do we find that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about pre-processing. Suppose for each possible duration d, we have a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we look for vouchers with duration (x - d) that don't overlap with it. But even then, how do we check for non-overlapping quickly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can process vouchers by their duration. Let's consider all vouchers sorted by their start and end times. For each voucher, we can find vouchers of the required duration that end before its start or start after its end.\n\nBut how to structure this? Let's think of the following steps:\n\n1. Precompute all vouchers grouped by their duration. For example, a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. This way, when we have a voucher with duration d, we can look up vouchers with duration (x - d) in the dictionary.\n\n2. For each voucher i with duration d, we need to find vouchers j with duration (x - d) such that they don't overlap with i. Then, take the minimum cost among all such j's.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal cost for j's that don't overlap with i?\n\nFor that, perhaps we can preprocess for each duration, the vouchers sorted by their end time and start time. Then, for a given voucher i, when looking for j's with duration (x - d), we can check for those that end before li, or start after ri. And among these, find the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to do that quickly?\n\nLet me think: For each duration k, let's have two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by their end time. For each voucher in this list, we can perform a binary search to find all vouchers that end before a certain date (like li of voucher i). Similarly, a sorted list by start time, so we can find all vouchers that start after a certain date (like ri of voucher i).\n\nBut even better, for each duration k, we can have two arrays:\n\n- One sorted by end time, and for each entry, keep track of the minimum cost up to that point. So for vouchers of duration k, sorted by end time, we can have a prefix min array. Then, for a given li, we can find the latest voucher in this sorted list that ends before li, and get the minimal cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case: vouchers of duration k sorted by start time, with a prefix min array. For a given ri, find the earliest voucher that starts after ri, and get the minimal cost from that point onward.\n\nWait, but how to structure this. Let's think of for each duration k, we have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time (so that we can find all vouchers ending before a certain day). And for each position in this sorted list, we can have a prefix minimum of the costs. So that when we find the last voucher in this list that ends before li, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimal cost for vouchers ending before li.\n\nSimilarly, sorted by start time (so that we can find all vouchers starting after a certain day). And for each position in this list, have a suffix minimum. So that when we find the first voucher in this list that starts after ri, the suffix min from that index gives the minimal cost for vouchers starting after ri.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into a dictionary grouped by their duration. For each duration k, store two sorted lists:\n\n   a. List of vouchers sorted by end time (ri), along with their cost. Also, a prefix min array for this list.\n\n   b. List of vouchers sorted by start time (li), along with their cost. Also, a suffix min array for this list.\n\nBut how to build these structures?\n\nFor example, for each duration k, we collect all vouchers with that duration. Then, for part a, we sort them by ri, and compute the prefix minimum. Similarly, for part b, sort them by li, and compute the suffix minimum.\n\nOnce this is done, for any voucher i with duration d, we can look for vouchers with duration (x - d). Let's call that target duration as t = x - d. If t is not present in the dictionary, then we can't use this voucher i. Otherwise, for each voucher i, we check two possibilities:\n\na) Find vouchers of duration t that end before li. The minimal cost among these would be the best option for the first part.\n\nb) Find vouchers of duration t that start after ri. The minimal cost among these would be the best option for the second part.\n\nThen, the minimal between a and b (if any) is considered for the current voucher i. We can track the global minimum across all such possibilities.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For all vouchers, group by their duration.\n\n- For each duration, pre-process the sorted lists and min arrays as described.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list, compute d = duration. Check if x - d is a valid duration (i.e., exists in the duration groups). If yes, then for that target duration t, check for vouchers that end before li (using the sorted end list and prefix min) and vouchers that start after ri (using the sorted start list and suffix min). Take the minimal of these two possibilities, and update the global answer.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i. However, since we are considering all vouchers in the group for t, even if there's a voucher j with same duration as i (but only if t is same as d?), but in that case, since x is the sum of two durations, if d + t = x, then if d = t, then x must be 2d. So for example, if x is 4 and d is 2, then t is 2. So when processing voucher i, which has duration 2, we need to check for other vouchers of duration 2 that don't overlap with i. But the group for duration t includes all vouchers of duration 2, including voucher i itself. However, when we check for vouchers ending before li, or starting after ri, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as i. Wait, but how?\n\nHmm, this could be a problem. Because if voucher i is in the group of duration t, then when we look for vouchers in that group, we might include voucher i itself. But in that case, since we need two different vouchers, we have to make sure that we don't select the same voucher twice.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nWell, for example, suppose we have voucher i with duration d, and target t = x -d. Suppose t is equal to d. Then, when looking for vouchers in the group t, which includes voucher i, but when checking if there's a voucher j in that group that ends before li (so that i and j don't overlap), but if j is i itself, then that would not be allowed. However, in that case, since j ends at ri, which is the same as voucher i's end. Wait, voucher i's li is the start of i, and the voucher j would have to end before li. So if j is i, then ri (voucher j's end) is ri, and li (voucher i's start) is li. So for j to end before li, we need ri_j < li_i. But voucher j is i, so ri_j is ri_i. So ri_i < li_i? That's impossible because li_i <= ri_i. Therefore, voucher i cannot be in the list of vouchers that end before li_i. Hence, when we process voucher i and look for vouchers in the group t (which may include i), the check for vouchers ending before li_i will not include i itself. Similarly for the other case. Therefore, even if the group includes voucher i, the logic of checking for vouchers that end before li_i or start after ri_i will exclude voucher i itself. Because voucher i's end is ri_i, which is >= li_i. So when looking for vouchers ending before li_i, voucher i's end is ri_i >= li_i. Hence, it's not included. Similarly for the other case. Thus, we don't need to worry about selecting the same voucher again. Therefore, the approach is safe.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Preprocess the vouchers into groups by their duration.\n\n- For each group (duration k), create two sorted lists:\n\n   a. sorted by end time (ri), and for each position, the prefix min of cost.\n\n   b. sorted by start time (li), and for each position, the suffix min of cost.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher i with duration d:\n\n   - Compute t = x - d. If t is not in the groups, skip.\n\n   - Else, check the group for duration t.\n\n   - For the group t, find the minimal cost of vouchers that end before li_i. How?\n\n      For the sorted end list of group t, we can binary search for the largest ri that is < li_i. All vouchers up to that index in the sorted end list are candidates. The prefix min array gives the minimal cost up to that index.\n\n   - Similarly, find the minimal cost of vouchers in group t that start after ri_i. For the sorted start list of group t, find the first li that is > ri_i. All vouchers from that index onwards are candidates. The suffix min array gives the minimal cost from that index.\n\n   - Take the minimal between these two values (if any) and add to the current voucher's cost. Update the global answer accordingly.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nFor each duration k, we need:\n\nsorted_end_list: list of vouchers sorted by ri, and for each position, the prefix min.\n\nsorted_start_list: list of vouchers sorted by li, and for each position, the suffix min.\n\nSo for example, for sorted_end_list:\n\nWe sort the vouchers by ri in ascending order. Then, create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers in the list.\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_start_list, we sort the vouchers by li in ascending order. Then, create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among vouchers from i to end of the list.\n\nOnce we have these, for a given li_i, we can perform a binary search on the sorted_end_list's ri values to find the rightmost voucher whose ri < li_i. Then, if such an index exists, the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost for vouchers ending before li_i.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start_list, we can perform a binary search to find the leftmost voucher whose li > ri_i. Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost for vouchers starting after ri_i.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, read all vouchers, compute their durations. Then, group them by duration.\n\nThen, for each duration group, process the sorted_end and sorted_start lists, along with their prefix and suffix mins.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher, check if x - duration exists in the groups. If yes, proceed.\n\nNow, for the binary search part, in Python, we can use the bisect module.\n\nFor example, for the sorted_end_list, which is sorted by ri. Let's say we have a list of end times, say ends = [v.r for v in sorted_end_list]. Then, for a given li_i, we can use bisect_left to find the insertion point of li_i in ends. The index would be the number of elements less than li_i. So the maximum index is insertion_point - 1. If insertion_point is 0, then no such elements. Otherwise, the prefix_min[insertion_point - 1] is the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start_list, which is sorted by li. We have starts = [v.l for v in sorted_start_list]. For a given ri_i, we want to find the first li in starts that is > ri_i. Using bisect_right for ri_i in starts, which gives the insertion point. All elements from that index onwards have li > ri_i. Then, the suffix_min at that index is the minimal cost in that subarray.\n\nNow, let's think about how to handle the prefix and suffix mins.\n\nFor the sorted_end_list:\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end_list[0].cost\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end_list[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start_list:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start_list[-1].cost\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(sorted_start_list[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1])\n\nOnce these are computed, during the binary search steps, we can quickly find the minimal cost.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nWe can use a dictionary, say duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are tuples (sorted_end_list, prefix_min, sorted_start_list, suffix_min).\n\nBut how to represent the sorted_end_list and sorted_start_list?\n\nEach voucher can be represented as a tuple (li, ri, cost). For each duration, we collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\nSo, for each duration k in duration_dict:\n\nsorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])  # sorted by ri\n\nsorted_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])  # sorted by li\n\nThen, compute prefix_min for sorted_end:\n\nprefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_end)\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\nfor i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n\nSimilarly for suffix_min for sorted_start:\n\nsuffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\nfor i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_min[i] = min(sorted_start[i][2], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher, we can process.\n\nNow, for each voucher (li, ri, cost), compute d = ri - li + 1. Then, t = x -d. If t is not in duration_dict, skip. Else, process as follows:\n\nFor the group t:\n\nCheck for vouchers ending before li. For that:\n\nsorted_end_list is the sorted_end for duration t. ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_end_list]\n\nWe can use bisect.bisect_left(ends, li) to find the insertion point. Let's call it pos. Then, if pos > 0, the minimal cost is prefix_min[pos-1].\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start_list of duration t. starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_start_list]\n\nWe use bisect.bisect_right(starts, ri) to find the insertion point. Let's call it pos. If pos < len(starts), then the minimal cost is suffix_min[pos].\n\nSo, the minimal between these two options (if available) plus current voucher's cost is a candidate for the answer.\n\nWe need to track the minimum of all such candidates.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\n- What if x is less than 2? Well, according to the input constraints, x is at least 2. Because in the input description, x is between 2 and 2e5.\n\nWait, the input says:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105). So x is at least 2. So for each voucher, the duration is at least 1 (since li <= ri, so ri - li +1 >=1). So for two vouchers, their durations sum to x. So x can be as small as 2 (each of duration 1). So that's okay.\n\nAnother edge case: when x is even, and there are two vouchers with duration x/2, but overlapping. Then, we need to find two non-overlapping ones.\n\nAnother case: when there are multiple vouchers of the same duration, but some non-overlapping.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, each with li, ri, cost. For each, compute duration = ri - li +1.\n\nGroup them in duration_dict.\n\nFor each duration in duration_dict, process sorted_end and sorted_start lists, and their prefix/suffix mins.\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nFor each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d = duration of voucher.\n\n   t = x -d.\n\n   if t not in duration_dict: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      process the group for t.\n\n      for the group, check for vouchers ending before li (current voucher's li).\n\n         get the minimal cost from that group.\n\n      check for vouchers starting after ri (current voucher's ri).\n\n         get the minimal cost from that group.\n\n      if either of these exists, then add current voucher's cost to the minimal of these and update the answer.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if the answer is still infinity, output -1 else the answer.\n\nBut how to handle the case where t is zero? Well, since x is >=2, and d is >=1, t = x -d can be zero only if x is 1, which is not possible. So no need to worry.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut how to handle the grouping. Let's think:\n\nImplementing the duration_dict as a defaultdict, where for each key (duration), we have the sorted_end list, prefix_min array, sorted_start list, suffix_min array.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps for each duration, we can precompute these structures once.\n\nSo:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    duration = r - l + 1\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\nfor l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n    duration_dict[dur].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\n# Now, pre-process each duration group\nprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_end_list, prefix_min, sorted_start_list, suffix_min)\nfor dur in duration_dict:\n    # process sorted_end list\n    sorted_end = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[1] )\n    # compute prefix min\n    prefix_min = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for v in sorted_end:\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, v[2] )\n        prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n    # process sorted_start list\n    sorted_start = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n    # compute suffix min\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sorted_start)-1, -1, -1):\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, sorted_start[i][2] )\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n    # store in processed\n    processed[dur] = (sorted_end, prefix_min, sorted_start, suffix_min)\n\n# Now, for each voucher, check\nans = float('inf')\nfor l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n    t = x - dur\n    if t not in processed:\n        continue\n    # get the processed data for t\n    sorted_end, prefix_min, sorted_start, suffix_min = processed[t]\n    # first case: find vouchers in t that end before l\n    # sorted_end is sorted by r (second element of the tuple)\n    # extract the end times for binary search\n    ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, l)\n    if pos > 0:\n        min_cost1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n        total = cost + min_cost1\n        if total < ans:\n            ans = total\n    # second case: find vouchers in t that start after r\n    starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n    pos = bisect.bisect_right(starts, r)\n    if pos < len(starts):\n        min_cost2 = suffix_min[pos]\n        total = cost + min_cost2\n        if total < ans:\n            ans = total\n\nif ans == float('inf'):\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(ans)\n\nWait, but in the code above, the 'processed' dictionary is built for each duration. But for each duration, the duration_dict is a list of (l, r, cost) tuples. Then, sorted_end is sorted by r (x[1]), and sorted_start by l (x[0]).\n\nBut in the code, the 'processed' dictionary is built with the key being 'dur', which is the duration. But when we process the voucher's duration, we have 'dur' and compute t = x - dur. Then, we check if t is in processed. But the 'processed' is built for all durations present in duration_dict. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about when t is zero? Well, since x >=2, and dur is at least 1, then t = x - dur can be 0 only if x=1, which is not possible. So no problem.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo, duration_dict:\n\n3: [(1,3,4)]\n\n2: [(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4)]\n\nprocessed for duration 2:\n\nsorted_end for duration 2: sorted by r. The vouchers have r=2,6,2. So sorted by r: (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1). Their r's are 2,2,6. So ends = [2,2,6]. prefix_min would be [5, 4, 1].\n\nsorted_start for duration 2: sorted by l. The l's are 1,1,5. So sorted_start is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. suffix_min for this would be [min(5,4,1) = 1, min(4,1) = 1, 1].\n\nNow, for each voucher:\n\nTake the first voucher (1,3,4, duration 3). t = 5 -3 = 2. Which is in processed.\n\nCheck for vouchers in duration 2.\n\nCase 1: vouchers ending before l=1. ends are [2,2,6]. bisect_left(ends, 1) → returns 0. pos is 0, so no.\n\nCase 2: vouchers starting after r=3. starts are [1,1,5]. bisect_right(starts, 3) → finds the insertion point after elements <=3. starts are [1,1,5]. 3 is between 1 and 5. bisect_right returns 2. pos is 2. len(starts) is 3. pos < 3 → yes. suffix_min[2] is 1. So total cost is 4+1=5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother voucher: the third voucher (5,6,1, duration 2). t = 5-2=3. So check if duration 3 is present. Yes. For that group, sorted_end is [(1,3,4)], ends = [3]. Check for vouchers ending before l=5. bisect_left(ends,5) → returns 1. pos is 1, which is >0. So prefix_min[0] is 4. So total cost is 1 +4=5. Also, check for vouchers starting after r=6. starts is [1], bisect_right([1],6) is 1, which is equal to len(starts) → no. So the minimal is 5. So ans is 5.\n\nSo the code would capture that.\n\nIn this case, the code would find the correct answer.\n\nNow, the second sample input:\n\n3 2\n\nVouchers:\n\n4 6 3 → duration 3 (6-4+1=3)\n\n2 4 1 → duration 3\n\n3 5 4 → duration 3.\n\nSo x is 2. For each voucher, duration is 3. t = 2-3 = -1. Which is not in the processed. So no possible pairs. Output -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when two vouchers with durations adding up to x, but overlapping.\n\nBut code would find that they are not in the non-overlapping regions.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat if there are multiple vouchers in the same group, and the code correctly finds the minimal cost.\n\nAnother thing: when building the starts and ends lists for binary search, in the code, for each processed duration, during the loop, for each voucher in the group, we have to generate the ends and starts lists. However, in the code above, during the processing of each voucher in the loop, we are generating the ends and starts lists by [v[1] for v in sorted_end], etc. But in Python, for each processed duration, during the initial processing, the sorted_end and sorted_start are stored. However, in the code, during the processing of each voucher, for the t duration, we have to generate the ends and starts lists again. But that would be O(n) per query, which would be too slow. Wait, no. Because during the initial processing, for each duration, we can precompute the ends and starts lists. For example, during the processing of the duration_dict, for each duration, we can store not only the sorted_end list, but also the list of ends (as a separate list). Similarly for starts.\n\nBut in the current code, during the processing of each voucher, when we need to perform the binary search, we are generating ends and starts lists by [v[1] for v in sorted_end], which is O(k) for each query, where k is the number of vouchers in the group. For large k, this would be expensive. For example, if there are O(n) vouchers in a group, and for each voucher in the original list, we process this group, then this would be O(n^2) time.\n\nAh! That's a problem. Because in the code as written, for each query, we are creating ends and starts lists by iterating through the sorted_end and sorted_start lists. For example, for each voucher, when processing t, we generate ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_end], which takes O(k) time. If there are many such queries, this would be very slow.\n\nThis would lead to O(n * k) time overall, which is not acceptable for n=2e5.\n\nSo, how to fix this?\n\nWe need to precompute the ends and starts lists for each duration group, and store them along with the sorted_end and sorted_start lists.\n\nModify the 'processed' dictionary to store for each duration, the sorted_end list, the ends list (for binary search), the prefix_min, sorted_start list, starts list (for binary search), and the suffix_min.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nfor dur in duration_dict:\n    sorted_end = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[1] )\n    ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n    # compute prefix_min\n    ...\n    sorted_start = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n    starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n    # compute suffix_min\n    ...\n    processed[dur] = (sorted_end, ends, prefix_min, sorted_start, starts, suffix_min)\n\nThen, during the voucher processing, for the t duration, we can access the ends and starts lists directly from the processed data.\n\nThis way, the ends and starts lists are precomputed once, and not generated each time during the voucher processing.\n\nThis is essential for efficiency.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nIn the preprocessing step:\n\nfor dur in duration_dict:\n    # process sorted_end list\n    sorted_end = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[1] )\n    ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n    # compute prefix min\n    prefix_min = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for v in sorted_end:\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, v[2] )\n        prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n    # process sorted_start list\n    sorted_start = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n    starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n    # compute suffix min\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sorted_start)-1, -1, -1):\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, sorted_start[i][2] )\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n    # store in processed\n    processed[dur] = (sorted_end, ends, prefix_min, sorted_start, starts, suffix_min)\n\nThen, during voucher processing:\n\nfor l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n    t = x - dur\n    if t not in processed:\n        continue\n    # get the processed data for t\n    sorted_end, ends, prefix_min, sorted_start, starts, suffix_min = processed[t]\n    # first case: find vouchers in t that end before l\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, l)\n    if pos > 0:\n        min_cost1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n        total = cost + min_cost1\n        if total < ans:\n            ans = total\n    # second case: find vouchers in t that start after r\n    pos = bisect.bisect_right(starts, r)\n    if pos < len(starts):\n        min_cost2 = suffix_min[pos]\n        total = cost + min_cost2\n        if total < ans:\n            ans = total\n\nThis way, the ends and starts lists are precomputed once.\n\nThis would reduce the time complexity.\n\nNow, this should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, testing for the first sample input.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when there are multiple vouchers in the same group, and the minimal cost is found.\n\nAnother case: when two vouchers are non-overlapping but in different groups.\n\nNow, code-wise, what about when the group t is the same as the current voucher's duration?\n\nLike, x is 4, and current voucher has duration 2. Then t is 2. So the group t is the same as the current voucher's duration. But as discussed earlier, the code would not select the same voucher, because the voucher's end is ri, which is >= l_i. So when looking for vouchers ending before l_i, the current voucher is not included.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nAnother possible error: when the voucher in group t has the same start and end as the current voucher. But since the code checks for non-overlapping, which requires that one ends before the other starts, it's handled.\n\nNow, let's think about the code's time complexity.\n\nPreprocessing steps:\n\nFor each duration, we sort the vouchers for end and start. Each of these is O(k log k) for k vouchers in the group. Sum over all durations is O(n log n) total.\n\nFor each voucher in the original list, during processing, we perform two binary searches (O(log k) each), and some O(1) operations. So overall O(n log n) time.\n\nThus, the code should be efficient enough for n up to 2e5.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, for the initial processing of the vouchers, the duration_dict is built with lists of (l, r, cost) tuples. Then, for each duration, sorted_end is sorted by r, etc.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        duration = r - l +1\n        vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n        duration_dict[dur].append( (l, r, cost) )\n    \n    processed = dict()\n    for dur in duration_dict:\n        # process sorted_end\n        sorted_end = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[1] )\n        ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        # compute prefix_min\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_end:\n            min_so_far = min( min_so_far, v[2] )\n            prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n        # process sorted_start\n        sorted_start = sorted( duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[0] )\n        starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        # compute suffix_min\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min( min_so_far, sorted_start[i][2] )\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        # store in processed\n        processed[dur] = (sorted_end, ends, prefix_min, sorted_start, starts, suffix_min)\n    \n    ans = float('inf')\n    for l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n        t = x - dur\n        if t not in processed:\n            continue\n        # get the processed data for t\n        sorted_end, ends, prefix_min, sorted_start, starts, suffix_min = processed[t]\n        # first case: vouchers ending before l\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, l)\n        if pos > 0:\n            min_cost1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n            total = cost + min_cost1\n            if total < ans:\n                ans = total\n        # second case: vouchers starting after r\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(starts, r)\n        if pos < len(starts):\n            min_cost2 = suffix_min[pos]\n            total = cost + min_cost2\n            if total < ans:\n                ans = total\n    \n    if ans == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code above, the 'processed' is built for each dur in duration_dict.

    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers whose durations sum up to the required value.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration group, we preprocess the vouchers to create sorted lists by their end times and start times. Additionally, we compute prefix minimums for the end-sorted list and suffix minimums for the start-sorted list. This preprocessing allows us to quickly query the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers.\n3. **Check for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with a duration that complements it to the required total duration. Using binary search on the preprocessed lists, we efficiently find the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost, duration))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n        duration_dict[dur].append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    processed = dict()\n    for dur in duration_dict:\n        # Process sorted_end and prefix_min\n        sorted_end = sorted(duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        # Process sorted_start and suffix_min\n        sorted_start = sorted(duration_dict[dur], key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        # Store in processed\n        processed[dur] = (sorted_end, ends, prefix_min, sorted_start, starts, suffix_min)\n    \n    ans = float('inf')\n    for l, r, cost, dur in vouchers:\n        t = x - dur\n        if t not in processed:\n            continue\n        sorted_end, ends, prefix_min, sorted_start, starts, suffix_min = processed[t]\n        # Check vouchers ending before current l\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, l)\n        if pos > 0:\n            min_cost1 = prefix_min[pos-1]\n            total = cost + min_cost1\n            if total < ans:\n                ans = total\n        # Check vouchers starting after current r\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(starts, r)\n        if pos < len(starts):\n            min_cost2 = suffix_min[pos]\n            total = cost + min_cost2\n            if total < ans:\n                ans = total\n    \n    if ans == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each represented by its start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration group, vouchers are sorted by their end times and start times.
