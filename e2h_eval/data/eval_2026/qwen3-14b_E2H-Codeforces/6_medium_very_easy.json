Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding two non-overlapping vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has a departure day li, return day ri, and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j where their durations sum to x, and they don't overlap. Also, i and j must be different.\n\nThe challenge is to find the minimal total cost for such pairs.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think. For each voucher, we can check if there exists another voucher that doesn't overlap with it and has a duration of (x - duration_i). So for each voucher, we need to find the minimum cost of vouchers that have duration d = x - duration_i, and do not overlap with it.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check for that?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, pre-process all vouchers by their duration. For example, group vouchers by their duration. So for a given duration d, we can quickly get all vouchers with that duration.\n\nThen, for each voucher i with duration d_i, we need to look for vouchers with duration d_j = x - d_i. And then check if there's a voucher j with duration d_j that doesn't overlap with i.\n\nBut how to find the minimal cost of such j vouchers?\n\nSo for each voucher i, we can compute d_i. Let's say d_i is a, then we need to find vouchers with duration b = x - a. Then, among all those vouchers, find the ones that don't overlap with voucher i, and take the minimum cost.\n\nBut how to find those vouchers efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that for each voucher i, checking all vouchers with duration b might be O(n) per voucher, leading to O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for n up to 2e5.\n\nWe need a way to query, for a given voucher i, the minimal cost of vouchers with duration b that end before li (so that they don't overlap), or start after ri (so that they don't overlap). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can pre-process for each possible duration, the minimum cost of vouchers that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day.\n\nWait, but for each duration, we can sort the vouchers by their end time, and have a prefix min array. Similarly, sort by start time and have a suffix min array. Or something like that.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have all vouchers with duration b. For a given voucher i, which has start li and end ri. We need vouchers with duration b that either end before li (so their ri' <= li - 1), or start after ri (so their li' >= ri + 1).\n\nSo for each duration b, we can have two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of end times, along with the minimum cost up to that end time. So for any given li, we can find the earliest end time that is <= li - 1, and get the minimum cost in that range.\n\nSimilarly, a sorted list of start times, along with the minimum cost from that start time onwards. For any given ri, find the earliest start time that is >= ri + 1, and get the minimum cost in that range.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nFor example, for each duration d, we can pre-process:\n\n- All vouchers with duration d, sorted by their end time. Then, for each end time, we can have a prefix minimum array. So that when we want to find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration d that end before a certain value, we can perform a binary search on the sorted end times to find the largest end time <= target, and then get the prefix min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the start times. Sort the vouchers with duration d by their start time, and create a suffix min array. For a given start target, find the first start time >= target, and then get the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into groups based on their duration. For each duration d, we have a list of vouchers.\n\n2. For each duration d, we process the vouchers in that group to create two structures:\n\n   a. Sorted by end time, with a prefix min array. This allows us to find the minimum cost of vouchers that end before a certain day.\n\n   b. Sorted by start time, with a suffix min array. This allows us to find the minimum cost of vouchers that start after a certain day.\n\n3. Then, for each voucher i with duration a, compute b = x - a. If b is not present in our duration groups, skip. Otherwise, check if there are any vouchers with duration b that do not overlap with voucher i.\n\n   For voucher i's li and ri, we need to find the minimum cost of vouchers in duration b that end before li (so that they are before i), or start after ri (so that they are after i).\n\n   So for the first case (end before li):\n\n   - In the duration b's sorted end times, find the largest end time <= li - 1. If such exists, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimum cost.\n\n   For the second case (start after ri):\n\n   - In the duration b's sorted start times, find the first start time >= ri + 1. If such exists, the suffix min from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\n   The overall minimum between these two possibilities (if any) would be the candidate for pairing with voucher i.\n\n4. Keep track of the global minimum across all such candidates.\n\nNow, the steps in code would be:\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. Let's create a dictionary, say duration_dict, where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers (each voucher is (li, ri, cost)).\n\nThen, for each duration d in duration_dict, process the vouchers for that duration to create the two structures.\n\nFor example, for each duration d, we can have:\n\nsorted_end = sorted list of vouchers by their ri (end time), and a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers in sorted_end.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_start = sorted list of vouchers by their li (start time), and a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among vouchers from i to end of the list.\n\nOnce these are preprocessed, for each voucher i, we can compute a = duration_i, then b = x - a. If b is not in duration_dict, skip. Else, check for vouchers in duration b that are non-overlapping with i.\n\nSo, for the current voucher i (li, ri, cost_i), we need to check:\n\nCase 1: Find vouchers in duration b that end before li - 1. The earliest possible end is <= li -1.\n\nCase 2: Find vouchers in duration b that start after ri + 1.\n\nFor case 1: in the sorted_end list of duration b, find the largest end time <= li - 1. If found, the prefix_min for that position gives the minimum cost.\n\nFor case 2: in the sorted_start list of duration b, find the first start time >= ri + 1. If found, the suffix_min for that position gives the minimum cost.\n\nWe take the minimum of these two possibilities (if any) and add it to the current voucher's cost. Then, keep track of the global minimum.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement the binary searches for these cases.\n\nFor case 1, sorted_end is sorted by ri. So for a target of li -1, we can perform a binary search to find the rightmost element <= target. Then, if such an index exists, the prefix_min at that index is the min cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, sorted_start is sorted by li. We need to find the leftmost element >= (ri + 1). Once found, the suffix_min from that index onwards gives the min cost.\n\nSo, for each duration d, we need to precompute sorted_end and sorted_start, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nNow, the steps to implement this:\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by duration.\n\nThen, for each duration d in the group:\n\n   sorted_end list: sort the vouchers by ri.\n\n   create prefix_min array for sorted_end:\n\n      prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0].cost\n\n      for i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n\n          prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\n   Similarly, sorted_start list: sort vouchers by li.\n\n   create suffix_min array for sorted_start:\n\n      suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1].cost\n\n      for i in len(sorted_start)-2 down to 0:\n\n          suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i].cost)\n\nOnce these are preprocessed, for each voucher i, we can check the two cases.\n\nNow, the problem is to handle the binary searches correctly.\n\nImplementing the binary search for case 1:\n\nIn Python, the bisect module can be used. For example, in sorted_end, which is sorted by ri, we can collect the end times into a list called ends. Then, for a target of li-1, use bisect_right to find the insertion point. The index is the number of elements <= target. So if the insertion point is k, then the elements up to k-1 are <= target. So if k>0, then the prefix_min[k-1] is the min cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, in the sorted_start list, which is sorted by li, collect the starts into a list called starts. For a target of ri+1, use bisect_left to find the first index where start >= target. Then, if such an index exists (i.e., index < len(starts)), then the suffix_min[index] is the min cost for that part.\n\nSo for example:\n\nFor case 1:\n\nends = [voucher.ri for voucher in sorted_end]\n\ntarget = li -1\n\nk = bisect.bisect_right(ends, target)\n\nif k > 0:\n\n   min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[k-1]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_cost_case1 = infinity\n\nSimilarly for case 2:\n\nstarts = [voucher.li for voucher in sorted_start]\n\ntarget = ri + 1\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(starts, target)\n\nif index < len(starts):\n\n   min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_cost_case2 = infinity\n\nThen, the total possible min for this voucher i is min(min_cost_case1, min_cost_case2). If either is possible, then we can take that and add to the current voucher's cost.\n\nBut wait, the voucher i is part of the duration a, and the other voucher is in duration b. So, when we check for vouchers in duration b, we need to make sure that they are not the same voucher as i? Well, since the problem says i != j. However, since the voucher i has duration a, and the voucher j has duration b. If a + b = x, then if a = b, then the voucher j could be the same as i? But only if x is even and a = x/2. However, in that case, when we check for vouchers in duration b (which is same as a), we need to ensure that the voucher j is different from i.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, suppose that voucher i has duration a, and x is 2a. So, when looking for vouchers with duration b = a. Then, during the processing, for voucher i, we may find that there's another voucher j with same duration and non-overlapping. But what if the voucher j is the same as i? Because in that case, we can't select the same voucher twice.\n\nBut in our approach, the group for duration b includes all vouchers with that duration, including voucher i. So, when we are looking for vouchers in duration b, which is same as a, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nThis is a possible problem. For example, if a voucher i has duration a, and x is 2a. Then, when considering vouchers in duration b = a, the same voucher i is in that group. However, when checking for non-overlapping, if voucher i's own duration is a, and we check if there's a voucher in duration a that doesn't overlap with it. But if the voucher is itself, then it would have to not overlap with itself, which is impossible because ri >= li, so ri >= li. So the voucher i's own start and end times would overlap with itself. Hence, when we find the minimum cost for case 1 or case 2, we need to exclude the possibility of selecting the same voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis complicates things. Because when we are considering vouchers in duration b, which may include voucher i, we need to make sure that when we find the min cost, we are not taking voucher i itself.\n\nBut how can that be handled?\n\nOne approach is, for each voucher i, when checking the group for duration b, to check if there exists any voucher in that group that is not i, and meets the non-overlapping condition.\n\nBut that seems tricky. How can we do that?\n\nAlternative idea: when we are looking for vouchers in duration b, which is x - a, and for voucher i, we can check if there are any vouchers in that group that are not overlapping with i. However, even if the group contains voucher i, but in case the voucher i is not overlapping with itself (which is impossible), but in reality, the voucher i's own start and end time is li and ri. So, for case 1, the voucher j would have end time <= li-1. Since voucher i's start is li, and its end is ri >= li. So voucher j's end is <= li-1 < li <= ri. So voucher j ends before voucher i starts, so they don't overlap. However, if voucher j is voucher i itself, then ri would be <= li-1. Which implies that ri <= li-1. But voucher i's duration is ri - li +1 >= 1. So ri - li +1 >=1 => ri >= li. So ri can't be <= li -1. Therefore, voucher j cannot be voucher i in case 1.\n\nSimilarly for case 2: the voucher j has start >= ri+1. Since voucher i's end is ri, so voucher j's start is after ri. So voucher i ends at ri, voucher j starts at ri+1. So they don't overlap. Again, if voucher j is voucher i itself, then li >= ri+1. But voucher i's li <= ri. So li >= ri+1 implies that ri >= ri+1, which is impossible. Therefore, voucher j cannot be voucher i in either case.\n\nTherefore, even if the group for duration b includes voucher i, when we are considering the case 1 or case 2, the voucher j cannot be i itself. Therefore, we don't need to worry about that. Because when we look for vouchers in the group, even if the group includes voucher i, the conditions of case 1 or 2 would exclude it. So our initial approach is safe.\n\nThat's a relief! So we don't have to worry about excluding the same voucher. Because in case 1, the voucher j ends before li-1, which is before voucher i's start. So voucher i's own end is ri >= li, which is larger than li-1. So voucher i cannot be in case 1. Similarly for case 2.\n\nSo that's handled automatically. Therefore, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to code this logic.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines of li, ri, cost.\n\nCompute for each voucher, the duration: duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup them into a dictionary: for example, duration_dict[d] is a list of (li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, for each d in duration_dict, process the list to create sorted_end and sorted_start, along with prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher in the original list, check:\n\na = duration of voucher i.\n\nb = x - a.\n\nIf b is not in duration_dict, skip.\n\nElse:\n\n   For the vouchers in duration b, find the min cost for case 1 (end before li-1) and case 2 (start after ri+1).\n\n   Take the min between these two options, and add to voucher i's cost. Update the global minimum if this is better.\n\nFinally, if the global minimum is found, output it, else -1.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut how to handle the data structures.\n\nImplementing the sorted_end and sorted_start for each duration.\n\nLet's think about for each duration d in duration_dict:\n\nsorted_end is a list of vouchers sorted by ri.\n\nsorted_start is a list of vouchers sorted by li.\n\nThen, for sorted_end, create a list of end_times (ri) and prefix_min.\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_start, create a list of start_times (li) and suffix_min.\n\nSo, for example, in Python:\n\nfor each duration d in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # sort by ri for case 1\n\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    # create end_times list\n\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n\n    # create prefix_min array\n\n    prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_end)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_by_end)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2])\n\n    # store this in some structure, perhaps a dictionary for each duration.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start:\n\nsorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nstart_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2])\n\nSo, for each duration d, we can store:\n\n- sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min.\n\n- sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min.\n\nBut how to store this? Maybe for each duration d, we have a tuple of (sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min).\n\nBut perhaps, for each duration d, we can precompute these and store them in a data structure.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher i, we can process.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers, storing them as a list.\n\nThen, build the duration_dict.\n\nThen, pre-process for each duration in duration_dict.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   a = duration_i = ri - li + 1.\n\n   b = x - a.\n\n   if b not in duration_dict: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      process for duration b.\n\n      get the sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min.\n\n      get the sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min.\n\n      for case 1:\n\n          target = li - 1.\n\n          using bisect.bisect_right on end_times to find k.\n\n          if k >0: case1_min = prefix_min[k-1]\n\n          else: case1_min = infinity.\n\n      for case 2:\n\n          target = ri + 1.\n\n          using bisect.bisect_left on start_times to find index.\n\n          if index < len(start_times): case2_min = suffix_min[index]\n\n          else: case2_min = infinity.\n\n      current_min = min(case1_min, case2_min)\n\n      if current_min is not infinity:\n\n          total = current_min + voucher_i's cost.\n\n          update the global answer.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, output the global answer if found, else -1.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if x is zero? No, since x is given as >=2? Wait, input constraints say x is between 2 and 2e5. So x can't be zero. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when a voucher's duration is x. Then, b = x - a = 0. But since vouchers have duration ri - li +1 >=1, so b=0 is invalid. So in that case, no possible pair. So during the code, for a voucher with duration a, if x -a is zero, then we skip.\n\nBut in code, when we check if b is in duration_dict, which will not be, since duration is >=1.\n\nAnother case: when x is 2, and there are two vouchers each with duration 1. Then, they need to be non-overlapping. So, for example, voucher1 is (1,1, ...), voucher2 is (2,2, ...). Then, their durations sum to 2, and they don't overlap.\n\nSo the code should find that.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the data structures.\n\nImplementing the duration_dict as a defaultdict(list), perhaps.\n\nBut for each duration d, we need to store the sorted_by_end, end_times, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, start_times, suffix_min.\n\nSo perhaps, for each duration d, we can precompute and store these in a dictionary, say, for example:\n\npreprocess = {\n\n   d: {\n\n      'sorted_end': sorted_by_end,\n\n      'end_times': end_times,\n\n      'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n\n      'sorted_start': sorted_by_start,\n\n      'start_times': start_times,\n\n      'suffix_min': suffix_min,\n\n   }\n\n}\n\nBut in Python, for each duration, we can compute and store these.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost) )\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor l, r, cost in vouchers:\n\n    duration = r - l + 1\n\n    duration_dict[duration].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\n# Preprocess for each duration\n\npreprocess = dict()\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # Process sorted by end (ri)\n\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n\n    # compute prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_end)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_by_end)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2] )\n\n    # Process sorted by start (li)\n\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n\n    # compute suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2] )\n\n    # save into preprocess\n\n    preprocess[d] = {\n\n        'sorted_end': sorted_by_end,\n\n        'end_times': end_times,\n\n        'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n\n        'sorted_start': sorted_by_start,\n\n        'start_times': start_times,\n\n        'suffix_min': suffix_min,\n\n    }\n\n# Now, iterate through each voucher\n\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor l, r, cost in vouchers:\n\n    duration_a = r - l + 1\n\n    b = x - duration_a\n\n    if b not in preprocess:\n\n        continue\n\n    # get the preprocess data for b\n\n    data = preprocess[b]\n\n    # case 1: find vouchers in b that end before l-1\n\n    end_times = data['end_times']\n\n    # find the rightmost end_time <= l-1\n\n    target_case1 = l -1\n\n    # using bisect_right\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_case1)\n\n    case1_min = float('inf')\n\n    if idx > 0:\n\n        case1_min = data['prefix_min'][idx-1]\n\n    # case 2: find vouchers in b that start after r+1\n\n    start_times = data['start_times']\n\n    target_case2 = r + 1\n\n    idx_case2 = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_case2)\n\n    case2_min = float('inf')\n\n    if idx_case2 < len(start_times):\n\n        case2_min = data['suffix_min'][idx_case2]\n\n    current_min = min(case1_min, case2_min)\n\n    if current_min != float('inf'):\n\n        total = current_min + cost\n\n        if total < min_total:\n\n            min_total = total\n\nif min_total == float('inf'):\n\n    print(-1)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(min_total)\n\nWait, but in the code, preprocess is built for each duration d. But when we check for b, we check if b is in preprocess. However, preprocess is built for each duration in duration_dict. But duration_dict is built from vouchers. So if a duration is present in duration_dict, then preprocess has it.\n\nBut the code is correct.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo, duration_dict has keys 3, 2.\n\nFor each voucher:\n\nFirst voucher has duration 3. b = 5 -3 = 2. So check for duration 2.\n\npreprocess for duration 2 has sorted_end and sorted_start.\n\nThe vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\n(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4). Wait, no. Wait, the vouchers are:\n\nOriginal vouchers:\n\nFirst voucher: l=1, r=3, duration 3.\n\nSecond: l=1, r=2, duration 2.\n\nThird: l=5, r=6, duration 2.\n\nFourth: l=1, r=2, duration 2.\n\nSo for duration 2, the vouchers are the second, third, fourth.\n\nSo sorted_by_end would be sorted by their r. So:\n\nsecond voucher: r=2.\n\nfourth voucher: r=2.\n\nthird voucher: r=6.\n\nSo sorted_by_end would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)] ?\n\nWait, no. The vouchers for duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: (1,2,5)\n\nvoucher 4: (1,2,4)\n\nvoucher 3: (5,6,1)\n\nsorted by r (ri) is 2, 2, 6. So sorted_by_end would be ordered as voucher 2, voucher 4, voucher 3. Or voucher 4, voucher 2, voucher 3? Because when sorted by ri, if two have same ri, their order depends on the other fields. But since we are sorting by ri, and for same ri, the order doesn't matter for the prefix_min.\n\nIn any case, the end_times for duration 2 would be [2, 2, 6].\n\nThe prefix_min would be min of 5, then min(5,4)=4, then min(4, 1) = 1. So prefix_min is [5,4,1].\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_start would be sorted by l. The l's are 1, 1, 5. So sorted_by_start would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. The start_times are [1,1,5]. The suffix_min would be [min(5,4,1), min(4,1), 1]. So suffix_min is [1, 1, 1].\n\nNow, for the first voucher (l=1, r=3, cost=4). duration_a is 3. b is 2.\n\ncase1: target is l-1 = 0. end_times is [2, 2, 6]. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0. So idx is 0, which is not >0. So case1_min is inf.\n\ncase2: target is r+1 = 3+1=4. start_times is [1,1,5]. bisect_left finds first index where start >=4. The start_times are 1,1,5. So looking for 4, the first element >=4 is at index 2. So case2_min is suffix_min[2] which is 1. So current_min is 1. total is 4 +1 =5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother voucher, for example, the third voucher (l=5, r=6, cost=1). duration is 2. x is 5. So b = 5-2=3. Check if 3 is in preprocess. Yes. For duration 3, the vouchers are the first one (1,3,4).\n\nSo for case1: target is l-1 =5-1=4. For duration 3, sorted_end is [(1,3,4)], end_times is [3]. bisect_right([3], 4) returns 1. idx>0 (1>0). So case1_min is prefix_min[0] =4. So case1_min is 4. case2: target is r+1=6+1=7. start_times for duration 3 is [1]. bisect_left([1],7) returns 1, which is >= len(start_times) (1). So case2_min is inf. So current_min is 4. total is 1 +4 =5. Which is same as before.\n\nThus, the code would find 5 as the answer.\n\nSo the code seems to work for the first sample.\n\nAnother test case is the second sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 --> duration 3\n\n2 4 1 --> duration 3\n\n3 5 4 --> duration 3\n\nEach voucher has duration 3. x is 2. So for each voucher, a is 3, so b is 2-3 = -1. Which is invalid. Hence, no possible pairs. Output is -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple vouchers with same duration and overlapping?\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=2. vouchers are (1,1,1) and (2,2,1). Each has duration 1. So x=2. So for each voucher, b = 2-1=1. So for first voucher, check for vouchers with duration 1.\n\ncase1: target is l-1=0. end_times for duration 1 is [1, 2]. bisect_right([1,2], 0) returns 0. case1_min is inf.\n\ncase2: target is r+1 =1+1=2. start_times are [1,2]. bisect_left([1,2], 2) returns 1. suffix_min[1] is 1. So current_min is 1. total is 1+1=2. So answer is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case where two vouchers are non-overlapping but same duration.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- What if there are multiple vouchers in the same duration and some are overlapping but others are not. The code should find the minimal.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses the same voucher in the preprocess for duration b. But as discussed earlier, the same voucher can't be selected because of the non-overlapping conditions.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code uses the preprocess for each duration, which is built from the vouchers. So it's okay.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut for large n, say 2e5, the code may have time issues. Let's think about the preprocessing steps.\n\nFor each duration, the code sorts the vouchers for that duration. The total time for all durations is O(n log n) in total, since all vouchers are processed once.\n\nThen, for each voucher, during the main loop, we perform two binary searches, which are O(log m) where m is the number of vouchers in duration b. So overall, the time complexity is O(n log n) which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nThus, the code should pass.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that in Python, for the preprocess, for each duration, we need to store the data. So the code is as written above.\n\nBut let's check for the case when x is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, x is at least 2, so no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when x is exactly the sum of two durations, but no non-overlapping vouchers. For example, two vouchers with same duration and overlapping. Then, output is -1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when building preprocess, for each duration in duration_dict. However, the code uses preprocess as a dict, and for each d in duration_dict, we process.\n\nBut in the code, during the for loop for each voucher, when checking if b is in preprocess. But preprocess is built from duration_dict, which is built from the vouchers. So yes.\n\nAnother thing: when x is 0, but according to the input constraints, x >= 2. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, code with proper handling of all steps.\n\nBut in the code, the preprocess is built for each d in duration_dict. However, in the code, the preprocess is a dict, and for each d in duration_dict, we process.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in Python, the code may need to import bisect and use it.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        vouchers.append( (l, r, cost) )\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = r - l +1\n        duration_dict[duration].append( (l, r, cost) )\n    \n    preprocess = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[d]\n        # process sorted by end\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        # compute prefix_min\n        prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_end)\n        prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_by_end)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2] )\n        # process sorted by start\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        # compute suffix_min\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n        suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2] )\n        # save into preprocess\n        preprocess[d] = {\n            'end_times': end_times,\n            'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'start_times': start_times,\n            'suffix_min': suffix_min,\n        }\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        duration_a = r - l +1\n        b = x - duration_a\n        if b not in preprocess:\n            continue\n        data = preprocess[b]\n        # case 1: end before l-1\n        end_times = data['end_times']\n        target_case1 = l -1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_case1)\n        case1_min = float('inf')\n        if idx >0:\n            case1_min = data['prefix_min'][idx-1]\n        # case 2: start after r+1\n        start_times = data['start_times']\n        target_case2 = r +1\n        idx_case2 = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_case2)\n        case2_min = float('inf')\n        if idx_case2 < len(start_times):\n            case2_min = data['suffix_min'][idx_case2]\n        current_min = min(case1_min, case2_min)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = current_min + cost\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the preprocess for each d, the code stored 'sorted_by_end' and 'sorted_by_start'?

This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers that can sum up to the required duration.\n2. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, preprocess the vouchers to create two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end date of the voucher, along with a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - Another sorted by the start date of the voucher, along with a suffix minimum cost array.\n3. **Check Non-overlapping Pairs**: For each voucher, determine if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration (such that their sum equals the given duration).
