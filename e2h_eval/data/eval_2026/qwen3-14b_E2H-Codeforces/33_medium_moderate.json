You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number with some given digits from a sequence to make the maximum possible number. Hmm.\n\nSo the problem says that each element in the sequence s can be used at most once. And I can choose any subset of them. The goal is to maximize the number a after replacements. Oh right, and the replacements can be done in any order, but each replacement uses one element from s.\n\nLet me think about the approach. To maximize the number, I should replace the leftmost digits as high as possible. Because the leftmost digits have higher place value. So for example, if I have a number like 1024 and the sequence is 010, then the best is to replace the first 0 (the second digit) with 1? Wait, but the sequence is 0,1,0. So the digits available are 0,1,0. So the best is to use the 1 to replace the first 0 (the second digit of a) to make 1124. That's the example given.\n\nSo the strategy would be: sort the sequence s in descending order. Then, for each digit in a from left to right, if there's a digit in s that's larger than the current digit, replace it with the largest possible available digit. Once a digit is replaced, we can't use that s digit again.\n\nWait, but how do I handle that? Let me think. For example, if s is sorted in descending order, then for each position in a, we check if the current digit can be replaced by the next available digit in s. Let me think of steps:\n\n1. Sort s in descending order. Because we want to use the largest digits first. Because replacing a higher position with a larger digit gives more gain.\n\nBut wait, maybe not. Suppose the s is [9, 8, 7], and the a is 1234. Then, the best is to replace the first digit (1) with 9, then the second (2) with 8, etc. So yes, sorting s in descending order and then greedily replacing the leftmost possible digits.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Sort the s digits in descending order. Let's call this sorted_s.\n\n- Then, iterate through each digit in a from left to right. For each digit, if the current digit is less than the next available digit in sorted_s, replace it and move to the next digit in sorted_s. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nWait, but how do we track which digits in sorted_s have been used? Well, since sorted_s is sorted in descending order, we can process them in order. For example, if we have sorted_s as [9,8,7,5,3], then we can iterate through a's digits, and for each digit, if the current digit is smaller than the next available in sorted_s, we take that digit and proceed. Otherwise, skip.\n\nSo, for example:\n\na is 1024. sorted_s is [1,0,0]. Wait, no. Wait the original s is '010', so the digits are ['0','1','0']. When sorted in descending order, it's ['1','0','0'].\n\nThen, we go through each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is '1'. Compare with the first element in sorted_s (1). Since it's equal, we don't replace. Because replacing with same digit doesn't help. So we move to the next digit in a.\n\nSecond digit is '0'. Compare with the first element of sorted_s (1). Since 0 < 1, replace it. Now, we take that 1, and move to the next element in sorted_s (which is 0). Then, third digit of a is '2'. Compare with next element in sorted_s (0). 2 is bigger, so no replacement. Then fourth digit is '4', compare with next element (0), no replacement. So the result is 1124, which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nAnother example: if a is 987 and s is 1234567. Then sorted_s is 7,6,5,4,3,2,1. Now, the digits of a are 9,8,7. For each digit, compare with sorted_s elements. The first digit is 9, which is larger than 7, so no replacement. Second digit 8 is larger than 6? No, 8 is larger than 6. So no replacement. Third digit 7 is equal to the next element (7?), wait sorted_s is 7,6,5, etc. So the first element is 7. So the third digit is 7. So since it's equal, we don't replace. So the output is 987. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort s in descending order.\n\nInitialize a pointer j starting at 0.\n\nFor each character in a's digits:\n\n   if j < len(sorted_s) and current digit < sorted_s[j], then replace it with sorted_s[j], increment j.\n\n   else, leave it as is.\n\nSo this way, we use the largest possible digits first, and replace the earliest possible digits in a that can be replaced.\n\nYes. That makes sense.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is two lines. The first line is a, which is a string. The second line is s, which is a string. For example, in the first example, the input is '1024' and '010'.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead a as input().strip()\n\nRead s as input().strip()\n\nThen, process s: sorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n\nThen, convert a into a list, because strings are immutable in Python. So for example, a_list = list(a)\n\nThen, j = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(a_list)):\n\n   if j < len(sorted_s) and a_list[i] < sorted_s[j]:\n\n       a_list[i] = sorted_s[j]\n\n       j += 1\n\n   else:\n\n       continue\n\nThen, the result is ''.join(a_list)\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros? The problem says that the output shouldn't have leading zeros. However, the original a doesn't have leading zeros. But when replacing digits, could we introduce leading zeros?\n\nFor example, if a is '100' and s is '000', then the code would replace the first digit (1) with 0. Which would make the number 000. But the problem says that the output shouldn't have leading zeros. So how to handle that?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the original a has no leading zeros. So, when we replace digits, the first digit can only be replaced with a digit that is larger or equal. Because if the first digit is replaced with a smaller digit, that would lead to leading zero. But the code above would not do that. Because sorted_s is sorted in descending order. For example, if the first digit is '1', and the sorted_s is ['0', ...], then the code would not replace it. Because 1 is larger than 0. So the code would not replace the first digit with a smaller one. Therefore, the resulting number will not have leading zeros.\n\nWait, but suppose the first digit is '1' and the sorted_s is ['1', '0', ...]. Then, the code would replace the first digit with '1'? Which is same as original. So no problem. So the code would not replace the first digit with a smaller digit. Because the sorted_s is in descending order. So the first element is the largest. So if the first digit of a is larger than the first element of sorted_s, then we don't replace. If it's equal, we can replace, but that's same. So the code would not introduce leading zeros.\n\nSo the code is safe. Because the first digit can only be replaced with a digit that's larger or equal. So the leading zero is not possible.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: a is '0', s is '0'. Then the code would replace it with '0' (but since it's already zero, no change). Output is '0'.\n\nCase 2: a is '123', s is '999'. Then sorted_s is ['9','9','9']. The code replaces each digit. So the result is 999.\n\nCase 3: a is '123', s is '99'. Then replace first two digits. So 993.\n\nCase 4: a is '999', s is '999'. Then all digits are same. So no change.\n\nAnother case: a is '111', s is '222'. Then replace all digits. Result is 222.\n\nAnother case: a is '111', s is '22'. Then replace first two digits, resulting in 221.\n\nAnother case: a is '100', s is '000'. Then sorted_s is ['0','0','0']. The code would check first digit '1' against '0', since 1>0, no replacement. Then second digit '0' against '0', no replacement. Third digit '0' against '0', no replacement. So the output is 100. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a is '100', s is '100'. Then sorted_s is ['1','0','0']. The code would replace first digit '1' with '1' (no change), then second digit '0' with '0' (no change), third digit '0' with '0' (no change). So output is 100. But what if the s is '100' and a is '100'? Then the code would replace nothing, but perhaps the code could replace the third digit with 0? But that's same as original. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: a is '100', s is '111'. sorted_s is ['1','1','1']. The code would check first digit '1' against '1' (equal). So no replacement. Then second digit '0' against '1' (replace, so becomes 1, j increments to 1. Then third digit '0' against '1' (replace, becomes 1. So the result is 111. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the sample input, the first input is '1024\\n010', which would be split into a being '1024' and s being '010'.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read the first line as a = input().strip(), then the second line as s = input().strip().\n\nThen, sorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True).\n\nThen, a_list = list(a).\n\nj = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(a_list)):\n\n    if j < len(sorted_s) and a_list[i] < sorted_s[j]:\n\n        a_list[i] = sorted_s[j]\n\n        j += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        continue\n\nThen, print(''.join(a_list))\n\nWait, but what about when the s is longer than the a's length? For example, a is '123' and s is '999999'. Then, sorted_s is ['9','9','9','9','9','9'], and the code would replace the first three digits, and the rest of the s elements are unused. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst case:\n\na is '1024', s is '010'.\n\nsorted_s is ['1', '0', '0']\n\nProcessing a's digits:\n\ni=0, a_list[0] is '1'. sorted_s[0] is '1'. Since 1 is not less than 1, no replacement.\n\ni=1, a_list[1] is '0'. sorted_s[0] is '1'. 0 < 1. Replace with '1', j becomes 1.\n\ni=2, a_list[2] is '2'. sorted_s[1] is '0'. 2 is not less than 0. No replacement.\n\ni=3, a_list[3] is '4'. sorted_s[1] is '0'. No replacement.\n\nResult is '1124', which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\na is '987', s is '1234567'.\n\nsorted_s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1'].\n\nProcessing each digit:\n\ni=0: '9' vs '7' → 9 >7 → no replacement.\n\ni=1: '8' vs '7' → 8>7 → no replacement.\n\ni=2: '7' vs '7' → equal, no replacement.\n\nSo the result is '987', which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: a is '0', s is '0' → output '0'.\n\nAnother test case: a is '0', s is '1' → replace the 0 with 1 → output '1'.\n\nAnother case: a is '123', s is '4321' → sorted_s is ['4','3','2','1'].\n\nProcessing:\n\ni=0: '1' < 4 → replace with 4. j=1.\n\ni=1: '2' < 3 → replace with 3. j=2.\n\ni=2: '3' < 2? No. So no replacement. So result is 433.\n\nWait, but the third digit is 3, and the next sorted_s element is 2. So no replacement. So the final number is 433.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead a and s, then process as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the first line as a, second as s.\n\nBut wait, in the input, the first line is a, which may have leading zeros? No, according to the problem statement, the given a doesn't have leading zeros. So no problem.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead a = input().strip()\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nsorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n\na_list = list(a)\n\nj = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(a_list)):\n\n    if j < len(sorted_s) and a_list[i] < sorted_s[j]:\n\n        a_list[i] = sorted_s[j]\n\n        j += 1\n\nprint(''.join(a_list))\n\nWait, but in Python, the sorted function returns a list. So sorted(s, reverse=True) is a list of characters.\n\nYes.\n\nYes, this code should work.\n\nBut let's test for the case where a is '100' and s is '000'. Then sorted_s is ['0','0','0']. Then the code would check for each digit:\n\ni=0: a_list[i] is '1', which is larger than '0' → no replacement.\n\ni=1: a_list[i] is '0' which is equal to sorted_s[0] (0). So no replacement.\n\ni=2: same as above. So the output is '100'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case where a is '100' and s is '100'. Then sorted_s is ['1','0','0'].\n\ni=0: '1' equals sorted_s[0], so no replacement. j remains 0.\n\ni=1: a_list[i] is '0' < sorted_s[0] (1). So replace with 1. j becomes 1.\n\ni=2: a_list[i] is '0' < sorted_s[1] (0)? No. So no replacement. So the result is '110'.\n\nWait, but sorted_s is ['1','0','0'].\n\nWait for i=0, the code checks if a_list[i] (1) is less than sorted_s[j] (1). It's not. So no replacement. Then j remains 0.\n\nThen i=1: a_list[i] is 0. sorted_s[j] is 1. So replace. j becomes 1.\n\ni=2: a_list[i] is 0. sorted_s[j] is 0. So no replacement. So the result is 110.\n\nYes. Which is better than original 100. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, this code should handle all the cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given integer by replacing its digits with a sequence of provided digits. The goal is to use the provided digits in such a way that the resulting number is the largest possible, without introducing leading zeros.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Sequence**: First, we sort the given sequence of digits in descending order. This allows us to use the largest available digits first, which is crucial for maximizing the number.\n2. **Greedy Replacement**: Iterate through each digit of the given number from left to right. For each digit, if it can be replaced by a larger digit from the sorted sequence, we perform the replacement. This ensures that we maximize the value of the number by prioritizing leftmost digits, which have higher place values.\n3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The original number does not have leading zeros, and our approach ensures that replacements do not introduce leading zeros by only replacing digits with larger or equal values when necessary.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na = input().strip()\ns = input().strip()\n\nsorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\na_list = list(a)\nj = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(a_list)):\n    if j < len(sorted_s) and a_list[i] < sorted_s[j]:\n        a_list[i] = sorted_s[j]\n        j += 1\n\nprint(''.join(a_list))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line is the integer `a` as a string, and the second line is the sequence of digits `s` as a string.\n2. **Sorting the Sequence**: The sequence `s` is sorted in descending order to prioritize using the largest digits first.\n3. **Greedy Digit Replacement**: We iterate through each digit of `a` from left to right. If the current digit in `a` is smaller than the next available digit in the sorted sequence, we replace it and move to the next digit in the sequence. This ensures that each replacement contributes maximally to increasing the value of the number.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all digits, the modified list of digits is joined into a string and printed, ensuring no leading zeros are introduced.\n\nThis approach efficiently maximizes the value of the given number using a greedy strategy, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, where n is the length of the sequence `s`.",
