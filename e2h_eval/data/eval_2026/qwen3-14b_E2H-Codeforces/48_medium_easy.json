He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, handling Roman numerals when needed.\n\nFirst, let me break down the steps:\n\n1. Read a and b (but b could be 'R').\n2. Read the number c as a string in base a.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n4. Then, if b is 'R', convert that decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n5. Otherwise, convert the decimal integer to base b as a string, without leading zeros.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the conversion from base a to decimal? Well, for the first part, since c is given as a string in base a, I can process each digit, multiply by a^position, etc. But since the length can be up to 10^3, I need to handle very large numbers. However, Python's integers can handle arbitrary precision, so that's manageable.\n\nBut wait, the note says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is <= 3000 in decimal. So when converting to Roman, the number is up to 3000. But for other cases, the number can be up to 1e15, which is okay for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Parse the input: first line has a and b. But for the case where b is 'R', we need to handle that. The second line is the number c in base a.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code:\n\nFirst, read the first line. Split into a and b. But for the case where b is 'R', we need to check that. For example, if the input is like '16 R', then b is 'R'.\n\nThen, read the second line as the string c.\n\nNow, convert c from base a to decimal. How to do that?\n\nFor example, if c is '1' in base 10, then decimal is 1. If c is 'A' in base 12, then it's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, for each character in c, we need to convert it to its value. For example, digits 0-9, then letters A-Z for higher values. But the problem says that in bases greater than 10, letters are used. So, for example, in base 12, digits go from 0-9, then A (10), B (11). So the conversion function must handle that.\n\nBut for the input c, the digits are valid for base a. So, for example, if a is 10, then c can have digits 0-9. If a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (but the problem says that the input is correct).\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal:\n\nWe can process each character in the string, and for each character, get its value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, etc. Then, compute the value as sum of digit * a^position, but processing from left to right.\n\nWait, but the standard way to convert a string in base a to decimal is to iterate through each character, and for each digit, multiply current total by a and add the digit's value. For example, for '123' in base 10: start with 0, then 0*10 +1=1, then 1*10 +2=12, then 12*10 +3=123.\n\nYes, that's the way to do it. So for each character in the string, we can process it as follows.\n\nBut how to handle the letters? For example, the characters can be 0-9, A-Z (uppercase?), but the input may have lowercase letters? Well, the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but the digits are valid for base a. So probably, the input uses uppercase letters for digits above 9. But the problem's examples have 'A' as a digit, like in the sample input where the input is '12 13\\nA', which is converted to 'A' in base 13. So that's 10 in decimal, and in base 13, it's 'A'.\n\nSo, the code for converting the string c to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the base is 10? Then, the digits can be 0-9. But the code would process 'A' as 10, which would be invalid. But the problem says that the input is correct. So the input c is a valid number in base a. So, the code can safely process each character as a digit in base a.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input '5 R\\n4', the c is '4' in base 5. Which is 4 in decimal. Then converted to Roman numerals is IV.\n\nSo, the first step is to convert c to decimal. Once that is done, then depending on whether b is R or not, we proceed.\n\nNow, the next steps:\n\nIf b is not R, then convert the decimal number to base b. How to do that?\n\nFor example, converting 4 to base 2 is 100. But the output must omit leading zeros. So, the code needs to generate the digits in base b, then remove leading zeros (if any), but if the number is zero, output 0. However, according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the input may be zero?\n\nWait, the input says that c is a non-negative integer. So, if the input is zero, then when converting to base b, the output is 0. However, the problem says that if Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So for other cases, the input could be zero. For example, if a is 10, c is 0, then converting to base 2 would be 0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So for the case when the decimal value is zero, but the output is not Roman, then we need to output 0.\n\nSo, the code for converting decimal to base b:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(str(remainder))\n        n = n // base\n    # Now reverse the digits\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    # Convert digits to the appropriate representation\n    # For digits >=10, use letters A, B, etc.\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if int(d) < 10:\n            res.append(d)\n        else:\n            res.append( chr(ord('A') + int(d) - 10) )\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nWait, but the digits in the code are stored as strings. Wait, no. Let's think again: when n is divided by base, the remainder is between 0 and base-1. So for example, if base is 16, then the remainder can be up to 15. So for each remainder, we need to convert it to the corresponding character.\n\nBut in the code above, the code is taking the remainder as an integer, then converting to a string. But for numbers >=10, we need to use letters. For example, 10 becomes 'A', 11 'B', etc.\n\nSo, the code for the conversion should be:\n\ndigits = []\nwhile n > 0:\n    remainder = n % base\n    digits.append(remainder)\n    n = n // base\ndigits = reversed(digits)\nthen for each digit in digits, convert to the appropriate character.\n\nSo, the code for the function:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]  # reverse the list\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append( chr(ord('A') + d - 10) )\n    return ''.join(res)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, for example, the first case is:\n\nInput is 10 2 and c is 1. So the decimal value is 1. Converted to base 2 is 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is '2 2\\n1111001' which is base 2 to base 2. The input is 1111001 in base 2. Let's see, that's 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converting to base 2 again would be 1111001, which is the same as input. So the output is '1111001' which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code for converting decimal to base seems correct.\n\nNow, the case where b is R. Then, the decimal number must be converted to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, how to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals?\n\nThe Roman numerals have specific rules. The standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nThe standard values are:\n\nM 1000\nCM 900\nD 500\nCD 400\nC 100\nXC 90\nL 50\nXL 40\nX 10\nIX 9\nV 5\nIV 4\nI 1\n\nSo, for example, the code can create a list of tuples like:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value-symbol pair, we check how many times the value fits into the number, append the symbol that many times, and subtract the value from the number.\n\nFor example, 4 is IV. So the code would process 4 as IV.\n\nSo, the function to convert decimal to roman:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman conversion is guaranteed to be <= 3000 and not zero. So this function will work.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead the first line: split into a and b. But note that b can be 'R'.\n\nRead the second line: c_str.\n\nConvert c_str from base a to decimal (as a Python integer). Then:\n\nif b is 'R', convert the decimal to roman numerals.\n\nelse, convert the decimal to base b, using the function decimal_to_base.\n\nBut need to handle the case where the decimal is zero. For example, if the input is a=10, b=10, c=0. Then output is 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So, in the code, when converting to Roman, the input is non-zero. So, the code can assume that.\n\nNow, the problem is to read the input correctly. But the input is given as two lines. The first line is two elements, which could be a and b, where b is 'R' or a number.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is given as something like '10 2\\n1' which is a=10, b=2. Then the next line is the c.\n\nSo, the code in Python would read the first line as input().split(), but perhaps there's a problem with reading the input correctly. Because in some cases, the first line may have two elements, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. For example, the first line is two values, then the second line is the c.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen, first_line = lines[0].split()\n\na = first_line[0]\n\nb = first_line[1]\n\nc_str = lines[1]\n\nWait, but the input may have multiple test cases? No, looking at the sample input, the first example shows that the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the input is two lines per test case. But the sample input shows multiple lines, perhaps as multiple test cases. But looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nSo, the input is five test cases, each with two lines. So the code needs to read multiple test cases. But how is the input given? The problem says that the input is given via stdin. So the code must read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the problem is presented in a way where each test case is given as two lines, and the code must process multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. Or maybe the sample input is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle one test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the code should read two lines. But the sample input shows multiple lines. However, the sample input is given as a list of inputs for different test cases. But the problem says that the code must read from standard input. Therefore, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first input line is \"10 2\" and the next line is \"1\", which is one test case. Then another test case with \"16 R\" and next line \"5\", etc. So the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input is two lines. So perhaps the sample input is a list of multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. But that contradicts the sample input. Therefore, I need to recheck the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains a and b, the next line contains c. So the code must read two lines. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. For example, the sample input may be multiple test cases, but the code must process a single test case. However, the sample shows that the code outputs multiple lines. But in the problem statement, the output is to write a single line. So this suggests that the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input and output shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of inputs for multiple test cases. The sample output is a list of outputs for those test cases. But the problem says that the code must read from stdin and print to stdout. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. But how?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. However, the sample output shows multiple outputs. Therefore, this suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement is unclear here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, each being two lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nSecond test case:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nThird test case:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nAnd so on. So the code must read all test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to read them in Python? Well, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of two lines, and process each group.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is two lines. So perhaps the sample input is a way to show multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle a single test case. However, the sample output shows that for each input, the code outputs one line. Therefore, perhaps the code must process a single test case, and the sample input shows multiple test cases for illustration.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So the code must process exactly two lines. Therefore, the sample input is probably a list of multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to read one.\n\nBut the sample input and output shows that for each input, the code outputs one line. So the code must process one test case. Therefore, the code should read two lines from stdin.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn Python, the code can read the first line with input().split(), then the second line with input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says nothing about multiple test cases. Therefore, I think that the code should process one test case. So the sample input is presented as multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is given as '10 2\\n1', which is two lines. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way where each test case is represented as a pair of lines. However, the actual code must read two lines.\n\nTherefore, the code will read two lines: the first line is a and b, the second line is c_str.\n\nNow, proceeding with that.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead a and b from first line.\n\nRead c_str from second line.\n\nConvert c_str from base a to decimal.\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert decimal to roman.\n\nElse, convert decimal to base b.\n\nNow, code for converting c_str to decimal:\n\nBut what about leading zeros? For example, c_str is '001' in base 10. That is 1 in decimal. The code for converting to decimal will process it correctly, as the code multiplies by a and adds the digit. For example, initial value is 0. Then, first 0: 0 * a + 0 = 0. Then next 0: 0 * a + 0 = 0. Then 1: 0 * a + 1 = 1. So yes.\n\nNow, code for converting c_str to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nBut need to make sure that the digits are valid for base a. However, the problem says that the input is correct, so no need to handle invalid digits.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead a and b. For example, first_line = input().split()\n\nBut a and b are given as two elements. So:\n\na = first_line[0]\n\nb = first_line[1]\n\nBut a and b are integers except for b which may be 'R'.\n\nWait, but the first line is two elements. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2', which is a=10, b=2. Another line is '16 R', which is a=16, b=R.\n\nSo, in code:\n\na_str, b_str = input().split()\n\na = int(a_str)\n\nb = b_str\n\nThen, c_str = input().strip()\n\nOnce we have that, convert c_str to decimal:\n\ndecimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nThen, process based on b.\n\nIf b is 'R':\n\nroman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n\nprint(roman)\n\nElse:\n\nconvert decimal_value to base b, using decimal_to_base function.\n\nBut what if the decimal_value is zero? For example, if c_str is '0' in base a. Then, the code returns '0' as the output.\n\nBut in the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So in the case of Roman, the code can assume that decimal_value is not zero.\n\nNow, code:\n\nPutting all together.\n\nBut code must handle the case when the decimal is zero. For example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c_str is '0', then the output is '0'.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the functions.\n\nBut in Python, the code must be written as a script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append( chr(ord('A') + d - 10) )\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    first_line = input().split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1]\n    a = int(a_str)\n    b = b_str\n    c_str = input().strip()\n    \n    # Convert c to decimal\n    decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n    \n    # Process based on b\n    if b == 'R':\n        roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n        print(roman)\n    else:\n        base = int(b)\n        converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n        print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nTesting this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\ndecimal_value is 1. Converting to base 2: 1. Output is '1' → correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5 → decimal_value is 5. Roman is V → output 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → decimal_value is 4 → IV → output 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → decimal is 121. Convert to base 2: 1111001 → output same as input.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → decimal is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' → output 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: input is 2 10 0 → output is 0.\n\nAnother case: input is 10 R 3000 → output is MMM.\n\nWhat about leading zeros? For example, input a=10, b=10, c_str is '000' → decimal is 0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: input a=10, b=16, c_str is '10' → decimal 10 → converted to hex is 'A'.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the function decimal_to_base returns '0' when n is 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the input is 0 and the output is base 2? Then the code returns '0'.\n\nBut what about when the decimal_value is zero and the target base is R? According to the problem statement, this case is not possible, since the input says that if Roman is involved, the number is not zero.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where c is zero and base is not R: output is 0.\n\nAnother case: converting a number that is zero in base a. For example, a=2, c_str is '0' → decimal is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base 1? But according to the input constraints, a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code doesn't have to handle base 1.\n\nWait, the input says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code can assume that a and b are in that range. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother case: when converting a number with letters. For example, a=16, c_str is 'A' → decimal is 10. Then converting to base 10 is '10'.\n\nAnother example: a=16, c_str is 'FF', which is 255 in decimal. Then converting to base 10 is '255'.\n\nAnother case: converting to base 25. For example, decimal value is 25 → in base 25, it's 10 (since 1*25 + 0 = 25). So the code would return '10'.\n\nBut in the decimal_to_base function, when the remainder is 25, which is 25, but the code is for base 25. So for example, 25 is 1*25 + 0. So digits are [1, 0]. Then, for each digit:\n\ndigit 1: less than 10 → '1'.\n\ndigit 0: '0'. So the result is '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: decimal value is 30, base 25. 30 / 25 is 1 with remainder 5. So digits are [1,5], which is '15'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle leading zeros in c_str. For example, c_str is '001' in base 10 → decimal is 1. Which is handled correctly.\n\nNow, the code seems to be correct. Let me code it accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base, which could be a Roman numeral. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting it to the target base or Roman numeral as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two values: the source base `a` and the target base `b` (which might be 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **Convert to Decimal**: Convert the input number from base `a` to a decimal integer. This is done by processing each digit of the input number and computing its value in base 10.\n3. **Convert to Target Base or Roman Numeral**:\n   - If the target base is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a predefined list of Roman numeral symbols and their corresponding values.\n   - If the target base is a regular integer, convert the decimal integer to the target base using division and modulus operations, handling digits above 9 with letters (A-Z).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef main():\n    first_line = input().split()\n    a_str = first_line[0]\n    b_str = first_line[1]\n    a = int(a_str)\n    b = b_str\n    c_str = input().strip()\n    \n    decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n    \n    if b == 'R':\n        roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n        print(roman)\n    else:\n        base = int(b)\n        converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n        print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **to_decimal Function**: Converts a string representation of a number in a given base to a decimal integer. Each character of the string is processed to compute its value in the target base.\n2. **decimal_to_roman Function**: Converts a decimal integer to a Roman numeral using a list of tuples that map decimal values to their Roman numeral equivalents.\n3. **decimal_to_base Function**: Converts a decimal integer to a specified base. For bases greater than 10, digits above 9 are represented by letters (A-Z).\n4. **main Function**: Reads input values, processes the conversion from the source base to decimal, and then converts the decimal value to the target base or Roman numeral as required, ensuring correct formatting and handling of edge cases like zero.",
