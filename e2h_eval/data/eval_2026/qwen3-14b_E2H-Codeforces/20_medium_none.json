    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem seems a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to compute the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a beautiful multiset is. For every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. The multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n. The maximum size of such a multiset is exactly f, and we need to count the number of c configurations that make this true.\n\nWait, but the question is about choosing the c_s values such that when you choose them, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, for each possible way of choosing the c_s's, we need to check if the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f, and count how many such c_s configurations exist.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about the constraints on the c_s's that would allow the maximum possible size of the multiset to be exactly f.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible size. What's the maximum size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s's?\n\nThis feels like a problem where the constraints form a tree-like structure. Each string s of length l can have two children: s0 and s1 (strings of length l+1). For a multiset to be beautiful, for each string s, the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be <= c_s. However, since the elements are of length exactly n, the count for a string s of length l is the number of elements in the multiset that start with s. For example, if s is of length l < n, then the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the sum of the counts of all strings of length n that start with s. But how does that relate to the c_s's?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a trie structure where each node represents a binary string s. The root is the empty string (but perhaps not considered here, since our s's are from length 1 to n). Each node has two children (0 and 1). The constraints for the beautiful multiset are that for each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree (i.e., the number of elements in the multiset that have s as a prefix) must be <= c_s. The maximum possible size of the multiset is the maximum number of leaves we can place in the trie without violating any of the constraints.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of leaves (elements of the multiset) that can be placed in the trie, given the c_s constraints. Then, the question is to count the number of c configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum? It seems similar to a problem where we have to assign capacities to nodes in a trie and find the maximum number of leaves that can be placed such that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree doesn't exceed its capacity.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be placed under it is constrained by the capacity of the node. Also, the children of the node can contribute their own maximums. For example, suppose we have a node s of length l. The maximum number of leaves that can be under s is min(c_s, max_leaves_children). Wait, but for the leaves to be in the subtree of s, they must be in the subtrees of either s0 or s1 (if l < n). So the maximum number of leaves under s is the sum of the maximum leaves under each of its children. However, this sum can't exceed c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves under s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves under its children.\n\nBut wait, for a node at level l (length l), the maximum number of leaves under it is the sum of the maximum leaves under its children (which are at level l+1), but that sum can't exceed c_s. However, for the leaves at level n (the bottom level), their children don't exist. So for a node at level n, the maximum leaves under it is 1 if we include it, but since the leaves are the elements of the multiset, which are of length n. Wait, perhaps the maximum number of leaves under a node s is the number of leaves in the subtree of s. So for a node at level l, the maximum is the sum of the maximum leaves of its children (if l < n), but constrained by c_s.\n\nSo, for example, if s is a node of length l < n, then the maximum number of leaves under s is min(c_s, left_max + right_max), where left_max is the maximum for the child s0, and right_max is for s1. If s is of length n, then the maximum is 1 (since each such node can contribute one leaf, but only if allowed by the constraints. Wait, no. For a node s of length n, the maximum number of leaves under it is 1, because the node itself is a leaf. However, the constraint for s is that the number of leaves in its subtree (which is just itself) must be <= c_s. So, the maximum number of leaves under s is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0. But how does that fit into the recursive formula?\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of leaves that can be placed in the subtree of s is determined as follows:\n\nIf s is a leaf (length n), then the maximum is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0.\n\nOtherwise, for each child (s0 and s1), compute the maximum number of leaves in their subtrees, then sum those, but take the minimum between that sum and c_s.\n\nSo the total maximum is the sum of the children's maximums, but not exceeding c_s.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming approach. For each node, compute the maximum number of leaves that can be placed in its subtree, given the constraints of the c_s's.\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset is then the value computed for the root (but the root here would be the empty string, which isn't considered here. Wait, no. The root would be the empty string, but the problem considers all binary strings of length 1 to n. So maybe the root is the empty string, and the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the maximum leaves for its children (the 0 and 1 strings of length 1). However, the problem says that the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. So the root's maximum leaves would be the total number of leaves in the entire trie.\n\nBut in our case, the problem is that the c_s's are given for all s of length 1 to n. So the root (empty string) isn't considered here. So perhaps the way to model this is that for each node (string s of length l), the maximum number of leaves under it is min(c_s, left + right), where left and right are the max leaves under the children. For leaves (l = n), the max is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0.\n\nTherefore, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the value computed for the root (the empty string?), but since the empty string isn't part of the c_s's. Wait, perhaps the empty string isn't considered. Because the constraints are for s of length from 1 to n. So for the root (empty string), there's no c_s. However, the maximum number of leaves in the entire trie is the sum of the max leaves under the children of the empty string (i.e., the 0 and 1 strings of length 1). But how is this handled? Because the empty string's maximum would be min(its c_s, sum of children's max), but there is no c_s for the empty string. So maybe the empty string isn't part of the problem's constraints. Therefore, the maximum possible size is the sum of the max leaves for the two children of the empty string (the 0 and 1 strings of length 1), but each of those is constrained by their respective c_s's.\n\nBut how do we model this? Well, the empty string isn't in the problem's constraints, so perhaps the maximum possible size is the maximum number of leaves that can be placed in the trie, considering that for each node s (from length 1 to n), the number of leaves under s is <= c_s. Therefore, the root (empty string) is not considered, but the maximum is calculated as the sum of the max leaves for its two children (the 0 and 1 of length 1), but each of those is constrained by their c_s's.\n\nBut regardless of that, the problem is to find all possible assignments of c_s's (each c_s can be between 0 and k) such that when you compute the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset (as per the above rules), it is exactly f.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of c configurations (each c_s for s in all binary strings of length 1 to n) where the maximum size computed as described equals exactly f.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this count efficiently, given that n can be up to 15. Let's think about the number of nodes. For n=15, the total number of binary strings of length 1 to 15 is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^15 = 2^(16) - 2. Which is about 65534. But for n=15, this is manageable? Well, even if we have to process all these nodes, perhaps some dynamic programming approach can be used.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the problem as follows:\n\nEach node (binary string s) has a value c_s (between 0 and k). The maximum size of the multiset is determined by the constraints on the nodes. We need to count the number of assignments of c_s's such that this maximum size is exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum size given the c_s's? As discussed earlier, it's a bottom-up process. For each node, starting from the leaves (length n) and moving up to the root (empty string), we compute the max leaves under it.\n\nSo for each node s of length l, the max leaves under s is:\n\nif l == n:\n    max_leaves = 1 if c_s >= 1 else 0\nelse:\n    max_left = max_leaves of child s0\n    max_right = max_leaves of child s1\n    max_leaves = min(c_s, max_left + max_right)\n\nThen, the total maximum size is the sum of the max_leaves of the two children of the root (the empty string's children, i.e., the 0 and 1 of length 1).\n\nBut for the problem, we need to count all possible c assignments where this total is exactly f.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 15, and the number of nodes is O(2^n), how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAn approach could be to model this as a DP problem, where for each node, we track the possible values of max_leaves, and then combine them according to the constraints. But with n=15, the number of nodes is 2^1 + ... + 2^15 = 2^16 - 2 = 65534. For each node, the possible values of max_leaves can be up to some value. But for the root, the maximum is up to 2^n (since each node can contribute 1 if allowed). However, since f can be up to 2e5, and n is up to 15, 2^15 is 32768, which is less than 2e5 for n=15. Wait, 2^15 is 32768, which is about 3e4. So for n=15, the maximum possible total is 2^15 = 32768. But the input allows f up to 2e5, which for n=15, if f exceeds 2^15, then the answer is zero. So in such cases, the answer is zero.\n\nSo first, for the given n, f must be <= 2^n. Otherwise, the answer is zero. Similarly, if f is larger than the maximum possible size given the constraints, which depends on the c_s's. Wait, but the problem requires that the maximum possible size is exactly f. So if f is larger than 2^n, then the answer is zero.\n\nSo the first thing to check is whether f exceeds 2^n. If yes, output zero.\n\nBut for the general case, we need to find the number of c assignments where the maximum size is exactly f.\n\nSo the problem becomes, for each node, determine the contribution to the maximum size based on the c_s's, and count the number of c assignments where the overall maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively. For each node, the value of max_leaves depends on the values of its children. So for each node, we can model the possible values of max_leaves, given the choices of c_s for that node and the choices for its children.\n\nThis suggests a dynamic programming approach where we process the nodes in order of increasing length (from n down to 1). For each node, we can compute the number of ways to choose c_s such that, given the choices for the children, the max_leaves for this node is a certain value.\n\nBut since the nodes are processed in order of decreasing length (since the max_leaves of a node depends on the max_leaves of its children), we can process them in order from the leaves (length n) up to the root (length 1).\n\nLet me think about this. For each node of length l, we can compute a DP table that maps possible values of max_leaves for that node to the number of ways to choose c_s for that node and the children (but the children's possibilities have already been computed).\n\nWait, but the children of a node of length l are nodes of length l+1. So for l from n down to 1, process the nodes of length l. For each node of length l, we need to know the possible values of max_leaves for its children (which have already been processed), and then compute for this node the possible max_leaves based on the c_s chosen for it and the children's max_leaves.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think for a node s of length l. Its children are s0 and s1 (length l+1). For each of these children, we have a DP table that tells us, for each possible value of their max_leaves, the number of ways to choose their c's (and their children's c's) to achieve that value.\n\nSo for the current node s, the possible max_leaves is min(c_s, left_val + right_val), where left_val is the max_leaves of s0, and right_val is the max_leaves of s1. But c_s can be chosen between 0 and k. For each possible left_val and right_val, the sum is left_val + right_val, and the min between that sum and c_s. However, since c_s is chosen, for each possible choice of c_s, we can compute what the max_leaves would be for this node.\n\nBut since we need to consider all possible combinations of left_val and right_val, and for each possible c_s, we can compute the contribution to the DP for this node.\n\nBut the problem is that for each node, the number of possible left_val and right_val combinations can be large. However, for a node of length l, the maximum possible left_val and right_val is 2^{n - l}, since each of their subtrees can contribute up to 2^{n - l} leaves (for example, a node of length l has (n - l) levels below it, so the maximum is 2^{n - l}).\n\nBut for n up to 15, and l from 1 to n, the maximum possible value for left_val and right_val is 2^{n - l}. So for l=1, the maximum is 2^{n-1}, which for n=15 is 32768. So the DP tables for each node could be of size up to 32768, but multiplied by the number of nodes. For n=15, the total number of nodes is 2^1 + ... + 2^15 = 2^16 - 2 = 65534. For each node, the DP table would be of size up to 2^{n - l}.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive. However, perhaps we can optimize by noting that for nodes of the same length, their DP tables can be computed similarly, and we can memoize or reuse some calculations.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, we can compute the possible max_leaves values based on the possible combinations of left and right values.\n\nLet me think about the steps again:\n\nFor each node of length l (processed in order from n down to 1):\n\n- For the node s, its children are s0 and s1 (if l < n).\n\n- For each possible value of left_val (max_leaves of s0) and right_val (max_leaves of s1), compute the possible contributions to the current node's max_leaves.\n\nBut for each node, the number of possible combinations of left and right is the product of the number of possible left_vals and right_vals. However, this could be very large, especially for nodes with l=1.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as convolution. For example, for each node, the possible sum of left and right is the convolution of the left and right possibilities. Then, for each possible sum, we can compute the number of ways to get that sum, and then for each possible c_s (from 0 to k), the max_leaves for the node is min(c_s, sum). But since c_s can be chosen independently, we need to account for all possible c_s values and their contribution to the max_leaves.\n\nWait, but for the node s, the choice of c_s affects the max_leaves. For a given sum of left_val and right_val (call it total), the max_leaves for the node is min(c_s, total). But since c_s can be chosen between 0 and k, for each possible total, we can compute how many choices of c_s will lead to a specific max_leaves value.\n\nBut here's the key insight: For each possible total (sum of left and right), the number of c_s choices that result in a particular value of max_leaves is:\n\nIf we want the max_leaves of the node to be x, then x must be <= total. Also, x must be <=k (since c_s can't exceed k). So for x <= min(total, k), the number of c_s choices that would make min(c_s, total) = x is:\n\nIf x < total: then c_s must be >=x and <= total. But since min(c_s, total) is x, which implies that c_s must be >=x and <= total. Wait, no. Wait, min(c_s, total) = x. That can happen in two cases:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1: x = total. Then, c_s >= total. But since c_s can be up to k, the number of choices is (k - total + 1) if total <=k. Else, zero.\n\nCase 2: x < total. Then, c_s must be >=x and < total. Wait, no. Because if c_s is >=x and < total, then min(c_s, total) is c_s, which is x. But that would require that c_s =x. Or wait, no. Suppose total is 5, and we want min(c_s, 5) =3. Then c_s must be >=3 and <=5. But min(c_s,5) would be 3 only if c_s is 3. Because if c_s is 4, then min(4,5)=4. So that's not correct.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nFor a given total (sum of left and right), and for a node s, the max_leaves is min(c_s, total). So for the node to have max_leaves = x, we need:\n\nx = min(c_s, total).\n\nWhich implies that:\n\nIf x <= total:\n\nThen, c_s must be >=x and <= total. Because if c_s is >=x, then min(c_s, total) is at least x. But also, if c_s is <= total, then min(c_s, total) is c_s. So for min(c_s, total) to be x, we need c_s =x. Wait, no. Because suppose total is 5, and x is 3. Then, if c_s is 3, min(3,5) =3. If c_s is 4, min(4,5)=4. So the only way for min(c_s, total) to be exactly x is if x is the minimum between c_s and total, which can be achieved in two scenarios:\n\nEither:\n\n- c_s >= total, and x = total.\n\nOR\n\n- c_s = x, and x <= total.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. For example, if total is 5, and x is 3. How can min(c_s, total) equal 3? It can happen if:\n\n- c_s is 3, and total is >=3. Then min(3, 5) is 3.\n\nOR\n\n- c_s is 4, and total is 5. Then min(4,5) is 4, which is not 3.\n\nWait, no. So the only way for min(c_s, total) to be exactly x is when x is the minimum between c_s and total. So:\n\nIf x = total, then c_s must be >= total. Because min(c_s, total) is total, which implies that c_s >= total.\n\nIf x < total, then c_s must be exactly x. Because if c_s is x, then min(x, total) is x. If c_s is greater than x but less than total, then min(c_s, total) is c_s, which is larger than x. So that's not allowed. If c_s is less than x, then min(c_s, total) is c_s <x, which is not allowed. So the only way for min(c_s, total) to be x is:\n\nEither:\n\n- x = total, and c_s >= total.\n\nOR\n\n- x < total, and c_s =x.\n\nSo for a given total, the number of c_s choices that result in max_leaves being x is:\n\nIf x == total: the number of c_s >= total and <=k. Which is max(0, k - total + 1).\n\nIf x < total: the number of c_s =x. Which is 1 (if x <=k) else 0.\n\nBut wait, what if x is greater than k? Then, even if x is less than total, but x >k, then c_s cannot be x, so it's zero.\n\nSo combining these, for a given total and x:\n\ncount = 0\n\nif x <=k:\n\n   if x < total:\n\n       count +=1 (only when c_s=x)\n\n   elif x == total:\n\n       count += max(0, k - x + 1)\n\nelse:\n\n   count remains 0.\n\nBut for x to be valid, it must be <=k. Also, x can't exceed total.\n\nSo, for each possible total, we can compute the number of ways to choose c_s such that the max_leaves for the node is x, for any x.\n\nBut how does this help us in the DP?\n\nLet me think again. For a node s of length l, which has children s0 and s1. Let's say that the possible max_leaves for s0 is A, and for s1 is B. Then, the total is A + B. The max_leaves for s is min(c_s, A+B). \n\nBut for the DP approach, we need to calculate, for each possible value of max_leaves for s, the number of ways to choose c_s and the possibilities for the children.\n\nSo for each node, we can compute a DP table that maps possible values of max_leaves (call it x) to the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's possibilities such that the max_leaves for this node is x.\n\nFor the leaves (nodes of length n), their children are none. So for a leaf node s (length n), the max_leaves is 1 if c_s >=1, else 0. So for this node, the possible x can be 0 or 1.\n\nThe number of ways to choose c_s such that x is 0 is the number of c_s values where c_s <1, i.e., 0 to 0 (since c_s is between 0 and k). So that's 1 way if k >=0 (which it is, since k >=1?), but wait k can be 0? Wait, the input constraints say 1 ≤ k, f ≤ 2e5. Wait no, looking back:\n\nThe input constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤15, 1 ≤k, f ≤ 2e5. So k is at least 1. So for the leaf node, the number of ways to get x=0 is 1 (c_s=0), and for x=1, it's (k - 0) ways? Wait, no. For x=1, the condition is that c_s >=1. Since c_s can be from 0 to k. So the number of possible c_s is (k - 0) if 1 <=k. Wait, no. The number of c_s values where c_s >=1 is (k) if k >=1. Because c_s can be 1, 2, ..., k. So that's k options.\n\nWait, for a leaf node, the max_leaves is 1 if c_s >=1, else 0. So for x=0: c_s must be 0 → 1 way (if k ≥0, which it is).\n\nFor x=1: c_s can be from 1 to k → k options.\n\nThus, for a leaf node, the DP table is {0:1, 1:k}.\n\nBut wait, no. Wait, the number of ways for x=1 is the number of c_s choices where the max_leaves is 1. Which is the number of c_s >=1. So that's (k) options, since c_s can be 1 to k (inclusive). So for the leaf node, the DP is:\n\ndp_leaf[x] = (number of ways to choose c_s for this node such that the max_leaves is x).\n\nSo for x=0 → 1 way (c_s=0).\n\nFor x=1 → k ways (c_s from 1 to k).\n\nBut what if k is 0? But according to the input constraints, k ≥1, so no problem.\n\nNow, for non-leaf nodes (l <n). For each node, we need to compute the number of ways to choose c_s and the children's possibilities such that the max_leaves for this node is x.\n\nTo compute this, we need to consider all possible combinations of left_val (from the left child's DP) and right_val (from the right child's DP). For each combination, compute the total = left_val + right_val. Then, for this total, compute the number of c_s choices that would result in a certain x for the current node, and multiply by the number of ways to get left_val and right_val.\n\nSo for the node's DP, the total number of ways is the sum over all left_val and right_val of (ways_left * ways_right * ways_c_s_for_total_and_x).\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThis seems like a convolution problem. For each node, the possible left_vals and right_vals are combined, and for each possible total, we calculate how many combinations of left and right give that total. Then, for each total, we compute the contribution to the current node's DP for various x values.\n\nBut with the DP tables for the children, we can compute for each node the convolution of the left and right possibilities.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's say for the left child, we have a list L where L[t] is the number of ways to have left_val = t. Similarly for the right child, R[t]. Then, the convolution C[t] is the number of ways to get left_val + right_val = t. This can be computed as the convolution of L and R.\n\nOnce we have the convolution C, for each possible total t, we can compute the contribution to the current node's DP for each possible x (which depends on t and the choice of c_s).\n\nSo for the current node's DP, for each possible x, we accumulate the sum over all t (total) of C[t] multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, t) = x.\n\nSo putting it all together, the steps are:\n\nFor each node, starting from the leaves (length n) up to the root (length 1):\n\n   if node is a leaf (length n):\n\n       dp_current[x] = number of ways to choose c_s such that max_leaves is x (as discussed earlier).\n\n   else:\n\n       get the left child's dp (L) and right child's dp (R).\n\n       compute the convolution C of L and R, which gives for each t, the number of ways to have left_val + right_val = t.\n\n       for each possible t (total), compute for each x the contribution to the current node's dp[x] as C[t] * ways_c_s(t, x).\n\n       sum these contributions across all t to get the current node's dp.\n\nOnce all nodes are processed, the root's dp (the root is the empty string, but how is it handled?) Wait, no. The root is not part of the nodes considered. The nodes are from length 1 to n. The root (empty string) is not part of the problem's constraints. However, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the sum of the max_leaves of the two children of the empty string (i.e., the nodes of length 1, '0' and '1').\n\nWait, the root (empty string) is not part of the problem's constraints, but the maximum size is computed as follows: for the empty string, the max_leaves would be min(c_root, left + right), but since there's no c_root, it's not considered. However, the actual maximum size of the multiset is the sum of the max_leaves of the two children of the empty string (the nodes of length 1). But how is that handled?\n\nWait, the empty string's children are the nodes of length 1. However, the constraints for the empty string are not part of the problem. Therefore, the maximum size is simply the sum of the max_leaves of the two children of the empty string. But since the empty string isn't part of the constraints, the sum of the max_leaves of '0' and '1' (the two children) is the maximum possible size of the multiset.\n\nWait, no. Because the max_leaves for the empty string would be min(c_empty, left + right), but since there's no c_empty, that's not part of the problem. Therefore, the maximum possible size is the sum of the max_leaves of the two children (the nodes '0' and '1') of the empty string. However, since the constraints for the empty string are not present, there's no limit on the sum of the children's max_leaves. Therefore, the maximum possible size is indeed the sum of the max_leaves of the two children of the empty string.\n\nBut how do we compute that? Because each node of length 1 (say, '0') has a max_leaves value, which is computed based on their own c_s and their children. For the root's children (the '0' and '1' nodes of length 1), their max_leaves is computed as min(c_s, left_child + right_child), where left_child and right_child are the nodes of length 2. So the sum of their max_leaves is the total maximum size.\n\nThus, after processing all nodes, the answer is the number of ways where the sum of the max_leaves for the '0' and '1' nodes of length 1 is exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute this sum? Well, for the two nodes of length 1, their max_leaves can be any value, and we need to count the number of assignments where their sum is exactly f.\n\nSo, the overall plan is:\n\n- For all nodes, compute their DP tables (possible max_leaves values and the number of ways to achieve them).\n\n- Once all nodes are processed, the '0' and '1' nodes of length 1 have their DP tables. We need to compute the convolution of these two DPs, and find the number of ways where the sum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we represent the DP tables for each node? For each node, we can store a dictionary or an array where the index represents the possible max_leaves value, and the value is the number of ways to achieve that value for the node.\n\nBut for n up to 15, and for each node, the max_leaves can be up to 2^{n - l} for a node of length l. For example, for l=1, the max is 2^{n-1}.\n\nBut for n=15, 2^14 is 16384. So for each node of length l, the max_leaves can be up to 2^{n-l}.\n\nSo, for each node, we can represent the DP as an array of size up to 2^{n} (but in practice, much smaller).\n\nBut how to handle the convolution for the children?\n\nLet me think of the steps again:\n\nFor each node in the trie, processed in order of decreasing length (from n down to 1):\n\n   if it's a leaf (length n):\n\n       create a dp array where dp[0] = 1 (ways to have max_leaves 0), dp[1] = k (ways to have max_leaves 1). All other entries are 0.\n\n   else:\n\n       get the left and right children's dp arrays.\n\n       compute the convolution of left and right, which gives the number of ways to have a total of t (sum of left and right's max_leaves).\n\n       for each possible t in the convolution:\n\n           compute the contribution to the current node's dp for each possible x (based on t and the choice of c_s).\n\n       sum these contributions to get the current node's dp.\n\nOnce all nodes are processed, the root's children (the two nodes of length 1) have their dp arrays. The answer is the number of ways that the sum of their max_leaves is exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute the convolution between the left and right children's dp arrays?\n\nConvolution can be done by iterating over all possible pairs of values from the left and right children's dp arrays, adding their counts for each possible sum.\n\nFor example, for left_vals and right_vals:\n\nfor each possible left_val in left_dp:\n\n   for each possible right_val in right_dp:\n\n       total = left_val + right_val\n\n       ways = left_dp[left_val] * right_dp[right_val]\n\n       add this to the convolution's count for total.\n\nThis is O(M^2) where M is the maximum possible value in the left and right dp arrays. For n=15, and for a node of length l=1, the maximum possible value for left and right is 2^{n-1} = 16384. So for each node of length 1, the convolution would take O( (2^{n-1})^2 ) time. For n=15, this would be 16384^2 = around 2.7e8 operations. But for each node, this may be too slow, especially since there are 2^1 + ... + 2^15 nodes. However, for n=15, the number of nodes is 2^16-2 = 65534. But for nodes higher up (like l=1), the convolution is expensive. However, for nodes deeper in the trie (like l=15, which are leaves), the convolution is not needed.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to optimize this. Let's think about the number of nodes for each level. For level l, there are 2^l nodes. For each of these nodes, the convolution is between their left and right children. For example, for l=1, each node has two children (l=2). For l=2, each node has two children (l=3), etc.\n\nBut for each level l, the number of nodes is 2^l. For each such node, the convolution of their children's dp arrays would take O(M^2) time, where M is the maximum possible value of the children's dp arrays. For example, for a node at level l, the children are at level l+1. The maximum value for their dp arrays is 2^{n - (l+1)} }.\n\nSo for level l, the maximum value for the children's dp arrays is 2^{n - (l+1)} }, and the convolution would take O( (2^{n - (l+1)} )^2 ) time per node. The total time for all nodes would be sum_{l=1}^{n-1} 2^l * (2^{n - l -1})^2 ) ?\n\nLet",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for `c_s` such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset of binary strings is exactly `f`. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) and convolution techniques to efficiently compute the required values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string `s` of length from 1 to `n` has a constraint `c_s` between 0 and `k`. The goal is to count configurations where the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming on Trie Structure**: Treat each binary string as a node in a trie. For each node, compute the maximum number of leaves (strings in the multiset) that can be placed under it, considering its constraints and those of its children.\n\n3. **Bottom-Up DP Calculation**: Start from the leaves (strings of length `n`) and move up to the root (strings of length 1). For each node, calculate possible values of maximum leaves using convolution of children's DP results.\n\n4. **Convolution for Combining Children's Results**: Use convolution to combine results from left and right children of each node to determine possible sums of leaves, which are then used to compute the current node's DP values.\n\n5. **Final Calculation**: After processing all nodes, compute the number of valid configurations where the sum of maximum leaves from the root's children (strings of length 1) equals `f`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        max_total = 1 << n\n        if f > max_total:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Precompute all nodes in order of decreasing length\n        # We'll represent nodes by their length and their binary string, but since we only need to process them in order, we can generate them level by level\n        # For each level l from n downto 1, process all nodes of length l\n        # For each node, store its dp array\n        \n        # We need to generate all nodes, but for DP purposes, we can process them level by level\n        # For each level l, process all nodes of that level, which have 2^l nodes\n        # We can represent the DP for each node as a dictionary or list, but for efficiency, use lists\n        \n        # For memoization, we can precompute for each level l, the dp arrays for all nodes at that level\n        # However, since nodes at same level have identical structure, perhaps we can compute once per level and multiply accordingly?\n        # No, because each node's children are different, but for the same level, the structure is same, so their dp arrays would be same.\n        # Wait, no.

For leaves (level `n`), initialize the DP array based on possible values of `c_s`.\n\n4. **Bottom-Up DP Calculation**: For each level from `n-1` down to `1`, compute the convolution of the DP arrays of the children nodes. This convolution helps determine the number of ways to achieve each possible sum of leaves from the children.\n\n5. **Final Convolution**: After processing all levels, compute the convolution of the DP arrays of the root's children (level `1`). The result at index `f` gives the number of valid configurations.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required values using dynamic programming and convolution, ensuring the solution handles the constraints effectively.",

Thus, we can compute once per level, and multiply by the number of nodes at that level.\n        \n        # So, we can optimize by computing the DP for one node at each level, then multiply by the number of nodes at that level.\n        \n        # Let's proceed with this optimization.\n        \n        # For each level l from n downto 1:\n        #   if l == n:\n        #       dp for each node is [1, k]\n        #   else:\n        #       get the dp of the children (level l+1)\n        #       compute convolution of left and right children's dp\n        #       compute the current node's dp based on convolution and possible c_s choices\n        \n        # So we can track for each level l, the dp array for a node at that level.\n        # Since all nodes at same level have same dp array, we can compute once.\n        \n        # Initialize a list of dp arrays for each level\n        # dp_levels[l] will be the dp array for a node at level l\n        dp_levels = [None] * (n + 2)  # levels 1..n\n        \n        # Process level n first (leaves)\n        max_val_n = 1\n        dp_levels[n] = [0] * (max_val_n + 1)\n        dp_levels[n][0] = 1  # ways to have max_leaves 0\n        dp_levels[n][1] = k  # ways to have max_leaves 1\n        \n        for l in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            # For level l, the children are at level l+1\n            # Get the dp array for level l+1\n            child_dp = dp_levels[l+1]\n            max_child_val = len(child_dp) - 1\n            # Compute convolution of child_dp with itself (since left and right children have same dp)\n            # Convolution result will be for possible total t\n            conv = [0] * (2 * max_child_val + 1)\n            for a in range(len(child_dp)):\n                for b in range(len(child_dp)):\n                    conv[a + b] = (conv[a + b] + child_dp[a] * child_dp[b]) % MOD\n            \n            # Now, for each possible total t, compute contribution to current node's dp\n            current_dp = [0] * (2 * max_child_val + 1)\n            for t in range(len(conv)):\n                ways = conv[t]\n                if ways == 0:\n                    continue\n                # Now, for this total t, compute how many ways to choose c_s to get x\n                # x can be from 0 to min(t, k)\n                # For x < t: only when c_s = x\n                # For x = t: c_s >= t\n                # So for each x, accumulate the ways\n                # But we need to build current_dp[x] for x up to min(t, k)\n                # However, since current_dp is for this node, which can have max_leaves up to min(t, k)\n                # But for our purposes, we can compute for all possible x and accumulate into current_dp[x]\n                # However, for large t, it's better to compute x up to min(t, k)\n                \n                # For x = 0: only if t == 0 and c_s = 0\n                # But in our case, t is a + b, which for l < n, the children are level l+1, which for l = n-1, the children are level n (which can have max 1)\n                # So for l < n, the maximum t is 2 * 1 = 2, etc.\n                # But regardless, for each t, process all possible x.\n                # However, for efficiency, we can process x up to min(t, k)\n                \n                # For x in 0 to min(t, k):\n                #   if x < t: add ways * 1 if x <=k\n                #   elif x == t: add ways * (k - t + 1) if t <=k\n                \n                # But since the current_dp needs to be built for all possible x, we can loop through x:\n                # However, for large t, this might be time-consuming.
