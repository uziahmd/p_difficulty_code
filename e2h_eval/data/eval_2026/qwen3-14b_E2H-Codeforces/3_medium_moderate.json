Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up points within a distance d from it. So I need to find the smallest d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. So how to approach this? Well, the key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would require the largest d.\n\nWait, but also considering the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position divided by two would be a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street. Because the lanterns might not cover the very start or end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because the order of the lanterns matters when checking consecutive gaps.\n2. Check the distance between the start of the street (0) and the first lantern. The required d here would be (a[0] - 0) / 2. But wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then that part is covered.\n3. Similarly, check the distance between the last lantern and the end of the street (l). The required d here is (l - a[-1])/2.\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns would require that the d is half of that gap. Because the middle of that gap would be the farthest point from either lantern. For example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, the middle is 2 units away from each. So d needs to be at least 2 to cover that point.\n5. The answer is the maximum among all these values: the initial part, the end part, and the maximum consecutive gap divided by two.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? Then, the maximum gap would be between the start and the lantern, and between the lantern and the end. So in that case, we take the maximum of those two.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial gap (a[0] - 0), divide by 2.\n- Compute the end gap (l - a[-1]), divide by 2.\n- For each consecutive pair, compute their difference, divide by 2, and track the maximum.\n- The overall answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me think about some examples.\n\nTake the second sample input: 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nAfter sorting, the positions are [2,5]. \n\nThe initial gap is 2-0 = 2, divided by 2 is 1. The end gap is 5-5=0, divided by 2 is 0. The consecutive gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum of 1, 0, 1.5 is 1.5. But the sample output is 2.0. Wait, that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait wait no. Wait the sample input says the second example is:\n\nInput: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Output is 2.0.\n\nWait according to the note, the first lantern covers [0,4], the second covers [3,5]. So the maximum d is 2.0.\n\nBut according to my approach, the initial gap is 2-0 = 2, divided by 2 is 1. The end gap is 5-5=0. The consecutive gap is 5-2=3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So maximum is 1.5. But sample output is 2.0. So why is that?\n\nOh! Oh right! Because the consecutive gap is between 2 and 5. The distance is 3. The middle is at 3.5. The distance from 2 is 1.5, and from 5 is 1.5. So the required d is 1.5. But according to the sample, the answer is 2.0. Wait why?\n\nWait the sample says that d is 2.0. But according to this calculation, 1.5 would suffice. But that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample input is 2 5, and the lanterns are at 2 and 5. So the street is from 0 to 5. The first lantern is at 2. Its coverage is from 2 -d to 2 +d. The second is at 5, coverage from 5 -d to 5 +d. But since the street ends at 5, the coverage of the second lantern is up to 5. So for the entire street to be covered, the point 0 must be covered by the first lantern. The first lantern's coverage starts at 2 -d. So 0 must be >= 2 -d. Which implies that d >= 2. Because 0 is at the left end. So for the first lantern, the distance from 0 to 2 is 2. So d must be at least 2. So the initial gap is 2. So in this case, the maximum between 2/2=1 (initial gap) and 1.5 (consecutive gap) and 0 (end gap) is 1.5, but the correct answer is 2.0. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh no! Because my approach is wrong. Because the initial gap is not (a[0] - 0) / 2. Because the first lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the distance between 0 and a[0] is a[0] - 0. So the required d is that distance. Because if the lantern is at a[0], then the coverage extends to a[0] -d. To reach 0, we need a[0] -d <= 0 => d >= a[0]. So the required d for the initial part is a[0], not a[0]/2. Wait that's conflicting with my previous reasoning.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine this.\n\nSuppose the first lantern is at position x. The street starts at 0. The lantern's light can reach up to x - d (left side) and x +d (right side). But since the street is from 0 to l, the leftmost part of the street is 0. So to cover 0, we need that 0 is within the range of the lantern. That is, 0 must be >= x -d. So d must be >= x - 0. Because x -d <= 0 => d >= x. Because x is positive. Wait, for example, if the lantern is at 2, then to cover 0, the distance from the lantern to 0 is 2. So d must be at least 2. Because the lantern's coverage extends to 2 -d. So 2 -d <= 0 => d >= 2. So the required d for the initial part is a[0] - 0. Similarly, for the end part, the lantern's coverage must reach l. So the last lantern is at a[-1]. The distance between a[-1] and l is l - a[-1]. So d must be at least that. Because the lantern's coverage extends to a[-1] +d. So a[-1] +d >= l => d >= l - a[-1].\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the initial gap is (a[0] - 0)/2. That was wrong. Oh no! That was a big mistake. So what's the correct approach here?\n\nSo the problem is that the initial and end parts are not handled by considering the gaps between consecutive lanterns. Because for the initial part, the first lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the required d is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. Similarly, for the end part, the required d is the distance from the last lantern to l.\n\nBut then, for the consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2. Because the middle point between them would be the farthest point from both. So for that, the required d is (gap)/2.\n\nSo the overall answer is the maximum between:\n\n- the distance from 0 to the first lantern (a[0] - 0)\n- the distance from last lantern to l (l - a[-1])\n- the maximum (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nAh! So in the second sample input, the first lantern is at 2. The distance from 0 to 2 is 2. So that's a candidate. The distance between 2 and 5 is 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. The end part is 5 -5 = 0. So the maximum is max(2, 0, 1.5) = 2. Which matches the sample. So that's the correct approach.\n\nOh wow, I had the initial and end parts wrong before. So that was the mistake. So the correct steps are:\n\nSort the lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial distance (a[0] - 0), which is the required d for the start.\n\nCompute the end distance (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute the gap between them, divide by 2. Take the maximum of these.\n\nThen the answer is the maximum between the initial distance, end distance, and the maximum of the consecutive gaps divided by 2.\n\nThat makes sense. Let's test this with the second sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5].\n\nInitial distance: 2-0=2.\n\nEnd distance: 5-5=0.\n\nConsecutive gap: 5-2=3, divided by 2 is 1.5. Max between 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input.\n\nSample 1 input: 7 15, lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting: 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nInitial distance is 0-0=0. End distance is 15-15=0. Now check consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0 =3 → 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nSo the maximum of these is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo now, the algorithm is clear. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Read n and l.\n\n2. Read the list of a_i.\n\n3. Sort the list.\n\n4. Compute initial_d = a[0] - 0.0.\n\n5. Compute end_d = l - a[-1].\n\n6. Compute max_gap = 0.0.\n\n   For i from 0 to n-2:\n\n       gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n       current = gap / 2.0\n\n       if current > max_gap:\n\n           max_gap = current\n\n7. The answer is the maximum of initial_d, end_d, max_gap.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where n=1. For example, n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then initial_d is 3, end_d is 5-3=2. The max_gap is 0 (since no consecutive pairs). So answer is max(3, 2, 0) → 3. Which is correct. Because the lantern is at 3. The left part (from 0 to 3) requires d=3, the right part (from 3 to 5) requires d=2. So maximum is 3.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=0. Wait, but l is given as ≥1? No, according to the input constraints, l is ≥1. Because the input says 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9.\n\nAnother case: lanterns at 0 and l. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then initial_d is 0, end_d is 0. The consecutive gap is 10, divided by 2 → 5. So answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: lanterns not covering the ends. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[2,8]. initial_d is 2, end_d is 2. Consecutive gap is 6 → 3. So answer is max(2, 2, 3) → 3. Which is correct. The middle of the gap is at 5, which is 3 away from both lanterns.\n\nSo code-wise, the steps are:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them. Then compute initial_d, end_d, and the max_gap between consecutive elements.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut need to handle the case when n is 0? No, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, l from input. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them. Then compute initial_d, end_d, and the max_gap.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, for example:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# initial\ninitial = a[0]\nend = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_d = max(initial, end)\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the initial is a[0] which is 0. So initial is 0. end is 0. Then the max_gap is 2.5. So the code returns 2.5, which is correct.\n\nBut in the second sample, initial is 2, end is 0. The max_gap is 1.5. So the code returns 2.0, which is correct.\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nWait, but in the code, the initial is a[0] - 0? Because initial is a[0], but the initial distance is a[0] - 0. So yes. Because a[0] is the first lantern's position. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0] - 0. So yes.\n\nBut what if a[0] is 0? Then initial is 0. So that's correct.\n\nSo that code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, initial is set to a[0], but that's the distance from 0 to the first lantern. Because the first lantern is at a[0], so the distance is a[0] - 0. So yes.\n\nBut the code uses initial = a[0], which is correct. Because a[0] is the position. So initial is a[0] - 0 = a[0]. So yes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample 1 input: 7 15, lanterns are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. initial is 0. end is 15-15=0. Then the gaps are 3-0=3 → 1.5, 5-3=2 → 1.0, etc. The maximum gap between consecutive is 5 (between 9 and 14) → 5/2=2.5. So the code returns 2.5. Correct.\n\nSample 2 input: 2 5, lanterns [2,5]. sorted [2,5]. initial is 2. end is 0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3 → 1.5. So max is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. initial is 3, end is 5-3=2. max_d is max(3, 2) = 3. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. initial is 0, end is 0. consecutive gaps are 5 and 5. divided by 2 gives 2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[1, 5, 9]. initial is 1, end is 1. consecutive gaps are 4 (5-1) → 2.0, 4 (9-5) → 2.0. So answer is max(1, 1, 2.0) → 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code formatting: the output needs to be printed with 10 decimal digits. So using the format string with .10f.\n\nBut in Python, when you print, for example, 2.5, it would show as 2.5000000000.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. The input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps that's just for the example. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich is two test cases. But the problem says that the input is read from standard input. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases? Or is it one test case per run?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... Then the next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows two separate test cases. But the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. Because the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is given as per the problem's input description.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. But that's probably because the sample shows two different examples. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nand the second example's input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut the code should read one test case. So the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nSo the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code should be written as:\n\nRead n and l from input, then read the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two test cases. However, in the problem statement, the code should process a single test case. So the code is written for one test case.\n\nSo the code is correct as written.\n\nThus, the Python code is:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute initial and end.\n\nCompute the max_gap between consecutive.\n\nThen output the maximum of these.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input. But in Python, sometimes the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\ninitial = a[0]\nend = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_d = max(initial, end)\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what if n is 1? Then, the for loop is not executed. So max_d is max(initial, end). Which is correct.\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\ninitial is 0, end is 0. The max_d is 0. Then, the loop checks the gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nSo the max_d is 2.5. Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\ninitial is 2, end is 0. max_d is 2. Then check gap 5-2=3 → 1.5. Which is less than 2. So output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. initial is 3, end is 5-3=2. max_d is 3. So output is 3.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0,5,10]. initial is 0, end is 0. gaps are 5 and 5. max gap is 5/2=2.5. So output 2.5.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code is ready.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given that there are `n` lanterns placed at various positions along the street. The key insight is to find the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns and ensure that the radius is sufficient to cover the farthest points from these lanterns, as well as the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check the Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Check Consecutive Lantern Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum required radius for these gaps is half the size of the largest gap since the farthest point from both lanterns would be in the middle of the gap.\n4. **Determine the Maximum Radius**: The required radius is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the ends of the street and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    initial = a[0]\n    end = l - a[-1]\n    max_d = max(initial, end)\n    \n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        gap = a[i + 1] - a[i]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: This allows us to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Initial and End Distances**: These are critical because if the first lantern is not at the start of the street or the last lantern is not at the end, the radius must cover these distances.\n- **Consecutive Gaps**: By considering each pair of consecutive lanterns, we determine the maximum gap between them. The radius required to cover this gap is half the size of the gap, as the midpoint of the gap is the farthest point from both lanterns.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is the maximum value among the initial distance, the end distance, and half the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. This ensures that all parts of the street are illuminated with the minimum possible radius.",
