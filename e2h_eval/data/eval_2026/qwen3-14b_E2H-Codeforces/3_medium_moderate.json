Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. The key idea is to find the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns, but also considering the ends of the street. Because if there's a gap between two lanterns, the required d would be half of that gap. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose two lanterns are at positions a and b, with a < b. The area between them that isn't covered by either would be the middle part. The maximum distance from either lantern would be (b - a)/2. Because if you have a gap between them, the worst case is the midpoint between them. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d would be (distance between them)/2. But also, we need to check the ends. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a certain value, and similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in ascending order.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d here is (a[0] - 0), because the lantern's coverage needs to reach from 0 to a[0] - d. Wait, no. Wait, the lantern at a[0] can cover from a[0] - d to a[0] + d. So for the start of the street (position 0) to be covered, 0 must be within [a[0] -d, a[0] +d]. So the maximum distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. So the required d must be at least a[0], because if the lantern is at a[0], then to cover 0, d has to be at least a[0] - 0. Similarly, for the end of the street, the last lantern's position is a[-1], so the distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. So d must be at least that.\n\nThen, for the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For example, between a[i] and a[i+1], the maximum distance between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]). The worst case is the midpoint between them. So the required d for that gap is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. Because if you have a gap of length g, then the maximum distance from either lantern to cover the entire gap is g/2.\n\nSo the overall minimum d is the maximum of:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if it's not at 0)\n- the last lantern's distance to l (if it's not at l)\n- the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. If it's greater than 0, then the required d is a[0] - 0. So compare that to current max_d.\n\nCheck the last lantern's position. If it's less than l, then required d is l - a[-1]. Compare to current max_d.\n\nThen, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference between them, divide by 2, and compare to max_d.\n\nThe maximum of all these values is the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the first lantern's position is a[0]. Then the required d would be max(a[0], l - a[0]). Because the lantern's coverage must reach from 0 to l. So for example, if the lantern is at 0, then the d needs to be l (since the coverage is from 0 -d to 0 +d. But since d is positive, the maximum is l - 0. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: the sample input given.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=7, l=15. The lantern positions are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, they become [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then:\n\nCheck first lantern is 0, so no contribution. Last lantern is 15, which is equal to l, so no contribution. Now check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nAnother sample input is 2 5 with lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. First lantern is 2, so distance from 0 is 2. Last lantern is 5, which is l. So the gaps between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum is 2.0, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo yes, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d.\n\nCheck the first element: if a[0] > 0, then candidate is a[0] - 0. Similarly for the last element: if a[-1] < l, candidate is l - a[-1].\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute the difference, divide by 2. Take the maximum.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nSort the array.\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif a[0] > 0:\n\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n\nif a[-1] < l:\n\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nreturn max_d.\n\nWait, but for the first and last elements, why is it a[0] and not a[0] - 0?\n\nBecause the first lantern is at a[0], and the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. So the required d must be at least that. Because the lantern's coverage is a[0] -d to a[0] +d. For 0 to be covered, a[0] -d <= 0 → d >= a[0]. Similarly for the end.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code, that's correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase 1: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the max_d would be max(5, 5) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nCase 2: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then the first and last are 0 and 10. The gaps between them is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So the max is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,5]. Then the first is 0, last is 5. So the last part is l - a[-1] = 5. The gap between 0 and 5 is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So max is 5. So d is 5. Which is correct because the second lantern is at 5, and the end is 10. So the lantern's coverage would be 5 -d to 5 +d. For 10 to be covered, 5 +d >=10 → d >=5. So yes.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as two lines. First line is n and l, then the next line is n integers.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']. Wait, maybe the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the first line. But the example shows two input examples. However, the user's task is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin. So perhaps the input is given as two lines: the first line is n and l, the second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut the sample input shows two separate inputs, but perhaps that's for two test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So for example, the code should read the first line as n and l, then the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen the output is 2.5.\n\nSo the code needs to read n and l, then read the list of a_i.\n\nNow, in Python, we can read via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, when the input is large, using sys.stdin is better, but for the problem, it's acceptable.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nRead the next line as list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the max_d as discussed.\n\nThen, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, in code.\n\nBut need to handle cases where n is 0? No, the constraints say 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif a[0] > 0:\n\n    max_d = a[0]\n\nif a[-1] < l:\n\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first case, when a[0] is 0, then the first check is skipped. Similarly for the last.\n\nBut what if the first lantern is at 0 and the last is at l? Then the max_d is the maximum of the gaps between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 2 5, and lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5].\n\nFirst check a[0] is 2, which is greater than 0. So max_d is 2. Then check a[-1] is 5, which equals l (5). So no change. Then for i=1, gap is 5-2=3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d remains 2. So output is 2.0, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: first sample input after sorting is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. The first a[0] is 0, so no contribution. The last a[-1] is 15, which is equal to l. So the max_d is computed from the gaps. The maximum gap is between 9 and 14, which is 5. Divided by 2 is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the first check is a[0] is 5>0, so max_d is 5. The last check is a[-1] is 5 < 10, so l - a[-1] is 5. So max_d is 5. Then no gaps. So output is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then the first is 0, last is 10. The gap between them is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So output is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. The gaps between 0 and 5 is 5/2=2.5, between 5 and 10 is 5/2=2.5. So max_d is 2.5. But the first and last are 0 and 10, so no contribution. So output is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. Then the first is 0, last is 10. The gaps between 0 and 3 is 3/2=1.5. Between 3 and 10 is 7/2=3.5. So max_d is 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the lanterns are not sorted? For example, in the first sample input, the input is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. So after sorting, it's [0,3,5,7,9,14,15], which is correct.\n\nSo the code sorts the array correctly.\n\nNow, the code uses floating point division. But in Python, dividing integers with / gives float.\n\nNow, the output needs to be printed with 10 decimal digits. So the format string is needed.\n\nBut in the sample outputs, the first sample is 2.5000000000, which is 10 decimal digits. So the code uses .10f.\n\nBut in Python, when you print with .10f, it rounds the number. However, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-9. So the code needs to output enough decimal digits. Using 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about when the maximum is from the first or last part?\n\nLike, if the first lantern is at 3, l is 10, and the rest are arranged so that the gaps are smaller. Then the max_d would be 3.0, which is the distance from 0 to first lantern.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and 5, l is 10. Then the last lantern is at 5, so l - a[-1] is 5. The gap between 0 and 5 is 5/2=2.5. So the max is 5.0. So the code will output 5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute max_d.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, in Python, for the first and last checks, the code is:\n\nif a[0] > 0:\n\n    max_d = a[0]\n\nBut what if a[0] is 0? Then, the first part is 0. So the code does not set max_d to a[0], which is 0. But then, the code proceeds. But in that case, the first part is already covered. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the code, initially max_d is 0.0. Then, for example, if the first lantern is at 0, then the code does not change max_d. Then, for the last lantern, if it's at l, then no change. Then the code checks the gaps. So for example, if all lanterns are at 0 and l is 0, but that's impossible since l is at least 1. Wait, no. The input says l can be 1. But in the code, if n=1, l=0? No, according to the problem statement, l is at least 1. Because the input says 1 ≤ l ≤ 1e9.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then the first check is a[0] is 0, so no change. The last check is a[-1] is 0 < 1, so l - a[-1] is 1. So max_d is 1.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[1]. Then the first check is a[0] is 1>0, so max_d is 1. The last check is a[-1] is 1 == l, so no change. So max_d is 1.0. Which is correct.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ that lanterns must have to ensure the entire street of length $ l $ is illuminated. The key insight is to consider the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position $ l $).\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them and determine the required radius to cover this gap, which is half the gap length.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius $ d $ is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the ends of the street and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# Check the first lantern's distance from the start\nif a[0] > 0:\n    max_d = a[0]\n\n# Check the last lantern's distance from the end\nif a[-1] < l:\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\n# Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to sequentially check the gaps between each pair of consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Ends of the Street**: The distances from the start (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end ($ l $) are critical because these areas might not be covered by any lantern if the lanterns are not placed at the ends.\n3. **Gaps Between Lanterns**: The largest gap between consecutive lanterns determines the required radius because the midpoint of this gap will be the farthest point from either lantern, requiring the largest radius to cover it.\n4. **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to ensure the required precision for the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius using sorting and linear traversal, ensuring an optimal solution with time complexity $ O(n \\log n) $ due to sorting, which is suitable given the constraints.",
