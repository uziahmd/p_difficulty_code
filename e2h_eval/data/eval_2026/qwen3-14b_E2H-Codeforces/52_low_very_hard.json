Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room with candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take 'b' of them to make a new one. And this new candle can be used again, and so on. The goal is to find the total hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles. That's 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burned-out candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new ones. So he lights those, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are burned out. So he can make 2 / 2 = 1 new candle. That adds 1 hour. Now, that candle is burned out. So he has 1 candle, but since b is 2, he can't make another. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: input 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's check:\n\nStart with 6, 6 hours. Then, 6 / 3 = 2 new. Add 2 hours. Now, 2 burned. But 2 < 3, so can't make more. Wait, but the output is 8. Wait 6 + 2 = 8. Oh right, that's correct. But what if there's a way to collect more?\n\nWait, maybe there's a case where after making some new candles, you can collect the burned ones again. Like, for example, if you have 5 candles and b=2. Let's see:\n\nOriginal 5: 5 hours. Then 5 burned. Make 5//2 = 2 new, with 1 leftover. So 2 hours. Now, 2 burned. Make 1 new. 1 hour. Now, that's burned. So total is 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. But wait, the leftover from the first step was 1. Then after making 2 new, you have 2 burned. Then after burning them, you have 2 burned. So 2//2 = 1. Then after that, you have 1 burned. So no more. So total is 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nBut how do we model this process? It seems like we need to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Start with a candles. Total hours is a.\n\n- Then, we have a burned candles. We can make new ones by dividing by b, but each time we make new ones, they get burned again, adding to the total hours. Also, the number of burned candles after each step is the remainder plus the number of new candles made (since each new candle is burned once, adding to the count).\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model it is:\n\nWe can have a variable 'total_hours' which starts as a. Then, we have 'burned' candles, which starts as a. Then, while the number of burned candles is >= b, we can make new candles. Each time, the number of new candles is (burned // b). The total_hours increases by that number. Then, the new burned candles are (burned % b) + (number of new candles). Because each new candle is burned once, so they add to the burned count. Wait, no. Because when you make new candles, you use up 'b' burned ones to make one new. So for each new candle, you subtract b from the burned count, and add 1 to the new candles. But then, when you burn the new candle, it becomes part of the burned count again.\n\nWait, let's think step by step.\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\nInitially, we have 'a' candles. They are all burned after being used. So the initial burned count is a.\n\nThen, while the burned count is >= b:\n\n- We can make new_candles = burned // b.\n\n- The total_hours += new_candles.\n\n- The new burned count is (burned % b) + new_candles. Because:\n\n   - The number of burned candles used is new_candles * b. So the remaining is burned - new_candles * b = burned % b.\n\n   - Then, the new_candles are burned again, adding new_candles to the burned count.\n\nSo this process continues until the burned count is less than b.\n\nSo for example, the first sample:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours = 4.\n\nburned =",
