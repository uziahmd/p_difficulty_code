    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. But not between 0 and 2 directly. That means that 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s, but 0s can't move past 2s. Wait, but maybe through some steps? Like, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, can they swap? No, because the allowed swaps are only between 0-1 and 1-2. So, for example, a 0 and a 2 can't be swapped directly. So their relative order can't be changed. So, in the final string, all the 0s must come before the 2s? Or not?\n\nWait, let's think: suppose there's a 0 followed by a 2. Since we can't swap them, their positions are fixed relative to each other. But what if there's a 1 between them? For example, 0 1 2. Then, the 0 can move past the 1 (since they can swap), and the 1 can move past the 2. So, the 0 can move to the left of the 1, and the 1 can move to the right of the 2. But then, the 0 can't get past the 2. So, the 0 can end up before the 1, and the 1 can end up after the 2. But the 0 and 2 would still be in their original order. So, in general, 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s, but 0s and 2s can't be swapped. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. Because any 0 that comes before a 2 in the original string can't be moved past it. So, in the final string, all 0s that were originally before 2s will remain before them, and vice versa.\n\nWait, but if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2. Then, the 0 can move to the left of the 1, and the 1 can move to the right of the 2. But then, the 0 can't go past the 2. So the 0 is before the 1, which is before the 2. So the order of 0 and 2 is preserved. So, in the final string, the 0s can be arranged among themselves, and the 2s can be arranged among themselves, but the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. The 1s can be arranged between the 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, the key idea here is that the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string must remain the same. But the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s. So, how do I arrange the characters?\n\nLet me think. The minimal lex string would want as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. However, the constraints are that 0s and 2s can't cross. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, that 0 must be before that 2. However, any 1s can be moved around.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- All 0s can be moved to the left of 1s, but 0s can't cross 2s. Similarly, 1s can be moved to the left of 2s, but not past 0s.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to consider that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order, and the 1s can be placed anywhere between them. So, the problem reduces to grouping the 0s, 1s, and 2s, but with the 0s and 2s in their original order.\n\nWait, but how can we arrange the 1s? Let's think of the original string as consisting of some 0s, 1s, and 2s. The 0s and 2s can't be reordered relative to each other. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 at position i and a 2 at position j where i < j, then in the final string, that 0 must still be before that 2. However, any 1s can be moved around between them.\n\nSo, the minimal lex string would be to arrange all 0s as early as possible, then 1s, then 2s. However, the 0s and 2s can't cross. So, the 0s can be arranged in their own group, and the 2s in their own group, but their order relative to each other is fixed. The 1s can be arranged between them.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Think about the allowed swaps. Since we can swap 0 and 1, and 1 and 2, but not 0 and 2, the 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s. Therefore, the 0s can be moved to the left of any 1s that are to their right. Similarly, 1s can be moved to the left of any 2s to their right. However, 0s cannot be moved past 2s. Therefore, the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order. So, the minimal string would be to arrange the 0s in their earliest possible positions, then the 1s, then the 2s, but keeping the 0s and 2s in their original relative order.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 0s and 2s? Let's take an example. Suppose the input is \"20\". Then, since you can't swap 0 and 2, the output is \"20\" as given. Which matches the sample input.\n\nAnother example: \"100210\" → output \"001120\".\n\nOriginal string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nThe 0s and 2s are in positions: the first 0 is at index 1, then another 0 at index 2, then 2 at index 3. So the 0s are before the 2. So in the output, the 0s can be arranged first, then the 2s. But the 2 is in the original string before the 0s? No, in the original string, the 2 is after the 0s. So the output's 0s can be arranged first, then the 2. But how about the 1s?\n\nWait, the sample input is '100210' and the output is '001120'. Let's see. The original string has 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0. The output is 0,0,1,1,2,0. So the 0s are arranged first, then the 1s, then the 2, then the 0. Wait, but the 0s and 2s can't cross. In the original string, the 2 is at position 3 (original index 3, assuming 0-based?), but then there's a 1 and 0 after it. So in the output, the 2 comes before the last 0. But that's allowed because the original 2 was before the last 0? No. Wait, in the original string, the 2 is at position 3 (assuming 0-based index 3?), and the last 0 is at position 5. So in the original string, the 2 is before the 0. So in the output, the 2 can be before that 0. So that's allowed. Because the 2 was originally before the 0. So the 0 can't move past the 2. So the 2 can be before the 0. But in the output, the 2 is before the 0. So that's allowed.\n\nSo the key is that the relative order of 0s and 2s is preserved. So, in the original string, if a 0 is before a 2, then in the final string, that 0 must be before that 2. Similarly, if a 2 is before a 0 in the original string, then in the final string, that 2 must be before that 0. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: arrange the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, and arrange the 1s in between them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s? Well, since 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. Wait, no. Wait, 1 can be swapped with 0, so 1s can move past 0s. Also, 1 can be swapped with 2, so 1s can move past 2s. Therefore, the 1s can be moved anywhere. So, the 1s can be placed in between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nSo the idea is that the 1s can be placed anywhere. However, the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. So the minimal lex string would be to arrange all 0s first (as much as possible), then 1s, then 2s. But considering that the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 0s and 2s? Let's think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their relative order. Then, between them, we can insert 1s. Also, the 1s can be placed before the first 0, between 0s and 2s, or after the last 2.\n\nBut how can we arrange the 0s and 2s? For example, suppose we have a 0 followed by a 2. Then, the 0 can be moved as far left as possible, and the 2 as far right as possible. But since their relative order is fixed, the 0 must be before the 2. So the minimal lex would be to have as many 0s as possible first, then 1s, then 2s. But the 0s and 2s in the original string may have 2s before some 0s, but that's not allowed. Wait, no. If in the original string, a 2 is before a 0, then in the final string, that 2 must be before that 0. So, for example, if the original string is \"20\", then the output is \"20\", because you can't swap 2 and 0. But if the original string is \"201\", then the 2 is before the 0, and the 1 can be moved. So the minimal string would be \"012\"? Wait, no. Because the 2 is originally before the 0. So the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the 0 can't be moved to the left of the 2. So the 2 must remain before the 0. So the minimal string would be \"012\" is not possible. Let's think. Original string is \"201\". How can we arrange it?\n\nThe original string is 2, 0, 1.\n\nWe can swap 0 and 1. So the string can become 2, 1, 0. But can we swap 0 and 1? Yes, because they are adjacent. So the 0 can be moved to the right of the 1. But the 2 is before the 0. Can we move the 0 to the left of the 2? No, because 2 and 0 can't be swapped. So the 0 can't be moved past the 2. So the minimal string would be \"012\"? No. Because the 2 is before the 0 in the original string. So the 2 must be before the 0 in the final string. So the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the minimal possible string is \"012\"? No. Because the original string is \"201\". Let me think. How can I arrange the 0 and 1. Let's see:\n\nOriginal is 2,0,1. The 0 can be swapped with 1 (they are adjacent). So the string can be 2,1,0. Then, the 1 can be swapped with the 2? No, because 1 and 2 can be swapped. Wait, yes. The allowed swaps are between 1 and 2. So the 1 can be swapped with the 2. So in the string 2,1,0, we can swap 2 and 1 to get 1,2,0. Then, the 0 can be swapped with the 2? No, because they are 2 and 0. So no. So the final string could be 1,2,0. But that's better than the original 2,0,1. Which is lex smaller. So the minimal string would be 120? But the 2 is before the 0. So the 0 is after the 2. But in the original string, the 2 was before the 0. So that's allowed. So the minimal possible string would be 012? No, because the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the minimal string is 120. But wait, how about the 0 and the 2 in the original string. The original has the 2 before the 0. So the 0 can't be moved before the 2. So the minimal possible string would be 120. But what about moving the 0 to the end? Like 120 is better than 210? Because 1 is less than 2. So the minimal string is 120.\n\nBut how to achieve that. So the 0 can be moved to the right of the 1, but not past the 2. So the minimal string is 120.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the 0s and 2s can't cross, but the 1s can be moved freely. So the way to arrange the minimal string is to arrange all the 0s and 2s in their original relative order, but arrange the 1s in between them as much as possible, and also arrange the 1s to be as left as possible.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 0s and 2s. Let's think: the 0s and 2s can be considered as a sequence where their relative order is fixed. For example, if the original string is \"201\", then the 2 comes before the 0. So in the final string, the 2 must be before the 0. But between them, we can have 1s. So the minimal string would be 1, 2, 0. Which is better than 2, 0, 1.\n\nSo, the approach is to collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then arrange the 1s in between them. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the minimal lex string can be formed by grouping all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and inserting the 1s in between. But since 1s can be moved anywhere, we can arrange all 1s to be placed in the earliest possible positions. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- The 0s and 2s are in their original relative order. So, for example, if the original string is \"100210\", then the 0s and 2s are in the order [0,0,2,0]. Wait, no. The original string is 1,0,0,2,1,0. So the 0s and 2s are 0,0,2,0. So their relative order is 0,0,2,0. So in the final string, these must appear in this order. So the 0s and 2s are arranged in the same order as they appeared in the original string, but with 1s inserted between them.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s. Since 1s can be moved anywhere. So the minimal lex string would be to have as many 1s as possible to the left of the 0s and 2s. Wait, no. Because the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So the 1s can be placed anywhere. So, the best way is to arrange the 1s as left as possible, but considering that the 0s and 2s are in their original order.\n\nSo, the minimal string can be constructed as follows:\n\nCollect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Then, for each of the positions between these 0s and 2s, insert as many 1s as possible. Also, insert the 1s that are before the first 0 or 2, and after the last 0 or 2.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, let's take the sample input \"100210\". The 0s and 2s in the original string are 0,0,2,0. The 1s are at positions 0 and 4 (assuming 0-based). So the 1s can be moved to the left of the 0s, between the 0s and 2, etc.\n\nSo the minimal string would be:\n\nInsert all the 1s before the first 0, then the 0s and 2s in their original order, but with the 1s inserted between them. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the 1s can be placed anywhere. So the minimal lex string is to arrange all the 1s as left as possible. But the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So the minimal string would be:\n\nTake all the 1s that can be moved to the left of the 0s and 2s, then the 0s and 2s in their original order, but with the 1s in between.\n\nWait, but how to arrange that. Let's think of the 0s and 2s as a sequence, say, S = [c_1, c_2, ..., c_k], where each c_i is either 0 or 2, and their order is the same as in the original string. Then, the 1s can be placed in any positions. The minimal lex string would be to arrange all the 1s as far to the left as possible, but respecting the order of the S elements.\n\nBut how? For example, the 1s can be placed before the first element of S, between elements of S, or after the last element of S.\n\nBut since the S elements are fixed in order, the minimal lex string would be to arrange all the 1s as left as possible. So, the minimal string would be:\n\nAll the 1s (counted as a group) followed by the S elements. However, that's not correct. Because the S elements may contain 0s and 2s. For example, if S is [0, 0, 2, 0], then putting all the 1s before them would give 1...1 followed by 0,0,2,0. Which would be better than inserting 1s between the elements of S. But that depends on the actual elements.\n\nWait, but inserting 1s between the elements of S may allow for a better lex order. For example, if S is [2, 0], then inserting 1s between them would make the string 2, 1, 0. Which is better than 1, 2, 0? No, because 1 is smaller than 2. So putting all 1s before S would be better.\n\nAh, so the idea is that all the 1s should be placed as early as possible. So the minimal lex string would be:\n\nAll the 1s (as many as possible) placed before the first element of S, then the elements of S. But wait, the elements of S include 0s and 2s. However, the 1s can be placed before the first element of S. Because the 1s can be moved past the 0s and 2s. Wait, no. Because the 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. For example, if there is a 0 in S, then the 1s can be moved before it. Because the 1 can be swapped with the 0. So the 1s can be moved to the left of the 0s and 2s.\n\nSo the minimal string would be:\n\nAll 1s (counted as a group) placed before the S elements, followed by the S elements. However, the S elements are the 0s and 2s in their original order. But wait, what if there are 1s that are between elements of S?\n\nNo, because the 1s can be moved anywhere. So the minimal string would be to arrange all the 1s as early as possible, then arrange the S elements in their original order. But the S elements are 0s and 2s, which are in their original relative order.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Let's call this list 'fixed_chars'.\n\n- Collect all the 1s in a separate list, call it 'ones'.\n\n- Then, the minimal string is the concatenation of the 'ones' list, followed by the 'fixed_chars' list. But wait, that's not correct. Because the 'fixed_chars' list may have 0s and 2s. However, the 1s can be placed before the fixed_chars. For example, if fixed_chars is [0, 2], then the ones can be placed before them. So the minimal string would be 11...102. Which is better than 01...12.\n\nBut that's not correct. Because the 1s can be placed before the 0s. For example, the minimal string would be all the 1s first, then the 0s and 2s. But that's not possible if the fixed_chars contain 2s before 0s. For example, if fixed_chars is [2, 0], then the minimal string would be 1s followed by 2, 0. Which is better than putting the 1s between 2 and 0. Because 1 is less than 2. So the minimal string is indeed 1s followed by the fixed_chars.\n\nSo this seems to be the way. Let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: \"100210\"\n\nOriginal string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'\n\nThe fixed_chars are the 0s and 2s in original order. So the 0s and 2s are:\n\nAt positions 1: 0, 2:0, 3:2, 5:0. So fixed_chars is [0,0,2,0].\n\nThe ones are the 1s in the original string: positions 0 and 4. So 'ones' is [1,1].\n\nThen, the minimal string would be the ones (11) followed by the fixed_chars (0,0,2,0) → \"110020\". But the sample output is \"001120\".\n\nWait, that contradicts. So clearly, my approach is wrong. What's wrong here?\n\nIn the sample input, the output is \"001120\". Which has two 0s, then two 1s, then a 2, then a 0. But according to my approach, the ones would be placed before the fixed_chars. But the sample output has 0s before the ones. So why is that?\n\nBecause the fixed_chars includes 0s. So the 0s are part of the fixed_chars. But according to my previous reasoning, the 1s can be moved to the left of the 0s. But that's not the case. Because the 0s are in the fixed_chars. But how?\n\nWait, the fixed_chars are the 0s and 2s in their original order. So if the original string has a 0, then the 1s can be moved past it. Because 0 and 1 can be swapped. So the 1s can be moved before the 0s. So why is the sample output not starting with 1s?\n\nHmm. Let me re-examine the sample input.\n\nOriginal string: '100210' → the fixed_chars are the 0s and 2s. Let's list them:\n\nThe original string is:\n\nIndices 0: '1', 1: '0', 2: '0', 3: '2', 4: '1', 5: '0'.\n\nSo the fixed_chars are the 0s and 2s in the order they appear. So the fixed_chars are:\n\n['0', '0', '2', '0'].\n\nThe ones are ['1', '1'].\n\nIf I arrange the ones before the fixed_chars, the result would be '11' + '0020' → '110020'. But the sample output is '001120', which is lex smaller than '110020'.\n\nThis shows that my approach is incorrect. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh, because the fixed_chars are not just the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s are in their original order. However, the 1s can be moved not only before the fixed_chars but also between the elements of fixed_chars. So the minimal string is not simply putting all 1s before the fixed_chars. Because the fixed_chars may contain 0s. And putting 1s between the 0s and 2s may be better.\n\nSo, what's the correct approach?\n\nThe key is that the 0s can be moved to the left of the 1s. So the 1s can be moved to the right of the 0s. But how?\n\nWait, the 0s can be moved past the 1s. So if there is a 0 followed by a 1, we can swap them to get 1 followed by 0. Wait, no. Wait, the allowed swap is between 0 and 1. So, for example, \"01\" can be swapped to \"10\". So, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. So, the 1s can be moved to the left of 0s. So, in that case, the 1s can be placed before the 0s. But in the sample input, the fixed_chars are [0,0,2,0], and the ones are [1,1]. So why isn't the minimal string '110020'?\n\nBut the sample output is '001120', which is lex smaller than '110020'.\n\nSo clearly, there's a flaw in my reasoning.\n\nLet me think again. What's the correct way to arrange the 0s, 1s, and 2s.\n\nThe allowed swaps allow us to sort the 0s and 1s among themselves, and the 1s and 2s among themselves, but not the 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, for example, the 0s and 1s can be rearranged in any order (since they can be swapped), but the 0s and 2s can't be rearranged. However, the 1s can be rearranged between the 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. So, the 1s can be placed anywhere. So the minimal string would be to arrange all the 0s as early as possible, then the 1s, then the 2s. But how to reconcile this with the fact that the 0s and 2s are in their original order?\n\nLet me think of the entire string as consisting of three groups:\n\nGroup A: 0s and 1s, but the 0s can be arranged freely among themselves and with the 1s.\n\nGroup B: 2s and 1s, but the 2s can be arranged freely among themselves and with the 1s.\n\nBut the 0s and 2s can't be swapped. So the 0s and 2s must be in their original relative order.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother approach: think of the string as a sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s, where the 0s and 2s are in their original order, and the 1s can be placed anywhere else.\n\nSo the minimal lex string is the one that has as many 0s as possible first, then as many 1s as possible, then as many 2s as possible, but ensuring that the relative order of 0s and 2s is preserved.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input:\n\nOriginal string is 1,0,0,2,1,0.\n\nThe 0s and 2s are in the order [0,0,2,0].\n\nSo the minimal string would arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, but with the 1s inserted in between.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s to minimize the lex order. Since the 1s can be placed anywhere, the optimal way is to have as many 1s as possible before the 2s, but after the 0s. Wait, but that depends on the order of 0s and 2s.\n\nLet me think of the fixed_chars as a list of characters (0s and 2s) in their original order. Now, the 1s can be inserted into the fixed_chars list. Where should they be inserted to get the minimal lex string?\n\nFor example, the fixed_chars list is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The 1s can be inserted between any of these elements. Also, before the first element or after the last element.\n\nThe minimal lex string would be obtained by inserting the 1s in the earliest possible positions. However, since inserting a 1 before a 0 would be better than inserting it after, but inserting a 1 before a 2 would also be better.\n\nSo, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s before the first occurrence of 2 in the fixed_chars list. Because inserting 1s before 2 would help reduce the lex order.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nIn the sample input, fixed_chars is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The 1s are two in number.\n\nWe can insert the 1s before the first 2. So the fixed_chars would become [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0]. Which gives the string 001120. Which is the sample output. That makes sense.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n- Split the original string into fixed_chars (0s and 2s) and the 1s.\n\n- Insert all the 1s into the fixed_chars list in such a way that they are placed as early as possible, but without violating the relative order of 0s and 2s.\n\nBut how to determine where to insert the 1s.\n\nThe key is that inserting 1s before any 2 in the fixed_chars list is better than inserting them after. Because 1 is smaller than 2. So, for example, inserting the 1s before the first 2 in the fixed_chars list will give the minimal lex string.\n\nBut what if the fixed_chars list contains only 0s and no 2s? Then the 1s can be inserted after the 0s, since 0 is smaller than 1. Wait, no. Because 0 is smaller than 1. So inserting the 1s after the 0s would make the string larger. Wait, but the 1s can be moved before the 0s. For example, if the fixed_chars is [0, 0], then inserting the 1s before them would give 1100, which is worse than 0011. Because 0 is smaller than 1.\n\nWait, but earlier reasoning said that 1 can be moved past 0. So for example, the string \"01\" can be swapped to \"10\". So the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. But that would make the string \"10\", which is worse than \"01\". So why would we want to do that?\n\nAh! This is the crux of the problem. Because the allowed swaps allow us to arrange the 0s and 1s in any order, but the minimal lex string would want the 0s to be as left as possible, and the 1s to be as right as possible. So, the 0s and 1s can be sorted in any order, but the minimal lex string would have the 0s first, then the 1s. However, the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So, the 0s in the fixed_chars are part of the original order, but the 1s can be moved past them.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to arrange the 0s and 1s in the fixed_chars and the 1s in such a way that the 0s are as left as possible, and the 1s are as right as possible, but respecting the fixed order of the 0s and 2s.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think again. The fixed_chars is a list of 0s and 2s in their original order. The 1s can be inserted into this list. To make the lex smallest string, the 1s should be inserted in positions where they are as far left as possible, but only if that doesn't create a larger character.\n\nWait, no. The minimal lex string requires that the earliest possible characters are as small as possible. So inserting the 1s before the 2s in the fixed_chars list is better than inserting them after. But inserting the 1s before the 0s in the fixed_chars list would be worse than inserting them after the 0s. Because 0 is smaller than 1.\n\nSo, for example, if the fixed_chars list is [0, 0, 2, 0], then inserting the 1s between the 0s and the 2 would be better than inserting them before the 0s. Because inserting them before the 0s would lead to 1s followed by 0s, which is worse than 0s followed by 1s.\n\nAh! So the correct way is to insert the 1s into the fixed_chars list in such a way that they are placed as far left as possible, but only in positions where they are not before a 0. Because inserting a 1 before a 0 would make the string larger than if the 0 is before the 1.\n\nWait, but the 0s can be moved past the 1s. For example, if you have a 0 followed by a 1, you can swap them to get 1 followed by 0. But that would make the string larger. So why would you do that? Because you want to minimize the lex order. So you wouldn't want to do that. Instead, you would keep the 0 before the 1.\n\nSo, the minimal lex string would arrange the 0s and 1s in the fixed_chars and the 1s in such a way that the 0s are as left as possible, and the 1s are as right as possible, but the 0s and 2s are in their original order.\n\nSo, the idea is that the fixed_chars list contains 0s and 2s. The 1s can be inserted into the fixed_chars list in any positions, but to minimize the lex order, they should be inserted in the earliest possible positions where inserting them doesn't cause a 1 to be before a 0 in the fixed_chars.\n\nWait, but the 0s in the fixed_chars are already in their original order. But since the 1s can be moved past them, we can arrange the 1s to be after the 0s and before the 2s. For example, if the fixed_chars is [0, 0, 2, 0], then the 1s can be inserted between the 0s and the 2, and after the 2 but before the next 0. But since 0 is smaller than 1, inserting 1s after the 0s and before the 2 would be better.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- The fixed_chars list consists of the 0s and 2s in their original order.\n\n- We can split this list into segments of 0s and 2s. For example, the fixed_chars list may have a sequence of 0s, then a 2, then more 0s, etc.\n\n- For each segment of 0s, we can insert the 1s after them but before any 2s. And for any 2s, we can insert the 1s before them.\n\nSo, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be directly swapped, meaning their relative order in the original string must be preserved.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Fixed Characters**: The characters '0' and '2' in the original string must maintain their relative order. This is because they cannot be directly swapped.\n2. **Collect 1s**: All '1's in the string can be moved freely relative to '0's and '2's. Thus, we collect all '1's separately.\n3. **Insert 1s Optimally**: To achieve the smallest lexicographical order, insert the collected '1's into the sequence of '0's and '2's such that they appear as early as possible without violating the relative order of '0's and '2's. Specifically, insert '1's before any '2's in the sequence of '0's and '2's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            fixed.append(c)\n    \n    # Now, insert the ones into fixed list\n    # We want to insert all ones before the first '2' in fixed\n    # Find the index of the first '2' in fixed\n    first_two = -1\n    for i in range(len(fixed)):\n        if fixed[i] == '2':\n            first_two = i\n            break\n    \n    if first_two == -1:\n        # No '2's, so append all ones after the fixed (which are all 0s)\n        return ''.join(fixed) + ''.join(ones)\n    else:\n        # Insert all ones before the first '2'\n        return ''.join(fixed[:first_two]) + ''.join(ones) + ''.join(fixed[first_two:])\n    \n# Read input and process each test case\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split input into individual cases (assuming each line is a separate case)\n    cases = input_str.splitlines()\n    for case in cases:\n        print(min_ternary_string(case))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where each line represents a separate test case.\n2. **Processing Each String**:\n   - **Fixed Characters**: Characters '0' and '2' are collected into `fixed` list while maintaining their original order.\n   - **Collecting 1s**: All '1's are collected into the `ones` list.\n3. **Optimal Insertion of '1's**:\n   - Determine the position of the first '2' in the `fixed` list.\n   - Insert all '1's before this first '2' to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
