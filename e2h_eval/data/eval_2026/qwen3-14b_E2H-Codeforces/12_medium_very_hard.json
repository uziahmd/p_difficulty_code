The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all tasks before it), we need to process them in sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation is that she moves 1→2→3 (time 2), then from 3 to 4→1→2 (time 3 more, total 5?), then from 2 to 3 (time 1 more, total 6). Wait, the total steps are 6. Oh right, because each move between adjacent houses is 1 unit. So the total steps are the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, considering the direction (clockwise only).\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, where each distance is the minimal steps needed to get from the current position to the next task's house, moving clockwise.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nLet's think about the movement between two consecutive tasks. Suppose Xenia is currently at position current_pos, and the next task is at target_pos. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the ringroad is a circle, moving clockwise, the distance between current_pos and target_pos is (target_pos - current_pos) mod n if we take the clockwise direction. Wait, no. Wait, if current_pos is 3 and target is 2, and n is 4. Then moving clockwise, she would go 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But (target - current) is (2-3) = -1. But mod 4, that would be 3. So yes, (target - current) mod n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, if target is larger than current, then (target - current) is positive, which is the correct steps. If target is smaller, then (target - current) is negative, but mod n gives the correct steps. For example, (2-3) mod 4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nWait, but for example, if current is 1 and target is 3, then the distance is 2 steps (1→2→3). Which is (3-1) = 2. Which is correct. So yes, the formula for the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which is equivalent to (target - current) % n. But since in Python, modulo can return negative values, but perhaps in our case, since target and current are between 1 and n, maybe we can compute it as (target - current) if target >= current else (target - current + n). Or perhaps (target - current + n) % n. Because if target is larger than current, then (target - current) is positive, and adding n and mod n would give the same value. For example, target=3, current=1: (3-1) = 2, (3-1 +4) mod 4 is 6 mod4= 2. So yes.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current else (target - current + n). Which can be written as (target - current + n) % n. But since in Python, the modulo operator returns non-negative results when the denominator is positive, so (target - current) % n would be the same as (target - current + n) % n. So perhaps the correct way is to compute (target - current) % n. But wait, let's check:\n\nIf target is 2 and current is 3, n=4. (2-3) is -1. -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and target is (target - current) mod n. So for each consecutive pair of tasks, we calculate that distance and add it to the total.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is 1. So for the first task, the distance from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Wait, no. Because if a_1 is 3 and n is 4, then moving from 1 to 3 is 2 steps. Which is (3-1) mod 4 = 2. Correct. If a_1 is 2, then (2-1) mod 4 is 1. Correct. If a_1 is 1, then (1-1) mod 4 is 0. Which is correct, no steps needed.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nInitialize current_position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n    compute the distance between current_position and a_i, add to total_time\n\n    set current_position to a_i\n\nSo the total_time is the sum of all these distances.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the tasks have to be done in order. So the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So for each task, we need to compute the distance from the previous position (which is the position of the previous task) to the current task's position.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nprev = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor each ai in the list:\n\n    total += (ai - prev) % n\n\n    prev = ai\n\nWait, but what if the list has multiple tasks in the same house? Like if a_i is same as a_{i+1}, then the distance is zero. Which is correct, since she's already there.\n\nSo for example, the second input example is 4 3, and the tasks are 2,3,3. Let's compute:\n\nprev = 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: distance is (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total is 1. prev is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 2. prev is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-3) mod4 = 0. total is 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read n and m, then the list of m integers. Then compute the sum as described.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and m, the second line is m integers. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be processed as:\n\nprev = 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod4 is 2. total is 2.\n\nprev is 3.\n\nNext ai is 2: (2-3) mod4 is ( -1 ) mod4 = 3. total becomes 2+3=5.\n\nprev is 2.\n\nNext ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 =1. total is 5+1=6. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, the problem is to read the input, process the list, and compute the sum.\n\nNow, in Python, the modulo operator can be used. However, note that in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So (ai - prev) % n would give the correct distance.\n\nBut wait, what if ai is 1, and prev is n? For example, n=4, prev is 4, ai is 1. Then (1 -4) mod4 is (-3) mod4 = 1. Which is correct: moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step. So yes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nprev = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor ai in a_list:\n\n    total += (ai - prev) % n\n\n    prev = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when the list is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because in the input description, m is given as 1<=m<=1e5.\n\nWait, the input says m can be 1. So for m=1, the code will process once.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's check the sample input. For the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nThe code computes:\n\nprev = 1.\n\nai = 3: (3-1) mod4 is 2. total=2.\n\nprev=3.\n\nai=2: (2-3) mod4 is 3. total=5.\n\nprev=2.\n\nai=3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. total=6. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 4 3, a is [2,3,3]. The code:\n\nprev=1.\n\nai=2: (2-1) mod4 =1. total=1.\n\nprev=2.\n\nai=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total=2.\n\nprev=3.\n\nai=3: (3-3)=0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, the problem is to read the input correctly.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m. The second line contains m integers a1...am.\n\nSo in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and m.\n\nRead the second line, split into m integers.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but in Python, splitting on whitespace is okay.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprev = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    total += (num - prev) % n\n\n    prev = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about if the list a has elements that are not in 1..n? According to the problem statement, the input says that each ai is between 1 and n. So no problem.\n\nBut let's test for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then the total is (1-1) mod2 = 0. So output is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. The first step is (1-1) mod2=0. Then (2-1) mod2=1. Total is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. First step is (2-1) mod2=1. Then (1-2) mod2 = ( -1 ) mod2=1. Total is 2.\n\nWhich is correct: starting at 1, go to 2 (1 step). Then from 2 to 1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: when all tasks are in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, a=[3,3,3]. The total is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when the list is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut let's check the sample input again. The first sample input gives 6 as output, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nSo the Python code is as above.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nBut in the problem's example, the input is given as ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'] for the two test cases. Wait, but the user is supposed to read from stdin. So in the code, when you read input, you need to read two lines. But in some cases, perhaps the input is given with multiple lines. But in Python, input() reads line by line. So for example, the code would read the first line as n and m, then the second line as the list of a's.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key challenge is to calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks in a clockwise direction.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1. Each task must be completed in order, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time. Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise from house `current` to house `target` can be calculated using modular arithmetic.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: The distance between two houses `current` and `target` on a ringroad with `n` houses is given by `(target - current) % n`. This formula correctly handles both cases where the target is ahead or behind the current position in a clockwise direction.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the target house, accumulate the total time, and update the current position to the target house for the next iteration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nprev = 1\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    total += (num - prev) % n\n    prev = num\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of house numbers where each task needs to be completed.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 (`prev = 1`) and initialize the total time (`total`) to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic. Accumulate this time into the total and update the current position to the target house.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time in linear time, O(m), making it suitable for large values of `n` and `m` up to 100,000. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the movement calculations are both correct and efficient.",
