The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how do we model the movement efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. Let's break down the movement:\n\nShe starts at 1. The first task is at 3. So moving clockwise from 1 to 3: that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the second task is at 2. Since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Then the third task is at 3 again. From 2, moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2+3+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, where each distance is the minimal steps needed moving clockwise between the current position and the next task's house.\n\nBut since the movement is only allowed clockwise, the distance from current position to next house is (next_house - current_house) mod n if we go clockwise? Wait, no. Wait, if current is at position x and next is at position y, then moving clockwise, the number of steps is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x +n). Or more generally, (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - (x - y)) ?\n\nWait, for example, if current is at 3, next is 2. Then moving clockwise, you have to go 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. Which is (2-3 +4) = ( -1 +4) = 3. So the formula is (y - x + n) % n. Because (y -x) could be negative, so adding n and mod by n gives the correct steps.\n\nBut since in the problem, the movement is only clockwise, the distance between current position and next house is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i is larger than current_pos, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Wait, no. Wait, if current is at 3, and next is 2, then the steps are (n - current_pos + a_i). For example, n=4, 3 to 2: steps are 4-3 +2 = 3 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between current position and next position is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i - current_pos + n). But that's equivalent to (a_i - current_pos) % n if the modulo is positive. Wait, no. For example, if current is 3, a_i is 2. (2-3) is -1. mod 4 would be 3, which is correct. So the distance between current and next is (a_i - current_pos) if positive, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Which can be written as (a_i - current_pos + n) % n. But since the movement is only clockwise, this is the correct distance.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1. Then for each task in the list, compute the distance from current position to the task's house, add that to the total time, and update current position to the task's house.\n\nBut wait, the tasks must be done in order. So the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m must be processed in order. So for each i from 1 to m, compute the distance from the previous position (which is the position of a_{i-1}, or 1 initially) to a_i, and accumulate the sum.\n\nBut what about if there are multiple tasks in the same house? Like, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house. Then the distance is zero. So that's handled automatically.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total_time = 0\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\nfor each a_i in the list:\n\n    distance = (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos else (a_i - current_pos + n)\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_pos = a_i\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but let's test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example: a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a_i is 3: 3 >= 1. distance is 3-1 = 2. total becomes 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond a_i is 2. 2 < 3. distance is 2 - 3 + 4 = 3. total is 5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird a_i is 3. 3 >= 2. distance is 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother example given in input is ['4 3\\n2 3 3', output '2'].\n\nLet's see:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a_i is 2: distance is 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond a_i is 3: distance is 1. total 2. current is 3.\n\nThird a_i is 3: distance 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nYes. So this approach works.\n\nNow, the problem is to process the list of a_i's, and compute the sum of the distances between consecutive positions, as per the above formula.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of m integers.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Wait, the sample input shows two examples. But the actual problem says that the input is given as per the problem's input format.\n\nWait, the user provided two examples. But the actual problem is that the code should read input from stdin. So in the problem, the input is given as two lines: first line has n and m, second line has m integers.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples, but perhaps that's just for illustration. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nand output is 6.\n\nThe second example is:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\noutput is 2.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line being n and m, then the second line being m integers. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and m, second line is m integers.\n\nSo the code needs to read from stdin. So in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute the total time as per the algorithm above.\n\nNow, for handling large values (n and m up to 1e5), the code must be efficient. But in Python, this is straightforward.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a as list of integers.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in a:\n\n    compute distance between current_pos and ai.\n\n    add to total_time.\n\n    set current_pos to ai.\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nBut how to compute the distance?\n\nIn Python, the formula can be written as:\n\ndistance = (ai - current_pos) % n if (ai - current_pos) % n != 0 else 0 ?\n\nWait, no. Because when ai is equal to current_pos, the distance is zero. But (ai - current_pos) is zero, and mod n is zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut for other cases, for example, when ai is less than current_pos, then (ai - current_pos) is negative. Let's take ai = 2, current_pos =3, n=4. (2-3) is -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the distance can be calculated as (ai - current_pos) % n, but if the result is zero, then it's zero. Wait, but (ai - current_pos) mod n gives the correct distance. Because when ai is equal to current_pos, the mod is zero. So the distance is zero. So yes, the formula can be written as (ai - current_pos) % n, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, (2-3) %4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nIf current_pos is 3, and ai is 2, then (2-3) is -1. -1 %4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nIf current_pos is 3, ai is 3, then (3-3) is 0, mod 4 is 0. Correct.\n\nIf current_pos is 1, ai is 3: (3-1) is 2 mod4 is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for distance is (ai - current_pos) % n.\n\nWait, but wait. For example, if current_pos is 4, ai is 1. Then (1-4) is -3. mod 4 is 1. Which is correct: moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step (since it's clockwise). So yes, the formula (ai - current_pos) %n gives the correct distance.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nfor each ai in a:\n\n    distance = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nWait, but in the first example, the first step is (3-1) mod4 is 2. Correct. Then (2-3) mod4 is 3. Then (3-2) mod4 is 1. Sum is 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3].\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 =1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3) mod4=0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo yes, this formula works. Therefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, in Python, reading the input. Let's make sure that the code reads from stdin. So:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then the second line as a list of m integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading input, there may be leading or trailing spaces, but in Python, splitting on whitespace is okay.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    diff = (ai - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if n is 1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 2. So the code is safe.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nThe code would process:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod4 is 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod4 is ( -1 ) mod4 = 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. total 6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nai=2: (2-1) mod4=1. total=1.\n\nai=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total 2.\n\nai=3: 0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if the list is [1,1,1], then the total is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1. first ai is 2: (2-1) mod2 =1. total is 1. current is 2. next ai is 1: (1-2) mod2 = -1 mod2 =1. total is 2. Which is correct: moving from 2 to 1 is 1 step. So total is 1+1=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code should be as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The movement is restricted to clockwise direction only, and each task must be completed in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to move to a specific house, and she can only move clockwise. The time taken to move from one house to another is calculated based on the clockwise distance between the current house and the target house.\n2. **Clockwise Distance Calculation**: The distance from the current house to the target house can be computed using modulo arithmetic. For any two houses `current` and `target`, the distance is `(target - current) % n` where `n` is the total number of houses. This formula efficiently handles both cases where the target house is ahead or behind the current house in the clockwise direction.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We iterate through each task, updating the total time required by summing up the distances calculated for each move from the current house to the target house specified by the task.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        diff = (ai - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = ai\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of houses where each task needs to be completed.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic. This ensures that the distance calculation wraps around correctly for circular movement.\n- **Update Total Time**: Accumulate the computed distance for each move into the total time and update the current position to the target house after each move.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle circular movement, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
