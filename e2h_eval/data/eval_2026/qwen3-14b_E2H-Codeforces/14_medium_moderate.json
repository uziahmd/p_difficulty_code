Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given m, find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then output how many such n's there are and list them.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. The trailing zeros for 5! is 1, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors, but since 10! would add another 5 (from 10), which would make the count 2. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Hence, 5 numbers.\n\nBut how do I find the possible n's for a given m?\n\nThe key idea here is that for each m, there's a range of n's that produce exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find that range?\n\nFirst, I need to find the smallest n such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then, find the largest n where the count is m. All numbers between them (inclusive) would be part of the solution. However, there's a catch here. Because sometimes, there might be no n that gives exactly m trailing zeros. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n such that the count is exactly 5. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the count of trailing zeros increases as n increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the count can either stay the same or increase by 1 or more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then the count increases by 1. But when n is a multiple of 25, it increases by 2, etc. So for some m, there may be no n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. For instance, let's take m=5. Let's see:\n\nLet me compute for n=24: count is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. n=25: 25//5 + 25//25 =5 +1=6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be 0.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if there exists any n such that the count is m. If there is, then find all such n's.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where the count of trailing zeros is >= m. Then check if the count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the range of n's where the count is exactly m.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count is >=m? That's a classic binary search problem.\n\nWait, but for the problem, we need to find all n's where the count is exactly m. So perhaps we can find the lower and upper bounds for n.\n\nLet me think: For a given m, the possible n's must be in a certain range. Let's say that the count of trailing zeros for n is f(n). So f(n) is non-decreasing as n increases. So for a given m, the set of n's with f(n) = m is either empty or a contiguous range.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Find the smallest n_low where f(n_low) = m.\n\n- Find the largest n_high where f(n_high) = m.\n\nIf there is no such n_low (i.e., m is not achievable), then output 0.\n\nOtherwise, the numbers from n_low to n_high inclusive are all valid. The count is n_high - n_low + 1.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nAlternatively, find the first n where f(n) = m, and the first n where f(n) = m+1. Then the numbers between the first occurrence of m and the first occurrence of m+1 minus one would be the valid n's.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input m=1. The first occurrence of m=1 is at n=5. The first occurrence of m=2 is at n=10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are the valid ones. So the count is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFind the lower bound (the first n where f(n) = m) and upper bound (the first n where f(n) = m+1) minus 1. Then check if the lower bound exists (i.e., if there is an n where f(n)=m).\n\nBut how to find these values?\n\nWe can use binary search for this. Let's think about how to find the first occurrence of m.\n\nBut first, how to compute f(n) quickly. Well, the function f(n) is the sum of n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the term is zero.\n\nNow, for a given m, we can perform a binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) equals m. If not, then there's no solution. Else, the minimal n is found.\n\nSimilarly, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Then subtract 1 to get the upper bound.\n\nSo for example, if we find the minimal n where f(n) >= m is x, and f(x) == m, then the upper bound is the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1 minus 1.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Find the lower bound (x) where f(x) = m. How?\n\nWe can find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this x. Then check if f(x) is equal to m. If not, then there is no solution.\n\nSimilarly, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this y. Then the upper bound is y-1.\n\nSo the numbers between x and y-1 inclusive are the valid numbers. So the count is y - x.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample case m=1:\n\nx is 5 (f(5)=1). y is 10 (f(10) is 2). So the upper bound is 10-1=9. So the numbers are 5-9 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's compute:\n\nFind x where f(x) >=5. Let's see:\n\nn=24: f(24) is 4 + 0 = 4. n=25: f(25) is 5 +1 =6. So the minimal x where f(x)>=5 is 25. But f(25) is 6, which is not equal to m=5. Therefore, there is no solution. Hence output 0.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCompute x = the minimal n where f(n) >=m.\n\nIf f(x) != m, then output 0.\n\nElse, compute y = minimal n where f(n) >= m+1.\n\nThe answer is all numbers from x to y-1. So the count is y -x.\n\nBut how to compute x and y?\n\nThis is where binary search comes into play.\n\nSo the first thing is to implement a function that computes the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\nThen, for binary search, we need to find the minimal n such that f(n) >= target.\n\nSo, for example, the binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >= target.\n\nBut what is the possible range for n?\n\nWell, for target m, the minimal n is somewhere between 0 and 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the number of trailing zeros is at least m (since 5*m /5 =m, and higher terms contribute more). So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. However, for cases where m is large, like 1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but maybe even higher. Let me think: For example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5, which is 5*1. For m=2, it's 10. But for m=5, the minimal n is 25 (but f(25) is 6). So perhaps the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. But in cases where m is not achievable, but for the binary search, we need to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. So the upper bound can be 5*m, but perhaps even higher. Wait, but for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, and the number of trailing zeros for 5e5 is 5e5 /5 + 5e5/25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + ... which is way more than m. So 5*m is a safe upper bound.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >= target can be done between low=0 and high=5*target.\n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, for a given target, find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nOnce we have that, check if count_zeros(n) == target. If not, then no solution. Else, proceed.\n\nSo for the problem, given m, we need to:\n\n- Find x = find_min_n(m)\n\n- Check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, find y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n- The answer is the numbers from x to y-1 inclusive.\n\nSo the count is y -x.\n\nBut how to implement find_min_n(target)?\n\nImplementing binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nThe binary search works as follows:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5 * target.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n    if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n        high = mid\n\n    else:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, for target=1, the binary search would find 5 as the minimal n.\n\nOnce x is found, check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then no solution.\n\nElse, find y as find_min_n(m+1). Then the upper bound is y-1.\n\nSo the numbers from x to y-1 inclusive are the solutions.\n\nBut then, the number of solutions is y -x.\n\nWait, for example, in the sample case:\n\nx is 5, y is 10. y -x is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would generate the list from x to y-1 inclusive.\n\nBut what if there are multiple numbers?\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, m is given as >=1.\n\nSo for the given m, proceed.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n   the numbers are x, x+1, ..., y-1.\n\n   the count is y -x.\n\nBut how to handle cases where m+1 is not achievable? For example, if m is 5, then for m+1=6, the find_min_n(6) would be 25 (since count_zeros(25) is 6). So y is 25, and the upper bound is 25-1=24. But for x, which was the minimal n for m=5, which was not found. So in that case, the code would have already output 0.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   compute y = find_min_n(m+1).\n\n   the answer is the list of numbers from x to y-1.\n\nSo, the code for this.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nx is find_min_n(1). Binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1.\n\nWhich is 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\ny is find_min_n(2). Let's see:\n\nbinary search for minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2.\n\nCheck n=5: count is 1 <2. So low would be 5+1=6. Then check mid points. Eventually, it would find 10 as the minimal n (count_zeros(10) is 2).\n\nSo y=10. So the numbers are 5 to 9. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSample Output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. Let's see:\n\nfind x = find_min_n(5). Let's see:\n\nbinary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=20: count_zeros(20) = 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). So 4 <5.\n\nn=25: count_zeros(25) = 6. So the binary search would find 25 as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. But count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nWhich matches the second sample input.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nCase when m=0. But according to the input constraints, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nAnother case: m=2.\n\nWhat's the possible n's?\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. count_zeros(11) is 2. ... up to 14. Then 15: count_zeros(15) is 3. So the numbers are 10-14. So 5 numbers. So for m=2, the output is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=6. Let's see:\n\nfind x for m=6. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6 is 25 (count_zeros(25)=6). So x=25. Then y is find_min_n(7). What is that?\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So for target 7, the minimal n is 25+1=26? Let's compute count_zeros(26) is same as 25, 6. So need to find higher.\n\nWait, let's compute for n=25: 6. n=29: same. n=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1. Total 7. So the minimal n for target 7 is 25? No. Wait, no. Because for n=25, count is 6. So for target 7, the minimal n is 30. So the code would find y=30. Then the upper bound is 29. So the numbers from 25 to 29. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6.\n\ncount_zeros(29) is 29//5=5 + 29//25=1 → 6. So yes. So the numbers from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers. So for m=6, the output is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would work here.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, read m from input. But the input is given as a list, like in the example input, it's ['1', '5']? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. But the example shows that the input is given as a list, like ['1', '5']? Or perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example input:\n\nInput is ['1', '5'] and output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem says:\n\nInput is a single integer m. But the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says:\n\nThe input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5). So the input is a single integer. However, the sample input shows that the user is given a list of inputs, perhaps as part of the code submission for multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the original problem is that the user is to read from standard input, but the example shows that for input m=1, the output is the first case, and for m=5, the output is 0. But perhaps the original problem is that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single integer m.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. The output is first the k (number of n's) then the list. The example shows that for input 1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers, and for input 5, output is 0.\n\nBut the sample input is written as ['1', '5'], perhaps indicating that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, or perhaps it's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's given as ['1', '5'], which perhaps indicates that the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the sample output shows two outputs. But that's conflicting.\n\nLooking back at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. For example, the first input line is the number of test cases, and then each line is a test case. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. The sample input shows two lines, but perhaps that's an error in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is a single integer m.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for m=1, output is 5... and for m=5, output is 0. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. Therefore, perhaps the original problem is that the user is to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is a single integer m.\n\nThis is conflicting. But given that the sample input shows two test cases, perhaps the actual problem expects that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is a single integer m. This is confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is not in the correct format. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo, the code should read a single integer m from input. The sample input may have been presented as a list for some reason. But in reality, the code is supposed to read one line of input, which is m.\n\nIn the example given, the first sample input is m=1, and output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second sample input is m=5, output is 0. So perhaps the sample input is two separate cases, but the code is supposed to read one m per run.\n\nBut the problem's note says that the code should read input from stdin and print to stdout. So the code is supposed to process one m per run.\n\nTherefore, the code should read m from stdin as a single integer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which is perhaps a mistake in the problem statement. But the code should read m from input, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code should read m from stdin.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nProcess as discussed.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nFirst, implement the count_zeros function.\n\nThen, the binary search function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nThen, for a given m:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m+1)\n    res = list(range(x, y))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, the code would generate x=5, y=10. Then range(x, y) is [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct. So len(res) is 5, and the list is printed.\n\nBut in the sample output, the first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the code would print len(res) followed by the numbers. However, the code currently prints len(res) and then the numbers. But for the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWait, but in the code above, the first print is len(res), then the second print is the list. So for the first sample, the output would be:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct. However, the sample output shows that it's printed as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is the same as two lines. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is two lines. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the output is given as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'], which suggests that for the first test case, the output is two lines: the first line is 5, the second line is the numbers. Which is exactly what the code does.\n\nBut for the case where the answer is zero, the code prints 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when the answer is zero, the code prints 0. But according to the problem statement, the output should first print k (the number of values), then print the k integers. So when k is zero, the code should print 0 and nothing else.\n\nBut in the code, when the count_zeros(x) != m, then print 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, when the answer is zero, the code prints 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's test for m=5. For that, x is find_min_n(5) which returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. x is find_min_n(6) which returns 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). Then y is find_min_n(7) which returns 30. So the list is 25,26,27,28,29. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would output 5 followed by these numbers.\n\nNow, what about m=2?\n\nx is find_min_n(2) which returns 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. Then y is find_min_n(3) which returns 15. So the list is 10-14 (5 numbers). Correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5. How efficient is this code?\n\nThe binary search for find_min_n is O(log(5*target)), and for each step, count_zeros is O(log n). So for target=1e5, 5*target is 5e5, and log2(5e5) is about 19 steps. Each step for count_zeros is O(log n) steps. So overall, it's acceptable for Python.\n\nBut for m=1e5, the code should handle it.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the input, we need to read m from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead m from input. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        y = find_min_n(m+1)\n        res = list(range(x, y))\n        print(len(res))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, for the case where m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nBut what if m=0 is passed? Well, the code would process it, but according to the problem statement, it's not required.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nOutput is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Input 5: m=5. Output is 0.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is ['1', '5'], which may be a mistake. But the code handles a single m.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case is m=1, and the output is as expected. The second case is m=5, output 0.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, check for the case where m=0. Well, the code will process it, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nBut the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible edge case: m=1, but the code returns 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: m=2, which returns 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=3.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nThe numbers for which trailing zeros is 3.\n\nn=15: count_zeros(15) = 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). Then 16, 17, 18, 19: same count. Then 20: 20//5=4 + 20//25=0 →4. So the numbers from 15 to 19. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code should return 5 numbers. So for m=3, the code would return 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother case: m=4.\n\nThe first occurrence is n=20 (count_zeros(20) is 4). Then the next is 25, which has count_zeros(25) =6. So the code would check for find_min_n(4) is 20. Then find_min_n(5) is 25. So the numbers from 20 to 24. Which is 5 numbers. So yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother case: m=6. As discussed earlier, returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $ using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To find the range of $ n $ values that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search to determine the smallest $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m $. We then check if this value indeed results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, there are no valid $ n $ values.\n3. **Range Determination**: Once the smallest $ n $ for $ m $ trailing zeros is found, we determine the smallest $ n $ for $ m+1 $ trailing zeros. The valid $ n $ values lie between these two points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        y = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        res = list(range(x, y))\n        print(len(res))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing the integer divisions of $ n $ by increasing powers of 5.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target value. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the possible values of $ n $.\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the input $ m $, determines the smallest $ n $ for $ m $ trailing zeros, checks if it is valid, and then finds the upper bound for valid $ n $ values. It then prints the count and the valid range of $ n $ values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the constraints and edge cases, providing an optimal solution using binary search and mathematical insights into trailing zeros in factorials.",
