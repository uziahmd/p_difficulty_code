He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where this count equals m. But how?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but why? Let's check:\n\n5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! is 5040 (1), etc. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers (5-9?), but wait 5 is the first one. So the numbers from 5 to 9 inclusive. Wait why does 9! have 1 trailing zero? Let me check. 9! = 362880, yes, ends with one zero. So that's why the sample input gives 5 numbers.\n\nBut how do I find all n's that have exactly m trailing zeros?\n\nThe key idea here is that for each m, there might be 0, 1, or 5 possible n's. Wait, why 5? Because when you have a number like 25, which contributes two 5s. So for example, when m is 5, maybe there's a range of numbers that contribute exactly 5 zeros. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the function that counts the number of trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding a higher number can't decrease the count. So for example, when n increases, the count of zeros either stays the same or increases. So for a given m, there might be a range of n's that give exactly m zeros. But how long is that range?\n\nLet me think about the example where m is 5. Let's compute the count for n=24: 24/5 = 4, 24/25=0. Total is 4. For n=25, it's 25/5=5, plus 25/25=1, total 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. So the answer would be zero. Wait, but what about numbers between 25 and ...?\n\nWait, let's take m=6. For n=25, the count is 6. For n=26, it's same as 25, since 26/5 is 5.2, floor is 5, 26/25 is 1, so total 6. Similarly for 27, 28, 29. Then for n=30, 30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7. So for m=6, the numbers are 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. That's five numbers. So the answer would be 5 numbers. So in this case, the count is 5.\n\nSo the pattern seems that for some m, there are 5 numbers, but for others, there are none. But how to find that?\n\nSo the approach is: For a given m, find all n such that the count of zeros is exactly m. How to find them?\n\nFirst, we need to find the possible n's. Since the count function is non-decreasing, for each m, there's a range of n's where the count is exactly m. However, sometimes there's no such n. For example, when m is 5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Because between 24 (count 4) and 25 (count 6), there's a jump. So for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Find the minimum n such that the count of zeros is >= m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Check if the count for low is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the maximum n where the count is exactly m. Then all numbers between low and high (inclusive) are valid.\n\nBut how to find the possible n's?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the largest n where the count is exactly m. The numbers between these two would be the possible answers.\n\nWait, but how do we find the range of n's that have exactly m zeros?\n\nAnother approach: For each m, the possible n's are in a range where the count of zeros is m. Let's think of the count function as f(n). So for a certain m, the values of n where f(n) = m.\n\nSince f(n) is non-decreasing, the set of n's where f(n)=m is a contiguous range. So if there exists any n with f(n)=m, then there is a range of numbers [a, b] such that for all x in [a,b], f(x) = m. The length of this range can be 1 or more.\n\nBut how to find a and b?\n\nLet me think. Let's find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n where f(n) = m. All numbers between them will be valid.\n\nBut how to find these numbers?\n\nAlternatively, find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then find the minimal n where f(n) = m+1. Then the numbers between the first and the second minus one would be the valid numbers.\n\nFor example, for m=6, the minimal n where f(n)=6 is 25. The minimal n where f(n)=7 is 30. So the valid numbers are 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFind the lower bound (the first n where f(n) = m) and upper bound (the first n where f(n) = m+1). Then the numbers between lower and upper -1 are the valid ones.\n\nBut how to find the lower bound?\n\nBut how do we know if there exists any n with f(n) = m? Because for some m, there's no such n. For example, m=5.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find the first n where f(n) = m. Let's call it a.\n\n2. Find the first n where f(n) = m+1. Let's call it b.\n\nThen the numbers from a to b-1 are the valid ones. But if a doesn't exist (i.e., there's no n with f(n)=m), then the answer is zero.\n\nBut how to find a and b?\n\nTo find a, we can perform a binary search for the minimal n where f(n) = m. But how to check if such an n exists?\n\nAlternatively, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call that x. Then check if f(x) is equal to m. If not, then there's no solution. Else, proceed.\n\nSimilarly, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call that y. Then the numbers from x to y-1 are the valid ones.\n\nSo the count of numbers is y - x.\n\nBut how to compute x and y?\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor a given m, compute x = the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nIf f(x) != m, then there are no solutions. So output 0.\n\nElse, compute y = the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1.\n\nThen the numbers from x to y-1 are the valid ones. The count is y - x.\n\nBut how to compute x and y?\n\nWe can use binary search for that.\n\nNow, the function f(n) is the count of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nSo the function to compute f(n) is straightforward:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nSo for binary search, for example, to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search can be done between 0 and 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, and higher divisions contribute more). So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m.\n\nWait, but for m=1, 5*1=5. Which is the correct n. For m=5, 5*5=25. Which is the n that gives count_zeros(25) = 6. So perhaps the upper bound can be 5*m. But maybe even higher?\n\nBut for binary search, the upper bound can be 5*m. Because for example, the minimal n that gives count_zeros(n) >= m is at most 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least 1, and there are m multiples of 5 in 5*m).\n\nWait, for example, m=5. 5*5=25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is >=5. So the upper bound is okay.\n\nSo the binary search for x (the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m) can be done between low=0 and high=5*m.\n\nOnce we find x, check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find y, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the answer is the numbers from x to y-1.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nx is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1. Which is 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1, which is equal to m. Then y is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2. Let's see: for 10, count_zeros(10) is 2. So y=10. So the valid numbers are from 5 to 9 (y-1=9). So that's 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's compute x. Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4 <5.\n\ncount_zeros(25) = 5+1=6 >=5. So x=25. Then check count_zeros(x)=6 !=5. So there are no solutions. Hence output 0.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\nGiven m, compute x as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nIf count_zeros(x) !=m, then output 0.\n\nElse, compute y as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m+1.\n\nThe answer is the list of numbers from x to y-1, inclusive.\n\nSo the number of such numbers is y -x.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nFirst, implement the count_zeros function.\n\nThen, implement a binary search function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nSo the binary search function could be something like:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for the binary search, the initial high can be 5*target, but maybe even higher? Well, for the case where target is 1, 5*target is 5, which is correct. For larger targets, perhaps 5*target is sufficient.\n\nBut let's think: For target m, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is at most 5*m. Because, for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because each multiple of 5 contributes 1, and there are m multiples of 5 in 5*m. But there are also higher multiples (like 25, 125, etc.) which contribute more. So the count_zeros(5*m) is definitely >= m. So the upper bound is safe.\n\nSo the binary search function would work.\n\nOnce x is found, check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then return 0.\n\nOtherwise, find y as find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers from x to y-1 are the answer.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\nRead m.\n\nif m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, m is >=1.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo for m:\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ny = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from x to y-1 inclusive.\n\nSo the count is y -x.\n\nBut then, how to generate the list of numbers?\n\nFor example, if x is 5 and y is 10, then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the list is [x, x+1, ..., y-1].\n\nSo the code would generate this list.\n\nBut what about when y -x is zero? Well, that can't happen because if x is such that count_zeros(x) = m, then y is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So for x, count_zeros(x) is m. For y, count_zeros(y) is >= m+1. So y must be greater than x, since count_zeros is non-decreasing. So y -x is at least 1. So the list is non-empty.\n\nBut in the case where m is such that there's exactly one n (like m=6, but wait no, for m=6, there are 5 numbers). Wait, no. Let me think. For example, if m=6, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29. So y is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7. Which is 30. So y -x is 30-25=5. Which gives 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would generate the list correctly.\n\nNow, the edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m=0. But according to the input constraints, m starts at 1. So we don't need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: m=5. As discussed earlier, x is 25, count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output is 0.\n\nAnother case: m=6. x is 25, count_zeros(25) is 6. y is find_min_n(7). Let's compute that. Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(29) is 29//5=5 + 29//25=1 → 6. count_zeros(30) is 6 + 30//25=1 → 7. So y is 30. So the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code structure in Python.\n\nFirst, read m from input. Then process.\n\nBut note that in the sample input, the first input is '1', which outputs 5 and the numbers 5-9. The second input is '5' which outputs 0.\n\nSo the code needs to handle multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. The sample input shows two cases, but that's probably because the user provided two examples. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nInput: the only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5).\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin, and output the required answer.\n\nWait, the sample input shows ['1', '5'] as input. But that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. Because the actual input is a single integer. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is for two different test cases. Like, when m is 1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers. When m is 5, output is 0. But the code is supposed to process a single m.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin, and output the answer accordingly.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m → print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ny = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthen the numbers are x, x+1, ..., y-1.\n\nSo the count is y -x.\n\nSo the code can generate the list as list(range(x, y)).\n\nBut in Python, range is exclusive of the end. So for example, range(x, y) gives x, x+1,..., y-1.\n\nSo the code can generate the list as list(range(x, y)).\n\nBut for large m, say m=1e5, then x and y could be up to 5*1e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut what about the time complexity?\n\nThe binary search for each find_min_n is O(log (5*m)), which is acceptable for m up to 1e5.\n\nSo the code should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, the count_zeros function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThen, the find_min_n function.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nBut for very large targets, like 1e5, 5*target is 5e5. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nm = int(input())\n\nThen, compute x = find_min_n(m).\n\nCheck if count_zeros(x) == m.\n\nIf not, print 0.\n\nElse, compute y = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nThen, the numbers are x to y-1 inclusive.\n\nSo the list is list(range(x, y)).\n\nThen, output the length of the list, followed by the elements.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nx is 5, y is 10. So range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9 → 5 elements. Correct.\n\nBut for m=5, x is 25, count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low =0\n    high =5*target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m+1)\n    res = list(range(x, y))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nWait, but the sample output for m=1 is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\".\n\nBut the code would print len(res) (5) followed by the numbers. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case is m=1, which outputs 5 followed by the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when m=0? Well, the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nBut the code should handle it.\n\nNow, testing for m=5.\n\nx = find_min_n(5). Let's compute:\n\nfind_min_n(5) would search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) is 5 +1 =6. So during binary search, the code would find low=25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 >=5 → yes. So returns 25. Then check if count_zeros(25) is 5? No, it's 6. So output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nx is find_min_n(6) → returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then y is find_min_n(7) → returns 30. So the list is 25-29, which is 5 elements. So output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nfind_min_n(2) → what is the minimal n with count_zeros(n)>=2?\n\nn=10: count_zeros(10) is 2. So x=10. Then check count_zeros(10) is 2. Then find y for m+1=3. find_min_n(3) would be 15? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(14) is 14//5=2 + 14//25=0 → 2. count_zeros(15) is 3 + 0 =3. So y=15. So the list is 10-14 → 5 numbers. So output is 5 and 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nBut wait, for example, 10! has 2 zeros, 11! also 2, etc. until 14! which has 2 zeros. 15! has 3. So yes, 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about m=3?\n\nx = find_min_n(3) → returns 15?\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3. Then y is find_min_n(4). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(19) is 3 (19//5=3, 19//25=0). count_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). So find_min_n(4) returns 20. So the list is 15-19 → 5 numbers. So output 5 and the numbers.\n\nBut wait, 15! has 3 zeros. 16! same. 17! same. 18! same. 19! same. 20! has 4. So yes, 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, reading from stdin and writing to stdout.\n\nBut what about the case when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nBut the code should handle it.\n\nBut what about the high value in find_min_n?\n\nFor target=1e5, high is 5*1e5 = 500,000. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be as follows:\n\nRead m.\n\nBut the code may have to handle multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So the code reads one line, which is m.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which is probably a mistake in the problem statement. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m.\n\nSo the code should read m from stdin, and process accordingly.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code may have to be written in a way that can handle multiple test cases. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is a single integer m. So the code is written for one m.\n\nBut the sample input shows two cases. Probably, that's a mistake. For example, in the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich probably indicates that the first input is m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is m=5, output is 0. But the code is supposed to read a single m.\n\nSo the code is written for a single m.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nImplement the functions as before.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code may have to be written with the functions inside.\n\nBut for the code to be efficient, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nRead m.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low =0\n    high =5*target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nBut for very large m, say 1e5, 5*target is 5e5. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m+1)\n    res = list(range(x, y))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, the code outputs 5 followed by the numbers. But the sample output shows that the first line is 5 and the second line is the numbers. However, the code prints len(res) followed by the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for m=1 is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is two lines. So the code would print len(res) as first line, and then the numbers as the second line. Which matches.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is given as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'], which for the first case, the output is two lines. So the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, the code for the first case would print:\n\nprint(len(res)) → 5\n\nprint(' '.join(...)) → 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is two lines. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when the list is empty? Well, in that case, the code would print 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nBut the code handles m=0 as well, but the problem says that m is ≥1.\n\nNow, testing for m=0 would be invalid, but the code would output 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code may have to be written with the functions inside, but in Python, that's allowed.\n\nBut what about the case when m is 0? Well, the problem says that m is between 1 and 1e5, so no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nThe code would return 5 numbers: 10,11,12,13,14.\n\nAnother test case: m=3 → 15-19.\n\nAnother test case: m=4 → 20-24?\n\nLet me check:\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0 → total 4). count_zeros(24) is 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 → 4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=4, x is 20. y is find_min_n(5) which is 25. So the list is 20-24 (5 numbers). So yes.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of numbers that satisfy the given condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s determines the number of trailing zeros.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: Using binary search, we can efficiently find the smallest number $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $. We then check if this number indeed gives exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, there are no valid numbers.\n3. **Range Calculation**: Once we confirm the smallest number with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we find the smallest number with $ m+1 $ trailing zeros. The valid numbers lie between these two values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    res = list(range(x, y))\n    print(len(res))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the range of possible values.\n3. **Main Logic**: After determining the smallest number $ x $ with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we check if it indeed has $ m $ zeros. If not, we print 0. Otherwise, we find the smallest number $ y $ with $ m+1 $ trailing zeros and generate the list of valid numbers from $ x $ to $ y-1 $.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the required range of numbers using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large values of $ m $.",
