The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 chance), there's a way to assign signal powers so that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what configurations of towers are valid. Let's think about the conditions required for such a setup.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower's signal. So, for any tower, its signal power must be such that it doesn't reach beyond town 0 or n+1. For example, if there's a tower at position i, then its power p must satisfy that i - p >= 0 (so that town 0 isn't covered) and i + p <= n+1 (so that town n+1 isn't covered). Wait, but the signal reaches cities c where |c - i| < p. So for town 0, which is at position 0, the distance from tower i is i. So to not cover town 0, we need i >= p. Similarly, for town n+1, the distance is (n+1 - i). So to not cover it, we need (n+1 - i) >= p. Therefore, p must be <= min(i, n+1 -i). \n\nBut when choosing the signal powers, the problem allows us to set them as needed, as long as the constraints are met. So the question is: for a given set of towers (some subset of 1..n), can we assign p_i's such that:\n\n- For each tower i, p_i is between 1 and n (but also, p_i must be such that the coverage doesn't reach 0 or n+1. So for each tower, p_i <= min(i, n+1 -i). Because if i is at position i, then the maximum p_i can be is min(i, n+1 -i). Otherwise, the tower would cover town 0 or n+1. So for example, a tower at position 1 can have p_i up to 1 (since min(1, n+1 -1) = 1). \n\nBut how does that affect the configuration?\n\nMoreover, each town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once. So the coverage regions must partition the towns 1..n into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower.\n\nThis seems similar to some kind of tiling problem. Maybe the valid tower configurations are those that form a certain structure, like a set of towers where each tower covers a certain range, and these ranges don't overlap except at the edges. \n\nLet me think of the example given. For n=5, towers at 2,4,5. The signal for 2 is 2, so it covers towns 1,2,3. Then 4 has power 1 (covers 3,4?), wait no. Wait, the signal from a tower at i with power p reaches all cities c where |c -i| < p. So for p=2, the tower at 2 covers cities 0 < c < 4? Wait, no. Let's take c=0: |0-2|=2. So 2 < p? No, because p=2. So |c-i| < p means that c is in (i - p + 1, i + p - 1). Or maybe I should think of the range as [i - p + 1, i + p -1] ?\n\nWait, for example, if p is 2, then the tower covers cities where their distance is less than 2. So cities at distance 1 or 0. So for a tower at i, it covers i-1, i, i+1. Because |c - i| < 2 implies c is i-1, i, or i+1. Wait, no. If p is 2, then |c - i| < 2. So c can be i-1 (distance 1), i (distance 0), or i+1 (distance 1). But i+2 is distance 2, which is not less than p=2. So the coverage is i-1, i, i+1. So the coverage is a range of length 2p -1? Or maybe the maximum reach is p-1 steps in either direction. So the tower's coverage is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), inclusive. So the length is 2p-1.\n\nBut for the problem, the key is that the coverage of the towers must exactly cover each town once, and not cover 0 or n+1. \n\nSo, perhaps the valid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 through n (each with a 50% chance), we can assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Configurations**: The valid configurations of towers must allow for a way to set signal powers such that each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once, and towns 0 and n+1 are not covered. This structure resembles a tiling problem where each tower's coverage area must be non-overlapping except at the edges.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid ways to place towers up to position `i`.\n\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each position `i`, we consider two cases:\n   - Placing a tower at `i` and extending coverage from the previous valid configuration.\n   - Not placing a tower at `i` and continuing from the previous valid configuration.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle divisions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: no towns considered, one way\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: place a tower at i, and it covers i and possibly some left\n        # The previous configuration must end at i-1, but with the tower at i covering i\n        # So the previous state is dp[i-1]\n        # But also, we can have a tower at i-1 and i, but that would require overlapping coverage\n        # Wait, perhaps the recurrence is similar to tiling with dominoes or something else\n        # Let me think again\n        \n        # The correct recurrence is based on the observation that valid configurations\n        # correspond to those where towers are placed such that each tower is either\n        # isolated or adjacent to another tower, forming a certain pattern.\n        \n        # After thinking about the problem, the recurrence is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]\n        # This is because if we place a tower at i, then the previous must have ended at i-1\n        # and the tower at i must cover i, which requires that the previous configuration ends\n        # at i-1 and the tower at i is placed. However, this seems too simplistic.\n        \n        # Looking at the examples:\n        # For n=2, the answer is 1/4. The valid configuration is both towers present.\n        # For n=3, the answer is 1/4. The valid configurations are:\n        # - all three towers present (but then how to assign power? Maybe not possible)\n        # Or according to the note, for n=3, it's 1/8 (for all 3) + 1/8 (only middle) = 1/4.\n        # So the number of valid configurations is 2. Since total is 2^3 = 8, 2/8 = 1/4.\n        \n        # Therefore, the valid configurations are those where the towers form a pattern that allows\n        # for a partitioning into ranges. This seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n        \n        # From the note, the number of valid configurations for n is F(n+1), where F is Fibonacci.\n        # For example:\n        # n=2: F(3) = 2, which gives 2/2^2 = 2/4 = 1/2?

No tower at 1: Then the rest must be valid for n-1 towns. But this may not be allowed.\n        # 2. Tower at 1: Then it must cover town 1. Its maximum power is 1 (since min(1, n+1 -1) = 1).\n        #    So the power is 1, which covers town 1 only.

Power 2 for 2 (covers 1,2,3) and power 1 for 3 (covers 3,4). No, overlapping.\n        # Wait, that's invalid. So need to find valid ones.\n        # Let's think of the valid configurations as those where the towers are placed such that each tower covers a unique segment, and the segments do not overlap.\n        # This seems similar to the problem of tiling with dominoes and trominoes, but with different rules.\n        \n        # Another idea: the valid configurations are those where the set of towers forms a structure where every tower is either alone or paired with its neighbor, forming a certain pattern.\n        \n        # After some research, this problem is similar to the number of ways to tile a 1xN grid with tiles of size 1 and 2, but with different constraints.\n        \n        # According to the examples and the note, the number of valid configurations for n is equal to the (n)th Fibonacci number minus something. However, without more data, it's hard to tell.\n        \n        # Alternatively, considering the answer for n=2 is 1, n=3 is 2, n=5 is 5 (from the third example, 5/32), which suggests that the number of valid configurations is the (n)th Fibonacci number, starting with f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=2, f(4)=3, f(5)=5, etc. But for n=2, the valid count is 1, which matches f(2)=1. For n=3, it's 2, which matches f(3)=2. For n=5, it's 5, which matches f(5)=5.

This is derived from the observation that valid configurations follow a pattern similar to tiling problems, where each configuration can be extended by adding a new tower or extending an existing one.\n\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result must be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular exponentiation to compute the inverse of `2^n` efficiently.

And we need to compute this modulo 998244353.\n        \n        # So the plan is to compute the nth Fibonacci number, then compute (f(n) * inv(2^n)) mod MOD.\n        \n        # Let's verify the examples:\n        # For n=2: f(2)=1, 1/4 = 0.25. Which matches the first example.\n        # For n=3: f(3)=2, 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches the second example.\n        # For n=5: f(5)=5, 5/32 = 0.15625. Which matches the third example.\n        \n        # Great! So the number of valid configurations is the (n)th Fibonacci number, assuming f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(3)=2, etc.\n        \n        # Now, the problem reduces to computing the nth Fibonacci number, then multiplying by the modular inverse of 2^n modulo 998244353.\n        \n        # So let's compute this.\n        \n        # Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to n.\n        fib = [0] * (n + 1)\n        fib[1] = 1\n        if n >= 2:\n            fib[2] = 1\n        for i in range(3, n + 1):\n            fib[i] = (fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) % MOD\n        \n        # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n        pow2 = pow(2, n, MOD)\n        \n        # Compute inverse of pow2 mod MOD\n        inv_pow2 = pow(pow2, MOD-2, MOD)\n        \n        result = (fib[n] * inv_pow2) % MOD\n        print(result)\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
