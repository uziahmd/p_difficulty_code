    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded on a plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns. We need to add k rings of gilding. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nLet me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For the i-th ring, it's based on a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we get the number of cells in that ring?\n\nWait, the description says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, no, maybe I need to think about it differently. Let me rephrase: For the first ring (i=1), it's the outermost layer. The next ring (i=2) is two cells away from the edge, which would be the perimeter of a rectangle that's smaller by 2*2 cells on each side. Wait, maybe the formula for the dimensions of the rectangle for the i-th ring is (w - 2*(i-1)*2) by (h - 2*(i-1)*2). Because each ring takes away two cells from each side. Wait, for example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The second ring would be the perimeter of a rectangle that's 2 cells in from each edge. So for the original width w, the next ring would be (w - 2*2) in width? Because you subtract two cells from both left and right. So for each ring i, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1))? Because for each step, you subtract 2 from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so 2*2 = 4 per dimension.\n\nSo for each ring i, the rectangle has dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). But how do we compute the number of cells in that ring?\n\nThe perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter is the total cells in the border. For example, a rectangle of 3x3 cells has a perimeter of 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since the corners are counted twice). Wait, another way: the perimeter is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because for a rectangle, the perimeter in terms of cells is (width * 2) + (height - 2) * 2. Wait, no. Let me think. For a rectangle of W columns and H rows, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (H-2) each. So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Which simplifies to 2*(W + H) - 4. So yes.\n\nSo for each ring i, the number of cells is 2*( (current_width) + (current_height) - 2 ), where current_width is (w - 4*(i-1)) and current_height is (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. So for each ring, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle. However, we need to make sure that the rectangle is valid. For example, if the current_width or current_height is less than or equal to zero, then that ring can't exist. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. So the input ensures that for all i up to k, the dimensions are valid.\n\nSo the approach is to loop for each ring from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter for the corresponding dimensions, and sum them all.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. So for i=1:\n\ncurrent_width = 3 - 4*(0) = 3\n\ncurrent_height = 3 - 4*(0) = 3\n\nperimeter is 2*(3+3 - 2) = 2*(4) = 8. Which matches the first output.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So for i=1:\n\ncurrent_width =7, current_height=9. Perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 -2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the second output.\n\nThird example input is 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9: 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring: i=2. current_width is 7 - 4*(1) = 3. current_height is 9 -4*(1) = 5. So perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6 = 12. Wait, but the output is 40. 28+12=40. Yes, which matches the third example. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nadd perimeter to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me check for example, if w and h are 3, then min is 3. (3+1)/4 is 1, floor is 1. So k can be 1. Which is correct because for i=1, current_w and current_h are 3, but for i=2, it would be 3-4*(1) = -1. Which is invalid. But the input constraints ensure that k is such that for all i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to handle that.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for another example. Let's say for a 5x5 plate, k=1. The perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be correct. For k=2, the current_w and current_h would be 5-4*(1) = 1. So 1x1. Then perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Which makes sense, since a 1x1 rectangle has no perimeter. But according to the problem statement, the input k is valid. So for example, if the input is 5x5 and k=2, then according to the input constraints, the minimum of w and h is 5. So floor( (5 +1)/4 ) = 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then compute the sum as described.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single line with three integers. For example, the sample inputs are like '3 3 1', etc. So in Python, read the input line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, let me test the third sample input. Input is 7 9 2. Let's compute:\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. \n\ni=2: current_w=7 -4*1=3, current_h=9-4*1=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 3 3 1. Output is 8. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Output is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: if w=5, h=5, k=1. What if k=1? That's allowed. So the code works.\n\nYes, this should handle all cases. So the code should be correct.\n",
