    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. But the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the width and height decrease by 4*(i-1) as i increases. Wait, for example, the first ring (i=1) is the border of the original rectangle. Then for the second ring (i=2), it's the border of a rectangle that's 4*(2-1) = 4 units smaller in both dimensions. Wait, but how does that work? Let me think: for the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. The next ring is 2 cells inward. So the rectangle for the second ring would be (w - 2*2) × (h - 2*2) ? Because each ring takes 2 cells from each side. Wait, for example, if you have a rectangle of width w, then the first ring is the perimeter. The next ring would be inside, which would require that the width is at least 2*2 + 1? Or maybe the formula given in the problem is correct. The problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for each ring, the rectangle is 4*(i-1) smaller in each dimension. So for i=1, the rectangle is w x h, and the ring is its perimeter. For i=2, the rectangle is (w-4) × (h-4), and the ring is its perimeter. But wait, how does that work? Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4 (since the corners are counted twice). Wait, the number of cells in the perimeter of a rectangle of size a x b is 2*(a + b) - 4. Because each side has a cells, but the corners are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's perimeter is 3*4 - 4 = 8, which matches the first example input where 3 3 1 gives 8. That makes sense.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating for each ring i from 1 to k, the perimeter of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and summing all these perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each i, the rectangle must be valid. For example, if the original w and h are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1) from each, the resulting dimensions must be at least 1x1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ), which ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to worry about negative numbers here.\n\nSo the plan is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w', h') where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the perimeter for each ring? Let's take the formula: for a rectangle of a x b, the perimeter in cells is 2*(a + b) - 4. Because, for example, a 3x3 rectangle has 3*4 - 4 = 8 cells in perimeter. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) - 4\nsum += perimeter\n\nBut wait, let me check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1. So i=1:\n\ncurrent_w =3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond sample input: 7 9 1. So current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird sample input: 7 9 2. For i=1: 7x9, perimeter 28. For i=2: current_w =7-4*(2-1) =7-4=3, current_h=9-4*(2-1)=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Sum is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is to loop from 1 to k, compute for each i the perimeter of the current rectangle, and sum them all.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nThe input is three integers w, h, k. So read them from input.\n\nThen, initialize total = 0.\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nadd to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes zero or negative? But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me think: For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 = 1, so k can be up to 1. For i=1, 4*(i-1) is 0, so current_w and current_h are 3 and ... Well, for the first ring, it's allowed.\n\nFor example, if min(w, h) is 5. Then (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. So for i=1, the current_w and current_h are w and h, which are >=3. So for i=1, the perimeter is okay.\n\nAnother example: if min(w, h) is 7. Then (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be up to 2. For i=2, 4*(2-1) =4. So current_w is w-4, current_h is h-4. Since min(w, h) is 7, then say w=7, h= something >=7. Then current_w is 7-4=3, current_h is h-4 >= 7-4=3. So the rectangle is 3x (something >=3), which is valid.\n\nThus, the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal =0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut let me test the third sample input: 7 9 2.\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. add to total.\n\ni=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5)-4= 16-4=12. total is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: let's take when k=0? Well, according to the input constraints, k is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother test case: say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5) -4 = 16. Which is 5x5 square's perimeter. Which is 5*4 -4 = 16. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=2. Then for i=1, perimeter is 16. For i=2, current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1) -4 = 4-4=0. So total is 16+0=16. But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, the second ring would be the border of a 1x1 rectangle. But that's just a single cell. The perimeter would be 0? Because 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. So that's correct. Because the ring is the border of the 1x1 rectangle, which is just the cell itself. But according to the problem statement, the rings are added as per the description. However, in this case, the second ring would be 2 cells away from the edge. But for a 5x5 plate, the first ring is the edge. The second ring is 2 cells inward. But 5-2*2 = 1. So the rectangle is 1x1. The border of that is just the single cell. But how many cells are in that ring? Well, the formula gives 0. But that's not correct. Wait, perhaps my formula is wrong here.\n\nWait, for a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter is 4 cells? But according to the formula 2*(a + b) -4, it would be 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. But that's not correct. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh, here's a mistake. Because for the formula, when the rectangle is 1x1, the perimeter is 4 cells. But according to the formula, it's 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. Which is wrong. So what's the correct formula for the perimeter?\n\nLet me think again. How to calculate the number of cells in the perimeter of a rectangle of a x b.\n\nThe perimeter is the outermost cells. For example, a rectangle of a rows and b columns. The number of cells in the perimeter is:\n\nIf a == 1 and b == 1: 1 cell.\n\nIf a == 1, then the perimeter is b cells (since it's a single row).\n\nIf b == 1, then the perimeter is a cells (single column).\n\nOtherwise, it's 2*a + 2*b - 4. Because each side has a cells (top and bottom) and b cells (left and right), but the four corners are counted twice. So subtract 4.\n\nSo for a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter is 1 cell. For a 1x2 rectangle, the perimeter is 2 cells (the entire row). For a 2x2 rectangle, the perimeter is 4 cells (each cell is on the perimeter). Using the formula 2*(a + b) -4: 2*(2+2) -4 = 4, which is correct. For 1x1, the formula gives 0, but the actual is 1.\n\nSo the formula is incorrect for cases where a or b is 1. So how do I adjust for that?\n\nIn the problem statement, the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for that rectangle, the ring is the perimeter. But when the rectangle is 1x1, the perimeter is 1 cell. So how to compute that?\n\nSo the correct formula for the perimeter is:\n\nif a == 1 and b == 1: 1\n\nelif a == 1: b\n\nelif b == 1: a\n\nelse: 2*(a + b) -4\n\nSo in the code, I need to handle these cases.\n\nBut wait, in our problem, when would a or b be 1? For example, when the original w and h are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1), the current_w or current_h is 1. Let's take the earlier example of w=5, h=5, k=2. For i=2, current_w =5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. So the perimeter is 1 cell. So the code would have added 1 instead of 0. So the previous approach was wrong.\n\nSo how to fix this?\n\nSo the code needs to calculate for each current_w and current_h, the perimeter correctly. So the formula is:\n\nperimeter = 0\n\nif current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n    perimeter = 1\n\nelif current_w == 1:\n\n    perimeter = current_h\n\nelif current_h == 1:\n\n    perimeter = current_w\n\nelse:\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nSo that's the correct way to compute the perimeter. So the code needs to account for that.\n\nBut in the sample input, for example, when the third example is 7 9 2. For i=2, current_w is 3, current_h is 5. So the perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 12, which is correct. So the code would have worked.\n\nBut for the case where current_w is 1 and current_h is 5, the perimeter is 5 cells.\n\nSo the code needs to handle these cases. So the previous approach was missing that.\n\nSo how does this affect the problem? Let's think about the original sample input. For example, the first sample input is 3x3, k=1. current_w and current_h are 3 and 3. So the formula 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which is correct. So the code would have worked.\n\nBut for the case where current_w and current_h are 1, the code would have added 1 instead of 0. So the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo, how to adjust the code?\n\nLet me think. So for each current_w and current_h, compute the perimeter as follows:\n\nif current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n    add 1\n\nelif current_w == 1:\n\n    add current_h\n\nelif current_h == 1:\n\n    add current_w\n\nelse:\n\n    add 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nBut how to implement this in Python.\n\nSo, in the code, for each i:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nthen compute perimeter.\n\nSo, let's adjust the code accordingly.\n\nLet me test the case where current_w=1, current_h=1. Then the perimeter is 1. So in that case, the code would add 1.\n\nAnother example: current_w=1, current_h=5. The perimeter is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: current_w=2, current_h=1. Perimeter is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: current_w=2, current_h=2. Perimeter is 2*(2+2) -4 = 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code must include these conditions.\n\nSo the code should be modified to handle these cases.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nfor each i in 1 to k:\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = 1\n\n    elif current_w == 1:\n\n        perimeter = current_h\n\n    elif current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = current_w\n\n    else:\n\n        perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nSo this would handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, let's take the case where current_w is 1 and current_h is 3. Then the perimeter is 3. Which is correct. Because the perimeter is the entire row of 3 cells.\n\nBut in the original problem's description, the rings are formed as the bordering cells on the inner rectangle. So for a 1x3 rectangle, the border is the entire rectangle, which is 3 cells.\n\nSo yes, the code must handle this.\n\nNow, let's re-calculate the example where w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: current_w=5, current_h=5. perimeter is 2*(5+5) -4 = 16. total is 16.\n\ni=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. perimeter is 1. total is 16+1=17.\n\nBut according to the problem's logic, what's the correct answer here?\n\nThe first ring is the perimeter of 5x5. Which is 16. The second ring is the perimeter of 1x1. Which is 1. So total is 17.\n\nBut according to the original code (without handling the 1x1 case), it would have added 0, giving 16. Which is wrong. So the code must be adjusted.\n\nSo now, the code needs to handle these cases.\n\nSo, the code needs to include these conditions.\n\nSo, the code will be:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = 1\n\n    elif current_w == 1:\n\n        perimeter = current_h\n\n    elif current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = current_w\n\n    else:\n\n        perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nNow, let's test this code with the previous example of 5,5,2. It would return 16+1=17.\n\nBut what about another example where current_w=1 and current_h=2. Then perimeter is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: current_w=2, current_h=1. Perimeter is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: current_w=1, current_h=1. Perimeter is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: current_w=3, current_h=1. Perimeter is 3. Correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's check the sample inputs again.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w=3, current_h=3. Not 1, so else clause: 2*(3+3)-4= 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1. current_w=7, current_h=9. else clause. 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2. i=1: 28. i=2: current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. else clause: 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. sum 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 5 5 2. total is 16+1=17.\n\nAnother test case: 5 5 1. total is 16.\n\nAnother case: 5 5 3. Let's see. What is k allowed here? The input constraints say k is up to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). For w=h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 3. So the code is not required to handle that.\n\nBut suppose for example, w=9, h=9, k=2. For i=1: current_w=9, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(9+9) -4 = 32. For i=2: current_w=9-4=5, current_h=9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(5+5)-4= 16. Total is 32+16=48.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=1. Output is 16.\n\nAnother example: w=1, h=1, k=1. But according to input constraints, w and h are at least 3. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then process as above.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead input line as w, h, k.\n\nThen compute the sum.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input line. For example, in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = 1\n\n    elif current_w == 1:\n\n        perimeter = current_h\n\n    elif current_h == 1:\n\n        perimeter = current_w\n\n    else:\n\n        perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nLet me test this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: '3 3 1' → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: '7 9 1' → 28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: '7 9 2' → 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 5 5 2. Output is 16 + 1 = 17.\n\nAnother test case: 5 5 1 → 16.\n\nAnother test case: 1x1 is not allowed.\n\nAnother test case: 5 7 2.\n\ni=1: current_w=5, current_h=7. perimeter is 2*(5+7) -4 = 24-4=20. i=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=7-4=3. perimeter is 3. total is 20+3=23.\n\nSo for input 5 7 2, output is 23.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is added at increasing distances from the edge of the plate, and the solution involves calculating the perimeter of each ring's inner rectangle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. The first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is 2 cells inward, and so on. The dimensions of each subsequent inner rectangle decrease by 4 units in both width and height (2 units from each side) for each ring.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, we calculate the perimeter of the corresponding inner rectangle. The perimeter calculation must handle special cases where the dimensions of the rectangle might be 1x1, 1xn, or nx1, which have different perimeter calculations compared to standard rectangles.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: Sum the perimeters of all rings from 1 to k, considering the adjusted dimensions for each ring.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    if current_w == 1 and current_h == 1:\n        perimeter = 1\n    elif current_w == 1:\n        perimeter = current_h\n    elif current_h == 1:\n        perimeter = current_w\n    else:\n        perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width), `h` (height), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the dimensions of the inner rectangle by adjusting the width and height based on the ring index.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**:\n   - If the inner rectangle is 1x1, the perimeter is 1.\n   - If the inner rectangle is 1xn or nx1, the perimeter is simply the length of the side.\n   - For standard rectangles (both dimensions greater than 1), use the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4` to avoid counting corners twice.\n4. **Summing Up**: Accumulate the perimeter of each ring to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and applying the appropriate perimeter calculation, ensuring correctness for all valid input dimensions.",
