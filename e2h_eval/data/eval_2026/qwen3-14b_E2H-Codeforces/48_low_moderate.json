            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, but if b is 'R', then we have to convert it to Roman numerals. Also, there's some specifics about the input and output.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\nFirst, the input is two lines. The first line has a and b (but b can be 'R'). The second line is the number c in base a. We need to convert this number to base b, which could be a regular base or Roman numerals.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Parse the input: get a, b (could be R), and the string c in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to decimal (integer).\n3. If b is not R, convert the decimal integer to base b, without leading zeros.\n4. If b is R, convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n\nBut wait, there's some constraints. For example, when converting to Roman, the number must be between 1 and 3000 (inclusive). The problem says that if Roman is involved, the number is guaranteed to be <= 3000 and not zero. So I don't have to handle 0 in that case.\n\nNow, let's think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting the input string c from base a to decimal. The input c can have leading zeros, but when converting, those are just part of the number. For example, if a is 10 and c is '001', that's 1 in decimal.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion? Well, for each character in the string, we can process it as a digit in base a. But note that for bases larger than 10, letters may be used. Wait, the problem says that in bases greater than 10, letters A, B, etc. are used. So for example, in base 12, the digits go from 0-9, then A (10), B (11).\n\nBut the input c is given in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then the input could have letters like A-F. But the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. So the input string c can contain digits and letters (uppercase?), but the problem says that in the input, the c is given in base a. So for example, if a is 12, then the input c can have digits up to 11, represented as 0-9 and A (for 10) and B (for 11). Wait, but the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3.\n\nSo, the first step is to parse the input string into a decimal value. How to do that?\n\nWe can process each character of the string, converting it to its numerical value, then compute the decimal equivalent.\n\nFor example, for the string 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal. For '1A' in base 16, that's 1*16 + 10 = 26.\n\nBut how to handle characters? Let's think: each character in the string is a digit in base a. So for each character, we need to find its value. For example, digits 0-9 are 0-9, then letters A-Z represent 10 and up.\n\nWait, but the problem says that in bases greater than 10, letters are used. So for example, in base 12, the digits are 0-9, A (10), B (11). So the input c can have letters in uppercase? Or lowercase? The problem's examples show that in the input, for example, 'A' is present in the sample input. For example, the sample input includes '12 13\\nA', which is converted to 'A' in base 13. So the input c is given with letters in uppercase? Probably, since the problem says \"the input may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3\".\n\nSo the code needs to process each character in the input string c as a digit in base a. For example, for each character in c, we can convert it to its value. For example, 'A' would be 10, 'B' 11, etc. So for that, we can create a helper function that maps a character to its value.\n\nSo for the first part, converting c from base a to decimal:\n\nInitialize a variable value = 0.\n\nFor each char in the string:\n\ndigit = value of the character (e.g., 'A' is 10, '5' is 5, etc.)\n\nvalue = value * a + digit.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, with special handling for Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this integer to the target base or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: First, we convert the given number from its original base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, taking into account that bases greater than 10 use letters (A-Z) for digits beyond 9.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: If the target base `b` is not 'R', we convert the decimal integer to the target base. This involves repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders, which are then converted to the appropriate characters for bases greater than 10.\n3. **Convert Decimal to Roman Numerals**: If the target base `b` is 'R', we convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef char_to_value(c):\n    if c.isdigit():\n        return int(c)\n    else:\n        return ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\ndef value_to_char(v):\n    if v < 10:\n        return str(v)\n    else:\n        return chr(ord('A') + v - 10)\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        value = value * base + char_to_value(c)\n    return value\n\ndef from_decimal(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(value_to_char(rem))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.strip().split('\\n')\n        first_line = parts[0].split()\n        a_str = first_line[0]\n        b_str = first_line[1]\n        c_str = parts[1]\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n        c = c_str\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n        \n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            result = from_decimal(decimal_value, base)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Character to Value Conversion**: The function `char_to_value` converts a character to its corresponding numerical value, handling both digits and letters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input string from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating over each character and computing the value.\n3. **Target Base Conversion**: The function `from_decimal` converts a decimal integer to a string representation in the target base, using appropriate characters for bases greater than 10.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `to_roman` converts a decimal integer to Roman numerals using a list of tuples that map values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion processes required for the problem, ensuring correctness for both standard base conversions and Roman numeral conversions.",
