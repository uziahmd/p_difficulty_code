Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me recall some geometry. In a regular polygon with n sides, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's for the internal angles of the polygon itself. However, the problem here is about angles formed by three vertices, not necessarily adjacent ones.\n\nWait, the angle we're looking for is when v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 are on the sides. So, for example, if we pick three vertices, say, v1, v2, v3, then the angle at v2 is formed by the lines from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. \n\nSo, how do we calculate that angle? Let me think. For a regular polygon, all the vertices lie on a circle. So, the central angles between consecutive vertices are 360/n degrees. \n\nLet me consider the regular polygon inscribed in a unit circle. Let's imagine that the polygon is centered at the origin. The vertices are placed at angles 0°, 360/n°, 2*360/n°, etc. \n\nNow, suppose we have three vertices v1, v2, v3. The angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2. For example, if v1 is k steps away clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps away counter-clockwise from v2, then the angle between them would be determined by the arc between v1 and v3. Wait, perhaps there's a formula here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in a regular polygon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices can be determined based on the number of edges between them. Let me think: For a regular polygon, if you take a vertex v2, and then take two other vertices such that there are k steps between v2 and v1, and l steps between v2 and v3 (but in opposite directions?), then the angle at v2 would be determined by the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the central angles. Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. \n\nSo, if I have three points on a circle, A, B, C, then the angle ABC (the angle at B) is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. Or wait, is it the arc that's opposite? Let me check. For example, in a circle, if you have points A, B, C on the circumference, then angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not include B. \n\nYes, that's correct. So, for a regular polygon, if we fix v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 are two other vertices, then the angle at v2 depends on the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. \n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose the polygon has n vertices. Let's assume that v1 is k steps away from v2 in one direction (say, clockwise), and v3 is m steps away in the other direction (counter-clockwise). Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 would be (k + m) steps. But since the polygon is regular, each step corresponds to a central angle of 360/n degrees. Therefore, the arc length (in degrees) would be (k + m) * (360/n) degrees. Then, the angle at v2 would be half of that arc. \n\nWait, but how do k and m relate here? Let me think again. For example, if v2 is fixed, and v1 is adjacent to v2 (k=1 step clockwise), and v3 is adjacent to v2 (m=1 step counter-clockwise), then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 would be (n - 2) steps. Because the total number of steps between v1 and v3 going the other way around is n - 2. So the angle at v2 would be half of ( (n-2) * 360/n ) degrees. But that seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. Let me think of the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not include v",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of these vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently calculating the closest possible angles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular polygon with `n` sides, each central angle between two adjacent vertices is `360/n` degrees. The angle formed at any vertex by two other vertices depends on the arc length between those vertices.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For a given vertex `v2`, the angle formed by vertices `v1` and `v3` can be derived based on the number of steps between `v1` and `v3` around the polygon. This angle is half the measure of the arc between `v1` and `v3` that does not include `v2`.\n3. **Optimal Angle Search**: We iterate through possible configurations of vertices to find the angle closest to `a`. The optimal configuration is found by checking different step distances between vertices and computing the corresponding angle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import math\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Calculate the central angle between adjacent vertices\n    central_angle = 360.0 / n\n    \n    # For a regular polygon, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3\n    # Let's assume v2 is fixed, say at position 2, and then v1 and v3 are positioned k steps apart\n    # The angle at v2 would be (k * central_angle) / 2\n    # However, since the polygon is cyclic, the actual arc length is (k) steps where k ranges from 2 to n-2\n    # Wait, for the angle at v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 must be (m) steps, where m = k - 1\n    # So the angle at v2 is (m * central_angle) / 2\n    \n    # To find the best m, which is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2\n    # m can range from 1 to n-2\n    # The angle is (m * central_angle) / 2\n    # We want this angle to be as close as possible to a\n    \n    # Compute the minimal difference\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_m = 1\n    for m in range(1, n - 1):\n        angle = (m * central_angle) / 2.0\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_m = m\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Choose the smallest m to have consistent output\n            if m < best_m:\n                best_m = m\n    \n    # Now, construct the triplet v1, v2, v3\n    # Let's choose v2 as 2, v1 as 1, and v3 as 1 + best_m + 1 ?\n    # Wait, need to find positions such that between v1 and v3 there are best_m steps (excluding v2)\n    # Let's fix v2 as 2, then v1 is 1, and v3 is 1 + best_m + 1 = best_m + 2?
