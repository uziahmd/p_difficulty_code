Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions ai. \n\nFirst, I should think about how the lanterns cover the street. Each lantern covers a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). But since the street is from 0 to l, we need to make sure that every point in [0, l] is covered by at least one of these intervals.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal d such that the union of all these intervals covers the entire street.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nWell, maybe the first step is to sort the lantern positions. Because if they are sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum required d based on those gaps.\n\nLet me think. For example, if the lanterns are sorted as a1, a2, ..., an. Then between two consecutive lanterns, say ai and ai+1, the maximum distance between them is (ai+1 - ai). But since each lantern covers a radius d, the middle point between them would require that d is at least half of that gap. Because if the gap is g, then the middle is at g/2 away from each lantern. So for that gap, the required d would be (g/2). But wait, maybe not exactly. Let's think: suppose two lanterns are at positions x and y, with x < y. The area between them that's not covered by either lantern would be from x + d to y - d. To ensure that this area is zero, we need that x + d >= y - d. Which implies that 2d >= y - x. So d >= (y - x)/2. So the maximum of these (gap/2) values across all consecutive pairs would be part of the required d.\n\nBut also, there's the beginning and the end of the street. For example, the first lantern might not be at 0. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a1. Then, the required d must be at least a1, because otherwise the area from 0 to a1 - d would not be covered. Similarly, the last lantern's position is an. The distance from an to l is l - an. So d must be at least that.\n\nSo putting it all together, the minimal d is the maximum between:\n\n- the maximum (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2, and \n- the distance from the first lantern to 0, and \n- the distance from the last lantern to l.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1. Then the lantern is at some position a. Then the maximum distance would be max(a, l -a). Because the lantern covers from a-d to a+d. So to cover 0, we need a -d <= 0 => d >= a. To cover l, we need a +d >= l => d >= l -a. So the maximum of those two.\n\nSo the general approach would be:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial maximum d as the maximum between the first lantern's position (since 0 to a1 needs to be covered) and (l - last lantern's position).\n\nThen, for each consecutive pair of lanterns, compute the gap between them, divide by 2, and take the maximum of all those values.\n\nThe overall answer is the maximum between these two values (the initial max and the max gap/2).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo steps to implement:\n\n1. Read n and l.\n\n2. Read the list of ai.\n\n3. Sort the ai list.\n\n4. Initialize max_d as 0.\n\n5. Check the first lantern: the distance from 0 to a[0]. So current_d = a[0] - 0. So max_d = max(max_d, current_d).\n\n6. Check the last lantern: the distance from a[-1] to l. current_d = l - a[-1]. max_d = max(...).\n\n7. Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\n   gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   current_d = gap / 2.0\n\n   if current_d > max_d: update max_d.\n\n8. The answer is max_d.\n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nBecause the maximum of these three cases (start, end, gaps between lanterns) gives the minimal d required.\n\nYes. Because for the start and end, the required d is the distance from the first lantern to 0, and from last lantern to l. For the gaps between lanterns, the maximum gap divided by two is the minimal d needed to cover that gap.\n\nSo for example, if two lanterns are 5 units apart, then the middle point is 2.5 units away from each. So d needs to be at least 2.5 to cover that area.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting, the ai is [2,5].\n\nFirst lantern is at 2. So distance from 0 is 2. Last lantern is at 5, distance from l (5) is 0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum of 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.0.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nFirst input is 7 15, with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, the positions are 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCheck first lantern is 0. So distance from 0 is 0. Last lantern is 15, distance from 15 is 0. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 1.5\n\n5-3 = 2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nSo the maximum of these is 2.5. Which is the sample output of 2.5. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the required d is max(5, 5) → 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then the gaps between them is 10, divided by 2 is 5. The first and last distances are 0 and 0. So answer is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then gaps are 5 and 5. Max gap is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. First and last distances are 0 and 0. So answer is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are not in order. For example, n=3, l=10, a=[5, 0, 10]. After sorting, [0,5,10], same as previous case.\n\nAnother edge case: when the lanterns are all at the same position. For example, n=3, l=10, a=[2,2,2]. Then the first distance is 2, last is 8. The gaps between consecutive are 0. So max_d is max(2, 8, 0) → 8.0.\n\nYes, which is correct. Because the lanterns are at 2. So the left part from 0 to 2 -d must be covered. So d must be at least 2. The right part from 2 +d must reach 10. So d must be 8. So the answer is 8.0.\n\nSo the algorithm handles that.\n\nNow, coding.\n\nIn Python, read the input.\n\nBut the input is given as two lines. Wait, the first input line is for the first test case. Wait, the sample input shows two test cases? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases. But looking at the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input, the first case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich is the first test case. Then the second line is another test case: 2 5 followed by 2 5.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is for one test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input formatting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nOutput\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nAh, so this is two test cases. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So the code should process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, no. Looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the user is showing two examples, but the actual code is supposed to handle one test case per run. So perhaps the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of ai.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output. The sample input is given as two lines, but the output is two lines. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line is n and l, then the next line is the ai's. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input representation. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is:\n\nInput\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nOutput\n\n2.5000000000\n\n2.0000000000\n\nBut the user presented the input as a list of two strings, but that's probably just a formatting error. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. However, in the problem statement's sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So maybe the code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nBut the original problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code should read one test case. However, the sample input has two test cases. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again. The problem says that the input is given as two lines. For example, the first line contains n and l, the next line contains the ai's. So the code should process one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. That's confusing.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the first test case's input, and the second line is the second test case's input. But the code should process each test case.\n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? The problem statement does not mention that. So perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So the code should read the first line as n and l, then the next line as the list of ai's. So for example, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut the code is supposed to process each test case. However, the problem says that the input is for one test case. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that the user is showing two examples, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read from stdin and print to stdout. So the code is supposed to process one test case. Therefore, the sample input may have two test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input format.\n\nBut regardless, according to the problem statement, the code should read one test case. Therefore, the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of ai's.\n\nSo the code should be written to read one test case. So the sample input given in the problem is two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one. Therefore, the code should process the first line as n and l, then the second line as the ai's.\n\nSo, in the code, read n and l from input, then read the next line as the list of ai's.\n\nNow, coding:\n\nIn Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as n and l. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but splitting on whitespace is okay.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of ai.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen, for each consecutive pair, compute the gap and divide by 2. Take the maximum of these.\n\nThe answer is the maximum between the initial max_d and the max gap/2.\n\nBut wait, the initial max_d is the maximum between a[0] (distance from 0 to first lantern) and (l - a[-1]) (distance from last lantern to l). So yes.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what if n is 0? No, according to input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# Check first and last\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\n# Check gaps between lanterns\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the first lantern is 0, so a[0] is 0. So the max_d starts as max(0, 15 - 15) = 0. Then the gaps are checked. The largest gap is between 9 and 14, which is 5. Divided by 2 is 2.5. So the max_d is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input.\n\nn=2, l=5. a is [2,5]. After sorting, [2,5]. max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So max_d remains 2. So output is 2.0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0,5,10]. max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. Then gaps are 5 and 5. So 5/2=2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nBut what about when the first lantern is not at 0, and the last is not at l. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[1, 9]. Then the first distance is 1, the last is 1. The gap between them is 8, divided by 2 is 4. So the max is 4. So the answer is 4.0. Which would cover from 1-4 = -3 (but the street starts at 0) to 1+4=5. The second lantern is at 9, covers 9-4=5 to 9+4=13. So the entire street from 0 to 10 is covered. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the lanterns are not sorted? Well, the code sorts them first.\n\nNow, handling the output with 10 decimal digits. The code uses the format string with .10f. However, in Python, when you print 2.5 as a float, it would show as 2.5000000000.\n\nBut what about when the answer is something like 2.5, but due to floating point precision, it's stored as something like 2.499999999999999? Well, the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, so using floating point calculations should be acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, when you do divisions, you get floating points. So the code should be okay.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, in the code, the initial max_d is set to max(a[0], l - a[-1]). But a[0] is the first lantern's position, which is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. So yes. But what if a[0] is 0? Then that distance is 0, which is correct.\n\nBut for example, if a[0] is 3, l is 10, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 3, so d must be at least 3 to cover 0. Similarly for the last lantern.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → after sorting [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen checking the gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → current is 1.5. max_d becomes 1.5.\n\nNext 5-3=2 → 1.0. No change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1.0. No change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1.0. No change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5 → max_d is 2.5.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5. No change.\n\nSo the final answer is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. Sorted as [2,5]. max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3 → 1.5. So the maximum remains 2. Output is 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut in Python, when reading the input, sometimes there can be leading or trailing spaces. But the split() function handles that.\n\nAnother possible edge case: n=1, l=0. But according to the input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then the max_d is max(0, 1-0=1) → 1.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[1]. Then max_d is max(1, 0) → 1.0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. The gaps between them is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So the max_d is max(0, 0) → 0, but then the gap gives 5. So answer is 5.0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be written as:\n\nRead n and l, read the list, sort, compute the max_d as described, and print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = 0.0\n    # Check first and last\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    # Check gaps\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in Python, the print statement will format the number with 10 decimal digits. However, if the number is an integer, like 2.0, it will print as 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case's output is 2.5000000000, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given their positions.
