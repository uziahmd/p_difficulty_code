Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this problem. The key idea is probably to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would be the point that requires the largest d to cover.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end of the street, if the last lantern isn't at l.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in order.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d must be at least this distance.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to the end (l). Again, d must be at least that.\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the distance between them. The maximum of these gaps divided by two would be the required d for covering that gap. Because the worst case is the middle of the gap, which is (distance between lanterns)/2 away from each.\n5. The overall answer is the maximum between the first part (start and end) and the max gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose two consecutive lanterns are at positions a and b (sorted). The gap between them is (b - a). The maximum distance from any point in this gap to the nearest lantern would be (b - a)/2. So yes, the required d for this gap is (b - a)/2. But if the gap is larger than the current maximum, then we need to take that into account.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial max_d as the maximum between the first lantern's position and (l - last lantern's position).\n- Then, iterate through consecutive pairs and compute (current - previous)/2, and see if that's larger than the current max_d.\n- The answer is the maximum of all those values.\n\nWait, but for example, if the first lantern is at 0, then the initial distance from the start is zero. Similarly for the last lantern being at l.\n\nSo let's take the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 15, with lantern positions 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCheck the first part: first lantern is at 0, so distance from start is 0. Last lantern is at 15, so distance from end is 0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns are 3-0=3, 5-3=2, 7-5=2, 9-7=2, 14-9=5, 15-14=1. The maximum of these gaps is 5. Divided by two gives 2.5. Which is the sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input is 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted: 2,5. First lantern is at 2, so distance from start is 2. Last lantern is at 5, distance from end is 0. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by two is 1.5. The maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ngap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_d = gap / 2\n\nif current_d > max_d, update max_d.\n\nAt the end, return max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1, l=10, and the lantern is at 5. Then the initial max_d is max(5, 10-5)=5. Then there are no consecutive pairs. So the answer is 5. Which is correct because the lantern covers from 0 to 10 (since 5 is the center, radius 5).\n\nAnother case: n=1, lantern at 0. Then the initial max_d is max(0, l - 0) = l. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to handle the case when n is 1.\n\nSo the steps in code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen loop through the sorted list from index 1 to end, compute the differences between consecutive elements, divide by two, and compare with max_d.\n\nThe answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn Python, read n and l. Then the list of a_i. Sort them.\n\nThen:\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n == 0: but according to input constraints, n >= 1.\n\nSo for n >= 1:\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nreturn max_d.\n\nBut wait, in the first step, for the initial max_d, perhaps it's better to compute the max between (a[0] and (l - a[-1])) ?\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, if the first lantern is at position 3, and l is 15. Then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 3, so the required d must be at least 3. Similarly, if the last lantern is at 14, then the distance from there to l (15) is 1, so required d must be at least 1. So the initial max_d is 3.\n\nThen, check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the first sample input, the first line is '7 15', then the next line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nSo in code, the input is read as:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the list has exactly n elements. However, according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nOnce we have the list, sort it.\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nNow, for the output, we need to print the answer with 10 decimal digits. So in Python, format it as a float with 10 decimal places.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the maximum is an integer, like 2.0, which should be printed as 2.0000000000.\n\nSo in code, after computing the maximum_d, we can print it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to handle floating points?\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the maximum is 2.5, which is 2.5000000000 when printed.\n\nIn Python, using the format string: \"{:.10f}\".format(max_d) would do that.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you print 2.5 as a float, it's 2.5, but when you format with 10 decimals, it adds zeros.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate over consecutive elements, compute (a[i] - a[i-1])/2.0, compare with max_d.\n\nFinally, print the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the lanterns are not sorted? For example, if the list is [15, 5, ...], but after sorting, it's [0, 3, 5, ...].\n\nYes, the code sorts the list.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and l.\n\na = list of integers.\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the second sample input.\n\nSample 2 input: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nAfter sorting, [2,5].\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.\n\nThen, check the gap between 5-2=3 → 3/2=1.5. Which is less than 2. So the max_d remains 2. Output is 2.0000000000. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. Then no consecutive elements. Output is 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then initial max is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. Then the gap is 10-0=10, divided by 2 is 5. So max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then initial max is max(0, 0) → 0. The gaps are 5 and 5. Each divided by 2 is 2.5. So max_d is 2.5.\n\nBut if l is 10, and the lanterns are at 0, 5, 10. Then the entire street is covered with d=2.5. Because between 0 and 5, the coverage is up to 2.5 from each. So the middle is covered. Same for 5-10.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about if there are multiple lanterns in the same position? For example, n=3, l=10, a=[0, 0, 10]. Then sorted a is [0,0,10]. The initial max is max(0, 10-10=0). Then the gaps between first two is 0, divided by 2 is 0. Then between 0 and 10, gap is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So max_d is 5. Which is correct. Because the first two lanterns are at 0, so the coverage starts at 0. The last lantern is at 10, so coverage ends at 10. But the gap between 0 and 10 is 10, so the middle is 5 away from each. So d needs to be 5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. Initial max is max(0, 0) → 0. Then gaps between 0 and 3 is 3 → 1.5. Between 3 and 10 is 7 → 3.5. So max_d is 3.5. Which is correct. The middle of the 3-10 gap is at 3 + 3.5 = 6.5. The distance from 3 is 3.5, which is the required d.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nThen for i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nThen print with 10 decimals.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for the first step, a[0] is the first element, which is the position of the first lantern. But what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the distance from the start is 0, which is correct.\n\nBut for example, if the first lantern is at 2, then the distance from 0 to the lantern is 2. So the required d must be at least 2, because the start of the street (0) is 2 units away from the first lantern. So the lantern's coverage must reach to 0, hence d must be at least 2.\n\nSimilarly for the end.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input:\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. Wait, the sample input shows two examples. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l.\n\nThe next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read one test case.\n\nWait, but in the sample input, there are two examples given. But that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple test cases. However, in the actual programming problem, the code is supposed to read one test case per run. So the code should process one input.\n\nSo the code is written to read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of ai.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and l.\n\nRead the second line as the list of ai.\n\nBut in some cases, perhaps the input is given with multiple lines? For example, the sample input shows two test cases. But the problem says that the input is for one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l.\n\nThe next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. So the sample input shows two examples, but each is a separate test case. So for the code, it's supposed to read one test case, not multiple.\n\nSo the code will process the input as follows:\n\nRead the first line as n and l.\n\nRead the next line as the list of ai.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the list has exactly n elements. However, according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nOnce that's done, proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSort the list.\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in Python, when you have integers, dividing by 2.0 gives a float.\n\nBut for example, when the gap is even, say 4, then 4/2.0 is 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the gap is odd? Like 5, which gives 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nBut what about when the max_d is 0? Like when all lanterns are at 0 and l is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, l is at least 1. So no, l can be 1, but if n is 1 and a[0] is 0, then l - a[-1] is 1-0=1. So max_d is 1.\n\nBut in the code, the initial max_d is max(a[0], l - a[-1]). For example, if a[0] is 0 and l is 0, but that's impossible since l is at least 1.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=7, l=15.\n\na = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]\n\nsorted a is [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d is max(0, 15 -15=0) → 0.\n\nThen check the gaps between consecutive elements:\n\n3-0 =3 → 1.5 → 1.5 > 0 → max_d becomes 1.5.\n\nNext gap 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nNext 7-5=2 → 1.0 → no.\n\nNext 9-7=2 → 1.0 → no.\n\nNext 14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5 → no.\n\nSo the final max_d is 2.5 → output as 2.5000000000.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na = [2,5]\n\nsorted a is [2,5].\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.\n\ngap between 5-2=3 → 1.5 → less than 2. So final max_d is 2.0 → output 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then sorted a is [5]. max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. So output is 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. Then gaps are 5 and 5. Each gives 2.5. So max_d is 2.5. Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSo code works.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase where all lanterns are at 0. For example, n=3, l=10, a=[0,0,0]. Then sorted a is [0,0,0]. max_d is max(0, 10-0=10). So initial max_d is 10. Then gaps between consecutive elements are 0, 0. So the max_d remains 10. Output is 10.0000000000. Which is correct, because the lanterns can't cover the end of the street (10), so d must be 10.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and l. For example, n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then initial max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. The gap between them is 10 → 5. So max_d is 5.0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nRead n and l, then a, sort, compute max_d.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 1, so the list is not empty.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if n is 1?\n\nYes, the code handles it.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen check gaps between 3-0=3 → 1.5, then 5-3=2 → 1.0, etc. Then the max is 2.5.\n\nSample output is 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.0.\n\nThen gap is 3 → 1.5. So output is 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, code with proper formatting.\n\nBut in Python, the print statement uses the format string. Also, note that in Python, when you have a float, the format will show the required decimals.\n\nBut for example, if the max_d is an integer, like 2.0, then printing with 10 decimals will show 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`. The lanterns are positioned at various points along the street, and each lantern can illuminate a distance `d` from its position. Our task is to find the smallest `d` such that every point on the street is within the illumination range of at least one lantern.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius `d`.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the gap between them. The maximum gap divided by two gives the minimum radius needed to cover the midpoint of that gap, which is the furthest point from either lantern in that gap.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required minimum radius `d` is the maximum value among the distances calculated from the endpoints and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Endpoint Check**: The initial check for the start and end of the street ensures that the edges of the street are covered by the lanterns' illumination range.\n- **Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted positions and calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns, we determine the largest gap that needs to be covered. The midpoint of the largest gap requires the largest radius to ensure full coverage.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum radius required using sorting and linear traversal, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step.",
