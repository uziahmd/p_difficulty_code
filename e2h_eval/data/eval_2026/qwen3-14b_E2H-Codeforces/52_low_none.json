Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones into new candles. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every b burned candles, he can make a new one. And this new one can be used again, leading to more hours.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2: \n\nHe starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then he has 4 burned candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So he lights those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burned ones. Again, he can make 2/2=1 new candle. That adds 1 hour. Now he has 1 burned candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see:\n\nStart with 6, burn for 6 hours. Then 6 burned. 6/3=2 new. Burn 2 hours. Now 2 burned. Can't make another (needs 3). Wait, but wait. Wait, the sample output is 8. Wait 6 + 2 = 8? Oh right, because 6 + 2 is 8. But wait, after burning the 2 new ones, you have 2 burned. But then, maybe there's a way to combine with previous ones? Or maybe not. So in that case, the answer is 6+2=8. But why?\n\nSo the process is: initial a, then each time you collect the burned ones, make as many new as possible, add to the total hours, and repeat until you can't make any more.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Start with a candles. Total hours is a.\n\n- Then, collect the burned ones (which is equal to the number of candles burned, which is a). Then, while the number of burned candles is >= b, we can make new candles.\n\nBut wait, each time you make new candles, you need to take the burned ones. Let me think of this as a loop.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\ncurrent_burned = a (after initial burning)\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nthen, while current_burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = current_burned // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    current_burned = (current_burned % b) + new_candles \n\nBecause, the number of burned candles after making new ones is the remainder (current_burned % b) plus the new candles that are now burned (since each new candle is burned once, so after making them, they are added to the burned pile once they are used.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you make new_candles from current_burned, you take (current_burned // b) new candles. Then, when you burn those new_candles, they add to the burned pile. So the process is:\n\nEach time you have some number of burned candles. You make as many new ones as possible. Then, those new ones are burned, adding their count to the burned pile. But the original ones that were used to make the new ones are no longer in the pile, because they were used to create the new ones. Wait, no. Wait, when you make new candles, you take b burned ones to make one new. So, for example, if you have 4 burned candles and b=2, you make 2 new. Then, those 4 burned ones are consumed, and you have 2 new. Then, when you burn those 2, you add 2 to the burned pile again.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ncurrent_burned = a (initially, after first burning)\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nloop:\n\n    new_candles = current_burned // b\n\n    if new_candles == 0: break\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    current_burned = (current_burned % b) + new_candles \n\nRepeat until new_candles is zero.\n\nYes, that seems right. Because, the number of burned candles after making new ones is the remainder (those that couldn't be used to make new candles) plus the new_candles that are now burned after being used.\n\nSo for example, the first sample:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ncurrent_burned starts at 4.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. current_burned is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nNext iteration: new_candles = 2",
