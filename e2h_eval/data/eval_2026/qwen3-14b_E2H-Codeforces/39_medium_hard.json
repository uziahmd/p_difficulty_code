Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to create an N x N board where a rook pays strictly less vuns than a queen during their traversal based on the movement rules described. If it's not possible, output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the movement rules. Let me rephrase them:\n\nThe process starts at cell 1. Each move, the figure (rook or queen) chooses the smallest-numbered unvisited cell that it can reach in one move. If there are no such cells, it teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, paying 1 vun. This continues until all cells are visited.\n\nThe goal is to construct a board where the rook's number of teleportations (vuns) is strictly less than the queen's.\n\nHmm. So for a given N, I need to find a numbering of the grid such that when the rook and queen follow their respective paths, the rook has fewer teleportations.\n\nLet me think about the sample input. For N=4, the output is a specific grid where the rook pays 1 vun and the queen pays 2. How was that achieved?\n\nLooking at the example, the rook's path includes a teleportation once, while the queen does it twice. The key seems to be arranging the numbers in such a way that the rook's movement allows it to reach the next smallest numbers more efficiently than the queen, thereby reducing the need for teleportation.\n\nSo the challenge is to design a numbering where the rook's path requires fewer teleportations than the queen's.\n\nBut how to approach constructing such a grid?\n\nLet me think about the movement patterns of rook and queen. The rook moves along rows and columns, while the queen can move diagonally as well. So the queen has more possible moves than the rook. However, in some cases, the rook might have access to certain cells that the queen can't reach in one move. But since the queen's movement is more flexible, perhaps in general, the queen can reach more cells, but the order in which the numbers are arranged could influence the path.\n\nWait, but the movement is determined by the minimal unvisited number. So for each step, the figure must choose the smallest possible number among those reachable in one move. If none, teleport.\n\nSo the order of numbers in the grid determines the path. The idea is to arrange the numbers such that the rook's path requires fewer teleportations than the queen's.\n\nLet me think about the case when N is 1. Then, there's only one cell, so no teleportations. Output is -1, as per the example.\n\nFor N=2, what's possible? Let's see. Let's try to create a grid where the rook and queen have different numbers of teleportations.\n\nBut maybe for small N, it's impossible. For example, N=2: the total cells are 4. Let's think of the possible paths.\n\nSuppose the grid is:\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\nFor the rook starting at 1 (position (1,1)), the next possible moves are cells in same row or column. The unvisited cells are 2,3,4. The rook can move to 2 (same row) or 3 (same column). The minimal number is 2. So rook moves to 2. Then from 2, unvisited are 3,4. Rook can move to 3 (same column) or 4 (same row). Minimal is 3. Then from 3, unvisited is 4. Rook can move to 4 (same row). So no teleportation. So total vuns is 0.\n\nFor the queen: starting at 1, can reach 2,3,4. The minimal is 2. Then from 2, can reach 3 and 4 (queen can move diagonally from (1,2) to (2,1) which is 3? Wait, the queen can move diagonally. So from (1,2), the queen can reach (2,1) (diagonal) and (2,3) (but that's out of bounds). So from 2, the queen can reach 3. Then the next step would be to go to 3. From 3, the queen can reach 4 (same row). Then no teleportations. So queen also has 0 vuns. So in this case, they are equal, which doesn't satisfy the problem's requirement. Hence, this arrangement is invalid.\n\nSo perhaps for N=2, there's no solution. But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to arrange numbers so that the rook and queen have different teleport counts. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is only possible for N ≥ 4. The sample shows N=4 works. What about N=3?\n\nBut the problem says that for N=1, output is -1. For N=2, perhaps it's also impossible. Let's check.\n\nBut how can we find a general approach?\n\nThe key is to find a numbering where the rook's path requires fewer teleportations than the queen's. Let's think about how the teleportations happen. Teleportation occurs when the current position cannot reach any unvisited cell in one move. So, for example, if the figure is stuck and has to teleport to the next smallest unvisited cell.\n\nTo minimize teleportations for the rook, we need to arrange the numbers such that the rook can reach the next minimal numbers in its movement steps, whereas the queen might get stuck more often.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path is more linear, allowing it to reach the next numbers without needing to teleport, while the queen's path might require teleporting more times.\n\nBut how to design such a grid?\n\nLooking at the sample for N=4. The grid is:\n\n4 3 6 12 \n\n7 5 9 15 \n\n14 1 11 10 \n\n13 8 16 2 \n\nThe rook's path starts at 1 (which is at position (3,2)). Let me think about the steps. The sample explanation says that the rook's path includes teleport once, while the queen's has two.\n\nSo the idea is that the rook's movement can reach the next numbers in order, but the queen may have to teleport more often.\n\nBut how to construct such a grid?\n\nAn alternative approach: think of a grid where the rook's path is designed to visit numbers in a certain order, and the queen's path is forced to have more teleportations.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nPerhaps the solution is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can traverse through the numbers in a snake-like pattern, covering all cells in the same row or column, while the queen might have to jump around more, leading to more teleportations.\n\nAlternatively, think of arranging the numbers such that the rook's movement allows it to reach the next minimal numbers in sequence, while the queen has to sometimes take longer paths, leading to more teleportations.\n\nBut how to translate this into code?\n\nAnother thought: the problem requires that the rook's teleport count is strictly less than the queen's. So, the minimal possible difference is 1. How can we create such a scenario?\n\nMaybe for even N ≥ 4, there exists a way to arrange the numbers, but for N=2 or 3, it's not possible.\n\nBut how to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for N=1, output is -1. For N=2, output is -1. For N≥3, there exists a solution.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of constructing a grid where the numbers are arranged in such a way that the rook can reach the next numbers in order, while the queen can't. For example, arrange the numbers in a way that the queen's movement options are limited when the numbers are ordered in a certain way.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of creating a grid where the numbers are arranged in a spiral or a specific pattern that favors the rook's movement.\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern that can be generalized for N ≥ 4.\n\nLooking at the sample for N=4. The number 1 is placed in the middle of the grid. Then numbers are arranged in a way that the rook can move along rows and columns, while the queen's path might require teleporting more.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can reach the next numbers in order, but the queen has to take a detour.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following approach:\n\nConstruct the grid such that the numbers increase in a way that the rook can move along the same row or column, while the queen has to sometimes take a longer path. For example, arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path is a straight line, but the queen's path requires jumping around.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the grid in a way that the numbers form a path that the rook can follow without teleporting except once, while the queen has to teleport more.\n\nBut how to design such a path?\n\nAnother idea: the rook's movement is restricted to rows and columns. So if we arrange the numbers in such a way that the next number in the sequence is always in the same row or column as the current position, then the rook can proceed without teleporting. However, the queen might have to teleport if the next number is not in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nBut how to arrange that?\n\nFor example, arrange the numbers in a row-wise order. Let's say the grid is filled row-wise, left to right, top to bottom. Then the rook can move along the row, then down the column, etc. However, the queen can reach any cell in the same row, column, or diagonal. So maybe in such a case, the queen's path would have fewer teleportations than the rook's?\n\nWait, no. Because if the numbers are in row-major order, then the next number is adjacent. For example, starting at 1, the next number is 2, which is in the same row. The rook can move to it. Then 3 is next, same row, etc. So the rook would not need to teleport. But the queen can also reach all these numbers. So in this case, both would have zero teleportations. Which is not helpful for our problem.\n\nThus, this approach would not work.\n\nWe need a numbering where the rook's path requires fewer teleportations than the queen's. So perhaps the queen's path gets stuck more often.\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the queen has to teleport more than the rook.\n\nSuppose that after some steps, the queen is stuck, but the rook isn't. How to arrange this?\n\nFor example, imagine that the next number after a certain point is in the same row or column as the current position for the rook, but not in the same row, column, or diagonal for the queen. Thus, the rook can proceed, but the queen has to teleport.\n\nBut how to arrange that?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the queen has more options, but the order of the numbers is such that the queen's next required number is not reachable from the current position, while the rook can reach it.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of a specific example. Suppose the current position is at cell X, which is a rook's move away from cell Y (next number), but for the queen, cell Y is not reachable from X. But how?\n\nWait, the queen can move in any direction, including diagonally. So for example, if X is at (1,1), and Y is at (2,3), then the queen can move from X to Y in one move (diagonal). But the rook can't reach Y from X directly. So in this case, the queen can reach Y, but the rook can't. So the queen would have a better chance of proceeding, but in our case, we want the opposite.\n\nSo perhaps the idea is to arrange numbers so that for the queen, the next number is not reachable, but for the rook it is. That way, the rook can proceed, while the queen has to teleport.\n\nBut how to ensure this?\n\nLet's imagine that the current position of the rook is at (i,j), and the next number is in the same row or column. The queen's current position is the same (i,j), but the next number is not in the same row, column, or diagonal. Then, the queen has to teleport, while the rook can proceed.\n\nSo, if we can arrange the numbers in such a way that the queen's path requires more teleportations, while the rook's path can avoid them, that would be ideal.\n\nBut how to construct such a grid?\n\nAn alternative approach is to find a specific pattern that works for all N ≥ 4. Let's look at the sample for N=4. The grid is constructed in a way that the numbers are arranged in a certain pattern. Let me try to analyze that.\n\nIn the sample, the 1 is placed at (3,2). Then, the next numbers are arranged around it. For example, the number 3 is at (1,2), which is in the same column as 1. Then 4 is at (1,1), which is in the same row as 3. Then 5 is at (2,2), which is same column as 3? Or same row? Let me see the positions:\n\nOriginal sample output for N=4:\n\nRow 1: 4 3 6 12 \n\nRow 2: 7 5 9 15 \n\nRow 3: 14 1 11 10 \n\nRow 4: 13 8 16 2 \n\nSo 1 is at (3,2) (third row, second column). The next numbers in the rook's path are 3 (row 1, column 2), then 4 (row 1, column 1), then 6 (row 1, column 3), then 9 (row 2, column 3), then 5 (row 2, column 2), then 7 (row 2, column 1), then 13 (row 4, column 1), then 2 (row 4, column 4), then 8 (row 4, column 2), then 16 (row 4, column 3), then 11 (row 3, column 3), then 10 (row 3, column 4), then 12 (row 1, column 4), then 15 (row 2, column 4), then teleport to 14 (row 3, column 1).\n\nThe queen's path, according to the note, has two teleportations. So the rook's path has one, queen's has two.\n\nSo in this arrangement, the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook can move along rows and columns, but the queen sometimes can't reach the next number.\n\nBut how to replicate this pattern for general N?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path follows a spiral-like pattern, but the queen's path is forced to teleport more often.\n\nBut how to generate such a grid programmatically?\n\nAnother observation: the problem requires that the rook pays strictly less than the queen. So for the sample N=4, it's possible. What about for N=3?\n\nLet me think for N=3. Let's see if there's a possible arrangement.\n\nBut first, what's the maximum N for which it's possible? The problem says N can be up to 500, but we need to find a general construction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the solution is to arrange the numbers in a way that for the rook, the next number is always reachable via row or column, but for the queen, it's not. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of a grid where the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook's path forms a single connected path through rows and columns, while the queen's path requires more jumps.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nMaybe the key is to arrange the numbers such that the next number is in the same row or column as the current position for the rook, but not in the same row, column, or diagonal for the queen. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path is a Hamiltonian path (visiting all cells) with each consecutive number in the same row or column, while the queen's path is not a Hamiltonian path and requires teleportations.\n\nBut constructing such a path for general N is non-trivial.\n\nAnother idea: For the rook's path, arrange the numbers in a way that they are filled row-wise, but with some modifications. For example, fill the grid in a way that each row is filled in reverse order, alternating between rows. This could allow the rook to move back and forth between rows.\n\nBut again, how to ensure that the queen's path would have more teleportations.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following pattern:\n\nArrange the numbers in a grid where the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook can move in a snake-like pattern through the grid, visiting each cell in order. For example, for even rows, fill left to right, for odd rows, fill right to left. This way, the rook can move from one row to the next by moving vertically. However, the queen might have to teleport when the next number is not in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nBut again, how to ensure that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following approach for constructing the grid:\n\nPlace the number 1 in a corner. Then, arrange the numbers in such a way that each subsequent number is in the same row or column as the previous one. This way, the rook can move directly to the next number. However, the queen might not have that option, leading to teleportations.\n\nBut how to arrange this?\n\nFor example, for N=4:\n\nStart with 1 at (1,1). Next number 2 at (1,2), then 3 at (1,3), then 4 at (1,4). Then 5 at (2,4), 6 at (3,4), 7 at (4,4), then 8 at (4,3), 9 at (4,2), 10 at (4,1), 11 at (3,1), 12 at (2,1), 13 at (2,2), 14 at (2,3), 15 at (3,3), 16 at (3,2). Wait, but this is just a spiral-like pattern. However, the queen would be able to reach most of these steps. For example, after 1 (1,1), the next is 2 (same row), then 3 (same row), etc. The queen would also be able to reach them. So no teleportations. So this would not help.\n\nHmm. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe problem requires that the rook has fewer teleportations than the queen. Let's think about the number of teleportations each would have. The teleportations occur when the figure cannot reach any unvisited cell in one move. So, for each step, if the figure is unable to reach any unvisited cell, it teleports.\n\nThe key is to arrange the numbers such that the rook's path has fewer such instances than the queen's.\n\nLet me think about the difference between the rook and queen's movement. The rook can only move along rows and columns. The queen can move along rows, columns, and diagonals. Therefore, for any given cell, the queen has more possible moves than the rook. However, the order in which the numbers are placed may affect whether the next number is reachable.\n\nFor instance, if the next number is in a diagonal from the current position, the queen can reach it directly, but the rook cannot. In this case, the queen would have a better chance of proceeding without teleporting.\n\nBut in our problem, we need the opposite: the rook has fewer teleportations. So we need scenarios where the rook can reach the next number, but the queen cannot. How?\n\nThis is only possible if the next number is in the same row or column as the current position for the rook, but not in the same row, column, or diagonal for the queen.\n\nBut how to arrange that? For example, suppose the current position is (i,j), and the next number is at (i, k) (same row). The queen can also reach (i,k) from (i,j) in one move. So she can reach it. So this scenario won't help.\n\nAlternatively, suppose the next number is at (k,j) (same column). Same situation: queen can reach it.\n\nSo, the rook and queen can both reach the next number if it's in the same row or column. So this doesn't help.\n\nWhat if the next number is in a position that is reachable by the rook but not by the queen? That would be impossible, because the queen can move in any direction, including rows and columns. So if the rook can reach a cell, the queen can as well.\n\nWait, that's true. The queen's movement includes the rook's movements. So the queen can reach any cell that the rook can reach. Thus, if the rook can reach the next number, the queen can also reach it. Therefore, the queen will never have to teleport when the rook doesn't. So the only way for the queen to have more teleportations is if the rook can reach the next number, but the queen cannot. But that's impossible, because the queen can reach any cell the rook can reach.\n\nWait, that suggests that the queen can reach all cells that the rook can reach. So if the rook has a choice to move to a cell, the queen can do the same. Therefore, the queen's set of reachable cells is a superset of the rook's. Therefore, the queen's path should never require more teleportations than the rook's. Wait, but that contradicts the sample input.\n\nIn the sample input, the rook pays 1 vun and the queen pays 2. How is that possible?\n\nLet me re-examine the sample.\n\nIn the sample, during the queen's traversal, she has to teleport twice. While the rook only once. How is that possible if the queen can reach all the cells that the rook can reach?\n\nAh, because the queen's path may have situations where she cannot reach the next number, but the rook can. But how?\n\nWait, no. The queen can reach all cells that the rook can reach. So if the rook can reach the next number, the queen can also reach it. So the queen would have at least as many options as the rook. So why in the sample, the queen has more teleportations?\n\nAh, perhaps the queen's path is such that she has to choose a different order of visiting cells, leading to situations where she can't reach the next number. Whereas the rook's path allows it.\n\nWait, the movement rule is that the figure must choose the smallest unvisited number that is reachable in one move. So the path depends on the order of numbers. So for example, if the next number is reachable by the rook but not by the queen, then the queen would have to teleport. But that's impossible, since the queen can reach any cell the rook can reach. So why in the sample, the queen has more teleportations?\n\nLet me look at the sample explanation again. For the queen's path:\n\nShe goes through 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 9 → 7 → 13 → 8 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → (teleport) → 14 → (teleport) → 16.\n\nSo after visiting 15, she has to teleport to 14 (the next smallest unvisited cell), then after visiting 14, she has to teleport to 16 (since from 14, she can't reach any unvisited cells).\n\nBut why couldn't she reach 16 from 14?\n\nLet's see. Let me look at the positions of 15 and 16 in the sample grid.\n\nRow 1: 4 3 6 12 \n\nRow 2: 7 5 9 15 \n\nRow 3: 14 1 11 10 \n\nRow 4: 13 8 16 2 \n\nSo 15 is at (2,4). 14 is at (3,1). 16 is at (4,3).\n\nWhen the queen is at 15 (2,4), the unvisited cells are 14 and 16. Let's see what cells are reachable from 15.\n\nQueen can move in any direction. From (2,4), she can reach:\n\n- Same row: cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) — but 2,4 is current cell. Unvisited are 14 (row 3, col 1) and 16 (row 4, col 3). Are these reachable from (2,4)?\n\nCheck if (2,4) can reach (3,1): it's a diagonal? No. (2,4) to (3,1): the difference in rows is 1, columns is 3. Not a diagonal. So no. Can't reach via queen's move. Similarly, (4,3) is two rows down and one column left. So difference is 2 rows and 1 column. Not a diagonal. So from (2,4), the queen cannot reach (3,1) or (4,3) in one move. Thus, she has to teleport to the smallest unvisited cell, which is 14. After that, when she is at 14 (3,1), the unvisited cells are 16. Can she reach it from (3,1)? (3,1) to (4,3): difference is 1 row down, 2 columns right. Not a diagonal. So no. So queen has to teleport again. Hence, two teleportations.\n\nMeanwhile, the rook's path: after visiting 15 (2,4), the unvisited cell is 14. From (2,4), the rook can move to (3,4) (same column), but that's already visited (cell 10). Or (2,4) can move to (3,4) (same column), which is already visited. Wait, what's the rook's path in the sample explanation?\n\nThe rook goes through 1 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 8 → 16 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → (teleport) → 14. So after visiting 15 (cell (2,4)), the unvisited cell is 14. From (2,4), the rook can't reach 14 (which is at (3,1)) because it's not in the same row or column. So the rook has to teleport to 14. Only one teleportation.\n\nAh! So the rook can't reach 14 from 15, but the queen also can't reach it. But why did the rook have to teleport once, and the queen twice?\n\nBecause the queen had to teleport twice, but the rook only once. How?\n\nBecause the queen's path had more instances where she couldn't reach the next number.\n\nWait, the queen's path includes two teleportations. The rook's path includes one. So how is this possible when the queen has more options?\n\nBecause the queen's path may have required her to visit certain numbers that were not reachable from her current position, but the rook's path didn't. But how?\n\nIn this case, the rook and queen both couldn't reach the next number (14) from 15. So both would teleport. But why the difference in counts?\n\nAh, because the queen had to teleport earlier. For example, let's look at the queen's path before reaching 15. Let me see:\n\nQueen's path: 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 9 → 7 → 13 → 8 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → teleport to 14 → teleport to 16.\n\nSo after visiting 12 (which is at (1,4)), the next number is 15 (at (2,4)), which is in the same column as (1,4). So the queen can move to it. Then, after visiting 15, she has to teleport to 14. Then, after visiting 14, she has to teleport to 16.\n\nSo two teleportations.\n\nThe rook's path after visiting 15 has to teleport once. So why the difference?\n\nBecause the rook's path had fewer instances where it couldn't reach the next number. But how?\n\nBecause the queen's path had more steps where she couldn't reach the next number.\n\nBut why? Because the queen's path took a different route, leading to situations where she couldn't reach the next number.\n\nThis suggests that the arrangement of numbers is crucial in determining the paths taken by the rook and queen. The order in which the numbers are arranged determines the choices each makes, and thus the number of teleportations.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a numbering of the grid where the rook's path leads to fewer teleportations than the queen's.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find a way to generate such a numbering for any N ≥ 4.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at the sample, the number 1 is placed in the middle of the grid. Then, the numbers are arranged in such a way that the rook's path can reach the next numbers in sequence, while the queen's path is forced to make detours that lead to more teleportations.\n\nPerhaps the key is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can follow a path that covers the entire grid with minimal teleportations, while the queen's path is forced to have more teleportations due to the ordering of the numbers.\n\nAn alternative idea is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path is a Hamiltonian path (visiting every cell exactly once) without needing to teleport, while the queen's path is not a Hamiltonian path and requires multiple teleportations.\n\nBut how to construct such a path?\n\nFor the rook, a Hamiltonian path can be created by filling the grid in a row-wise manner, but alternating directions in each row. For example, for even rows, fill left to right, for odd rows, fill right to left. Then, the rook can move from the end of one row to the start of the next by moving vertically.\n\nHowever, this would require that the next number is in the same row or column.\n\nBut let's think of a specific example for N=4:\n\nRow 1: 1 2 3 4 \n\nRow 2: 8 7 6 5 \n\nRow 3: 9 10 11 12 \n\nRow 4: 16 15 14 13 \n\nIn this arrangement, the rook starts at 1 (row 1, column 1). Next number is 2 (same row), then 3, then 4. Then from 4 (row 1, column 4), the next number is 5 (row 2, column 4) — same column. Then 6 (row 2, column 3), then 7 (row 2, column 2), then 8 (row 2, column 1). Then from 8 (row 2, column 1), next is 9 (row 3, column 1) — same column. Then 10 (row 3, column 2), 11 (row 3, column 3), 12 (row 3, column 4). Then 13 (row 4, column 4), 14 (row 4, column 3), 15 (row 4, column 2), 16 (row 4, column 1). This is a Hamiltonian path for the rook with no teleportations.\n\nBut what about the queen's path? Starting at 1, the next number is 2 (same row). Then 3, then 4, then 5 (same column). Then 6 (same row), then 7, then 8 (same row), then 9 (same column), and so on. It seems the queen can also follow this path without any teleportations. Thus, both would have 0 teleportations, which is not helpful.\n\nSo this approach won't work.\n\nBack to the sample. The key seems to be that the queen's path requires her to visit certain cells in an order that makes it difficult to reach the next number, while the rook's path avoids that.\n\nPerhaps the way to achieve this is to create a numbering where the queen's path is forced to visit higher-numbered cells early, which are not reachable from her current position, while the rook's path can reach them.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of a different approach. Maybe for N ≥ 4, it's always possible to construct such a grid, and for N=1 and N=2, it's not possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For N=1, output -1.\n\n- For N=2, output -1.\n\n- For N≥3, construct a grid where the rook pays fewer vuns than the queen.\n\nBut how to construct it for general N?\n\nLooking back at the sample for N=4, the number 1 is placed in the center, and the numbers are arranged in a way that creates a path for the rook that requires only one teleport, while the queen has to teleport more. Perhaps we can generalize this pattern.\n\nMaybe the idea is to place the number 1 in a central position, and then arrange the numbers in a spiral or similar pattern that allows the rook to move along rows and columns, but forces the queen to have to teleport.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, think of a grid where the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook's path visits cells in a certain order that is optimized for its movement, while the queen's path is not.\n\nFor example, arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path is a single row followed by a single column, then another row, etc., ensuring that each next number is reachable via rook's move, but for the queen, the next number is not reachable.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nLet me think of the following pattern for N=4:\n\nPlace the number 1 in the middle (row 2, column 2). Then, arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can move in a zig-zag pattern through the rows and columns.\n\nFor example, the rook's path could be:\n\n1 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 8 → 16 → ... and so on, like the sample.\n\nBut how to generalize this for larger N?\n\nAlternatively, think of a grid where the numbers are arranged in a specific pattern that creates a path for the rook that requires only one teleport, while the queen's path requires more. This seems to be the case for the sample.\n\nBut how to construct such a grid programmatically?\n\nPerhaps the solution is to use a specific pattern for the grid, such as the one used in the sample. For example, the sample for N=4 has the following structure:\n\nThe grid is divided into regions, and the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook can move through the grid in a specific order, but the queen has to take alternate routes.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to generalize.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the rook's movement is limited to rows and columns, perhaps we can arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path visits all cells in a single row, then a single column, then another row, and so on. This would allow the rook to move sequentially through the grid with minimal teleportations.\n\nFor example, for N=4:\n\nRow 1: 1 2 3 4 \n\nRow 2: 8 7 6 5 \n\nRow 3: 9 10 11 12 \n\nRow 4: 16 15 14 13 \n\nThis is the same as before. But the queen can also follow this path.\n\nBut this doesn't help. So what's different in the sample?\n\nIn the sample, the rook's path includes teleporting once, while the queen's path has two. So the key is that the queen's path is forced to visit certain cells that are not reachable from her current position.\n\nMaybe the solution is to create a grid where the rook's path is a Hamiltonian path with no teleportations, and the queen's path is not a Hamiltonian path and requires teleportations. But how?\n\nBut for that, the queen's path must have to teleport at least once, while the rook's path doesn't.\n\nBut how to arrange the numbers to force the queen's path into this scenario?\n\nPerhaps the answer lies in the fact that the queen's movement allows her to choose from more cells, which may lead her to choose a path that results in more teleportations. For example, if the queen chooses to visit a cell that is not in the same row, column, or diagonal as the next number, but the rook chooses a path that avoids this.\n\nBut how to ensure this in the numbering?\n\nThis seems too vague. Perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that can be generalized from the sample.\n\nLooking at the sample for N=4:\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 1: 4 3 6 12 \n\nRow 2: 7 5 9 15 \n\nRow 3: 14 ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an N x N board such that a rook pays strictly fewer vuns (teleportation fees) than a queen during their traversal based on the given movement rules. The solution involves creating a specific grid pattern that ensures the rook's path requires fewer teleportations than the queen's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Special Cases**: For N = 1, it's impossible to have any teleportation since there's only one cell. Hence, the output is -1. For N = 2, it's also impossible to construct such a grid, so we return -1.\n2. **General Case for N ≥ 4**: Construct a grid where the numbers are arranged in a specific pattern that ensures the rook's path has fewer teleportations than the queen's.
