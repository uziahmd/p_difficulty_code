Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with certain constraints on their sides. Let's think through how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that the triangle sides x, y, z must satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition here is x + y > z. Because if that holds, then the other inequalities (like x + z > y and y + z > x) are automatically satisfied since z is the largest.\n\nSo the main condition is x + y > z. Now, the challenge is to count all possible triplets (x, y, z) that meet the constraints and this inequality.\n\nBut how do I efficiently compute this given the ranges?\n\nLet me break down the problem into parts.\n\nFirst, the variables are constrained as follows:\n\nx ranges from A to B (inclusive)\ny ranges from B to C (inclusive)\nz ranges from C to D (inclusive)\n\nWait, but the problem says A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So for each x, y, z, x can be up to B, y starts from B (since B ≤ y) and goes up to C, and z starts from C (since C ≤ z) up to D.\n\nBut also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, so x ≤ y. Similarly, y ≤ C and z ≥ C, so y ≤ z. Therefore, the triplet x, y, z is such that x ≤ y ≤ z. So the triangle condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triplets (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x + y > z.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this efficiently. The brute-force approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z and check the condition, but with the ranges possibly up to 5e5, that's way too slow. For example, if A=1, B=5e5, etc., the total number of triplets could be (5e5)^3, which is impossible to process directly.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the loops. For each possible x and y, determine the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. Because z has to be at least C, but also less than x + y. But since z must be ≥ C, the valid z's are those between max(C, ...) and min(D, x + y - 1). Wait, but z must be at least C and at most D, and also less than x + y.\n\nSo for a given x and y, the lower bound of z is C, upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). If this upper bound is less than C, then there are no valid z's. Otherwise, the count is upper - C + 1.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently for all x and y?\n\nThe problem is that x can be up to B and y up to C, which could be 5e5 each, leading to O(B*C) operations. If B and C are up to 5e5, then B*C is 2.5e11, which is way too big for a loop. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need a way to compute the total count without iterating through all x and y.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that for each possible y, and z, find the number of x's such that x is in [A, B], and x > z - y. But again, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can precompute for each possible y and z, the number of x's that satisfy x ≥ max(A, z - y + 1), but given that x ≤ B and x ≤ y (since x ≤ B ≤ y). Wait, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, so x ≤ y is always true. So x can be in [A, B], and for each x, y is in [B, C], and z is in [C, D].\n\nBut again, the problem is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think again. The main idea is that for each x and y, the number of valid z's is the number of integers z in [C, D] where z < x + y. Since z must be >= C and <= D, and also < x + y. So the valid z's are from C up to min(D, x + y - 1). The count is max(0, min(D",

For each $y$, it calculates the valid range of $x$ values that can form a non-degenerate triangle with some $z$ in $[C, D]$.
