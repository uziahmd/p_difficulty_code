He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, which might be Roman.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Read the input: first line has a and b (or R), second line has c as a string in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n3. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be Roman numerals.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. Since c can be up to 10^3 digits long, but a can be up to 25, so for large a, this could be a very big number. However, the note says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is <= 3000 in decimal. Otherwise, it's up to 1e15. So for the conversion from base a to decimal, I need to handle very large numbers. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's manageable.\n\nWait, but how do I convert a string in base a to decimal? For example, if the string is \"123\" in base 10, it's 1*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 3*10^0. So for each character in the string, I can process it as a digit in base a. But the digits can be from 0 to a-1. However, the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a, possibly with leading zeros. So, for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the input's c is given as a string. Wait, the input says that c is written in base a. How are the digits represented? For example, if a is 12, then digits go up to 11. How are those digits represented? The problem says that in bases greater than 10, letters are used (like A for 10, B for 11, etc.). But the input's c is given as a string. So for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nBut the input for c may have letters? Or does it only have digits? Wait, the problem says that the input for c is a single non-negative integer in base a. So, for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9 and A-F (uppercase?), but the input's c is given as a string. But the input is given as a string, which may contain letters. For example, in the sample input, there is '16 R\\n5', which is base 16, and the input is '5', which is 5 in base 16. Another sample input is '12 13\\nA', which is base 12, and the input is 'A', which represents 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, when converting c from base a to decimal, I need to parse each character of the string as a digit in base a. For example, the digits can be 0-9 and letters A-Z (uppercase?), where A represents 10, B 11, etc. But how to handle this?\n\nSo, for each character in the string, we need to convert it to its numerical value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, up to 'Z' which would be 35. However, since a can be up to 25, then the maximum digit is 24. So for example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-15. So the letters go up to F (15). But if a is 25, then digits can be up to 24, which would be 'O' (since 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 24 is O? Let's see: 0-9 are digits, then A=10, B=11, ..., J=19, K=20, L=21, M=22, N=23, O=24. So yes.\n\nSo, the first step is to convert the string c into a decimal integer. How to do that?\n\nI can write a helper function that takes the string and base a, and converts it to decimal. Let's think:\n\nFor each character in the string:\n\n- If it's a digit, then its value is int(c).\n- Else, it's a letter, so its value is ord(c) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input c may have leading zeros, but that's okay. Also, the input c is in base a, which may have letters. So the code must process each character in the string as a digit in base a.\n\nSo, for example, the input 'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal.\n\nSo the code for converting c to decimal would be:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\nWait, but what if the input has lowercase letters? The problem says that the input is given as a string. The sample inputs have 'A' in one case, but perhaps the input is case-insensitive? The problem says nothing about case, but the sample shows uppercase letters. So perhaps the input is in uppercase, but perhaps the code should process both cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is given as a string, but it's unclear. However, the problem says that in the case of bases greater than 10, letters are used. So the code should process letters as uppercase, but perhaps the input is given in uppercase. So assuming that the input is in uppercase.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps the code should convert the characters to uppercase before processing.\n\nSo for each character in the string, convert to uppercase, then check if it's a digit or a letter.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor ch in s:\n    if ch.isdigit():\n        digit = int(ch)\n    else:\n        digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\nBut need to make sure that the digit is less than base. However, the problem says that the input is valid. So no need to check for invalid digits.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then the next step is to convert it to base b, which can be either a normal base (integer between 2-25) or Roman numerals (R).\n\nSo, first, let's handle the case where b is not R. Then, we need to convert the decimal number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-O (for bases up to 25). For example, base 16 would use 0-9 and A-F. Base 25 would use 0-9, A-O (since 10 is A, 15 is F, 16 is G, up to 24 is O).\n\nSo, the function to convert decimal to base b (as a string) would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but what if the input is zero? The problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the input can be zero? Let's check the input description.\n\nThe input says that c is a non-negative integer. So for example, if c is zero, then when converting to base b (not R), it would be zero. However, the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. So for the case where b is R, the input c is guaranteed not to be zero. So in our code, when converting to base b (non-R), we need to handle zero.\n\nBut in the problem statement's note, the sample input includes '2 2\\n1111001' which is 1111001 in base 2, which is 121 in decimal. Then converted to base 2 again, which is same as input. So output is '1111001'.\n\nSo, for the case when the decimal number is zero, the output should be '0'. However, the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the input is not zero, so we don't have to handle that case.\n\nSo, the code for converting decimal to base b (when b is not R) is as above.\n\nNow, the other case is when b is R. Then, the decimal number must be converted to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, the problem requires implementing the Roman numeral conversion.\n\nHow to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals?\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from largest to smallest. For each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number, appending the symbol each time.\n\nThe standard Roman numerals have the following values:\n\nM 1000\nCM 900\nD 500\nCD 400\nC 100\nXC 90\nL 50\nXL 40\nX 10\nIX 9\nV 5\nIV 4\nI 1\n\nSo, the list would be:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, while the number is >= value, append the symbol and subtract the value.\n\nSo, the code for converting decimal to Roman is:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman numerals is guaranteed to be <= 3000 and not zero. So this function will work for numbers up to 3000.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nThe steps for the code:\n\nRead the first line, which has a and b. But b can be R. So split the first line into two parts. For example, if the first line is '16 R', then a is 16, b is 'R'.\n\nThen, read the second line as the string c.\n\nThen, convert c from base a to decimal. Then, depending on b, convert to base b or Roman numerals.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead the input. But the input is given as a list of test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut in reality, the input is read from stdin. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a...\n\nWait, the problem says that each test case is two lines. But the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. But in the actual programming competition problem, the input is probably multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, maybe the sample input is showing multiple test cases as separate entries. But perhaps the actual problem is for a single test case. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nSo, this suggests that the input is multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. But the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. So perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases, but the problem statement is unclear. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, for each test case, there are two lines. So the actual input is multiple test cases, each with two lines. But how many test cases are there? The sample input shows five test cases. However, the problem statement may not mention that. But looking at the sample input and output, the code must read multiple test cases. Wait, but in the problem statement's input description, it says \"the first line contains...\", implying that it's a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input, the first line is ['10 2\\n1', ...], but perhaps this is a list of test cases, each being a two-line input. But in reality, the actual input is given as per the problem's input description. But perhaps the problem is a single test case, and the sample input shows multiple test cases for illustration. Or perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's sample input and output. The sample input is given as a list of strings, each representing a test case. But in reality, the input for the program would be multiple lines. For example, the first test case's input is:\n\n10 2\n1\n\nSecond test case's input is:\n\n16 R\n5\n\nAnd so on. So, the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. Which implies that the code should read two lines for each test case. But how many test cases are there?\n\nLooking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. Because in the sample input, there are five test cases, each with their own input lines, and the output is five lines.\n\nBut how to read the input? Well, in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a test case. But in reality, the code is supposed to read from standard input. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to have a single test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. But the problem's original description may have a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code should process one test case. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must handle multiple test cases. Because in the sample input, each entry is a separate test case.\n\nBut how can I know? Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the input is two lines for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code should process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has five test cases, and the output is five lines.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1' which is two lines. But perhaps the actual input is given as multiple lines. For example, each test case is two lines. So, the code must read all the lines from stdin, grouping them into pairs of two lines per test case.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, if the input is given as multiple lines, like:\n\n10 2\n1\n16 R\n5\n5 R\n4\n...\n\nIn that case, the code can read all lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, then iterate through them two at a time.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is intended to have only one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple. But the problem's note says that the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual input for the code is one test case. But that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a single test case, and the sample input is presented in a way that shows multiple examples. However, the sample input and output show that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me look at the problem's sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nEach element in the input list is a separate test case. For example, the first test case is:\n\na=10, b=2, c=1. Output is '1'.\n\nThe second test case is a=16, b=R, c=5. Output is 'V'.\n\nSo, the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. Which implies that there is only one test case. But this is conflicting.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases, and the output has multiple lines. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases, each with two lines of input.\n\nThus, the code must read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs of two lines per test case.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, and then process them in pairs. For example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n    a_line = lines[i]\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n    # process a_line and c_line\n\nBut perhaps the code should read until EOF, and for each pair of lines, process them.\n\nBut how to handle the input? For example, the input may have multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nSo, the code will read all the input lines, group them into pairs, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead a_line and c_line.\n\nParse a_line into a and b. For example, split the line into two parts. For example, if the line is '16 R', then a is 16, b is 'R'.\n\nThen, process c_line as the string in base a.\n\nConvert c_line to decimal.\n\nThen, convert decimal to base b (if b is not R) or to Roman numerals (if b is R).\n\nNow, implement the functions.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut first, handling the case where b is R.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead a and b. For example, split the first line into two parts. For example, if the first line is '16 R', then a is 16, b is 'R'.\n\nThen, process c_line.\n\nNow, converting c_line to decimal.\n\nImplementing the to_decimal function.\n\nBut what if c is zero? For example, if c is '0' in base a. Then, the decimal is zero. Then, when converting to base b (non-R), output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So in that case, we don't have to handle zero for Roman.\n\nNow, code for converting the string c to decimal.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\nBut for example, if s is 'A' and base is 12, then the value is 10.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then:\n\nif b is 'R':\n\n    convert to roman.\n\nelse:\n\n    convert to base b, using the function decimal_to_base.\n\nNow, the decimal_to_base function:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nBut for example, if n is 0, returns '0'. But in the problem statement, when converting to base b, the output must omit leading zeros. However, the function returns '0' for zero, which is correct.\n\nBut for cases where the number is zero, like if c is '0' in base a, and b is not R, then output is '0'.\n\nBut for example, if the input is '2 2\\n0', the output is '0'.\n\nNow, the code for the Roman conversion.\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nBut now, how to handle the input.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, the input can be read via:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, process lines in pairs.\n\nBut for each pair, the first line is a and b, the second line is c.\n\nSo, for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n    a_line = lines[i]\n\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n\nBut what if the number of lines is odd? According to the problem statement, the input is correct, so each test case has two lines.\n\nNow, code:\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n    a_line = lines[i]\n\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n\n    # process a_line and c_line\n\nNow, parsing a_line into a and b.\n\na_line is split into two parts. For example, '16 R' → a is 16, b is 'R'.\n\nBut the first part is a, which is an integer. The second part can be an integer or 'R'.\n\nSo, split the line into parts = a_line.split()\n\nparts[0] is a, parts[1] is b.\n\nSo:\n\na = int(parts[0])\n\nb = parts[1]\n\nNow, process c_line.\n\nNow, converting c_line to decimal.\n\nBut what if c_line is '0'? Then, decimal is 0.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then:\n\nif b == 'R':\n\n    roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n\n    print(roman)\n\nelse:\n\n    base = int(b)\n\n    converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n\n    print(converted)\n\nBut need to handle the case when the converted string is empty? No, because for n=0, the function returns '0'.\n\nBut what about leading zeros? The problem says to omit leading zeros. However, the decimal_to_base function returns the correct representation without leading zeros. For example, if the decimal value is 5, and base is 2, then the function returns '101', which has no leading zeros. For the case when the number is zero, it returns '0'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1 → decimal is 1 → base 2 is 1 → output '1'\n\nSample Output is '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5 → decimal is 5 → Roman is 'V'.\n\nSample Output 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → decimal is 4 → Roman is 'IV'.\n\nSample Output 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → decimal is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converted to base 2 → 121 in decimal is 1111001 in binary. So output is '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13. 10 is less than 13, so it's represented as 'A'.\n\nSo output 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where c is zero. For example, input a=10, b=2, c=0. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base 10, which is allowed. For example, a=2, b=10, c=101 → decimal is 5 → output is '5'.\n\nAnother case: converting to base higher than 10, e.g., a=10, b=16, c=10 → decimal is 10 → converted to base 16 is 'A'.\n\nAnother case: Roman numerals with numbers like 4, 9, etc.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing all these steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut need to handle the case where the input for c is zero. Also, the code for converting to decimal.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        # parse a and b\n        parts = a_line.split()\n        a = int(parts[0])\n        b = parts[1]\n        # convert c_line to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n        # process based on b\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the converted value is zero, it returns '0', which is correct. For other cases, the decimal_to_base function returns the correct digits without leading zeros.\n\nTesting with sample input 4: input is 2 2, c_line is 1111001. The decimal is 121, converted to base 2 is 1111001. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is '5 R\\n4' → decimal is 4 → converted to Roman is IV.\n\nAnother case: input is '10 10\\n0' → output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: input is '12 13\\nA' → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat if the input c_line is empty? But according to the problem statement, the input is a non-negative integer, so it's not empty.\n\nWhat about leading zeros in the c_line? The code handles that correctly, since leading zeros are part of the number in base a. For example, '001' in base 10 is 1.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting to base b, the code returns '0' for zero. But the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. So in that case, the code is safe.\n\nWhat about when the decimal value is zero and b is not R? Then output is '0', which is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1 → decimal is 1 → converted to base 2 is 1 → output '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5 → decimal is 5 → Roman 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → decimal is 4 → 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nAll samples pass.\n\nAnother test case: input is '2 10\\n101' → decimal is 5 → output '5'.\n\nAnother case: '10 16\\nA' → decimal is 10 → converted to base 16 is 'A'.\n\nAnother case: '10 16\\n10' → decimal is 10 → base 16 is 'A'.\n\nAnother case: '16 10\\nA' → decimal is 10 → converted to base 10 is '10'.\n\nAnother case: '10 16\\n0' → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: '10 R\\n3' → output 'III'.\n\nAnother case: '10 R\\n4' → output 'IV'.\n\nAnother case: '10 R\\n9' → output 'IX'.\n\nAnother case: '10 R\\n40' → 'XL'.\n\nAnother case: '10 R\\n3000' → 'MMM'.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, possible corner cases.\n\nWhat about when the input is '2 2\\n0' → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: when the input is '2 3\\n10' → decimal is 2 → converted to base 3 is '2'.\n\nAnother case: '3 10\\n10' → decimal is 3 → output '3'.\n\nAnother case: '16 16\\nFF' → decimal is 255 → converted to base 16 is 'FF'.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nPotential bugs:\n\nWhat if the input for c_line is empty? According to the problem statement, it is a non-negative integer, so not empty.\n\nAnother possible bug: when the base is 1? But according to the input constraints, a and b are between 2 and 25. So no.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code is ready.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, where `b` can either be a standard integer base (2-25) or Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base `b`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: Convert the input number from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, handling both numeric digits and alphabetic characters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a standard integer or Roman numerals:\n   - For standard integer bases, convert the decimal number to the target base using standard base conversion techniques, which involve repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders.\n   - For Roman numerals, use a predefined list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral representation by subtracting values from the decimal number until it reaches zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        parts = a_line.split()\n        a = int(parts[0])\n        b = parts[1]\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of lines. Each pair of lines represents a test case, with the first line containing the bases `a` and `b`, and the second line containing the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The `to_decimal` function processes the input string `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and converting it to its respective numeric value.\n3. **Base Conversion**: The `decimal_to_base` function converts a decimal number to a specified base, using standard division and remainder operations, handling both numeric and alphabetic digits for bases greater than 10.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The `decimal_to_roman` function constructs the Roman numeral representation by repeatedly subtracting the largest possible values from the decimal number and appending the corresponding symbols.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including leading zeros, large numbers, and special Roman numeral conversions.",
