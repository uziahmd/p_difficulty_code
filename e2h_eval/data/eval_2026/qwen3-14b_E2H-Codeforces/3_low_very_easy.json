Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l.\n\nFirst, I think the approach should be to sort the lantern positions. Because if they're sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum distance that needs to be covered. Because each lantern covers a range around it, but overlapping with adjacent ones. The largest gap between two consecutive lanterns would determine the required d, since that's the area that's not covered by either lantern unless their coverage overlaps.\n\nWait, but also need to consider the ends. Like, the first lantern might not start at 0, so the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position minus d must be covered. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d must be at least this distance, because otherwise the area before the first lantern isn't covered.\n3. Similarly, check the distance from the last lantern to the end (l). Again, d must be at least that.\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum gap between them divided by 2 is the required d for that gap. Because if two lanterns are separated by a distance 'gap', then each covers half of it, so the radius needs to be at least gap/2. For example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then each covers up to 2 units from their positions, so the middle point is covered by both. But if the gap is 5, then the middle is 2.5 away from each, so d must be at least 2.5.\n5. The overall answer is the maximum between these three values: the first part, the last part, and the maximum (gap/2) between consecutive lanterns.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSort the array. Then:\n\n- initial_gap = a[0] - 0. So d needs to be at least initial_gap.\n- final_gap = l - a[-1]. d needs to be at least that.\n- Then for each i from 1 to n-1, compute a[i] - a[i-1], take the maximum of these gaps. Then divide by 2. That's the required d for the middle gaps.\n- The answer is the maximum of initial_gap, final_gap, and (max_middle_gap / 2).\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the initial and final gaps are the two ends. For example, if the lantern is at position x, then the initial gap is x, the final is l -x. The max between them is the required d. Because the lantern's coverage must reach both ends.\n\nYes. So that case is covered.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst example input: 7 15, with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, the positions are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. Let's check:\n\nInitial gap is 0 - 0 = 0. Final gap is 15 -15=0. Then the consecutive gaps are 3-0=3, 5-3=2, 7-5=2, 9-7=2, 14-9=5, 15-14=1. The max gap is 5. Divided by 2 is 2.5. So the maximum between 0, 0, 2.5 is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input: 2 5, positions 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. Initial gap is 2-0=2. Final gap is 5-5=0. The consecutive gap is 5-2=3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum between 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: if the lanterns are at 0 and 5, and l is 5. Then initial gap is 0, final gap is 0. The consecutive gap is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: if there's one lantern at position 3, and l is 5. Then initial gap is 3, final is 5-3=2. Max is 3. So answer is 3.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining the minimum light radius required for all lanterns to cover a street, we follow a structured approach that ensures all parts of the street are illuminated.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: \n   - Sorting the lantern positions allows us to easily calculate the gaps between consecutive lanterns and identify the largest gap, which determines the minimum radius needed to ensure coverage.\n\n2. **Check Edge Cases**:\n   - The first lantern may not be at position 0, so we need to consider the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern.\n   - Similarly, the last lantern may not be at the end of the street (length `l`), so we check the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Gap**:\n   - Between each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum of these distances divided by two gives the minimum radius required to cover that segment, as each lantern would illuminate half of the gap.\n\n4. **Compute Result**:\n   - The final result is the maximum value among the initial edge distance, the final edge distance, and the maximum middle gap divided by two.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n_l = line.strip().split()\n        if len(n_l) < 2:\n            continue\n        n, l = map(int, n_l)\n        a = list(map(int, data[data.index(line) + 1].strip().split()))\n        \n        a.sort()\n        \n        max_gap = 0.0\n        # Check the first gap\n        first_gap = a[0]\n        max_gap = max(max_gap, first_gap)\n        # Check the last gap\n        last_gap = l - a[-1]\n        max_gap = max(max_gap, last_gap)\n        # Check gaps between lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i - 1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_gap:\n                max_gap = current\n        \n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_gap))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Key Points**\n\n- **Sorting the Array**: This is crucial for identifying the gaps between adjacent lanterns.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: By checking the first and last lanterns against the ends of the street, we ensure that the entire length of the street is considered.\n- **Gap Calculation**: The largest gap between two adjacent lanterns requires the most coverage. Dividing this by two ensures that the radius covers both sides of the gap.\n\nThis solution is efficient with a time complexity of **O(n log n)** due to sorting and **O(n)** for computing the gaps, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
