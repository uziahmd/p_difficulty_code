In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The input is three tiles. We have to check if they already form a mentsu. If not, find the minimum number of tiles needed to add to make it possible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n2. If not, find the minimum number of tiles to add (could be 1 or 2) to form a mentsu.\n\nLet me think about how to check for possible mentsu.\n\nFor a triplet (koutsu), all three tiles must be the same. So for example, if all three are '9m', then it's a triplet. So for the given three tiles, check if all three are same. If yes, then answer is 0.\n\nFor a sequence (shuntsu), the three tiles must be consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But they can be in any order. So, for the three tiles, we need to check if they are all same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence. For example, 3p, 2p, 4p would form a sequence.\n\nSo first, for the initial three tiles, check if they already form a triplet or sequence. If yes, output 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimum number of tiles to add. Let's think about possible cases.\n\nThe problem says that after adding some tiles, the total number of tiles will be 3 + added. But the mentsu can be formed by any subset of the tiles. For example, if you add one tile to make four tiles, but among them there's a triplet or sequence.\n\nBut the question is, what's the minimal number of tiles to add so that there exists at least one mentsu in the hand.\n\nSo for the original three tiles, if they don't form a mentsu, we need to see what's the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nLet's think about possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Can form a triplet with adding 1 tile?\n\nFor example, if two of the three tiles are same. Then adding another same tile would make a triplet. So for example, if the three tiles are 1s, 1s, 2s. Then adding one 1s would form a triplet.\n\nBut maybe there are other possibilities. So for each possible way to form a triplet, check how many tiles are needed.\n\nSimilarly for sequences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering all possibilities of forming a triplet or sequence with the existing tiles plus some added tiles.\n\nBut how do we approach this?\n\nLet me think for each possible case.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles can form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, check if adding two tiles can form a mentsu. Return 2.\n\nBut how to check for these possibilities.\n\nLet's think for the case when adding one tile.\n\nFor example, suppose the three tiles can form a sequence with one more tile. For example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then adding 3s would form a sequence. Or, if the three tiles are 1s, 3s, 4s, adding 2s would make a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s, then they already form a sequence. So that's 0.\n\nAnother example: if the three tiles are 1s, 1s, 2s. Adding another 1s would form a triplet. Or adding a 3s would allow forming a sequence (1s, 2s, 3s) with the existing tiles plus the new one.\n\nSo for each case, we need to check whether there's a possibility to form a triplet or sequence by adding 1 tile.\n\nIf that's possible, then answer is 1.\n\nElse, check if adding two tiles can form a triplet or sequence. For example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Adding 3s and then another tile (but maybe that's not necessary). Wait, no. For example, adding 3s would allow a sequence. So that's one tile. So the answer would be 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer for the third example given in the problem is 1. Let's look at the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw in order to form a valid meld (mentsu) in her hand.
