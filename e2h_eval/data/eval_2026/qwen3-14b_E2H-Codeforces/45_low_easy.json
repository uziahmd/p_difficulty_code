There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, the challenge is to model how the winner can accumulate as many games as possible under this constraint.\n\nLet me think about examples first. For n=2, there's only one game. The winner plays once. Output is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays the second game, the other player (player 3) has zero games played. The difference is 1 (since the winner has 1 game already). So that's allowed. So output is 2. For n=4, the example says output is 2. Why can't the winner play 3 games? Let's think. Let's say the winner plays three games. That would require that each time, the opponent's game count is within one. Let's imagine:\n\nFirst game: plays against someone, wins. Now has 1 game. Second game: plays against another, who has 0 games. So that's allowed. Now has 2 games. Third game: needs to play against someone who has either 1 or 2 games. But the other players would have to have played 1 game each. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, for n=4, the structure would be like a binary tree. Normally, in a standard knockout tournament, each round halves the number of players. But with 4 players, there are 3 rounds. But maybe the way the matches are arranged here is different. However, the example says that the maximum is 2. So why can't the winner play 3 games?\n\nBecause perhaps the constraints prevent that. Let's think. For the winner to play 3 games, he must have 3 opponents. Each time, the opponent must have a game count differing by at most one. Let's think about the steps:\n\nFirst game: opponent has 0 games. Winner has 1.\n\nSecond game: opponent must have 0 or 1 games. Suppose the winner plays someone who has 0 (like another player who hasn't played yet). Then after that, the winner has 2 games. Now, for the third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But how can there be such an opponent?\n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's say the winner plays three games. The first two games would have opponents with 0 games. But then, after those two games, the winner has 2 games. For the third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But how would that opponent have 1 game? Well, maybe that opponent had to play someone else before. But in that case, the opponent would have already played once. Let's think of a scenario:\n\nLet's say the winner (player 1) first plays against player 2 (game 1). Then, player 1 plays against player 3 (game 2). Now, player 1 has 2 games. Now, to play a third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But the remaining player is player 4. He hasn't played any games. So the difference is 2-0=2, which is more than one. So that's not allowed. Hence, the third game can't be played. Therefore, the maximum is 2 games.\n\nSo the answer for n=4 is 2. Hence, the example makes sense.\n\nSo how do we model this for general n?\n\nThe problem seems to be similar to finding the largest k such that the sum of the first k numbers (or something similar) is less than or equal to n-1. Wait, because each game the winner plays requires that they have a certain number of players in the tournament. Let me think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the maximum number of games the winner can play as k. For each game, the winner must have an opponent. The opponent must have a number of games that is either equal to the winner's current games count minus 1, same, or plus 1. But since the winner is progressing through the tournament, each time they play, they have to have opponents that have played a certain number of games.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a binary tree. The winner's path through the tournament requires that each time, the opponent is from a subtree where their number of games is within one. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. Let's denote f(k) as the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can play k games. Then, the answer",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the structure of the tournament can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. This is because each time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played a number of games that is either equal to or differs by one from the winner's current count of games. This leads us to the conclusion that the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci sequence.\n\nWe can use this observation to efficiently compute the maximum number of games the winner can play for a given number of players `n`. The approach involves:\n1. Precomputing the Fibonacci sequence up to a point where the values exceed `n`.\n2. Using binary search to find the largest value `k` such that the minimum number of players required for `k` games is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # We need to find the maximum k such that the minimal number of players needed for k games is <= n\n    # The minimal number of players for k games is Fib(k+2) - 1, where Fib is the Fibonacci sequence starting with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, etc.\n    # So we precompute Fibonacci numbers until it exceeds n\n    \n    fib = [1, 1]  # Fib(1) = 1, Fib(2) = 1\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_fib > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_fib)\n    \n    # Now, find the maximum k where Fib(k+2) - 1 <= n\n    # For example, for k=1, Fib(3) -1 = 2-1=1 <=n\n    # For k=2, Fib(4)-1 = 3-1=2 <=n\n    # So find the largest k such that Fib(k+2) -1 <=n\n    # The answer is the largest k where Fib(k+2) <= n+1\n    # So we look for the largest index i where fib[i] <= n+1\n    # Then k = i - 1\n    \n    # Edge case: n=1 is not possible as per input constraints (n >=2)\n    \n    # Find the largest index i such that fib[i] <= n+1\n    low = 0\n    high = len(fib) - 1\n    best = 0\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if fib[mid] <= n + 1:\n            best = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    \n    # The maximum k is best - 1\n    print(best - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Calculation**: We generate Fibonacci numbers until the sequence exceeds the given number of players `n`. This helps in determining the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n2. **Binary Search**: We use binary search to efficiently find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n + 1`. This helps in determining the maximum number of games the winner can play, which is derived from the position of this Fibonacci number in the sequence.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle the large input constraints (up to $10^{18}$) using logarithmic time complexity for both Fibonacci generation and binary search.",
