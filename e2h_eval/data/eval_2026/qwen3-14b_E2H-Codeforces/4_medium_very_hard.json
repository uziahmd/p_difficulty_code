The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., loses a round).\n\nThe input is n, then the two sequences A and B. The output is two numbers: the number of losses for Nikephoros (the first one) and Polycarpus (the second).\n\nFirst, let me think about how to model their moves. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find what move each player makes. Since their sequences are cyclic, for round i, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus's move, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the challenge is to compute for all rounds, how many times each player loses, but without iterating through all n rounds.\n\nLet me think about the possible patterns. Since both sequences repeat, perhaps there's a cycle that repeats after some period. The least common multiple (LCM) of m and k might be the key here. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so the pattern of moves between the two players would repeat.\n\nSo, if I can compute the number of losses in one full LCM cycle, then multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the remaining rounds.\n\nYes, that seems like a plan. Let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it lcm_length. The total number of rounds in one full cycle is lcm_length.\n\n2. Compute how many full cycles there are in n rounds, and the remainder rounds. Let full_cycles = n // lcm_length, remainder_rounds = n % lcm_length.\n\n3. For each full cycle, calculate the number of times Nikephoros loses (countA) and Polycarpus loses (countB). Then multiply by full_cycles.\n\n4. Then, process the remainder_rounds (up to lcm_length - 1 rounds) and add those counts.\n\nBut how do I compute the counts for one LCM cycle?\n\nWell, for each round in 0 to lcm_length - 1, I can compute the moves of A and B, check who wins, and accumulate the counts. But since lcm_length could be up to m*k, and m and k are up to 1000 each, that's 1e6 maximum. Which is acceptable for processing once, even for large n.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k. How? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nWait, but for LCM, if m or k is zero? Well, the problem says m and k are at least 1, so no problem.\n\nOnce I have the LCM, then for the full cycles, I can compute the number of losses per cycle.\n\nSo, for the initial part, I can precompute for each round in 0 to lcm_length-1, what the moves are, and count how many times each loses.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nFor each round in 0 to lcm_length-1:\n\na_move = A[round % m]\n\nb_move = B[round % k]\n\nThen determine who wins. For each such pair, increment the counts accordingly.\n\nOnce I have the counts for one cycle, multiply by full_cycles. Then process the remainder_rounds.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B strings.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute full_cycles = n // lcm_length\n\nremainder = n % lcm_length\n\nCompute the number of losses in one cycle (totalA, totalB).\n\nThen, multiply by full_cycles to get fullA = totalA * full_cycles, fullB = totalB * full_cycles.\n\nThen, compute the losses in the first 'remainder' rounds (from 0 to remainder-1), adding to fullA and fullB.\n\nSo the total for Nikephoros is fullA + remainderA, and same for Polycarpus.\n\nBut how to compute the totalA and totalB for one cycle?\n\nWell, for each i in 0 to lcm_length - 1:\n\nget a = A[i % m], b = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine who wins, and increment the counts.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the problem is that for large LCM, say m=1000, k=1000, LCM could be up to 1e6, which is manageable. Because 1e6 iterations are acceptable for Python.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut let's think about the example given.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is RPS (m=3), B is RSPP (k=4). LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nSo for each round from 0 to 11:\n\nFor each i in 0-11:\n\na = A[i%3], b = B[i%4]\n\nThen check who wins.\n\nThen, for the 7 rounds, the full_cycles is 7//12 = 0, remainder is 7. So process the first 7 rounds.\n\nWhich matches the sample explanation.\n\nIn the sample, the total for one cycle (12 rounds) would be calculated, but since n is 7, which is less than 12, we just process the first 7 rounds.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput is 5, A is RRRRRR (length 8?), B is R (length 1). So LCM(8,1) is 8. Then n=5, full_cycles=0, remainder=5. So process first 5 rounds. Since both play R each time, all draws. So output is 0 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the calculation of LCM.\n\nImplement the function to compute the number of losses in a given number of rounds (like the first 'remainder' rounds).\n\nBut how to compute the LCM?\n\nIn Python, math.gcd exists. So:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to import math, and handle the case when a or b is zero? Well, in the problem, m and k are >=1, so no problem.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string, read B string.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B)\n\nCompute the LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute full_cycles = n // lcm_length\n\nremainder = n % lcm_length\n\nCompute for one cycle (lcm_length rounds) the number of A losses and B losses.\n\nThen compute for the remainder rounds, the number of A and B losses.\n\nAdd them up.\n\nNow, how to compute the counts for one cycle and for the remainder.\n\nLet me write a helper function that, given a number of rounds (say, total_rounds), returns (a_loss, b_loss).\n\nBut how? For each round in 0 to total_rounds-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nCheck who wins.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to total_rounds-1:\n\nBut for the case of the full cycle, total_rounds is lcm_length, which is the LCM.\n\nSo, for the helper function:\n\ndef calculate_losses(total_rounds, m, A, k, B):\n\n    a_loss = 0\n\n    b_loss = 0\n\n    for i in range(total_rounds):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        # determine outcome\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # a wins, so b loses. So b_loss +=1\n\n            b_loss +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # b wins, a loses. a_loss +=1\n\n            a_loss +=1\n\n    return a_loss, b_loss\n\nBut for total_rounds up to 1e6, this is acceptable.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCompute for the full cycle:\n\ncycle_a, cycle_b = calculate_losses(lcm_length, m, A, k, B)\n\nThen, total_a = cycle_a * full_cycles\n\ntotal_b = cycle_b * full_cycles\n\nThen, remainder_a, remainder_b = calculate_losses(remainder, m, A, k, B)\n\ntotal_a += remainder_a\n\ntotal_b += remainder_b\n\nThen output total_a and total_b.\n\nBut wait, for the remainder rounds, it's the first 'remainder' rounds, which is from 0 to remainder-1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for the case when remainder is zero, the remainder rounds is zero, so nothing added.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the constraints:\n\nn can be up to 2e9, but the LCM can be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1e3 each). So for the worst case, 1e6 iterations for the full cycle, and another 1e6 for the remainder. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for cases where LCM is 1e6, and n is 2e9, then full_cycles is 2e9 / 1e6 = 2000, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code is efficient enough.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4). LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nfull_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0. remainder =7.\n\nSo calculate_losses(7, ... )\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor each i from 0 to 6 (7 rounds):\n\ni=0:\n\na = A[0%3] = R\n\nb = B[0%4] = R → draw. No loss.\n\ni=1:\n\na = A[1%3] = P\n\nb = B[1%4] = S → P vs S. S beats P. So B wins. So a_loss +=1. (Nikephoros loses, so his count increases.)\n\nWait, the code checks:\n\nif a == b → no.\n\nElse, check if a beats b. If yes, then b loses (so b_loss +=1). Else, a loses (a_loss +=1).\n\nSo in this case, a is P, b is S. S beats P. So b wins. So a (Nikephoros) loses. So a_loss increases by 1.\n\nSo in the first sample, the first round (i=0) is draw. Then i=1, a_loss increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (so his count increases by 1). But according to the sample explanation, the first sample's output is 3 and 2. Let me check the sample explanation again.\n\nSample input:\n\nThe first sample input is 7 rounds, and the output is 3 2.\n\nThe explanation shows that in the 7 rounds:\n\nRound 1: R-R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (so his count is 1).\n\nRound 3: S vs P → Polycarpus loses (so his count is 1).\n\nRound 4: R vs P → Nikephoros loses (count 2).\n\nRound 5: P vs R → Polycarpus loses (count 2).\n\nRound 6: S vs S → draw.\n\nRound 7: R vs P → Nikephoros loses (count 3).\n\nSo total for Nikephoros is 3, Polycarpus 2.\n\nSo in the code, for the 7 rounds, the a_loss (Nikephoros's losses) is 3, and b_loss is 2.\n\nSo when we run calculate_losses(7, ...) it returns (3,2).\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother sample: when n=5, A is RRRRRR (length 8?), B is R (length 1). So for all rounds, both play R. So no losses. So output is 0 0.\n\nSo the code would compute LCM(8,1) = 8. full_cycles is 5//8=0, remainder is 5. So calculate_losses(5, ...) returns (0,0).\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, need to read the inputs. Wait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as three lines: first line is n, second line is A, third line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 7, then RPS, then RSPP.\n\nSo in code, read n as int(input()), then A as input().strip(), then B as input().strip().\n\nSo code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        return math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    lcm_length = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n\n    # Now compute the number of losses in one LCM cycle\n\n    # Then compute full_cycles and remainder\n\n    full_cycles = n // lcm_length\n\n    remainder = n % lcm_length\n\n    # compute the losses for one cycle\n\n    def calculate_losses(total_rounds, m, A, k, B):\n\n        a_loss = 0\n\n        b_loss = 0\n\n        for i in range(total_rounds):\n\n            a = A[i % m]\n\n            b = B[i % k]\n\n            if a == b:\n\n                continue\n\n            # determine winner\n\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n                # a wins, b loses\n\n                b_loss += 1\n\n            else:\n\n                # b wins, a loses\n\n                a_loss += 1\n\n        return a_loss, b_loss\n\n    # calculate for one cycle\n\n    cycle_a, cycle_b = calculate_losses(lcm_length, m, A, k, B)\n\n    # calculate for remainder\n\n    rem_a, rem_b = calculate_losses(remainder, m, A, k, B)\n\n    total_a = cycle_a * full_cycles + rem_a\n\n    total_b = cycle_b * full_cycles + rem_b\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, the code may have a problem when the LCM is zero? No, since m and k are >=1, so LCM is >=1.\n\nBut let's test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample 1: n=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nm=3, k=4. LCM is 12. full_cycles = 7//12=0. remainder is 7.\n\ncalculate_losses(7, ...) returns (3,2). So total_a is 0*cycle_a + 3 =3, total_b is 0*cycle_b + 2=2. So output is 3 2. Which is correct.\n\nSample 2: n=5, A is RRRRRR (length 8?), B is R (length 1). So LCM(8,1)=8. full_cycles=5//8=0, remainder=5. calculate_losses(5, ...) returns (0,0). So output is 0 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly equal to LCM. For example, n=12, then full_cycles=1, remainder=0. So the total is cycle_a *1 + 0.\n\nAnother case: when the sequences are same. For example, A and B are same. Then for each round, it's a draw. So total_a and total_b are zero.\n\nBut what if A and B are different?\n\nAnother test case: A is \"R\", B is \"S\". So m=1, k=1. LCM is 1. For each round, A plays R, B plays S. So R beats S. So B loses. So for n=1, the output is 0 1. For n=2, full_cycles=2//1=2, remainder 0. So total is 0 *2 + 0 (for remainder) = 0, and 1*2 + 0 = 2. So output 0 2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the time constraints?\n\nFor m and k up to 1000, LCM can be up to 1e6. So for each calculate_losses, for 1e6 rounds, it's O(1e6) operations. For two times (once for the cycle, once for remainder). So for each test case, it's O(2e6) steps. Which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, but the code doesn't loop through n steps. So it's efficient.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where m or k is 1.\n\nCase where the remainder is zero.\n\nCase where n is zero? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when the sequences have all same elements. Like A is all R, B is all R. Then no losses.\n\nAnother case: when A is R, B is P. So in each round, B wins. So for n rounds, Nikephoros has n losses, Polycarpus 0.\n\nBut code should handle that.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses the function calculate_losses twice. For the cycle_length and for remainder. But for the cycle_length, when the LCM is large, but for the remainder, it's up to LCM-1.\n\nBut the code is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement it in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. However, in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists. But for cases where m or k is zero? Well, the problem says m and k are at least 1, so no problem.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code above, the calculate_losses is defined inside main, but that's okay.\n\nBut in Python, the code must be written properly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    # Wait, the input may have lines with newlines. But the original input is:\n\n    # first line is n, then second line is A, third line is B.\n\n    # However, using input() may be better. But sometimes, when reading from stdin, if the input is given with multiple lines, but when using input(), it reads line by line.\n\n    # However, in some cases, for example, when the input is provided via a file, the code may have to read the lines properly.\n\n    # So perhaps the code should read the first line as n, then the next line as A, then the next as B.\n\n    # However, in some cases, the input may be given as a single line, but according to the problem statement, it's three lines.\n\n    # So, perhaps the code should read as follows:\n\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is read via a file, the input() function may read the lines correctly. However, when using online judges, the code should read from stdin properly.\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is provided with multiple lines, but the code uses input() three times, that's correct.\n\nBut for example, in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo the code reads n as 7, then A as 'RPS', then B as 'RSPP'.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is written as a list of strings. But in practice, the code should read from standard input.\n\nBut the code as written is correct.\n\nBut in Python, if the input is read with input(), then for the first line, it's n, then the next line is A, then the next line is B.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut when testing, perhaps the code should read from stdin properly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        return math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    lcm_length = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    def calculate_losses(total_rounds, m, A, k, B):\n        a_loss = 0\n        b_loss = 0\n        for i in range(total_rounds):\n            a = A[i % m]\n            b = B[i % k]\n            if a == b:\n                continue\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n                b_loss += 1\n            else:\n                a_loss += 1\n        return a_loss, b_loss\n    \n    full_cycles = n // lcm_length\n    remainder = n % lcm_length\n    \n    cycle_a, cycle_b = calculate_losses(lcm_length, m, A, k, B)\n    rem_a, rem_b = calculate_losses(remainder, m, A, k, B)\n    \n    total_a = cycle_a * full_cycles + rem_a\n    total_b = cycle_b * full_cycles + rem_b\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the code defines the gcd function inside main, but math.gcd is available. However, the code uses math.gcd. But in Python, math.gcd returns the absolute value. But since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nBut in the code, the gcd function is defined, but perhaps it's redundant. Because math.gcd is already available. So perhaps the code can be simplified as:\n\nlcm_length = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n\nBut the code as written is correct.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nOutput: 3 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, A='R', B='S' → output is 0 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, A='R', B='S' → output 0 2.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=1, A='R', B='P' → B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So output is 1 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat if the LCM is zero? No, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nWhat if the remainder is zero? Then rem_a and rem_b are zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when the number of rounds is extremely large (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Sequences**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds.\n2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The pattern of moves for both players will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. This allows us to break down the problem into smaller cycles.\n3. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the number of complete cycles of length LCM(m, k) within the total number of rounds `n`, and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n4. **Loss Calculation**: For each cycle, determine how many times each player loses. Multiply the losses per cycle by the number of complete cycles and add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    lcm_length = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    def calculate_losses(total_rounds, m, A, k, B):\n        a_loss = 0\n        b_loss = 0\n        for i in range(total_rounds):\n            a = A[i % m]\n            b = B[i % k]\n            if a == b:\n                continue\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n                b_loss += 1\n            else:\n                a_loss += 1\n        return a_loss, b_loss\n    \n    full_cycles = n // lcm_length\n    remainder = n % lcm_length\n    \n    cycle_a, cycle_b = calculate_losses(lcm_length, m, A, k, B)\n    rem_a, rem_b = calculate_losses(remainder, m, A, k, B)\n    \n    total_a = cycle_a * full_cycles + rem_a\n    total_b = cycle_b * full_cycles + rem_b\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the move sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Loss Calculation Function**: This function computes the number of losses for each player over a given number of rounds by simulating each round within the given number of rounds.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of rounds is divided into full cycles of LCM length and a remainder. The losses from full cycles are multiplied by the number of cycles, and the remainder is processed separately to get the final counts.\n\nThis approach ensures that even for very large values of `n`, the solution remains efficient by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences.",
