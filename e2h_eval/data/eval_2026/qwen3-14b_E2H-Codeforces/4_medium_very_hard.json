The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round, they use their own sequences cyclically. The challenge is to compute how many times each loses in those n rounds.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. We have n, then two strings A and B representing their sequences. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find out what each player plays. Then determine who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round one by one. So we need an efficient approach here.\n\nLet me think. Since the sequences are cyclic, the moves repeat every m and k steps respectively. So for each round i, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nThe problem is to compute for all i from 0 to n-1, the number of times Nikephoros loses (which adds to his red spots) and Polycarpus loses (adds to his).\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, iterating through each round is impossible. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be computed once and then multiplied.\n\nLet me think about the total number of possible combinations of moves. Since the sequences are periodic, the combined sequence of moves (A and B) will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because LCM(m, k) is the least common multiple of m and k. So after LCM(m, k) rounds, the pattern of moves repeats.\n\nSo the idea is to compute the number of losses in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, then multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, we need to compute LCM(m, k). To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need to compute GCD.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to period-1, compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and count the number of times Nikephoros loses (count_a) and Polycarpus loses (count_b) in this period.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % period.\n\n5. So total_a = total_periods * count_a + count_in_rem_a (number of losses in rem rounds)\n\nSimilarly for total_b.\n\nBut how do we compute count_in_rem_a and count_in_rem_b? Well, for the rem rounds, we can iterate from 0 to rem-1 and check each round.\n\nBut the problem is that period can be up to m*k. Since m and k can be up to 1000, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6. Which is manageable because even 1e6 iterations are acceptable for Python.\n\nSo for example, if m and k are both 1000, LCM could be 1e6. And for each of these 1e6 rounds, we can compute the outcome once. Then multiply by the number of full periods, and then handle the remainder.\n\nSo the plan is feasible.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nFirst, read n, A, B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each i in 0 to period-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nCheck who wins, and increment count_a and count_b accordingly.\n\nOnce we have count_a and count_b per period, then:\n\nfull_cycles = n // period\n\nremaining_rounds = n % period\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * count_a\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * count_b\n\nThen, for the remaining_rounds, we need to process each of the first remaining_rounds rounds (from 0 to remaining_rounds-1), and compute how many times each loses.\n\nBut wait, for the remaining rounds, we can't just take the same count from the first 'remaining_rounds' steps of the period. Because the period is LCM(m, k), but the remaining rounds may be less than period. So for the remaining_rounds, we need to process each round from 0 to remaining_rounds-1, and compute the same as before.\n\nBut how do we do that?\n\nYes. So for the remaining rounds, we can loop from 0 to remaining_rounds-1, and for each, compute a_move and b_move, then check the outcome, and add to total_a and total_b.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, and period up to 1e6, the total time would be O(period) + O(remaining_rounds) which is O(1e6) + O(1e6) = acceptable.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nCompute count_a_per_period and count_b_per_period.\n\nCompute full_cycles = n // period.\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * count_a_per_period\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * count_b_per_period\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds, compute the number of a and b losses in the first rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1), and add them.\n\nNow, the question is: how to compute the outcome between a_move and b_move.\n\nLet me think: for each pair (a, b), determine who wins.\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b and returns (a_wins, b_wins) ?\n\nWait, for each round, if a beats b, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. If b beats a, then Nikephoros gets a spot. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: no spots.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a beats b):\n\nthen Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. So Nikephoros's loss count (his red spots) increases by 0, and Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1?\n\nWait, no. Wait the problem says:\n\nThe loser gets pinched. So in each round, the loser is the one who loses. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so he gets a spot. If Nikephoros loses, he gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round, the number of spots for Nikephoros is incremented by 1 if he loses. Similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nSo for each round, we have:\n\nif a and b are same: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\nif a beats b: Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So Nikephoros's count remains same, Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nif b beats a: Nikephoros loses. So his count increases by 1, and Polycarpus's count remains same.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we need to check which one wins.\n\nHow to implement that?\n\nWe can have a helper function, like:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so Nikephoros wins. Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # b wins, Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nSo for each pair, return (a_loses, b_loses). So in the code, for each round, we add these values to the totals.\n\nSo now, the code steps:\n\nImplement this helper function.\n\nNow, let's proceed with code.\n\nBut for Python, perhaps we can precompute for all possible pairs.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's easier to code the condition.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A as string.\n\nRead B as string.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM(m, k) as period.\n\nCompute count_a and count_b for one period.\n\nThen compute full_cycles and rem.\n\nThen compute the total.\n\nNow, the code for LCM:\n\nTo compute GCD, we can use math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value. However, since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nBut for LCM, since LCM(a, b) = a*b // GCD(a, b).\n\nSo:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to import math.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut for large n, the period could be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000, their LCM is up to 1e6). So for 1e6 iterations, it's manageable.\n\nSo code:\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k).\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to period-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen compute (a_loss, b_loss) for this round, and accumulate count_a and count_b.\n\nOnce that's done, multiply by full_cycles.\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, do the same for 0..rem-1.\n\nSo code:\n\nNow, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSample Output: 3 2\n\nLet's compute:\n\nm = 3, k=4.\n\nLCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo period is 12.\n\nFor each of 12 rounds, compute the outcomes.\n\nLet me list the rounds:\n\nRound 0:\n\ni=0: A[0%3] = A[0] = R; B[0%4] = B[0] = R. Draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1: i=1: A[1%3] = P; B[1%4] = S. P vs S: S beats P? Wait, no. Wait:\n\nThe rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock.\n\nSo for a_move = P (paper), b_move = S (scissors). Scissors beats paper. So b wins. So Nikephoros loses. So (1, 0). So Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nWait, in the first sample explanation:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\nn=7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4). The rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P vs S. So Nikephoros's move is P, Polycarpus's is S. S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So his count increases by 1. But according to the sample explanation, in the first sample, the first round (probably round 0?) is R-R. Then in the second round (i=1?), P vs S. So in the first sample, the output is 3 and 2.\n\nBut let's compute for the 12 rounds.\n\nBut perhaps I should proceed with the code steps.\n\nBut in any case, the code would compute the correct counts.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo for the first sample, the code computes the period as 12.\n\nBut n is 7, so full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, rem=7. So the code would process the first 7 rounds of the period.\n\nBut let's see what the code would compute for those 7 rounds.\n\nFor i from 0 to 6 (since rem=7):\n\ni=0:\n\nA[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. (0,0)\n\ni=1:\n\nA[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S. P vs S: S beats P. Nikephoros loses. (1,0)\n\ni=2:\n\nA[2%3] = S, B[2%4] = P. S vs P: S beats P. Nikephoros wins. So (0,1).\n\ni=3:\n\nA[3%3=0] = R, B[3%4=3] = P. R vs P: P beats R. Nikephoros loses. (1,0)\n\ni=4:\n\nA[4%3=1] = P, B[4%4=0] = R. P vs R: P beats R. Nikephoros wins. (0,1).\n\ni=5:\n\nA[5%3=2] = S, B[5%4=1] = S. Draw. (0,0).\n\ni=6:\n\nA[6%3=0] = R, B[6%4=2] = P. R vs P: P beats R. Nikephoros loses. (1,0).\n\nSo adding up for the 7 rounds:\n\nNikephoros's losses (a_loses) are:\n\ni=1: 1\n\ni=3: 1\n\ni=6: 1 → total 3.\n\nPolycarpus's losses (b_loses) are:\n\ni=2: 1\n\ni=4: 1 → total 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 3 2. So the code would correctly compute that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8?), B is \"R\" (k=1). So LCM(8, 1) is 8. For each of 8 rounds, all moves are R vs R. So no losses. So for n=5, the full_cycles is 0, rem=5. All rounds are draws. So output is 0 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input. Wait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is written as ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'] — but that's probably a mistake in the way the user presented the input. Probably, the actual input is:\n\nFirst line: 7\n\nSecond line: RPS\n\nThird line: RSPP\n\nBut in the code, we need to read n, then A, then B.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys, math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    period = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # compute count_a and count_b for one period\n\n    def get_result(a, b):\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            return (0, 0)\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # a wins, so Nikephoros wins. Polycarpus gets a spot. So Nikephoros's loss is 0, Polycarpus's is 1.\n\n            return (0, 1)\n\n        else:\n\n            # b wins. Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros's loss is 1, Polycarpus's is 0.\n\n            return (1, 0)\n\n    count_a = 0\n\n    count_b = 0\n\n    for i in range(period):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        da, db = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n\n        count_a += da\n\n        count_b += db\n\n    full_cycles = n // period\n\n    rem = n % period\n\n    total_a = full_cycles * count_a\n\n    total_b = full_cycles * count_b\n\n    # Now process rem rounds\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        da, db = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n\n        total_a += da\n\n        total_b += db\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, in the code, the function lcm is not defined. So need to define it.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to import math.\n\nBut in the code, the code must be written as a Python script.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nBut in the code, the code must read from stdin. Also, note that for reading the input, sometimes after reading n, the next lines may have leading/trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input is given correctly.\n\nBut in the code, using strip() for A and B is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nBut what about when m or k is zero? No, the constraints say 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000.\n\nSo code should be okay.\n\nBut what about when n is zero? Well, the constraints say n ≥ 1.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about the case where the period is larger than n. For example, n is 5, and period is 10. So full_cycles is 0, rem is 5. So the code loops over 5 rounds.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code's time complexity is O(period) + O(rem). Since period is up to 1e6, and rem is up to 1e6, for each test case, it's acceptable.\n\nBut for Python, even 1e6 iterations are manageable.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut in Python, the code must be written with proper imports.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    period = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    def get_result(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return (0, 0)\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n    \n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    for i in range(period):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        da, db = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        count_a += da\n        count_b += db\n    \n    full_cycles = n // period\n    rem = n % period\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * count_a\n    total_b = full_cycles * count_b\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        da, db = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        total_a += da\n        total_b += db\n    \n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first input is 7, then A is RPS (length 3), B is RSPP (length 4). So period is lcm(3,4)=12. Then for rem=7, the code processes 7 rounds, which gives the correct result.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when n is equal to the period. Then rem is 0, and the code adds nothing. So the total is count_a and count_b.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nBut what about when the period is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, so period is at least 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after they play n rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results given the constraints where n can be as large as 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences for their moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every m rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every k rounds.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The combined sequence of moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds, where LCM is the least common multiple of m and k. This is because LCM(m, k) is the smallest number that is a multiple of both m and k.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of simulating each round individually (which is infeasible for large n), we calculate the number of losses in one full cycle (LCM(m, k) rounds). We then use this result to compute the total number of losses over all cycles and handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    period = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    def get_result(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return (0, 0)\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n    \n    count_a = 0\n    count_b = 0\n    for i in range(period):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        da, db = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        count_a += da\n        count_b += db\n    \n    full_cycles = n // period\n    rem = n % period\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * count_a\n    total_b = full_cycles * count_b\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        da, db = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        total_a += da\n        total_b += db\n    \n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read from standard input, including the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of sequences A and B is computed to determine the cycle length after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Result Calculation per Cycle**: For each round within one full cycle (up to LCM(m, k) rounds), we determine the outcome of each round and accumulate the number of losses for both players.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles in `n` rounds is calculated, and the losses from these cycles are multiplied by the number of full cycles. The remaining rounds after the full cycles are processed individually to account for any leftover rounds.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses (red spots) for both players is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles very large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring that we avoid unnecessary computations and maintain optimal performance.",
