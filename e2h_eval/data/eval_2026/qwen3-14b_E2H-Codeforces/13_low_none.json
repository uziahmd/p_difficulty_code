For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine whether a given set of three notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or is strange. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the definitions properly. Let me re-read the problem statement to make sure I get the details right.\n\nA major triad is when, after ordering the notes X, Y, Z, the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. The total from X to Z would be 7 semitones. For a minor triad, the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively. \n\nBut since the triad is unordered, I need to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any of them satisfy either the major or minor condition.\n\nSo, the steps I need to perform:\n\n1. Read the three notes from input.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes (since order matters for checking the distances).\n3. For each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor criteria.\n4. If any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, how do I calculate the distance between two notes? The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, in the problem description, the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic. \n\nEach consecutive pair is one semitone apart. So, the distance between two notes is the number of steps between them in this cyclic order, moving forward. For example, C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, D to D# is 3, D# to E is 4? Or wait, maybe the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me check the example given. The example says that C to E is 4 semitones. Let me count:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E. So from C to E, there are four steps: C to C# (1), C# to D (2), D to D# (3), D# to E (4). So yes, that's 4 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of steps moving forward from X to Y. So if X is before Y in the list, it's the difference in their positions. If X is after Y, then it's (12 - (X's position - Y's position))? Or perhaps the distance is calculated as (Y's index - X's index) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because if you go from E to C, you have to go through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12, but if that's negative, add 12? Wait, no. Because the distance is always measured from the lower note to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X - Y))? Or maybe the distance is (Y - X + 12) % 12? No, because for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Let me think of the indexes. Let's assign each note an index. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let's say:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indexes are 0 to 11. \n\nSo for any two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? But no, because if X is before Y, then the distance is Y_index - X_index. If X is after Y, then the distance is (12 - X_index + Y_index). For example, X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0). Then the distance is (0 -4",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or is neither. The solution involves checking the semitone distances between the notes in all possible permutations to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent each note as an index in a predefined list of musical notes, which allows us to easily calculate the semitone distances between any two notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes by considering their positions in the list of notes. The distance is determined by moving forward from the lower note to the upper note in the cyclic sequence of notes.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three given notes, check if the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third note, match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Result Determination**: Based on the checks, determine if the triad is major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef get_distance(note1, note2):\n    idx1 = note_to_index(note1)\n    idx2 = note_to_index(note2)\n    return (idx2 - idx1) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    d1 = get_distance(x, y)\n    d2 = get_distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    d1 = get_distance(x, y)\n    d2 = get_distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Index Conversion**: The `note_to_index` function converts a note name to its corresponding index in the list of musical notes, facilitating distance calculations.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function calculates the semitone distance between two notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Triad Checks**: The `is_major` and `is_minor` functions check if the distances between the notes in a given permutation meet the criteria for a major or minor triad, respectively.\n4. **Permutations Evaluation**: The `classify_chord` function evaluates all permutations of the given notes to determine if any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad. If none do, it returns \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the given notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical scales.",
