For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the three notes can be ordered in some way. For a major triad, there should be an ordering where X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. For minor, it's 3 then 4. So I need to check all possible permutations of the three notes and see if any of them fit either the major or minor condition.\n\nBut how do I calculate the distances between the notes? Oh right, the notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list of notes is given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic. So each note can be assigned an index from 0 to 11, and then the distance between two notes can be calculated based on their positions.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its corresponding index. Let me create a list of the notes in order. Let me see: the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in the problem statement, the list is written as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nWait, but then after H (index 11) comes C again. So the distance between two notes is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but since the distance is measured from lower to higher, maybe we need to consider the positions in the circular list.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. Between C and D is 2 semitones. But when you go the other way, like from C# to C, the distance is 11 semitones? Because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to upper. Wait, the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". So if you have two notes, say X and Y, then the distance is calculated as the number of semitones you move upwards from X to reach Y. So if X is lower than Y, then it's (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? No, wait, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones you need to go up from X to reach Y. For example, between C and E: C is 0, E is 4. So the distance is 4 semitones. But between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones because you have to go up 8 steps (E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, ..., up to C again).\n\nSo for two notes, the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is y_index - x_index. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (x_index - y_index))? Or perhaps the distance is (y_index - x_index + 12) % 12? Wait, no. Let me think: for example, X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0). Then the distance from X to Y would be (0 -4 + 12) = 8 semitones. Which matches the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between X and Y (from X to Y) is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. Wait, no. Because if y is higher than x, then (y -x) is positive. If y is lower than x, then (y -x) is negative. So mod 12 would give the correct value. For example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then 4-0=4. So 4 mod 12 is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then 0-4 = -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves calculating the distances between the notes in a cyclic musical scale and checking if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: First, we map each note to its corresponding index in the cyclic musical scale. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between any two notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the distance is calculated as the difference in their indices modulo 12. This accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Since the order of notes in a triad can vary, we check all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the conditions for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Major and Minor Triad Conditions**: A major triad requires the distances between the first and second note to be 4 semitones and between the second and third note to be 3 semitones. A minor triad requires the distances to be 3 and 4 semitones respectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = [\"C\", \"C#\", \"D\", \"D#\", \"E\", \"F\", \"F#\", \"G\", \"G#\", \"A\", \"B\", \"H\"]\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef get_distance(a, b):\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3\n    dist_xy = get_distance(x, y)\n    dist_yz = get_distance(y, z)\n    return dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 3, Y to Z is 4\n    dist_xy = get_distance(x, y)\n    dist_yz = get_distance(y, z)\n    return dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\n# Read input\nimport sys\ninput_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\nnotes = input_line.split()\n\n# Process and print output\nresult = classify_chord(notes)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` function maps each note to its position in the list of musical notes, which helps in calculating distances.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function calculates the distance between two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Triad Checks**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` check if a given permutation of notes meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, respectively.\n4. **Permutations Check**: By iterating over all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that we check every possible ordering to determine if the triad fits either the major or minor criteria. If none fit, the chord is classified as strange.",
