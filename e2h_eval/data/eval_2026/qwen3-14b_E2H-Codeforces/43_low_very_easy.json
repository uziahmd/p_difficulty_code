He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is: A has some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the count of 'c's could be equal to both.\n\nSo the string must have a certain structure. Let's break down the conditions.\n\nFirst, the string must consist of a bunch of a's followed by b's followed by c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. Like, if there's a 'c' before some 'b's, that's not allowed. So the string should have a section of a's, then b's, then c's. So the first part is checking the order of characters.\n\nFor example, the second example input is 'bbacc'. Let's see: the order is b, b, a, c, c. So after the initial a's (which are zero here?), but wait, the initial string from A is some number of a's. Then B adds some b's. So the string after B's step is a's followed by b's. Then C adds c's. So the final string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So any deviation from that order is invalid.\n\nSo first, check that the string is composed of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. If that's not the case, return NO.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, then check the counts.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the counts are:\n\ncount_a = number of a's\n\ncount_b = number of b's\n\ncount_c = number of c's.\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\nAfter A and B's steps, the string has count_a a's and count_b b's. Then C appends count_c c's. And count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b (or both).\n\nBut also, the original string after B's step must have at least one a and one b. So count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is in the form a*b*c* (i.e., all a's first, then all b's, then all c's).\n\n2. count_c equals count_a or count_b (or both).\n\n3. count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1.\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input is 'aaabccc' → count_a is 3, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So count_c equals count_a (3). So that's valid. Also, the order is correct.\n\nThe second sample is 'bbacc' → the order is b, then a, which is invalid. So even though count_c is 2, which equals count_b (2?), but the order is wrong. So output is NO.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). So that's okay. Order is a's then b's then c's. So yes.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\nFirst, check that the string is in the correct order. How to do that?\n\nWe can check that the string is composed of a sequence of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. So, for example, the string should not have any a's after the first occurrence of b or c, and no b's after the first occurrence of c.\n\nSo, the string can be divided into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's. Let's think about how to check this.\n\nWe can iterate through the string and check the transitions between characters. For example:\n\n- The first part is all a's. Once a 'b' is encountered, all subsequent characters must be 'b's until the first 'c' is encountered, and then all subsequent characters must be 'c's.\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is made up of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, the string should not have any 'a's after the first 'b' or 'c', and no 'b's after the first 'c'.\n\nAnother way is to split the string into three parts. Let's find the index where the first 'b' occurs, then the first 'c' occurs. For example:\n\nIf there are no 'b's, then the string can't be valid (since B added some 'b's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in a particular order. The string must be composed of a block of 'a's followed by a block of 'b's and then a block of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order Validity**: Ensure the string consists of all 'a's followed by all 'b's and then all 'c's. This can be checked by verifying that once a 'b' is encountered, no 'a' should appear after it, and once a 'c' is encountered, no 'b' or 'a' should appear after it.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' (since both A and B added these characters). Also, check if the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check the order: a's followed by b's followed by c's\n    in_a = True\n    in_b = False\n    in_c = False\n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if in_b or in_c:\n                return False\n            in_a = True\n            in_b = False\n            in_c = False\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if in_c:\n                return False\n            if not in_a and not in_b:\n                in_a = False\n            in_b = True\n            in_c = False\n        elif char == 'c':\n            if not in_b:\n                return False\n            in_c = True\n    # Now check counts\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n        return False\n    \n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    if is_valid_string(input_str):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Validity Check**: The loop through the string ensures that the characters transition from 'a' to 'b' to 'c' without any backward transitions. This ensures the string is structured as a block of 'a's followed by 'b's and then 'c's.\n2. **Character Count Check**: After confirming the order, the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are determined. The presence of at least one 'a' and one 'b' is necessary because both A and B must have added these characters. The count of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's to satisfy the condition imposed by C's operation.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks both the structural and numerical constraints of the problem, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
