He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) â€” the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) â€” difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about splitting an array of n elements into exactly k contiguous parts, each part being solved on a day. Each day's profit is the maximum of that day's subarray. We need to maximize the total profit. And then output the maximum total and the split.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Since n and k can be up to 2000, a brute-force approach would be way too slow. So dynamic programming seems like a good candidate here.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days. Then, the transition would be: for each possible split point m (from j-1 to i-1), we take dp[m][j-1] plus the max of a[m+1..i]. But wait, since each day must have at least one problem, for j days, the first j-1 days must have at least j-1 problems, so for dp[i][j], i must be >= j.\n\nSo the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) ) for all m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nBut calculating the max for each possible m and i could be expensive. For each i and j, we have to check O(n) possibilities, and for each of those, compute the max of a subarray. That would be O(n^3) time in the worst case. For n=2000, that's 8e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm, so we need to optimize this. How can we precompute the max values for ranges?\n\nWe can precompute a 2D array max_range where max_range[i][j] represents the maximum value from a[i] to a[j]. Then, when we need the max between m+1 and i, it's just max_range[m+1][i]. Precomputing this would take O(n^2) time and space. For n=2000, that's 4 million entries, which is manageable.\n\nOnce we have that, the DP transitions can be done in O(n^3) time. Wait, but n is 2000, and with O(n^3) that's 8e9 operations. That's way too slow. Oh right, because for each dp[i][j], we have to check O(i) possibilities. So for n=2000, and k=2000, it's O(n^3) which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think again. The problem requires that the splits are contiguous and in order. So for the DP approach, perhaps we can find a way to compute the transitions more efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to optimize the inner loop. Let me think about the constraints. For example, for each dp[i][j], we need to find the best m where m ranges from (j-1) to (i-1). For each m, we take dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut how can we compute the max(a[m+1..i]) efficiently? Well, the precomputed max_range helps here. But even with that, the time complexity is O(k * n^2). For n=2000, k=2000, that's 8e9 operations. Which is way too slow. So that's not going to work.\n\nWait, but what's the actual maximum value of k? Since k can be up to n, but for some cases, maybe we can find a better way. Let's think again about the constraints. For example, when k equals n, each day has exactly one problem, so the total profit is the sum of all elements. Similarly, when k=1, the total profit is the max of the entire array.\n\nBut for general k, how can we optimize this DP approach?\n\nAnother thought: For each j, the number of days, when building dp[i][j], we can compute it based on previous j-1 layers. But even so, the O(kn^2) time might be too slow for n=2000. Let's calculate the numbers. For n=2000, k=2000, the total operations would be 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10. That's way beyond acceptable time limits. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there's another way. Let's think about the problem differently. Since each day's profit is the maximum of the subarray for that day, and we need to split into k parts. What's the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to split an array of problem difficulties into exactly `k` contiguous parts such that the total profit, defined as the sum of the maximum difficulty of each part, is maximized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum total profit for the first `i` problems split into `j` days.\n2. **Precompute Maximum Values**: To efficiently compute the maximum value of any subarray, we precompute a 2D array `max_range` where `max_range[i][j]` stores the maximum value from index `i` to `j` in the input array.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible split point `m`, we calculate the maximum profit by considering the best way to split the first `m` problems into `j-1` days and adding the maximum value of the subarray from `m+1` to `i`.\n4. **Reconstruct the Solution**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact splits that yield the maximum profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute max_range[i][j] = max(a[i..j])\n    max_range = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_max = a[i]\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            current_max = max(current_max, a[j])\n            max_range[i][j] = current_max\n    \n    # Initialize dp table\n    dp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    # Also, keep track of the split points\n    prev = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            if j > i:\n                continue\n            if j == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = max_range[0][i-1]\n                prev[i][j] = 0  # no previous split\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = 0\n                for m in range(j-1, i):\n                    current = dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m][i-1]\n                    if current > dp[i][j]:\n                        dp[i][j] = current\n                        prev[i][j] = m\n    \n    # Now reconstruct the answer\n    result = []\n    current = n\n    current_k = k\n    while current_k > 0:\n        prev_split = prev[current][current_k]\n        if prev_split == 0:\n            result.append(current)\n            current_k -= 1\n            current = 0\n        else:\n            result.append(current - prev_split)\n            current = prev_split\n            current_k -= 1\n    result.reverse()\n    \n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of problems `n`, the number of days `k`, and the list of problem difficulties `a`.\n2. **Precompute Maximum Values**: The `max_range` array is precomputed to store the maximum values of all possible subarrays, which helps in quickly determining the maximum difficulty for any segment during the DP transitions.\n3. **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized where `dp[i][j]` keeps track of the maximum profit for the first `i` problems split into `j` days. The `prev` table is used to backtrack the splits.\n4. **DP Transitions**: For each possible split point `m`, the DP value is updated based on the best possible previous splits and the maximum value of the current segment.\n5. **Backtracking to Find Splits**: After filling the DP table, the solution is reconstructed by backtracking from `dp[n][k]` using the `prev` table to determine the exact segments for each day.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal splits using dynamic programming and precomputed maximum values, leading to an optimal solution within feasible time complexity.",
