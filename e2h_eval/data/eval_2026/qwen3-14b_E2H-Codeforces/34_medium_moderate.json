And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day period, I need to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those averages.\n\nWait, right. So the problem says that for each of the (n - k + 1) weeks, we take the average of their sleep times, and then compute the average of all those averages. Oh right, but the example shows that in the third case, they sum all the weeks' totals and divide by the number of weeks. Wait, because the average of averages is the same as the total sum divided by the number of weeks. Because each week's average is sum of that week's days divided by k, and then when you average all those, it's (sum of all those sums) / (number of weeks * k). But wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose there are m weeks. Each week's average is (sum of its k days)/k. Then the average of all these averages is [sum_{i=1 to m} (sum_i)/k ] / m. Which equals [ (sum of all sum_i) / k ] / m = total_sum / (k * m). But m is (n - k + 1). So the overall average is the total sum of all the days in all the weeks divided by (k * m). But wait, how many times is each day counted in the total sum?\n\nFor example, take the first example: n=3, k=2. The weeks are days 1-2 and 2-3. The sum of the weeks' sums is (3+4)+(4+7) = 7 + 11 = 18. The average of averages is ( (7/2) + (11/2) ) / 2 = (18/2)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? Wait but the sample output says 9.0... Oh wait, no. Wait the sample input says that for the first example, the output is 9.0000... Wait what's the actual calculation here?\n\nWait the first example input is 3 2 and the array is [3,4,7]. The weeks are two weeks: first week is 3 and 4, sum is 7, average is 3.5. Second week is 4 and 7, sum is 11, average is 5.5. The average of these two averages is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output says 9.0000... Wait that's conflicting. Wait no, looking back at the example:\n\nWait the sample input says that the first example's output is 9.0000... Wait that can't be. Wait maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Wait in the third example, the output is 28964.2857... which is (sum of all weeks' sums) divided by 7. So perhaps the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. Wait that's confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n -k +1 weeks. For example, if k=2, n=3, a=[3,4,7], then the result is ... the example says the output is 9.0000... Wait what's the correct answer here?\n\nIn the example given in the problem statement, the output is 9.0000. Let me see. How is that calculated?\n\nThe weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. The sum of each week is 7 and 11. The average of these sums would be (7+11)/2 = 9. So the output is 9.0000. Oh! So the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the sums of each week. Because the problem says \"average sleep time per week\" but maybe the way it's calculated is that the average is the sum of the week's hours divided by k. But then the problem says that the answer is the average over all weeks. So the average of the averages. But in the example, the sample output is 9.0000, which is the average of the sums, not the average of averages.\n\nWait this is confusing. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: the doctor asked him about his average amount of hours of sleep per week. So Polycarp is considering each week's average (sum of the week's days divided by k), and then he wants the average of those averages. But according to the example, that's not the case. Let's look at the first example.\n\nIn the first example, the two weeks have averages 3.5 and 5.5. The average of those is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. So that contradicts. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement's note: in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So the problem says that the answer is the sum of all weeks' sums divided by the number of weeks. Which would be the average of the sums. But that would be the same as the average of the averages multiplied by k. Because each average is sum_week /k. So the average of averages is (sum_week1/k + sum_week2/k + ... ) / m, where m is the number of weeks. Which equals (sum of all sum_week) / (m *k). But the note says that the answer is sum of all sum_week divided by m. Which suggests that the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the averages. So why does the problem say \"average sleep time per week\"?\n\nWait maybe the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. But that seems odd. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". So for each week, the average is sum of the week's hours divided by k. Then, the average over all weeks is the average of these values. However, according to the sample input, that's not what's happening. Let's re-examine the first sample:\n\nSample input 1: 3 2, a = [3,4,7]. The weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. The average for each week is 3.5 and 5.5. The average of these is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. That's impossible unless the problem is not asking for the average of averages, but the average of the sum of each week. Which would be (7 + 11)/2 = 9.0. So the sample output is 9.0. Which matches the sample. So the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the averages.\n\nBut why does the problem say \"average sleep time per week\"? Because that would be the average of the averages. So there's a contradiction here. But according to the sample, the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which would be the sum of all the weeks' sums divided by the number of weeks. So how to resolve this?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the problem says that the result is 9.0000... So in that example, the output is 9.0. So that's the sum of the weeks' sums divided by the number of weeks. Which is (7+11)/2 = 9. So that's the correct approach.\n\nBut why does the problem say \"average sleep time per week\"? Because that would be the average of the averages. So perhaps the problem is not well-worded. But according to the sample, the correct approach is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which is the same as the sum of all the weeks' sums divided by the number of weeks. Which is the same as the average of the sum of each week.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which is the same as the average of the sum of each week. So for each week, we take the sum of the k days, then take the average of those sums. So the output is (sum_total) / m, where m is the number of weeks (n -k +1).\n\nSo the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which is the same as the sum of all the weeks' sums divided by the number of weeks.\n\nSo how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to compute the sum of each consecutive k elements, then take the average of those sums. But with n up to 2e5, and k up to n, the naive approach of computing each sum in O(k) time would be O(nk), which is up to 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to compute the sum of all consecutive k-length windows. The standard approach for that is using a sliding window technique. Let me think.\n\nYes. For example, the first window is sum of a[0] to a[k-1]. The next window is sum of a[1] to a[k], which is previous sum minus a[0] plus a[k]. So we can compute all the window sums in O(n) time.\n\nOnce we have all the window sums, we can compute their average by adding them all and dividing by the number of windows (m = n -k +1).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the first window (first k elements).\n\n2. Then iterate from i=1 to m-1, each time subtracting a[i-1] and adding a[i + k -1], then adding to the total sum.\n\nBut wait, the total sum of all window sums can be computed by adding each window's sum. So for example, the first window is sum_0, then sum_1, etc. So the total sum is sum_0 + sum_1 + ... + sum_{m-1}.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute the initial window sum.\n\nThen for each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element leaving the window and adding the new element.\n\nEach time, add that to the total.\n\nOnce we have the total, divide by m (number of windows) to get the average.\n\nYes. So the time complexity is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nIf m is zero, but since k <=n, m is at least 1.\n\nCompute the initial window sum.\n\nThen for each next window, adjust the sum.\n\nAdd all the window sums to a total.\n\nThen divide by m.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 1, the total sum of the window sums is 7 + 11 = 18, divided by m=2 gives 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nSo now the code can be written.\n\nNow, how to handle the initial sum?\n\nIn Python, for example, for the array a, the first sum is sum(a[0:k]).\n\nThen, for each i in 1 to m-1:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\nBut for the indexes, let's see. For the first window, the starting index is 0. The next window starts at 1. So for the i-th window (starting at index i), the elements are a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[i +k -1].\n\nSo when moving from window i-1 (starting at i-1) to window i (starting at i), we subtract a[i-1] and add a[i +k -1].\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\nThen average = total / m\n\nYes.\n\nBut for large k, say k=2e5, sum(a[0:k]) would take O(k) time, which is acceptable since it's O(n) overall.\n\nBut for n=2e5, this is manageable.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and k.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nm = n -k +1\n\nif m ==0: but since k<=n, m is at least 1.\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal = initial_sum\n\ncurrent_sum = initial_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / m\n\nThen output with sufficient decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the code would compute total as 7 + 11 = 18, average is 18/2 =9. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\nInput is 1 1, a = [10]. Then m = 1. The initial sum is 10. total is 10. average is 10/1 =10. Correct.\n\nThird example: input is 8 2, array [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. The weeks are 7 in total. Let's compute the sum of each week's sum.\n\nThe weeks are:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3 +6 +100004 + 100123 +579 + 1245 +790 = Let's compute:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n+100004 = 100013\n\n+100123 = 200136\n\n+579 = 200715\n\n+1245 = 201960 \n\n+790 = 202750.\n\nDivide by 7: 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python, handling multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the input examples, the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait the input given in the problem is:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given in the problem, it's:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich seems to be three test cases. But the original problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases, but in the actual programming competition problem, the input is one test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is presented as multiple test cases for illustration. But the actual problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k...\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code should read a single test case. However, in the sample input provided, there are three test cases, but perhaps that's just for the example. But the actual problem expects to read a single test case. Wait the sample input shows three examples, but the user probably provided them as separate test cases. However, the code needs to process a single test case. Wait the problem says, \"your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read the input as per the problem's input format. Which is, for each test case, two lines: first line n and k, second line the array.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem is perhaps a list of test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich outputs 9.0000000000.\n\nBut the code needs to process a single test case. So the code should read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases? Or is it only one?\n\nWait the problem's input description says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ...\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. But perhaps that's just for the example. For example, in the problem statement, the sample input is given as three separate test cases. But in reality, the code should process one test case per run.\n\nBut the user's code must read from stdin. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, but the problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is formatted with multiple test cases, but the actual code should read a single test case. But that's unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nOutput:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nWhich suggests that the code must process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input, or perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But that's conflicting.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ...\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the user's sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one test case. However, the sample output shows three outputs, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the problem's original source, perhaps it's from Codeforces or similar. Let me think. The problem's title is \"Average Sleep Time\", and the sample input seems to be three different test cases. But perhaps the original problem is expecting to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the user's code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the input is actually multiple test cases. But how to know?\n\nLooking back at the problem's note:\n\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nSo the code must process a single test case. Therefore, the sample input provided by the user is perhaps incorrect. However, in the problem's original context, the code should read a single test case. So the code should read n and k from the first line, then the array from the second line.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, the code has three test cases, but the output is three lines. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how can we know?\n\nWell, looking at the problem's original statement, perhaps the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, implying a single test case. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases, each on separate lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSecond test case is:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nThird test case is:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo the code should read all test cases until EOF. However, in programming competition problems, it's common to have multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says nothing about multiple test cases. So this is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. Otherwise, the sample input would have only one test case. So the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the code could read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut how to read the input correctly? Let's think.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines: first line has n and k, second line has n integers.\n\nSo the code should read all the input lines, split into groups of two lines each, and process each group as a test case.\n\nBut in practice, the code could read all input lines, and process them as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. Then for each pair of lines (i.e., line 0 and 1, line 2 and 3, etc.), process them as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the input is provided as a single line with multiple test cases? Well, the problem's sample input is given as three test cases, each with two lines.\n\nSo for the code, the correct approach is to read all the input lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to do this in Python? Let's see.\n\nIn Python, the standard way to read input is via input() or sys.stdin. For multiple test cases, the code can read all lines at once.\n\nBut for example, the code can read all lines as a list, and then process them in pairs.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps the code should read a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is a bit of a problem.\n\nBut looking back at the original problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nWhich would be three test cases. The output is three lines.\n\nThus, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n and k. So perhaps the problem's original input is for multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description may have been miswritten. But given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all test cases from the input, processing them as pairs of lines.\n\nBut how to read the input in Python? For example, the code could read all lines from stdin, split into groups of two lines, and process each group as a test case.\n\nBut in practice, for some programming competition problems, the input may have multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not mention it. However, given the sample input and output, it's clear that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nTake the first line as n and k.\n\nTake the second line as the array.\n\nProcess and output the result.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n    n, k = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    # process and output\n\n    i += 2\n\nBut this assumes that the input is given as pairs of lines. Which is the case in the sample input.\n\nSo the code should be written to process multiple test cases.\n\nNow, the code for each test case:\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\nThen compute the total sum of all window sums.\n\nThen divide by m.\n\nThen output with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut in Python, for large n and k, the initial sum can be computed with sum(a[0:k]).\n\nBut for very large k (like 2e5), this is O(k) time. However, since the total time is O(n) per test case, it's acceptable.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, the code must process each one.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n =k. Then m =1. The sum is sum of the entire array, divided by 1. So output is sum(a)/1 = sum(a).\n\nEdge case 2: k=1. Then each week is a single day. The sum of all weeks' sums is sum of all elements, and m =n. So average is sum(a)/n. Which is the same as the average of the array.\n\nAnother edge case: when k= n, then m=1. The average is sum(a)/1 = sum(a).\n\nAnother case: when n=2, k=1. Then m=2. The sum of the weeks' sums is a[0] + a[1], divided by 2. Which is the average of the array.\n\nSo the code handles these cases.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, the code for each test case:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nIf m is zero? No, since k<=n.\n\nCompute initial_sum = sum(a[0:k]).\n\ntotal = initial_sum.\n\ncurrent_sum = initial_sum.\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\naverage = total / m\n\nprint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, for large numbers, this is okay.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, since k <=n, m is at least 1.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\na = [3,4,7]\n\nm=3-2+1=2.\n\ninitial_sum = 3+4=7.\n\ntotal =7.\n\ni runs from 1 to 1 (since m=2, range(1,2) is one iteration).\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] (3) + a[1+2-1] = a[1+1] = a[2] =7. So 7-3+7= 11. total becomes 7+11=18. average is 18/2=9.0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample: second test case is n=1, k=1. m=1. initial_sum is 10. total is 10. average is 10.0.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\narray is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nm=8-2+1=7.\n\ninitial_sum = 1+2=3.\n\ntotal =3.\n\nThen for i from 1 to 6 (since m=7, range(1,7) is 6 iterations):\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_sum = 3 - a[0] (1) + a[1+2-1] = a[1+1] = a[2] =4. So 3-1+4=6. total is 3+6=9.\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_sum = 6 - a[1] (2) + a[2+2-1] = a[3] =100000. So 6-2+100000= 100004. total 9 + 100004 = 100013.\n\ni=3:\n\ncurrent_sum = 100004 - a[2] (4) + a[3+2-1] = a[4] =123. 100004 -4 +123 = 100004 + 119 = 100123. total becomes 100013 + 100123 = 200136.\n\ni=4: current_sum = 100123 - a[3] (100000) + a[4+2-1] = a[5] =456. 100123 -100000 +456 = 123 +456 = 579. total 200136 + 579 = 200715.\n\ni=5: current_sum = 579 - a[4] (123) + a[5+2-1] = a[6] =789. 579-123=456 +789= 1245. total 200715 + 1245 = 201960.\n\ni=6: current_sum = 1245 - a[5] (456) + a[6+2-1] = a[7] =1. 1245 -456 = 789 +1 = 790. total 201960 +790= 202750.\n\naverage is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code must be written in Python, handling multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in the sample input, the lines are:\n\nLine 0: '3 2'\n\nLine 1: '3 4 7'\n\nLine 2: '1 1'\n\nLine 3: '10'\n\nLine 4: '8 2'\n\nLine 5: '1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'\n\nSo the code reads lines in pairs.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and k\n\n        n, k = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        m = n -k +1\n\n        # compute initial sum\n\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n        total = current_sum\n\n        for i in range(1, m):\n\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n            total += current_sum\n\n        average = total / m\n\n        # print with 10 decimal digits\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, in Python, the format string for 10 decimal digits. However, the sample outputs show 10 decimal digits. For example, the first sample output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nBut the code uses the format string with 10 decimal digits. However, when the average is an integer, like 9.0, it will be printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nBut in Python, the format function will handle that.\n\nBut what about floating point precision? For example, when the average is something like 28964.2857142857, which is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857142857... So when printed with 10 decimal digits, it would be 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut the sample output is '28964.2857142857'.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Python, when using the format string, it will round the number appropriately. However, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 1e-6. So printing with 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nBut for the code, using the format string with 10 decimal digits is correct.\n\nBut what about when the average is something like 9.0, which would be printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, testing for the sample inputs:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe code returns 9.0000000000.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n10 → average is 10.0 → printed as 10.0000000000.\n\nSample input 3:\n\n8 2\n\narray as before → printed as 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nNow, what about when the numbers are large? For example, when the sum is very large, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nNow, the code is ready.\n\nBut what about when the array is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, n ≥k ≥1, so the array will have at least one element.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n, k = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        m = n - k +1\n\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n        total = current_sum\n\n        for i in range(1, m):\n\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n            total += current_sum\n\n        average = total / m\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut in Python, when you have a very large array, the sum(a[:k]) could take O(k) time. However, for n up to 2e5, and per test case, it's acceptable.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, it's still manageable.\n\nBut what if the code is given a test case where n is 2e5 and k is 2e5? Then sum(a[:k]) is O(2e5) time, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks from a given list of daily sleep times. Each week is defined as a sequence of `k` consecutive days, and we need to compute the average of the sums of these weekly sleep times.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, we read the number of days `n` and the length of each week `k`, followed by the list of sleep times for `n` days.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique:** To efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive `k`-day window, we use the sliding window technique. This allows us to compute each window sum in constant time after the initial sum calculation.\n3. **Sum Calculation:** The initial sum of the first `k` days is computed. For subsequent windows, we adjust the sum by subtracting the element that slides out of the window and adding the new element that slides into the window.\n4. **Average Calculation:** The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of valid windows (which is `n - k + 1`) to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        n, k = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        m = n - k + 1\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total = current_sum\n        for i in range(1, m):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n            total += current_sum\n        average = total / m\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input:** The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing. Each pair of lines represents a test case.\n- **Sliding Window Technique:** The initial sum of the first `k` elements is calculated. For each subsequent window, we adjust the sum by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This reduces the time complexity from O(n*k) to O(n) per test case.\n- **Average Calculation:** The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of valid windows to get the average sleep time over all weeks, ensuring the result is formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures accurate results within the required precision.",
