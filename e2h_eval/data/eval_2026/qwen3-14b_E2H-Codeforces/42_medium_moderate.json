    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. \n\nLet me think about how the progress bars work. For each byte copied, there's a current file's progress and the total progress. Both are calculated with floor division. So for every byte x in file i, we compute two values: \n\nFirst progress bar: floor(100 * x / a_i)\nSecond progress bar: floor(100 * (sum of previous files' sizes + x) / total_sum)\n\nThe challenge is to find all percentages that appear on both bars at the same time.\n\nSo the approach would be to simulate each byte being copied and check for each moment what the two percentages are. Then collect the ones that are the same. But wait, considering that n can be up to 100 and each a_i up to 1000, the total number of bytes is up to 100 * 1000 = 100,000. For each of these bytes, we can compute the two percentages and track when they are equal. However, since each file has a_i bytes, for each file, we have to loop through each byte in order.\n\nBut even 10^5 steps are manageable in Python. Let's think about the steps:\n\nFirst, calculate the total sum of all a_i. Let's call it total_sum.\n\nThen, for each file i from 0 to n-1:\n   For each byte x in 1 to a_i (since after each byte, the progress is updated):\n      current_progress = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n      total_progress = floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum)\n      if current_progress == total_progress, add it to a set.\n\nWait, but also, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) shows 0% on both bars. So we need to include 0% as a possible value. Also, after the last byte is copied, the total progress is 100%, but maybe during the copying of the last byte, the total progress could reach 100%?\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the progress bars update after each byte. So for example, when the last byte is copied, the total progress would be 100% (since sum_prev + x equals total_sum). So in that case, the total progress is 100. But for the current progress, the current file's progress is 100% (since x = a_i, so 100 * x /a_i is 100.0, floor is 100. So that's included.\n\nSo the initial state (0%) is covered when x=0? Or is that considered before any bytes are copied. Wait, the problem says that the initial state is both bars showing 0. So that's a moment where both are 0. So we need to include 0% in the output if it's present. But according to the simulation steps above, when x is 0 (before any bytes are copied), but in the code, we are looping through x from 1 to a_i. So perhaps we need to handle the initial 0% separately.\n\nWait, the problem says that the progress bars are updated after each byte. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% on both. Then, after the first byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. So the initial 0% is a valid moment. So we need to check if 0 is present. But in our simulation, when x=0, it's not part of the loop. So how do we account for that?\n\nSo the initial moment (before any bytes are copied) is a valid moment where both are 0. So we should include 0% in the answer if it's present. However, in the simulation steps, for each byte x in the files, we check after each byte. But the initial 0% is not captured by any of those steps. Therefore, we need to check that 0 is added to the set if it's a valid value.\n\nWait, but in the example given in the first input, the output includes 0 and 100. For example, the first test case input is 1 and 6. The output is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. So in that case, when the first byte is copied, the current progress is 100*1/6 = 16.666..., which is floored to 16. The total progress is 100*(1)/6 = 16.666... floored to 16. So that's why 16 is present. But the initial 0 is present, so the output includes 0. So how do we capture that?\n\nTherefore, the initial 0 is a valid moment, and we need to check for that. Similarly, after all bytes are copied, the progress bars are both 100. So that's another moment. But how do we capture that?\n\nWait, for the last byte of the last file, after it's copied, the total progress is 100. So when x is a_i (the last byte of the last file), the total progress is 100. So during the simulation, when processing that byte, the total progress will be 100. So the code would capture that. But the initial 0 is not captured by any of the steps. So we need to add 0% to the set if it's present. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial state is considered as a moment where both are 0. So we can add 0 to the set initially. Then, for all the other steps, check for equality.\n\nBut then, what about the final 100%? Because when the last byte is copied, the total progress is 100. So during the simulation, for that byte, the total progress will be 100, and the current progress is 100. So the code would capture that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize a set to collect all valid percentages.\n\n- Add 0 to the set (since initial state is 0 for both).\n\n- Then, for each file, for each byte x (from 1 to a_i), compute the current progress and total progress, and if they are equal, add to the set.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the progress bars are updated after each byte. So for the initial state, before any bytes are copied, the bars are 0. Then, after each byte, they are updated. So the initial 0 is a valid moment. However, during the simulation, when x is 1, 2, etc., the progress is computed after that byte is copied. So the initial 0 is not covered by the simulation steps. Therefore, we need to include 0 in the set.\n\nBut how about the 100%? When the last byte is copied, the progress bars show 100% for both. So during the simulation, for that byte, the code would check if current progress and total progress are equal. Which they are. So 100 will be added to the set. However, in the first example, the output includes 0 and 100. So adding 0 initially and then checking during simulation would capture all cases.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nThen, for each file, for each byte x in 1..a_i:\n\nCompute current progress (for current file) and total progress (for total). If equal, add to the set.\n\nBut wait, the initial 0 is added, but what about other moments where both progress bars are 0? For example, if during the copying of a file, the current progress is 0 and the total progress is 0. But that's only possible if the sum of previous files plus x is less than total_sum. But for example, when the first byte is copied, the total progress is 100 * (x) / total_sum. So if the total_sum is large, that could be 0. So during the simulation steps, we might have cases where both progress bars are 0. But in that case, adding 0 to the set is already done. But the initial 0 is already added. So the code would capture that.\n\nBut maybe the initial 0 is not the only moment when both are 0. For example, during the copying of the first byte, if the total progress is 0 (say, total_sum is 1000, and the first byte is 1, then 100 * 1 / 1000 is 0.1, floored to 0). And the current progress is 100 * 1 / a_1. Suppose a_1 is 100, then 1/100 is 1% (so current progress is 1, which is not 0. But if a_1 is 1000, then current progress is 0. So both bars would be 0. So this would be another moment where both are 0. So in this case, the code would add 0 again, but since it's a set, duplicates don't matter.\n\nSo the initial approach is to add 0 to the set, and then simulate all the steps, adding any percentage that occurs when both bars are equal. Then, after processing all steps, we can collect all the numbers in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut how to compute the total progress? Let's think about variables:\n\nWe can precompute the total_sum = sum(a).\n\nFor each file i (starting from 0 to n-1):\n\nsum_prev = sum of a[0] ... a[i-1]\n\nfor x in 1 to a[i]:\n\ncurrent progress is floor(100 * x / a[i])\n\ntotal progress is floor( 100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum )\n\nSo for each x in each file, compute those two values and check for equality.\n\nBut how to compute sum_prev?\n\nWe can precompute the prefix sums. For example, prefix_sum[i] is the sum of a[0] ... a[i-1]. So for file i, sum_prev is prefix_sum[i].\n\nSo for example, for the first file (i=0), sum_prev is 0. For the second file (i=1), sum_prev is a[0], etc.\n\nSo let's proceed.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n, then list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a)\n\nCompute prefix_sums: for example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc.\n\nThen, for each file index i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\nfile_size = a[i]\n\nfor x in 1 to file_size:\n\ncurrent_progress = (100 * x) // file_size\n\ntotal_bytes_copied = sum_prev + x\n\ntotal_progress = (100 * total_bytes_copied) // total_sum\n\nif current_progress == total_progress:\n\nadd to the set.\n\nAlso, after all that, we need to check if 100 is present. Because when the last byte is copied, the total progress is 100. But during the simulation, for that x, the code would compute total_progress as (100 * total_bytes_copied) // total_sum. Since total_bytes_copied is sum_prev + x, which is the total_sum. So 100 * total_sum / total_sum is 100. So yes, that will be captured.\n\nBut what about the initial 0? For example, in the first test case, the initial 0 is added. But during the simulation, when x is 1, the current progress is 100*1//6 = 16, and the total progress is 100*1//6 = 16. So that's added. So the set contains 0 and 16, etc.\n\nSo the code would collect all the required values.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input is n=1, a = [6]. total_sum =6.\n\nprefix_sums is [0].\n\nfor i=0, sum_prev = 0, file_size=6.\n\nx runs from 1 to 6.\n\nfor x=1: current progress 100*1//6 = 16, total progress 100*(0+1)/6 = 16. So added.\n\nSimilarly for x=2: 200//6=33, 200//6=33. So added.\n\nSo all the steps for x=1 to 6 would generate the same values for both progress bars. So the set will contain 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100 (when x=6, 100*6//6=100, and total progress is 100*6//6=100).\n\nThus the output is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWhich matches the first example.\n\nAnother sample input is n=2, a=[100,500]. total_sum is 600.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 100].\n\nFor the first file (i=0, sum_prev=0, file_size=100).\n\nx ranges from 1 to 100.\n\ncurrent_progress is (100x)/100 = x. So for x=1, current progress is 1. Total progress is (100 * (0 + x)) / 600 = (x*100)/600 = x/6. So for x=1, 1/6 = 0.166..., floored to 0. So current progress is 1, total is 0. Not equal. So no addition here.\n\nBut for x=6, current progress is 6. total progress is (6 * 100)/600 = 1. So 6 != 1. No.\n\nBut when x=600? Wait, no, because the first file is 100 bytes. So for x=100, current progress is 100*100/100 = 100. total progress is (100 * (0 + 100 )) / 600 = 100*100 / 600 = 10000 / 600 = 16.666..., floored to 16. So current progress is 100, total is 16. Not equal. So during the first file, the current progress is higher than the total progress. But during the first file, the total progress is (sum_prev + x) / total_sum * 100. So for x=100, sum_prev +x is 100. total is 100*100 / 600 = 16.666... → 16. So during the first file, the current progress is from 1% to 100%, while the total progress is from 0.166... (floored to 0) up to 16.666 (floored to 16). So during this phase, there may be some x where current progress and total progress are equal. But according to the sample output, in the second test case, the output includes 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. So perhaps during the second file.\n\nSo during the second file, sum_prev is 100 (prefix_sums[1] = 100). The second file is 500 bytes. So for each x in 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent progress is (100*x)/500 = 0.2x. Floored.\n\ntotal progress is (100*(100 + x))/600 = (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nSo when x is 500, the total progress is (100 * (100 + 500 )) / 600 = 600*100 /600 = 100. Current progress is 100*500/500 = 100. So both are 100. So that's added.\n\nBut what about during the second file. Let's say when x is 499. The total bytes copied is 100 + 499 = 599. total progress is (599 * 100) // 600 = 59900 // 600 = 99.833... → 99. Current progress is (499 * 100)/500 = 99.8 → 99. So both are 99. So that's added. So 99 is in the set.\n\nSimilarly, when x is 500, both are 100. So the sample output includes 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. How?\n\nBut the sample output for the second input is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. So how does 95 come into play?\n\nLet me think. For example, during the second file, when the total progress is 95, what x would make that?\n\ntotal progress is floor(100*(100 + x)/600) = 95.\n\nSo 100*(100 + x)/600 >=95 and <96.\n\nMultiply all by 600:\n\n100*(100 +x) >= 95 * 600 → 100 +x >= 570 → x >= 470.\n\nand 100*(100 +x) < 96 * 600 → 100 +x < 576 → x < 476.\n\nSo x can be from 470 to 475 (since x is integer). For these x, the total progress is 95.\n\nAt the same time, the current progress is floor(100 * x / 500) = floor(0.2x).\n\nSo for x in 470-475:\n\nx=470 → 0.2 * 470 = 94 → floor 94. Which is not 95. So not equal.\n\nWait, but the total progress is 95. So for current progress to be 95, 0.2x must be >=95 and <96. So x must be >= 95 * 500 /100 = 475, and < 96 * 500 /100 = 480. So x is 475, 476, 477, 478, 479.\n\nSo for x=475, current progress is 0.2 * 475 = 95 → floor 95. And the total progress is 95. So this is a match. So during x=475, the current progress is 95 and total progress is 95. So that's added. Similarly for x=476, current progress is 0.2*476=95.2 → floor 95. Total progress is 95. So that's another match. Same for x=477, 478, 479. So for these x values, the current progress is 95 and the total progress is 95. So 95 is added to the set.\n\nSo that's how 95 comes into play. So during the second file, when x is between 475 and 479, the current progress is 95, and the total progress is 95. Hence, 95 is added.\n\nSo the code will capture that.\n\nThus, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n from input. Then read the list of a's.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums. For example, prefix_sums is a list where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. So for i in 0 to n, prefix_sums[i] = sum of first i elements.\n\nBut in code, we can compute prefix_sums as follows:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nOnce that's done, for each file i (from 0 to n-1), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i], and the file size is a[i].\n\nThen, for x in 1 to a[i], compute current_progress and total_progress.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nInitialize a set called result = set()\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    file_size = a[i]\n\n    for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_p == total_p:\n\n            result.add(current_p)\n\nOnce all that is done, collect the elements of the set, sort them, and print them separated by newlines.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the total_sum is zero? Well, the problem says that a_i >= 1, so sum is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nNow, testing the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nprefix_sums is [0,6]\n\nfor i=0, sum_prev = 0, file_size=6.\n\nx from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x)//6.\n\ntotal_bytes = 0 +x =x. total_p is (100x)//6.\n\nSo current_p == total_p. So all x's will add their respective values. So the set will have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100 (for x=6, (100*6)//6 = 100).\n\nSo the output is sorted as 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nWhich matches the first example.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nn=2, a=[100,500]\n\ntotal_sum = 600.\n\nprefix_sums = [0, 100, 600].\n\nFor the first file (i=0, sum_prev=0, file_size=100):\n\nfor x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_p = (100x)/100 = x.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(0 +x )) // 600 = (100x) // 600 = x//6.\n\nSo when is x == x//6? Only when x//6 is equal to x. Which is only possible if x is 0. But x starts from 1. So no matches here.\n\nThus, during the first file, nothing is added except possibly 0, which was added earlier.\n\nThen, for the second file (i=1, sum_prev=100, file_size=500):\n\nfor x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_p = (100x) // 500 = (x * 100) // 500 = x//5.\n\ntotal_bytes = 100 +x.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nSo we need to check when x//5 == (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nWhich is the case for some x's. For example, when x is 475:\n\nx//5 is 475//5 = 95.\n\ntotal_p is (100*(100 +475 )) // 600 = (100 * 575) // 600 = 57500 // 600 = 95.833... → 95. So yes, 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x=476, x//5 is 95.2 → 95. total_p is (100*(576))//600 = 57600//600 = 96. So 95 vs 96. Not equal. Wait, no. Wait:\n\nWait for x=476:\n\ntotal_bytes = 100 +476 = 576.\n\ntotal_p = (100 * 576) // 600 = 57600 // 600 = 96. So 96. But current_p is 476//5 = 95.2 → 95. So 95 != 96. So not added.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis said that for x between 475 and 479, current_p is 95. Let me recheck:\n\nx=475: 475 /5 is 95.0 → 95.\n\nx=476: 476/5 is 95.2 → floor is 95.\n\nx=479: 479/5 = 95.8 → 95.\n\nSo for x in 475 to 479, current_p is 95.\n\ntotal_p for x=475 is 575 * 100 /600 = 57500 /600 = 95.833... → 95.\n\nfor x=476: 576 * 100 /600 = 57600/600 = 96 → 96. So total_p is 96.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier analysis. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate:\n\ntotal_bytes = 100 +x.\n\ntotal_p is floor( (100 * total_bytes) / total_sum )\n\ntotal_sum is 600.\n\nSo for x=475:\n\ntotal_bytes = 100 +475 = 575.\n\n100*575 = 57500. Divided by 600 → 57500 / 600 = 95.8333... → floor 95.\n\ncurrent_p is (100 * x) // 500 → (100 * 475) // 500 = 47500 // 500 = 95. So yes, 95 equals 95. So added.\n\nFor x=476: total_bytes = 576 → 57600 / 600 = 96. So total_p is 96. current_p is (100 * 476) // 500 → 47600 /500 = 95.2 → 95. So 95 != 96 → no addition.\n\nSo why did I think earlier that x=475-479 would have total_p 95? That was a mistake.\n\nSo how does 95 get added? Only for x=475.\n\nWait, but then in the sample output for the second test case, 95 is present. So what's happening?\n\nLet me check the sample input for the second test case:\n\nThe input is '2\\n100 500', and the output is '0\\n95\\n96\\n97\\n98\\n99\\n100'.\n\nSo how do 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 get into the set?\n\nLet me think again. Maybe during the second file, there are multiple x values where current_p equals total_p.\n\nLet me think for x=500:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * 500) //500 = 100.\n\ntotal_p = (100*(100 +500 )) // 600 = (600 * 100)/600 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nFor x=599 (but that's not possible, since the second file is 500 bytes. So x can't be more than 500.)\n\nWait, during the second file, the total_bytes is 100 + x, where x ranges from 1 to 500. So total_bytes ranges from 101 to 600.\n\nLet me consider for total_p = 95:\n\nWe have 95 ≤ (100 * total_bytes)/600 <96 → multiply by 600:\n\n95 * 600 ≤ 100 * total_bytes < 96 * 600 → 57000 ≤ 100 * total_bytes < 57600 → divide by 100:\n\n570 ≤ total_bytes < 576.\n\nBut total_bytes = 100 + x → 570 ≤ 100 +x <576 → 470 ≤x < 476 → x ranges from 470 to 475 inclusive (since x is integer).\n\nSo for x in 470 to 475:\n\ntotal_p is 95.\n\ncurrent_p is (100x) // 500 = (x * 100) // 500 = x//5.\n\nSo for x=470:\n\nx//5 = 470//5 = 94 → 94 !=95.\n\nx=471: 471//5 is 94.2 → 94.\n\nx=472: 94.4 →94.\n\nx=473: 94.6 →94.\n\nx=474: 94.8 →94.\n\nx=475: 475//5 = 95 → 95.\n\nSo only x=475 gives current_p=95, which equals total_p=95. So 95 is added.\n\nNow, for total_p=96:\n\nWe have 96 ≤ (100 * total_bytes)/600 <97 → multiply by 600:\n\n96*600 ≤ 100 * total_bytes < 97 * 600 → 57600 ≤ 100 total_bytes < 58200 → divide by 100:\n\n576 ≤ total_bytes < 582 → 100 +x >=576 → x >= 476. And x < 582 -100 = 482 → x < 482.\n\nSo x ranges from 476 to 481 (inclusive).\n\nIn this range, total_p is 96.\n\ncurrent_p for x in this range is x//5.\n\nFor x=476: 476//5=95.2 → 95. Not equal to 96.\n\nx=477 → 95.4 →95. No.\n\nx=478 → 95.6 →95. No.\n\nx=479 → 95.8 →95. No.\n\nx=480 → 480//5 = 96. So current_p is 96. total_p is 96. So added.\n\nx=480 is in the range 476-481. So for x=480, current_p is 96, total_p is 96. So 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x=481, current_p is 481//5 = 96.2 → 96. total_p is 96. So added.\n\nSo for x=480 and 481, current_p is 96, total_p is 96. So 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for total_p=97:\n\nWe need 97 ≤ (100 * total_bytes)/600 <98 → 97*600 ≤ 100 * total_bytes < 98*600 → 58200 ≤ 100 total_bytes < 58800 → total_bytes >= 582 and <588 → 100 +x >=582 → x >=482. And x < 588 -100 = 488. So x ranges from 482 to 487 inclusive.\n\ncurrent_p for x in 482-487:\n\nx=482: 482//5 = 96.4 →96. total_p is 97. Not equal.\n\nx=485: 485//5 = 97. So for x=485, current_p is 97. total_p is 97. So added.\n\nx=485 is in the range 482-487.\n\nx=485: total_bytes = 100 +485 = 585 → 100*585 /600 = 58500 /600 = 97.5 → floor 97. So yes, total_p is 97. current_p is 485//5=97. So added.\n\nSimilarly, x=486: current_p is 486//5 = 97.2 →97. total_p is (100*(100+486))/600 = 58600/600 = 97.666..., floor 97. So current_p and total_p are 97. So added.\n\nx=487: same as x=486. current_p is 487//5=97.4 →97. total_p is 58700/600 = 97.833... →97. So added.\n\nSo for x=485, 486, 487: current_p is 97, total_p is 97. So 97 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for total_p=98:\n\nrange is 98*600 ≤ 100 total_bytes <99*600 → 58800 ≤ 100 total_bytes < 59400 → total_bytes >=588, <594 → 100 +x >=588 → x >=488, and x < 594-100=494. So x ranges from 488 to 493.\n\ncurrent_p for x in this range is x//5.\n\nLooking for x where x//5 = 98 → x >= 98*5=490, and x < 99*5=495. So x ranges 490-494.\n\nSo for x=490, 491, 492, 493, 494:\n\ncurrent_p is 98. total_p is (100*(100 +x ))//600.\n\nFor x=490: total_bytes is 590 → 100*590 /600 = 59000/600 = 98.333... →98. So current_p is 98, total_p is 98. So added.\n\nSame for x=491: 591 → 59100/600 = 98.5 →98. current_p is 491//5 = 98.2 →98. So added.\n\nSame for x=492, 493, 494.\n\nSo 98 is added.\n\nSimilarly for total_p=99:\n\nrange is 99*600 ≤ 100 total_bytes < 100*60",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. The progress bars update after each byte is copied, and both percentages are floored to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Total Sum Calculation**: Compute the total size of all files combined to determine the overall progress.\n3. **Prefix Sums**: Calculate prefix sums to efficiently determine the cumulative size of files processed before the current one.\n4. **Progress Simulation**: For each byte copied in each file, compute both the current file progress and the total progress. Check if these values are equal and collect such values.\n5. **Edge Cases**: Ensure the initial state (0%) and final state (100%) are considered.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n    \n    result = set()\n    result.add(0)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n        file_size = a[i]\n        for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n            current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n            total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n            total_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n            if current_p == total_p:\n                result.add(current_p)\n    \n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    print('\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Total Sum Calculation**: The total size of all files is computed to determine the overall progress percentage.\n3. **Prefix Sums**: These help in quickly determining the cumulative size of files processed before the current file, which is essential for calculating the total progress.\n4. **Simulation Loop**: For each byte copied in each file, the current progress (for the current file) and the total progress (across all files) are calculated. If these values match, they are added to the result set.\n5. **Edge Cases Handling**: The initial state (0%) is explicitly added to the result set as it is a valid moment when both progress bars show 0%.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible moments when both progress bars show the same value are captured efficiently, even considering the constraints and edge cases.",
