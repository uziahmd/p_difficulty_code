Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, so a standard knapsack approach would be too slow here because for n=1e5 and m=3e5, the O(nm) solution would be way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can handle each weight category separately. For example, for items of weight 1, we can take as many as possible (sorted by cost descending), same for weight 2 and 3. But how do we combine them optimally?\n\nWait, but there's a possibility that taking some combination of items with different weights gives a better total than just taking the highest value items in each category. For example, maybe a weight 3 item with high cost is better than two weight 2 items, but maybe not. So how do we balance that?\n\nLet me think about grouping the items by their weight. For each weight, sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight group, compute prefix sums. That way, for any number of items taken from that group, we can quickly get the total cost.\n\nOnce we have the prefix sums for each weight group, the problem becomes how to choose how many items to take from each group such that the total weight is <= m, and the sum of costs is maximized.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find this combination? Let's consider the following approach:\n\nFor each possible number of weight 3 items taken, say k, then compute how many weight 2 and 1 items can be taken with the remaining weight. But even that might be computationally intensive if done naively.\n\nAlternatively, since the weights are small (1,2,3), perhaps we can iterate through possible numbers of weight 3 items and then for each, compute the optimal selection of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut considering that m can be up to 3e5, and for each possible number of weight 3 items (say up to m//3), this could be manageable if the inner steps are optimized.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups: w1, w2, w3.\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost, and compute prefix sums for each group.\n   - For example, for w1, the prefix sum array will have the sum of the first i items, which allows us to know the maximum cost if we take i items of weight 1.\n3. Then, for each possible number of weight 3 items (let's call it x), we can calculate the remaining weight (m - 3x). Then, we need to select the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items with that remaining weight.\n\nBut how to find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items given a certain capacity?\n\nFor that, perhaps we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, but that's not feasible. Alternatively, for each possible x (number of weight 3 items), we can compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items with capacity rem = m - 3x.\n\nBut how to compute that quickly?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a certain rem capacity. Let's say we can take y items of weight 2 and z items of weight 1, such that 2y + z ≤ rem. How to maximize the sum of the prefix sums of w2 and w1.\n\nBut since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, we can precompute their prefix sums.\n\nSo for the weight 2 items, let's say we take a certain number of them. For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (say, a), the remaining capacity is rem - 2a. Then, the maximum number of weight 1 items is min( (rem - 2a), len(w1) ). But since the prefix sums are sorted, taking as many as possible is optimal.\n\nBut trying all possible a for each x would be O(n) per x, which could be expensive.\n\nBut perhaps, for each possible rem, the optimal combination of weight 2 and 1 items can be found by considering all possible numbers of weight 2 items (up to min( len(w2), rem//2 )) and then taking the maximum possible weight 1 items. However, even that could be O(m) time for each x, leading to O(m^2) time overall, which is not acceptable.\n\nHmm. Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's consider that for a given rem, the maximum value from combining weight 1 and 2 items is the maximum over all possible splits between the two.\n\nSuppose we have for weight 2 items, their prefix sum array is s2, and for weight 1 items, their prefix sum array is s1.\n\nFor a given rem, the maximum value is the maximum of s2[a] + s1[rem - 2a], for all a where 2a ≤ rem and a is within the number of available weight 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for a given rem?\n\nThe problem is that for each possible a, we can compute this, but the number of a's is up to rem//2, which for m=3e5 could be up to 1.5e5 per x. If x ranges up to m//3, which is 1e5, then this would be O(1.5e5 * 1e5) operations, which is 1.5e10 — way too slow.\n\nThis approach is not feasible. So, we need a better idea.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can use a dynamic programming approach that takes advantage of this.\n\nBut even then, for n=1e5 and m=3e5, the standard DP approach would be O(nm) which is 3e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nSo, back to the previous idea. Maybe for the weight 2 and 1 items, we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value possible using only those items.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have for weight 1 and 2 items, and we want to find the maximum value for a given capacity. How can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me consider that for the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value can be computed with a modified knapsack approach. However, since the items are sorted and we can take as many as possible, maybe we can find an optimal way.\n\nLet me think again. For the weight 1 items, the best is to take as many as possible (since they have the highest value per unit weight?), but no, not necessarily. Because maybe a weight 2 item with higher value per weight is better than two weight 1 items. But since the items are sorted in descending order of cost, for each group, the prefix sum is the maximum possible for taking that number of items.\n\nSo for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps the optimal way is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill the remaining with weight 1 items. Or take some combination of both.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible number of weight 2 items (say, a), then the maximum number of weight 1 items is b = (rem - 2a). But since a can be up to min( len(w2), rem//2 ), and for each a, we can compute the sum s2[a] + s1[b], but how to find the maximum of this over all a?\n\nBut if we can find the optimal a quickly, that would help.\n\nLet me think about the possible a values. For a given rem, the maximum possible a is min(len(w2), rem // 2). Let's denote this as max_a.\n\nNow, for a in [0, max_a], the value is s2[a] + s1[rem - 2a]. But since rem - 2a can't be negative, and also can't exceed the number of weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find the maximum of this function?\n\nLet me consider that for a given rem, the optimal a is somewhere around (rem / 2) - but how?\n\nAlternatively, since the prefix sums are non-decreasing (because each item is added with positive cost), then the function s2[a] + s1[rem - 2a] may have some properties that allow us to find the maximum quickly.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose rem is 5. For a=0, we can take 5 weight 1 items. For a=1, 2*1=2, rem-2=3, so take 3 weight 1 items. For a=2, rem-4=1, take 1 weight 1. For a=2, that's 2*2=4, but rem is 5, so 5-4=1. So the sum is s2[2] + s1[1].\n\nBut what's the optimal a here? It depends on the actual values in the prefix arrays.\n\nBut perhaps for each possible rem, the optimal a is either floor( (rem)/2 ) or ceil( (rem)/2 ), or something similar. But I don't think that's guaranteed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible rem, we can check a few candidates around the optimal a. But how?\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for the weight 2 and 1 items, a combined array for each possible capacity. But how?\n\nAnother idea: since the weight 1 items can be taken in any quantity (up to their count), and the weight 2 items can be taken up to their count, for a given capacity, the optimal is to take as many as possible of the higher value per unit weight items.\n\nBut how to compare the two?\n\nLet me think: for the weight 2 items, each item contributes c_i per 2 units of weight. For weight 1 items, it's c_j per 1 unit. So if the average value per unit weight of weight 2 items is higher than that of weight 1, then we should take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill the remaining with weight 1. Otherwise, take as many weight 1 items as possible, and then fill with weight 2.\n\nBut this is assuming that the items are sorted in descending order of value per unit weight. Which they are not. However, since we have sorted the items in each group by their cost, not by value per unit weight, this approach may not work.\n\nWait, but for the weight 1 items, taking the top k items gives the maximum possible sum for k items. Similarly for weight 2 items. So when combining them, the optimal choice depends on the combination.\n\nBut perhaps, for each possible rem, the optimal is to take some a weight 2 items and then the rest with weight 1 items, but how to find the best a quickly.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible rem, the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items can be found by checking all possible a in the range [max(0, (rem - len_1))//2 ] ... something like that. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think that for the weight 2 items, the prefix sum array is s2, and for the weight 1 items, it's s1. Let's suppose that for a given rem, the maximum a is min(len_2, rem//2). Then, the maximum a is up to say, 1e5 (if len_2 is large). But for each possible x (number of weight 3 items), and for each possible rem, we can't afford to loop through all possible a.\n\nBut perhaps, for each possible x (number of weight 3 items), the rem is m - 3x. Then, for this rem, we can compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items by considering all possible a up to min( len_2, rem//2 ), but how to optimize this.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible x? Since m can be up to 3e5, x can be up to m//3, which is up to 1e5. And for each x, the rem can be up to m, which is 3e5. So, for each x, the a can be up to rem//2, which for rem=3e5 is 1.5e5. So the total number of operations would be O(1e5 * 1.5e5) = 1.5e10. Which is way too big for Python to handle in reasonable time.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible. Need another idea.\n\nAlternative approach: since the weight is small, maybe we can precompute for all possible numbers of weight 3 items, and for each, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. Let's separate the problem into three parts:\n\n- All items of weight 1, 2, 3.\n\nWe can process each group:\n\nFor weight 1 items, take as many as possible (sorted descending, take the first k items).\n\nSame for weight 2 and 3.\n\nBut the problem is when combining different groups.\n\nLet me think about the following:\n\nThe maximum total cost is the maximum of:\n\n- All possible combinations of taking x weight 3 items, y weight 2 items, and z weight 1 items, such that 3x + 2y + z <= m.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: since weight 3 items are the heaviest, perhaps we can iterate over the possible number of weight 3 items taken. For each x, we can take up to x_max = min( len(w3), m//3 ). For each x, the remaining weight is rem = m - 3x. Then, we need to find the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items with capacity rem.\n\nNow, the key is how to compute this maximum value for the weight 1 and 2 items quickly.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the weight 1 and 2 items. Let's assume that we have sorted them and have their prefix sums.\n\nLet me denote the maximum number of weight 2 items as a, and the maximum number of weight 1 items as b, such that 2a + b <= rem.\n\nBut since we want to maximize the sum of the prefix sums of weight 2 and weight 1 items, perhaps we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of it as a knapsack problem with two types of items. However, with the items sorted in descending order, and the prefix sums, maybe we can find a way to compute this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, we can compute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value achievable using these items.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nLet’s say we have the prefix sums for weight 1 (s1) and for weight 2 (s2). The length of s1 is len1, and the length of s2 is len2.\n\nFor a given capacity rem, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible a (number of weight 2 items) such that 2a ≤ rem, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (b = rem - 2a, but not exceeding len1).\n\nSo, for each a in 0 to min(len2, rem//2), the value is s2[a] + s1[ min(b, len1) ].\n\nBut again, for each x, this would take O(rem//2) time, which is too slow.\n\nBut perhaps, we can precompute for all possible capacities the best a.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible capacity rem, the optimal a is either floor(rem/2) or something close. Let's think about the following:\n\nIf we take as many weight 2 items as possible (a = min(len2, rem//2)), and then fill the remaining with weight 1 items. But this may not be optimal. For example, if rem is 5, and taking 2 weight 2 items (using 4 weight) leaves 1 for weight 1. But maybe taking one weight 2 item and then 3 weight 1 items gives a better total.\n\nSo, the optimal a may be around rem//2, but perhaps we can check a few possibilities around that.\n\nBut how many possibilities do we need to check?\n\nLet me think. For each possible rem, the optimal a is between max(0, a_opt - k) and min(a_opt +k), where a_opt is the maximum possible a (rem//2), and k is a small number (like 100). This way, for each rem, we check O(1) possibilities.\n\nBut how to choose k? Well, since the weight 2 items are sorted, and the weight 1 items are sorted, the optimal a is likely near the maximum possible a, or near the a that uses up the entire capacity. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the cost of the weight 2 items is sorted in descending order, and the same for weight 1, the optimal a is such that the marginal value of adding a weight 2 item is higher than the marginal value of adding two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, for a given rem, the optimal a is the one that maximizes s2[a] + s1[rem - 2a]. Since s2 and s1 are prefix sums, they are non-decreasing. So for a given rem, the function f(a) = s2[a] + s1[rem - 2a] may have a single peak, which can be found with ternary search.\n\nBut since a is an integer between 0 and a_max, and the function f(a) is unimodal (increasing then decreasing, or vice versa), ternary search could be applied. But I'm not sure if it's unimodal.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose rem is 5. Let's imagine that s2[a] increases with a, and s1[b] increases with b. For a=0, b=5, sum is s2[0]+s1[5]. For a=1, sum is s2[1] + s1[3]. For a=2, sum is s2[2] + s1[1]. Now, depending on the actual values, the function could increase and then decrease, or other patterns. But it's not clear if it's unimodal.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the function is unimodal, then ternary search could be used. But even if it's not, perhaps checking a few candidates around the maximum possible a could be sufficient.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 and 1 items are sorted in descending order, the optimal a for a given rem is either the maximum possible a (i.e., a_max = min(len2, rem//2)), or a_max -1, or a_max-2, etc., up to some limit. Because taking more weight 2 items may give higher values, but sometimes it's better to take fewer and replace with more weight 1 items.\n\nBut how many possibilities do we need to check? Let's say for each rem, we check a_max, a_max-1, a_max-2, ..., down to max(0, a_max - 100). Similarly, check a_max+1 (but that's not possible since a_max is the maximum). So for each rem, we check up to 100 possibilities. Since 100 is small, this would make the total time acceptable.\n\nBut why would this work? Because the optimal a is likely to be near the maximum possible a. But this is an assumption that may not hold in all cases, but perhaps in practice, it's sufficient.\n\nBut what if there's a case where the optimal a is far away from a_max?\n\nFor example, if the weight 2 items are very low value compared to weight 1 items. Like, suppose all weight 2 items have cost 1, and the weight 1 items have cost 100. Then, for rem=5, the best is to take 5 weight 1 items (a=0), which is far from a_max (which is 2 for rem=5). So checking only a few possibilities near a_max would miss this case.\n\nThus, this approach would not work in general.\n\nAlternative idea: precompute for the weight 1 and 2 items, for all possible capacities, the maximum value. How?\n\nLet me think of the following. Since the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, the maximum value for any capacity is the sum of the first k items, where k is the minimum between the capacity and the number of weight 1 items. Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\nBut combining them is tricky.\n\nWait, but for a given capacity rem, the maximum value can be found by considering all possible ways to split rem into 2a + b, where a is the number of weight 2 items and b is the number of weight 1 items. And then take the maximum of s2[a] + s1[b].\n\nBut since the maximum a for a given rem is min(len2, rem//2), and for each a, b is rem - 2a, but cannot exceed len1.\n\nSo, for a given rem, the maximum value is the maximum of s2[a] + s1[ min( rem - 2a, len1 ) ] for all a in [0, a_max].\n\nBut how to compute this quickly?\n\nLet me think of the following: for each possible rem, we can compute the best a in O(1) time using preprocessed data.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, and their prefix sums are non-decreasing, the function f(a) = s2[a] + s1[ min(rem - 2a, len1) ] is not necessarily monotonic, but for a fixed rem, it's possible to find the optimal a by checking all a in the range [max(0, a_max - k), a_max], where k is the number of weight 1 items that could be taken in place of weight 2 items.\n\nBut again, this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking more of them is better. So, for a given rem, the optimal a is such that the remaining weight after taking 2a is filled with as many weight 1 items as possible. But the question is whether taking more weight 2 items is better than taking fewer and filling with weight 1 items.\n\nBut since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, the first a items are the best ones. Similarly for weight 1.\n\nSo, for a given rem, the best a is the one that balances the value of the weight 2 items and the value of the weight 1 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe we can precompute for the weight 2 items and the weight 1 items, the best combination for all possible capacities.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nLet’s create a new array for the weight 1 and 2 items. For each possible capacity up to m, compute the maximum value that can be achieved with weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nHow to compute this?\n\nLet’s denote dp[i] as the maximum value for capacity i using weight 1 and 2 items. But how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut since the items are grouped, perhaps we can compute this with a modified knapsack approach.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, since they are sorted, we can take as many as possible. So for each capacity, the maximum value for weight 1 items is s1[min(capacity, len1)].\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 items, it's s2[min(capacity//2, len2)].\n\nBut combining them is not straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps, for a given capacity, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Take as many weight 1 items as possible, and then the remaining capacity is zero.\n\n- Take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill the remaining with weight 1 items.\n\n- Or, take some combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to find this combination.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for all possible capacities, the maximum value using weight 1 and 2 items, by iterating through the weight 2 items and updating the dp array.\n\nBut with m up to 3e5, and n up to 1e5, this might be feasible.\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize dp as an array of size m+1, where dp[i] is the maximum value for capacity i.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0.\n\nFor each weight 2 item (sorted in descending order), we can update the dp array by considering adding this item. However, since there are multiple items, this would be similar to the unbounded knapsack problem. But since we have a limited number of items (each can be taken once), it's the 0-1 knapsack problem. However, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, this would be O(nm) time, which is not feasible.\n\nBut wait, the weight 2 items are already sorted in descending order. So perhaps we can take them greedily. But no, because greedy doesn't work for the 0-1 knapsack.\n\nBut since we have to take items in the optimal way, perhaps this approach isn't feasible.\n\nBack to the original problem.\n\nLet me think again: since the weight of the items is small, maybe we can find for each possible number of weight 3 items, and then for the remaining capacity, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items using a precomputed array.\n\nBut how to precompute that array.\n\nLet me think: for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value using those items.\n\nLet me try to think of this as a knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2, but with the items sorted and taken in a way that allows for efficient computation.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: since the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, the best way to take them is to take as many as possible. Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\nSo, for any capacity, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many weight 2 items as possible and then fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n\n- Taking as many weight 1 items as possible and then fill the rest with weight 2 items.\n\nBut this may not be optimal, but perhaps it's a good approximation.\n\nAlternatively, for each capacity, we can compute the maximum between taking a certain number of weight 2 items and the rest weight 1 items, and the maximum between taking a certain number of weight 1 items and the rest weight 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nFor a given capacity rem, the best a is between 0 and a_max = min(len2, rem//2). For each a in this range, the value is s2[a] + s1[rem - 2a]. To find the maximum of this expression, perhaps we can find the a that maximizes this sum.\n\nBut how to find this quickly.\n\nLet me consider that for each a, the term rem - 2a is the remaining capacity for weight 1 items. Let's denote this as b = rem - 2a. So the value is s2[a] + s1[min(b, len1)].\n\nNow, since s2 and s1 are non-decreasing, the function s2[a] + s1[b] is not necessarily monotonic. However, for a fixed rem, the value of b decreases as a increases. So, as a increases, the s2[a] increases (since we're adding more high-value items), but s1[b] decreases (since b decreases).\n\nThis suggests that the function may have a single peak, which can be found with binary search or ternary search.\n\nIf this is true, then for a given rem, we can perform a ternary search on a in [0, a_max] to find the maximum value.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\ns2 = [0, 5, 8, 10] (for a=0, 1, 2, 3)\ns1 = [0, 10, 19, 27, 34] (for b=0,1,2,3,4)\n\nrem = 5.\n\nPossible a values are 0, 1, 2 (since 2*2=4 <=5).\n\nFor a=0: b=5 → s1[4]=34 → total 0+34=34.\n\na=1: 2*1=2 → b=3 → s1[3]=27 → total 5+27=32.\n\na=2: 2*2=4 → b=1 → s1[1]=10 → total 8+10=18.\n\nSo the maximum is at a=0.\n\nIn this case, the function decreases as a increases, so it's monotonic decreasing. Hence, the maximum is at a=0.\n\nExample 2:\n\ns2 = [0, 3, 5, 6]\n\ns1 = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\nrem = 4.\n\na_max = 2 (since 2*2=4).\n\na=0: b=4 → s1[4] = 8 → total 0+8=8.\n\na=1: 2 → b=2 → s1[2]=4 → total 3+4=7.\n\na=2: 4 → b=0 → 5+0=5.\n\nAgain, decreasing.\n\nExample 3:\n\ns2 = [0, 5, 8, 10]\n\ns1 = [0, 10, 19, 27, 34]\n\nrem = 4.\n\na_max = 2 (2*2=4).\n\na=0: b=4 → 34 → total 34.\n\na=1: 2 → b=2 → s1[2]=19 → 5+19=24.\n\na=2: 4 → b=0 → 8+0=8.\n\nStill decreasing.\n\nAnother example where the function increases and then decreases.\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the function increases up to a certain point and then decreases.\n\nSuppose:\n\ns2 = [0, 1, 3, 4] (for a=0,1,2,3)\n\ns1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (for b=0,1,2,3,4,5)\n\nrem = 5.\n\na_max = 2 (2*2=4 <=5).\n\nCheck a=0: b=5 → s1[5]=5 → total 0+5=5.\n\na=1: 2*1=2 → b=3 → s1[3]=3 → 1+3=4.\n\na=2: 4 → b=1 → s1[1]=1 → 3+1=4.\n\nHmm, no increase. What if:\n\nrem = 6.\n\na_max = 3 (since 2*3=6).\n\na=0: b=6 → s1[6] = 5 (assuming len1 is 6). Wait, but in this example, s1 is up to 5. Let me adjust.\n\nLet me say s1 is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], with len1=6.\n\nrem=6.\n\na=0 → b=6 → 6 → total 6.\n\na=1 → 2 → b=6-2=4 → s1[4]=4 → total 1+4=5.\n\na=2 → 4 → b=2 → 2 → total 3+2=5.\n\na=3 → 6 → b=0 → 4+0=4.\n\nSo still decreasing.\n\nAnother example:\n\nLet's have s2 = [0, 2, 5, 6], and s1 = [0, 3, 6, 9, 12].\n\nrem = 5.\n\na_max = 2 (2*2=4 <=5).\n\nFor a=0: b=5 → s1[5] = 12 → total 0+12=12.\n\na=1: 2*1=2 → b=3 → s1[3]=9 → total 2+9=11.\n\na=2: 4 → b=1 → s1[1]=3 → 5+3=8.\n\nStill decreasing.\n\nIt seems hard to find a case where the function increases and then decreases. Perhaps the function is always non-increasing as a increases. If that is true, then for a given rem, the optimal a is 0, and we should take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nBut that can't be right, because there are cases where taking some weight 2 items gives a better result.\n\nWait, let's think of a case where taking one weight 2 item is better than taking two weight 1 items.\n\nFor example:\n\nweight 2 items: [5] (cost 5).\n\nweight 1 items: [2, 2] (two items, each cost 2).\n\nrem = 2.\n\nOption 1: take 0 weight 2 items, 2 weight 1 items: total 4.\n\nOption 2: take 1 weight 2 item: total 5.\n\nSo here, a=1 gives a better result.\n\nBut in this case, for rem=2, a_max is 1. So the function increases from a=0 to a=1.\n\nSo, the function increases here. So the function is not always decreasing. Hence, the previous examples were not covering this case.\n\nSo, how does this fit into the function?\n\nIn this case, for rem=2, the function for a=0 is s2[0] + s1[2] = 0 + (2+2) = 4.\n\nFor a=1: s2[1] + s1[0] = 5 + 0 = 5.\n\nSo the function increases as a increases from 0 to 1. Then, if a increases further, but there are no more a's (since a_max is 1), it stops.\n\nSo, in this case, the function is increasing.\n\nAnother example: rem=4, and weight 2 items [5, 4], weight 1 items [3, 3, 3].\n\nSo s2 = [0, 5, 9], s1 = [0, 3, 6, 9].\n\nFor a=0: b=4 → s1[3] =9 → total 9.\n\na=1: 2*1=2 → b=2 → s1[2]=6 → 5+6=11.\n\na=2: 4 → b=0 → 9 + 0 =9.\n\nSo the function increases from a=0 to a=1, then decreases from a=1 to a=2. Hence, it has a single peak at a=1.\n\nSo the function is unimodal in this case.\n\nThis suggests that the function f(a) = s2[a] + s1[rem - 2a] is unimodal, meaning it increases to a certain point and then decreases. If this is the case, then ternary search can be used to find the maximum value of f(a) for a given rem.\n\nSo, for a given rem, we can perform a ternary search on a in the range [0, a_max], and find the a that gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nWell, if the function is unimodal, then ternary search would work. But how to prove it?\n\nAssume that for a < a_opt, the function is increasing, and for a > a_opt, it is decreasing. This would imply that the function is unimodal.\n\nBut why would this be the case?\n\nBecause each additional weight 2 item adds a certain amount of value, while reducing the available space for weight 1 items. The trade-off between these two factors determines whether it's better to increase or decrease a.\n\nBut without a formal proof, it's risky to rely on this. However, given that in practical cases the function seems to be unimodal, perhaps we can proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each possible x (number of weight 3 items), compute rem = m - 3x. If rem < 0, skip. Else, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items with capacity rem using ternary search on a (number of weight 2 items). Then, the total value is the sum of the weight 3 items' value (s3[x]) plus this value.\n\nWe need to iterate x from 0 to x_max, where x_max is min(len3, m//3).\n\nNow, the steps are:\n\n1. Group the items by weight.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. Iterate x from 0 to x_max.\n\n   a. For each x, compute rem = m - 3x.\n\n   b. If rem < 0, skip.\n\n   c. Compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items with capacity rem.\n\n   d. Total value is s3[x] + this value.\n\n5. Take the maximum total value over all x.\n\nNow, the key part is step ",
