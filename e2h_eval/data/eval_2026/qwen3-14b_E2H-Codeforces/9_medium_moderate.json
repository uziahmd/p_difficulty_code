Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting souvenirs with maximum total cost without exceeding a weight limit. The constraints are that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. But each souvenir's weight is between 1 and 3. Hmm, so maybe there's a way to optimize based on the small weights.\n\nThe classic knapsack problem is O(nm), which for these numbers would be 1e5 * 3e5 = 3e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSince the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can group items by their weight and then find an optimal way to select them. Let's think about each weight category separately.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items: we can take as many as possible, but since they have different costs, we should take the ones with highest cost first. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nBut the problem is combining them optimally. For instance, sometimes it's better to take some weight 2 items instead of two weight 1 items, depending on their values.\n\nSo here's an idea: for each weight (1, 2, 3), sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight group, compute a prefix sum array. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each group, we can compute the total cost and weight, and find the maximum.\n\nBut how do we combine them efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have:\n\n- For weight 1: sorted list, prefix sums.\n- For weight 2: same.\n- For weight 3: same.\n\nThen, the total weight is w1*1 + w2*2 + w3*3 <= m.\n\nWe need to find the best combination of w1, w2, w3 such that this holds, and the sum of their prefix sums is maximized.\n\nBut even with that, trying all possible combinations would be O(n^3) which isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but for each weight group, the maximum number of items we can take is limited. For example, for weight 1, the maximum possible count is min( number of items in group 1, m ). But since m can be up to 3e5, and for each group, the number of items could be up to 1e5, but perhaps we can process them in a way that allows us to iterate through possible counts for two groups and compute the third.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is small (1,2,3), maybe we can loop through all possible numbers of weight 3 items, and for each, compute the best possible combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut even that might be manageable. Let's think:\n\nSuppose we have for weight 3, we can take up to k items. For each possible k (from 0 to max possible), we can calculate how much weight is left (m - 3*k), and then solve the problem for weight 1 and 2 items with that remaining weight.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving the 1 and 2 weight case for varying capacities. How can we do that efficiently?\n\nFor the 1 and 2 weight case, perhaps we can use the following approach:\n\nLet’s say we have a capacity W. We can take x items of weight 1 and y items of weight 2, such that x + 2y ≤ W. We want to maximize the sum of their values.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x and y quickly?\n\nLet me think. Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted in descending order, the optimal strategy is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. However, there's a trade-off between taking more weight 1 items and weight 2 items.\n\nFor example, if we have a certain amount of weight left, say W, we can try all possible numbers of weight 2 items (up to min( number of weight 2 items, W//2 )) and then take as many weight 1 items as possible for the remaining weight.\n\nBut even that could be O(W) for each k in the weight 3 loop, which would be expensive. However, since W can be up to m (which is 3e5), and for each k, this would be O(3e5), and k can be up to m//3 (which is up to 1e5), then total time is O( (m/3) * m ) = O(1e10) which is way too slow.\n\nSo that approach isn't going to work. Need something better.\n\nAlternative idea: for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible weight capacity up to m, the maximum value. But how?\n\nBut the problem is that for each weight 1 and 2 group, the maximum number of items is up to 1e5. However, the maximum capacity is 3e5. So maybe we can model this as a knapsack with items of weight 1 and 2, but using a dynamic programming approach optimized for these small weights.\n\nWait, but the standard knapsack approach for 0-1 knapsack is O(nm), but here n is 1e5, m is 3e5. Again, that's not feasible.\n\nBut since the items are grouped by weight, perhaps we can find an efficient way to compute the best selection for weight 1 and 2.\n\nLet me think again. For weight 1 items, we can take any number up to the count of items. Similarly for weight 2. Let's say we have sorted lists for weight 1 and 2.\n\nFor a given capacity W, what is the best combination of x and y?\n\nLet me think about the following approach: for each possible number of weight 2 items y, the maximum possible is min( len(weight2), W // 2 ), and then the remaining weight is W - 2*y, and take as many weight 1 items as possible (up to the count of weight 1 items, and up to the remaining weight). Then, for each y, we can compute the sum of the first y weight2 items and the first (W - 2y) weight1 items. Then take the maximum over all possible y.\n\nBut how many y's are there? For each W, the maximum possible y is up to W//2. For example, if W is 3e5, then W//2 is 1.5e5. So for each k in the weight3 loop, which could be up to 1e5, this would be O(1.5e5) per step. Which would be O(1.5e10) operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a better way to compute the maximum for weight 1 and 2 given a capacity W.\n\nAlternative approach: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute the prefix sums for each group. Let's say we have:\n\nsum1[i] = sum of first i weight 1 items.\n\nsum2[j] = sum of first j weight 2 items.\n\nThen, for a given capacity W, the optimal is to choose some j (number of weight 2 items) and then take i = min( W - 2j, len1 ), where len1 is the number of weight 1 items. Then the total is sum2[j] + sum1[ min( W - 2j, len1 ) ].\n\nBut how to find the optimal j quickly?\n\nThe question is, for a given W, what is the best j (number of weight 2 items) to take, such that 2j <= W, and then take as much as possible of weight 1 items.\n\nThe maximum j can be up to min( len2, W//2 ). For each j, we can compute the value as sum2[j] + sum1[ min( W - 2j, len1 ) ].\n\nBut trying all possible j for each W is O(W) time. Which is not feasible.\n\nBut maybe we can find the optimal j quickly. For example, since the sum2[j] increases with j (as items are sorted in descending order), and the sum1 term decreases as j increases (since W - 2j decreases). So the function is unimodal? Or not?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the best j, it's either the maximum possible j (i.e., take as many weight2 items as possible) or the j that allows taking as many weight1 items as possible. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight1 items are sorted in descending order, the best way to take them is as many as possible. So for each j, the maximum possible weight1 items is (W - 2j). But since the weight1 items are sorted, taking the first (W - 2j) of them gives maximum value.\n\nSo for a given W, the optimal j is the one that maximizes sum2[j] + sum1[ min( W - 2j, len1 ) ].\n\nBut how to find this j quickly?\n\nLet me think of the possible j's. For example, the optimal j could be around (W - k) / 2, where k is the number of weight1 items. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: for a fixed W, the maximum number of weight2 items is up to min( len2, W//2 ). Let's denote this maximum as J_max. For j from 0 to J_max, the value is sum2[j] + sum1[ min( W - 2j, len1 ) ].\n\nBut since sum2 is increasing and the sum1 part is decreasing as j increases, the total may have a single peak, allowing binary search. However, I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum2[j] is the sum of the top j weight2 items, and sum1[...] is the sum of the top (W-2j) weight1 items. Let me consider that when j increases by 1, the sum2 increases by the next weight2 item, and the sum1 decreases by the value of the weight1 item that is now excluded due to the reduced available weight.\n\nBut since the weight2 items are sorted in descending order, adding a new weight2 item is better than replacing some weight1 items. But how?\n\nWait, suppose I have W weight capacity. Let's say I take j weight2 items. Then, the weight used is 2j, and the remaining weight is W - 2j. Let's say that the number of weight1 items I can take is s = min( W - 2j, len1 ). So the total value is sum2[j] + sum1[s].\n\nNow, for each j, the value is determined by this. But how can we find the optimal j quickly?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each possible j, the optimal s is min( W - 2j, len1 ). So for j ranging from 0 to J_max.\n\nBut since W is up to 3e5, and for each j, the calculation is O(1), perhaps we can find the best j by considering all possible j in a certain range. However, even that would be O(W) per step, which is too slow.\n\nWait, but for the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps the optimal j is in the vicinity of (W - x)/2, where x is the number of weight1 items. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternative idea: for the weight1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value. How?\n\nLet me think. For each weight group, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, for a given capacity W, the maximum value is the maximum of all possible combinations of weight1 and weight2 items that fit into W.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly?\n\nAnother observation: since the weight1 items are sorted, and the weight2 items are sorted, for each possible number of weight2 items, we can compute the maximum number of weight1 items. However, perhaps we can find the optimal number of weight2 items by considering the following:\n\nFor each possible number of weight2 items, j, the optimal is to take as many weight1 items as possible. But since the weight1 items are sorted, taking the first (W - 2j) of them gives the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut how can we find the best j?\n\nLet me think of the following: for the given W, the optimal j is either the maximum possible j (so that 2j is as large as possible) or the j that allows taking as many weight1 items as possible.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal j can be found by trying all possible j in a small range around (W - k)/2, where k is the number of weight1 items.\n\nBut this seems vague.\n\nWait, perhaps for the weight1 and weight2 items, the maximum value can be computed by considering two cases:\n\nCase 1: Take as many weight2 items as possible, then fill the rest with weight1.\n\nCase 2: Take as many weight1 items as possible, then fill the rest with weight2.\n\nBut this may not cover all possibilities. However, perhaps the optimal solution is somewhere near these extremes.\n\nAlternatively, for the given W, we can try all possible j in the range [max(0, J_max - K), J_max], where K is a small number like 100. If the optimal j is within this range, then this would work. Otherwise, we might miss it. But how to determine K?\n\nBut considering that the weight1 and weight2 items are sorted, maybe the optimal j is either the maximum possible j, or the j that uses up all the weight (i.e., 2j + s = W, where s is the number of weight1 items taken). However, this is not necessarily true.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight2 items are more valuable per unit weight than weight1 items, but that depends on the individual items. For example, a weight2 item with value 3 is better than two weight1 items with value 1 each (total 2). So, if we have a weight2 item with higher value per unit weight, it's better to take those.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, the first few weight2 items are the most valuable. So, for a given W, the optimal j is likely to be somewhere around the maximum possible j that allows taking as many high-value weight2 items as possible.\n\nBut this line of thinking isn't leading me to a concrete solution.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Since the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can model the problem with dynamic programming, but optimized for the small weights.\n\nLet me think about the original problem again. The total weight is up to 3e5, and for each weight group, the items are sorted.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. Now, for each possible number of weight3 items (k), we can compute the remaining weight as rem = m - 3*k. If rem < 0, skip. Then, for rem, compute the maximum value from weight1 and weight2 items, which we'll call f(rem).\n\nThen, the answer is the maximum over all possible k of (prefix3[k] + f(rem)).\n\nThe key is how to compute f(rem) efficiently.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving the weight1 and weight2 case for a given rem.\n\nLet me focus on solving f(rem) for a given rem.\n\nLet me think of the following for f(rem):\n\nWe can take x items of weight1 and y items of weight2, such that x + 2y ≤ rem. We need to maximize the sum of the first x weight1 items and the first y weight2 items.\n\nHow can I compute this quickly?\n\nLet me consider that for a given rem, the maximum possible y is up to min(len2, rem//2). Let me denote this as Y_max.\n\nFor each y in 0 to Y_max, the maximum x is min(rem - 2y, len1). So the value is sum2[y] + sum1[x].\n\nBut trying all y from 0 to Y_max is O(Y_max) time. For rem up to 3e5, this is O(3e5) per call to f(rem). But if we have to call this for many k (each of which can be up to m//3, which is 1e5), then the total time becomes O(1e5 * 3e5) = 3e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nThis is not feasible. So I need a better way to compute f(rem) in O(1) or O(1) per call after some preprocessing.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight1 and weight2 items, precompute for each possible possible total weight up to m, the maximum value. But how?\n\nThis is similar to the classic knapsack problem, but with items of weight 1 and 2. However, with the items sorted, perhaps there's a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the following approach for the weight1 and weight2 case:\n\nLet’s imagine that for each possible weight W, we want to compute the maximum value. Let’s denote this as dp[W].\n\nBut how to compute dp[W]?\n\nWe can think of dp[W] as the maximum between:\n\n- Taking one weight1 item and adding it to dp[W - 1], or\n\n- Taking one weight2 item and adding it to dp[W - 2], or\n\n- Not taking anything.\n\nBut this is the standard unbounded knapsack approach. However, in our case, the items are unique and we can take each at most once. So this is the 0-1 knapsack problem. However, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, the standard DP approach would be O(nm) which is not feasible.\n\nBut wait, the items are grouped by weight. For example, for weight1, we have a sorted list of items. For weight2, same. So perhaps we can compute the DP for weight1 and weight2 items in a way that takes advantage of the sorted order.\n\nLet me think again. For the weight1 items, since they are sorted in descending order, the best way to take x items is the first x items. Similarly for weight2.\n\nSo for any capacity W, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible x (number of weight1 items) and y (number of weight2 items) such that x + 2y ≤ W.\n\nBut how to find x and y?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for a given W, the optimal number of weight2 items is y, and the optimal number of weight1 items is x = min( W - 2y, len1 ). So for each y, we can compute the value. But how to find the optimal y quickly.\n\nBut if we can find the optimal y in O(1) time, then we can compute f(rem) quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following: for each possible y, the value is sum2[y] + sum1[ min( W - 2y, len1 ) ].\n\nLet me denote that for a given y, the value is sum2[y] + sum1[ s ], where s = min( W - 2y, len1 ). So the question is, for a given W, find the y that maximizes this expression.\n\nLet me consider that for a given W, the optimal y is the one where the marginal gain of adding a weight2 item is better than replacing some weight1 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since the sum2[y] increases with y (as we take more high-value items), and the sum1[...] decreases with y (since W - 2y decreases), there's a trade-off. However, the function may not be unimodal. But perhaps for practical purposes, we can find the optimal y by considering the point where the next weight2 item is better than replacing two weight1 items.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight1 items are sorted, the sum1[s] is the sum of the first s items. So for a given W, the maximum s is min(W, len1). So if we take all possible weight1 items, and then see how many weight2 items can be added, or vice versa.\n\nWait, here's an idea: for the given W, the optimal choice is to take as many weight2 items as possible, but also possibly replace some of them with weight1 items. However, since the weight2 items are sorted, and the weight1 items are sorted, we can find the optimal balance.\n\nFor example, let's say we take y weight2 items. The total weight used is 2y. The remaining weight is W - 2y. We can take up to s = W - 2y weight1 items. But since the weight1 items are sorted, taking the first s of them gives the maximum sum.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the best y to choose.\n\nLet me think of the following: the optimal y is between max(0, (W - s_max)/2) and some upper bound. Where s_max is the maximum possible number of weight1 items (which is len1).\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nAlternative approach: For the weight1 and weight2 items, let's precompute the maximum possible for all possible capacities. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following: for weight1 items, the prefix sum is sum1[x]. For weight2 items, the prefix sum is sum2[y].\n\nNow, for any capacity W, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y (number of weight2 items), of sum2[y] + sum1[ min( W - 2y, len1 ) ].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for any W.\n\nLet me think of this as a function of y. Let's denote that for a given W, the function is:\n\nf(y) = sum2[y] + sum1[ min( W - 2y, len1 ) ]\n\nNow, since sum2[y] is increasing and sum1[...] is decreasing as y increases, the function f(y) may have a single maximum point. If that's the case, then we can perform a ternary search on y to find the maximum.\n\nBut is this function unimodal?\n\nLet's imagine that as y increases from 0 to Y_max, f(y) first increases and then decreases. That would make it unimodal, allowing ternary search.\n\nBut is that the case?\n\nSuppose that adding a weight2 item gives more value than removing two weight1 items. Then, increasing y increases the function. Once the added weight2 item's value is less than the value of the two weight1 items that are replaced, then increasing y decreases the function.\n\nSo, the function is unimodal. Thus, we can perform ternary search on y in the range [0, Y_max] to find the maximum.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each W, we can perform a ternary search on y, which would take O(log Y_max) time.\n\nThis would reduce the overall complexity.\n\nSo for each k (number of weight3 items), we compute rem = m - 3k. Then, for rem, we compute the best combination of weight1 and weight2 items using ternary search on y. This would be O(log (Y_max)) per call.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this ternary search correctly.\n\nBut first, we need to confirm that the function is indeed unimodal.\n\nLet's take an example.\n\nSuppose W is 5, len1 is 5 (so sum1[x] is x * 1, for example), and sum2[y] is y * 3. So for each y:\n\ny=0: sum2[0] = 0, sum1[5] = 5 → total 5.\n\ny=1: sum2[1] = 3, sum1[5 - 2*1 = 3] = 3 → total 6.\n\ny=2: sum2[2] = 6, sum1[5 - 4 = 1] = 1 → total 7.\n\ny=3: 2*3=6 > W=5 → invalid. So Y_max is 2.\n\nSo the function increases with y. So the maximum is at y=2.\n\nAnother example: W=4, sum1[x] is x*1, sum2[y] is y*2.\n\ny=0 → sum1[4] =4 → total 4.\n\ny=1 → sum2[1] = 2, sum1[4-2=2] = 2 → total 4.\n\ny=2 → sum2[2] =4, sum1[0] =0 → total 4.\n\nSo the function is flat. So the maximum is same for all y.\n\nAnother example where the function has a peak.\n\nLet's say W=6, sum1[x] is x*1, sum2[y] is y*3.\n\ny can be 0 to 3.\n\ny=0: sum1[6] =6 → total 6.\n\ny=1: sum2[1]=3 + sum1[4] =4 → total 7.\n\ny=2: sum2[2]=6 + sum1[2] =2 → total 8.\n\ny=3: sum2[3]=9 + sum1[0] =0 → total 9.\n\nSo function increases with y. So maximum at y=3.\n\nAnother example: W=5, sum1[x] is x*2 (so each weight1 item has value 2), sum2[y] is y*3 (each weight2 item has value 3).\n\ny can be up to 2 (since 2*2=4 ≤5).\n\ny=0: sum1[5] = 5*2=10.\n\ny=1: sum2[1] =3 + sum1[5-2=3] =3*2=6 → total 9.\n\ny=2: sum2[2] =6 + sum1[5-4=1] =2 → total 8.\n\nSo the function decreases as y increases beyond 0. So the maximum is at y=0.\n\nIn this case, the function is decreasing with y.\n\nSo in this case, the maximum is at the lowest y.\n\nBut what if there's a peak?\n\nLet me create a scenario where the function increases then decreases.\n\nLet's say W=5.\n\nsum1[x] is x*2 (so each weight1 item is 2).\n\nsum2[y] is for y=0: 0; y=1: 3; y=2: 5 (so the second weight2 item is 2).\n\nSo for y=0: sum1[5] = 10.\n\ny=1: sum2[1]=3 + sum1[5-2=3] =3*2=6 → total 9.\n\ny=2: sum2[2]=5 + sum1[5-4=1] =2 → total 7.\n\nSo the function decreases with y. Still no peak.\n\nAnother example:\n\nLet's say W=6.\n\nsum1[x] is x*1.\n\nsum2[y] is for y=0:0, y=1:3, y=2:3+1=4 (second weight2 item is 1).\n\nFor y=0: sum1[6] =6 → total 6.\n\ny=1: sum2[1]=3 + sum1[4] =4 → total 7.\n\ny=2: sum2[2]=4 + sum1[6-4=2] =2 → total 6.\n\nSo the function increases from y=0 to y=1, then decreases from y=1 to y=2. So it's unimodal. So the maximum is at y=1.\n\nSo this seems to be a case where the function is unimodal.\n\nSo, assuming that the function is unimodal, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, Y_max] to find the maximum.\n\nThus, for each rem, the f(rem) can be computed in O(log Y_max) time.\n\nNow, the steps for the solution would be:\n\n1. Group the items into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\n2. Sort each list in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each list.\n\n4. For each possible k (number of weight3 items), compute rem = m - 3*k. If rem <0, skip.\n\n5. For rem, compute the maximum value from weight1 and weight2 items using ternary search on y (number of weight2 items).\n\n6. Keep track of the maximum total value across all k.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, for the prefix sums:\n\nFor example, for the weight1 list, we sort it in descending order. Then, sum1[0] = 0, sum1[1] = w1[0], sum1[2] = w1[0]+w1[1], etc.\n\nSimilarly for sum2 and sum3.\n\nNow, for the ternary search part:\n\nFor a given rem, Y_max is min( len2, rem//2 )\n\nWe need to find the y in [0, Y_max] that maximizes sum2[y] + sum1[ min(rem - 2y, len1) ].\n\nBut how to handle the min(rem - 2y, len1)?\n\nWell, len1 is the length of the weight1 list. So when rem - 2y is larger than len1, we can take all len1 items. Otherwise, take rem - 2y items.\n\nSo during the ternary search, for a given y, we calculate:\n\ns = rem - 2*y\n\nx = min(s, len1)\n\nvalue = sum2[y] + sum1[x]\n\nSo the function is as described.\n\nNow, the ternary search would be on the interval [low, high], where low = 0 and high = Y_max.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the maximum is at the endpoints?\n\nTernary search can be implemented as follows:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = Y_max.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n   mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n   if f(mid1) < f(mid2):\n\n       low = mid1 + 1\n\n   else:\n\n       high = mid2 - 1\n\nOnce low == high, check the value at low and possibly nearby points.\n\nAlternatively, perform a loop until low + 1 < high, and then check the remaining points.\n\nBut in practice, since the function is unimodal, the ternary search should find the maximum.\n\nBut to be safe, after finding the approximate maximum, we can check all y in the vicinity (like from max(0, low - 2) to high + 2) to ensure we don't miss the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, since the Y_max can be up to 1.5e5, even checking all possible y in a small window around the ternary search result would be manageable.\n\nBut for the sake of time, perhaps the ternary search approach is sufficient.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines of wi and ci.\n\nGroup into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each.\n\nThen, for each possible k in 0 to len3 (where len3 is the length of w3 list), but also ensuring that 3*k <= m.\n\nBut len3 could be up to 1e5. For each k, we can compute the maximum possible 3*k is min( len3, m//3 )\n\nSo for k in 0 to max_k:\n\n   rem = m - 3*k\n\n   if rem <0: continue\n\n   compute the best value from w1 and w2 for rem.\n\n   total = sum3[k] + best_value\n\n   update the global maximum.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute best_value for rem.\n\nImplementing the ternary search for rem.\n\nBut what about when rem is zero? Then best_value is zero.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFor the prefix sums:\n\nsum1 = [0]\n\nfor i in range(len(w1)):\n\n    sum1.append( sum1[-1] + w1[i] )\n\nSimilarly for sum2 and sum3.\n\nNow, for the ternary search function.\n\nBut in Python, functions inside loops can be slow. However, given that the ternary search is O(log Y_max) per call, and the number of k is up to O(m/3), which is up to 1e5, then the total number of operations is acceptable.\n\nBut for the worst case, say m=3e5, and for each k, Y_max is up to 1.5e5, and ternary search is O( log(1.5e5) ) ~ 18 steps.\n\nSo total operations would be around 1e5 * 18 * (some small constants) which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, handle the case where rem is negative. Also, when rem is zero, the best_value is zero.\n\nNow, for the function that computes best_value for a given rem:\n\ndef compute_best(rem, sum1, len1, sum2, len2):\n\n    # returns the maximum value for weight1 and weight2 items with capacity rem.\n\n    Y_max = min( len2, rem // 2 )\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = Y_max\n\n    best = 0\n\n    # perform ternary search\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        # evaluate mid and mid+1 ?\n\n        # Alternatively, use the ternary search approach.\n\n        # For simplicity, perhaps use a loop that checks all possible y in a small range around the current guess.\n\n        # But for now, let's proceed with a ternary search.\n\n        # However, I'm not confident in the implementation. Another approach is to try all possible y in the vicinity of the optimal.\n\n        # Alternatively, since the Y_max is up to 1.5e5, but for each rem, the maximum number of iterations is small.\n\n        # Perhaps a better way is to try all possible y in the range [max(0, Y_max - 200), Y_max], since the optimal y is likely to be in this range.\n\n        # This is a heuristic, but given that the items are sorted, and the optimal y is where the trade-off between weight2 and weight1 is best, perhaps the optimal y is near the maximum possible Y_max or near the Y where 2y is close to rem.\n\n        # For example, for each rem, try y from max(0, Y_max - 200) to Y_max.\n\n        # This would be O(200) per call, which is manageable.\n\n        # Let's try this approach.\n\n    # So, instead of ternary search, try all possible y in a small range around Y_max.\n\n    # For example, for each possible y in max(0, Y_max - 200) to Y_max.\n\n    # Because for large Y_max, the optimal y is likely to be in this range.\n\n    # However, what if the optimal y is outside this range? For example, if the weight2 items are not very valuable.\n\n    # But given that the items are sorted, the first few items are the most valuable. So taking more weight2 items is better than taking fewer. But if the weight2 items are not valuable enough, it's better to take fewer and more weight1 items.\n\n    # However, with this approach, there is a risk of missing the optimal y. But perhaps for the problem's constraints, this is acceptable.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can try all possible y in 0 to Y_max, but this is O(Y_max) per call, which is not feasible.\n\n    # So, back to the ternary search idea.\n\n    # Let's proceed with the ternary search.\n\n    # Let's write a function to compute the value for a given y.\n\n    def get_value(y):\n\n        s = rem - 2 * y\n\n        x = min(s, len1)\n\n        return sum2[y] + sum1[x]\n\n    # Now, perform ternary search between low and high.\n\n    # Initialize best_val to 0.\n\n    best_val = 0\n\n    # We can perform a loop for a fixed number of steps, say 100, to converge.\n\n    # Or use the standard ternary search approach.\n\n    # Let's try the iterative approach.\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = Y_max\n\n    for _ in range(100):\n\n        if high - low < 3:\n\n            break\n\n        m1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        m2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        v1 = get_value(m1)\n\n        v2 = get_value(m2)\n\n        if v1 < v2:\n\n            low = m1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = m2 - 1\n\n    # After narrowing down, check all values between low and high.\n\n    for y in range(max(0, low - 2), min(Y_max, high + 2)):\n\n        current_val = get_value(y)\n\n        if current_val > best_val:\n\n            best_val = current_val\n\n    return best_val\n\nBut this is just a rough approach. However, given the time constraints, perhaps this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible rem, we can try all possible y in the range [max(0, Y_max - 200), Y_max], which would be O(200) per call.\n\nBut why 200? Well, if the optimal y is within 200 steps from Y_max, then this approach would capture it. This is a heuristic, but given that the items",
