For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C. So each note has a position, and the distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones from the first to the second, moving forward in the sequence.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. Between C and D is 2, etc. But since the notes are cyclic, if I have a note that's before another in the list, like H and C, the distance from H to C is 1 semitone. But when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the minimal way? No, no. Wait the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Because C to C# is 1, D is 2, D# 3, E is 4. So the distance from X to Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? Wait no, because if Y is after X, then it's Y's position minus X's. If Y is before X, then it's (Y's position + 12 - X's position). Because the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. For example, the distance between E and C would be 8 semitones. Because E to F is 1, F to F# 2, etc., up to C. So the distance is (C's position - E's position) mod 12? No, wait. Let me think. Let's say the positions are numbered 0 to 11. Let's assign each note to a number. For example:\n\nC is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# 3, E 4, F 5, F# 6, G 7, G# 8, A 9, B 10, H 11. Then, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12 if Y is higher than X. But if Y is lower, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones? Or wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So for example, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones you need to move up from X to reach Y. So if X is C (0), Y is E (4): 4-0=4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8. Because you have to go from E to F (1), F to F# (2), ... up to C, which is 8 steps. So the formula for the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y - X + 12). Which can be written as (Y - X) % 12? Wait, no. Because (Y - X) mod 12 gives the same result as (Y - X) if positive, but if Y < X, then (Y - X) mod 12 is (Y - X + 12). For example, if Y is 0 and X is 4: (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the upper. So for example, between X and Y, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12. But when you have X and Y, the distance is the number of semitones you have to move up from X to reach Y. So that's correct.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its position. So I need a dictionary that maps the note names to their index. Let's create that. The order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Let me check that. Let me count:\n\nC is 0, C# 1, D 2, D# 3, E 4, F 5, F# 6, G 7, G# 8, A 9, B 10, H 11. Yes.\n\nSo for example, the distance between C and E is (4 - 0) = 4. Between E and C is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Which matches the example given.\n\nNow, the problem says that a major triad is when there are three notes X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. And the order is such that X, Y, Z are arranged in that way. But since the triad is unordered, we have to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo for the three notes, we need to generate all possible orderings (permutations) and check for each if they meet the criteria.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all permutations and see if any of them meets the major or minor condition. Once we find any, we can return the answer.\n\nSo, for example, for the input 'C E G', the possible permutations include (C, E, G). Let's check: distance from C to E is 4, E to G is 3. So that's a major triad. So output is major.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' — the example says that when ordered as B, C#, F, the distance between B and C# is 3, and between C# and F is 4. So that's a minor triad.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Convert the three input notes into their numerical positions (like 0-11).\n\n2. Generate all permutations of these three notes (since the order matters for checking the conditions).\n\n3. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\n   a. Check if the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. If yes, then it's a major triad.\n\n   b. Check if the distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4. If yes, then it's a minor triad.\n\n4. If any permutation satisfies the major condition, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut since there are 3! = 6 permutations, it's manageable.\n\nBut how to generate permutations?\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used.\n\nSo steps for code:\n\nFirst, create a mapping from note names to their positions. Let's make a list of the notes in order, then a dictionary.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, note_to_index = {note: index for index, note in enumerate(notes_order)}.\n\nThen, read the input: three notes. For example, input is given as a list of three elements, like ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nOnce we have the three notes, convert them into their indices. Let's say they are a, b, c.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of [a, b, c]. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck for major: distance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3.\n\nCheck for minor: distance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between x and y?\n\ndistance = (y - x) % 12 ?\n\nYes. Because for example, if x is 0 (C) and y is 4 (E), (4-0) mod 12 is 4. Which is correct. If x is 4 (E) and y is 0 (C), (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is the correct distance (from E to C is 8 semitones). But for the major triad, the distance between X and Y must be 4. So in the case where the permutation is (E, C, ...), the distance between E and C is 8, which is not 4. So that permutation would not satisfy the major condition.\n\nSo for each permutation, we need to check if the first two notes have a distance of 4, and the next two have a distance of 3. Or for minor, first two have 3, next two have 4.\n\nSo for each permutation, check:\n\nif (distance between x and y is 4) and (distance between y and z is 3) → major.\n\nelif (distance between x and y is 3) and (distance between y and z is 4) → minor.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, there may be multiple permutations that satisfy the condition. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so once any permutation satisfies either major or minor, we can return accordingly.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead the three notes. For example, input is a list of three strings. So for example, input could be 'C E G'.\n\nThen, for each of the permutations of the three notes:\n\nCheck for major and minor.\n\nOnce any permutation satisfies major, return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nIf none, return 'strange'.\n\nSo now, code steps.\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index mapping.\n\nThen, read the input. The input is given as a list of three notes, e.g., ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nThen, get their indices. Let's say, notes = list of three elements. Then, indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes].\n\nThen generate all permutations of indices.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck if (distance between x and y is 4) and (distance between y and z is 3). If yes → major.\n\nCheck if (distance between x and y is 3) and (distance between y and z is 4). If yes → minor.\n\nOnce any of these is found, return the corresponding result.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between x and y? As (y - x) % 12.\n\nWait, but for example, if x is 0 (C) and y is 4 (E), (y - x) is 4, mod 12 is 4. Correct. If x is 4 and y is 0, (0 -4) is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between x and y is (y - x) % 12.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper note. So if x is lower than y, then the distance is y -x. If x is higher than y, then the distance is (y + 12 -x). Which is equivalent to (y - x) mod 12. Because for example, if x is 4 and y is 0, then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8, which is the correct distance. So yes, the formula (y - x) % 12 gives the correct distance between x and y.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef distance(x, y):\n\n    return (y - x) % 12\n\nBut in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So that's correct.\n\nSo for each permutation, check:\n\nd1 = (y - x) % 12\n\nd2 = (z - y) % 12\n\nIf d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nOr if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor perm in permutations([a, b, c]):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        return 'major'\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        return 'minor'\n\nSo once any permutation meets either condition, return the respective answer.\n\nBut since there are 6 permutations, we need to check all of them. For example, maybe the first permutation doesn't meet the condition, but another one does.\n\nBut once any permutation meets the major or minor condition, we can return the answer immediately.\n\nSo in code, for the three notes, generate all permutations, and check each in order. If any of them meets the major condition, return 'major'. If any meets the minor condition, return 'minor'. Otherwise, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So there's no case where a permutation satisfies both major and minor. But according to the problem statement, the input will not have such cases. So we can check for major first, then minor, and if none, return strange.\n\nBut in code, for each permutation, check if it's major, then check if it's minor. But since there are multiple permutations, perhaps some permutations may satisfy major and others minor. But according to the problem statement, the answer is unique, so if any permutation satisfies major, then there are no permutations that satisfy minor, and vice versa.\n\nBut the code needs to check all permutations, and if any permutation meets major, then return 'major', else check if any meets minor, else return 'strange'.\n\nBut perhaps the code can check all permutations, and collect whether any of them meets major or minor.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound_major = False\n\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        found_major = True\n\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n\n    print(\"major\")\n\nelif found_minor:\n\n    print(\"minor\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but this code would check all permutations. For example, even if one permutation satisfies major, but another permutation also satisfies minor, but according to the problem statement, this is impossible. However, the code would check all permutations, and if any permutation satisfies major, then found_major becomes True. Similarly for minor. But according to the problem statement, the answer is unique, so the code can safely check for found_major first, then found_minor.\n\nBut what if a permutation meets both major and minor conditions? Well, that's impossible. Because for a permutation (x, y, z), the d1 and d2 would have to be 4 and 3 for major, and 3 and 4 for minor. So unless 4=3 and 3=4, which is not possible, no permutation can satisfy both. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut in code, for each permutation, check if it's major, and if so, set found_major to True. Similarly for minor. Then after checking all permutations, decide based on found_major and found_minor.\n\nBut what if two permutations meet the major condition? That's possible, but the code will set found_major to True once, and that's okay.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so if found_major is True, then found_minor must be False, and vice versa.\n\nBut the code above checks for all permutations, and if any permutation meets the major condition, then the answer is major. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut in the code above, even if one permutation meets the major condition, and another meets the minor condition, the code would return 'major' because found_major is True. But according to the problem statement, this scenario cannot happen. So the code is safe.\n\nBut how to test this?\n\nLet's take the example given in the problem:\n\nFirst input: C E G → indices are 0,4,7.\n\nCheck permutations:\n\nOne permutation is (0,4,7). d1 = (4-0) mod 12 =4. d2 = (7-4) mod 12 =3 → major. So found_major is True.\n\nOther permutations may not meet any condition. So the code returns 'major'.\n\nSecond example: C# B F → the notes are C# (1), B (10), F (5). Let's check permutations.\n\nOne permutation is B (10), C# (1), F (5). Let's compute d1: (1 -10) mod 12 → (1 -10) = -9 mod 12 is 3. Then d2 is (5 -1) mod 12 →4. So this permutation meets the minor condition. So found_minor is True.\n\nAnother permutation may not meet any other conditions. So code returns 'minor'.\n\nThird example: A B H → indices are 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's see:\n\nTake permutation (9, 10, 11). d1 is 1, d2 is 1 → no. Another permutation: (9, 11, 10). d1 is (11-9)=2 mod 12 →2. d2 is (10 - 11) mod 12 = 11 → no. Another permutation: (10, 9, 11). d1 is (9-10) mod 12 → 11. No. Another permutation: (10, 11, 9). d1 is (11-10) =1 mod 12 →1. d2 is (9-11) mod 12 = 10. No. Another permutation: (11,9,10). d1 is (9-11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 →10. No. Another permutation: (11,10,9). d1 is (10-11) mod 12 →11. No. So none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for these examples.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code should be written as follows.\n\nBut first, the input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, the sample input is:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, no. The input is given as a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the input is something like:\n\nC E G\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem is a list of three examples. But the actual input is a single line with three notes. So the code should read the input as three notes, split by spaces.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem is:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWhich seems to be a list of three examples. But that's probably the sample input for the problem. But the actual input is a single line. For example, for the first example, the input is 'C E G', and the output is 'major'.\n\nSo the code should read the input as a single line, split into three notes.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound_major = False\n\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        found_major = True\n\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n\n    print(\"major\")\n\nelif found_minor:\n\n    print(\"minor\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, the code checks all permutations. For example, if one permutation meets the major condition, but another permutation meets the minor condition. According to the problem statement, this is impossible. However, the code would set both flags. But according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous, so this situation can't happen. So the code is safe.\n\nBut let's think about a case where a permutation meets both conditions. Well, that's impossible. Because for a permutation (x,y,z), d1 and d2 would have to be 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). So for a permutation to meet both conditions, d1 must be 4 and 3 at the same time, which is impossible.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nC E G → output 'major'\n\nSample Input:\n\nC# B F → output 'minor'\n\nSample Input:\n\nA B H → output 'strange'\n\nNow, let's check the code for the second sample input: C# B F → the notes are C#, B, F.\n\nThe indices are:\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nPermutations:\n\nFor example, (10, 1, 5) → x=10 (B), y=1 (C#), z=5 (F).\n\nd1 = (1 -10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is (5 -1) mod 12 = 4. So this permutation meets minor condition. So found_minor is True.\n\nAnother permutation (1, 10, 5) → x=1, y=10, z=5. d1 is (10 -1) mod 12 =9. Not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nAnother permutation (10,5,1): d1 is (5-10) mod 12 = ( -5 ) mod 12 =7. No. So no.\n\nSo the code will find that found_minor is True, so output 'minor'.\n\nAnother example: let's take a minor triad. Let's say B, C#, F. Which is the example. So code returns minor.\n\nAnother example: let's check a major triad. Suppose the input is C E G. The code finds that in the permutation (C, E, G) → d1 is 4, d2 is 3 → major.\n\nSo code returns 'major'.\n\nAnother test case: what if the input is C E G#?\n\nLet's see. C is 0, E is 4, G# is 8.\n\nCheck permutations. For example, (0,4,8). d1 is 4-0=4. d2 is 8-4=4. So d2 is 4. Not 3. So not major. What about other permutations?\n\nWhat about (0,8,4). d1 is 8-0=8 mod 12 is 8. Not 4. No.\n\nWhat about (4, 0, 8)? d1 is (0-4) mod 12 = 8. No. Not 4.\n\nAnother permutation (4, 8, 0). d1 is 8-4=4. d2 is 0-8 mod 12 is 4. So d2 is 4. So not 3. So no. So this is not a major or minor. So output is strange.\n\nAnother example: let's take a minor triad. For example, B, C#, F. Which is the example.\n\nAnother example: let's take C, D#, G. Let's see. The indices are 0, 3, 7. Check permutations. Let's try (0,3,7). d1 is 3, d2 is 4. So that's a minor triad. So code would find that. So output is minor.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code uses permutations from itertools. So need to import that.\n\nBut in the code, the code is written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nBut in Python, the code would need to import permutations.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if the three notes are the same? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is three notes, but the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, according to the problem statement, the input is a valid chord. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. However, the code will handle it. For example, if all three notes are C, then all permutations will have d1 =0, d2=0. So no major or minor, output 'strange'.\n\nAnother edge case: notes that wrap around. Like C, H, D. Let's see: C is 0, H is 11, D is 2. Let's check permutations. For example, (11, 0, 2). d1 is (0 - 11) mod 12 = 1. d2 is (2 -0) mod 12 = 2. No. Another permutation: (0, 11, 2). d1 is 11-0=11. d2 is 2-11 mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. So d1 is 11, d2 is 3. No. Not matching. Another permutation: (0,2,11). d1 is 2, d2 is (11-2) mod 12 =9. No. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother example: check for a minor triad. Let's take B, C#, F. Which is the sample. So code returns minor.\n\nAnother example: let's check the permutation (C#, B, F). The code checks all permutations. For example, the permutation (B, C#, F) is considered, which is one of the permutations. So code finds it.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in semitones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to an index representing its position in the cyclic sequence of musical notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes and check each permutation against the criteria for major and minor triads:\n   - A major triad has a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second notes, and 3 semitones between the second and third notes.\n   - A minor triad has a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second notes, and 4 semitones between the second and third notes.\n4. **Determine Result**: Based on the checks, determine if the triad is major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the order of notes and create a mapping from note to index\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\n# Read input notes\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\n# Convert notes to their corresponding indices\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\n# Check all permutations of the three notes\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\n# Output the result based on the checks\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The notes are mapped to indices from 0 to 11 based on their position in the cyclic sequence.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to ensure it wraps around correctly for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the three input notes, we check each permutation to see if it meets the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation meets the major triad criteria, the result is \"major\". If any permutation meets the minor triad criteria, the result is \"minor\". If none meet the criteria, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical notes.",
