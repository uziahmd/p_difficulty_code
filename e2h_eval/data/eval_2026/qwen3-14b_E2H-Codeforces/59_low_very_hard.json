    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of arrays of sets that can be rearranged such that each consecutive set in the rearranged array is a child of the next. Let me break down what's required here.\n\nFirst, understanding the definition of a child set. A set A is a child of set B if for every element x in A, there's an x+1 in B. So, for example, if A has {1,2}, then B must have 2 and 3. Wait, no: for each x in A, there must be an x+1 in B. So for each element in A, x+1 is present in B. So B has elements that are one more than elements in A. So, if A has {1}, then B must have 2. If A has {2}, B must have 3. But if B has 2 and 3, then A can have elements 1 and 2, since for 1, B has 2; for 2, B has 3.\n\nNow, the main task is to find the number of arrays of N sets, each with elements from 1 to K, such that there exists some permutation of the array where each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nSo, how do we model this? Let's think about the constraints on the sets when they are arranged in some order. For example, if we have two sets S and T, then in the rearranged array, either S comes before T (so S is a child of T) or T comes before S (so T is a child of S). But not both, unless both conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut since the problem allows any permutation, perhaps we can model the sets in a way that their dependencies form a DAG, and there's a topological order that satisfies the chain. However, considering all permutations seems tricky. Maybe we need to find a way to model the sets such that there's a certain hierarchy between them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to model the sets in terms of their elements and how they can be ordered. Let me think: For the entire array, after rearrangement, each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}. So, for each i, every element in S'_i must have its x+1 in S'_{i+1}.\n\nThis suggests that the elements in the sets must form a kind of chain. Let's think about the elements in the sets. Suppose we have a chain of sets S_1', S_2', ..., S_N'. Then, for each element x in S_1', x+1 must be in S_2'; for each element y in S_2', y+1 must be in S_3', and so on. Therefore, any element x in any set S'_i must have x + (N - i) ≤ K. Because, for example, if x is in S'_i, then x+1 is in S'_{i+1}, x+2 in S'_{i+2}, etc., up to x + (N - i) being in S'_N. Since the maximum value in the sets is K, x + (N - i) ≤ K. Therefore, x ≤ K - (N - i) = K + i - N. \n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the sets. Let's imagine that for each element x, it can appear in some sets. But given that in the rearranged array, each time an element x is present in a set, the next set must contain x+1. So, the presence of x in a set implies that there is a later set (in the rearranged order) that contains x+1. However, since the sets can be arranged in any order, perhaps the dependencies between elements can be modeled as a DAG, and the entire array of sets must be such that all elements can be ordered in a way that for each element x, the number of times it's used in the sets is compatible with the chain of sets.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into considering for each element x, how many times it can be present across the sets. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the entire collection of sets. Since we can arrange them in any order, perhaps the sets must form a hierarchy where each set can be ordered in a way that their elements are \"lower\" than those in the next set. But how?\n\nWait, if we have a set S and a set T, then S can be placed before T in the rearranged array if S is a child of T. So, for S to be before T, every element in S must have x+1 in T. Alternatively, T can be before S if every element in T has x",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid arrays of sets such that there exists a permutation of the array where each set is a child of the next. The key insight here is to model the problem using dynamic programming and combinatorics, leveraging the constraints on the elements within the sets.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Child Sets**: A set A is a child of set B if every element x in A has x+1 in B. This implies that for an element x in a set at position i in the rearranged array, it must be possible to find x+1 in the next set, and so on until the end of the array.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP array `dp[i]` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid ways to form sequences of length `i` with elements up to `K`.\n3. **Combinatorics with Factorials and Inverses**: Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo `998244353` to efficiently compute combinations and permutations.\n4. **Transition Between States**: For each position `i`, calculate the number of valid transitions from `i-1` to `i` considering the constraints on elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    N = int(input[0])\n    K = int(input[1])\n    \n    max_n = N + 1\n    max_k = K + 1\n\n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial mod MOD\n    fact = [1] * (max_k)\n    for i in range(1, max_k):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_k)\n    inv_fact[max_k - 1] = pow(fact[max_k - 1], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_k - 2, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n\n    def comb(n, k):\n        if n < 0 or k < 0 or n < k:\n            return 0\n        return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD\n\n    dp = [0] * (N + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: empty sequence\n\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        # For each step, we want to compute dp[i] based on dp[i-1]\n        # The number of ways to choose elements for the current set\n        # For each possible value of m, which is the number of elements in the current set\n        # But we need to consider how many elements can be in the set such that they can be followed by the next set\n        # However, the actual way to model this is through the transitions between dp[i-1] and dp[i]\n        # We realize that for each i-th set, the elements can be any subset of {1, ..., K} such that they do not exceed K - (N - i)\n        # So for the i-th set in the sequence, the maximum element allowed is K - (N - i) = K + i - N\n        # Let's compute the maximum value allowed for the i-th set\n        max_val = K + i - N\n        if max_val < 1:\n            # No possible elements, so dp[i] = 0\n            dp[i] = 0\n        else:\n            # The number of subsets for the i-th set is 2^m, where m is the number of allowed values\n            # allowed_values = max_val\n            # So the number of subsets is 2^allowed_values\n            # However, since we are considering the entire sequence, the transition is dp[i] = dp[i-1] * (2^allowed_values)\n            # Wait, but this is not accurate.
