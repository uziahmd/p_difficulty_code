Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, moving through adjacent blocks. The adjacency is defined by sharing a common border of non-zero length. \n\nHmm, the problem is about regions divided by lines. Each line divides the plane into two parts. The blocks are regions formed by the arrangement of all these lines. The key here is to model the blocks and their adjacencies. But how?\n\nWait, but considering that each block is a region, and moving between adjacent regions requires crossing a line. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there can be up to 300 lines, the number of regions could be huge. For example, n lines can divide the plane into O(n²) regions. But with n up to 300, that's 90,000 regions. But even then, doing BFS on that might be feasible if we can find a way to represent each region uniquely and determine which regions are adjacent.\n\nBut how to represent each region? Well, perhaps we can model each region by the sign of the equations of each line. For example, for each line, a point lies on one side or the other. So for a given point (like home or university), each line contributes a +1 or -1 based on the value of a_i x + b_i y + c_i. If the value is positive or negative. But since the home and university are not on any line, their signs for all lines are fixed.\n\nWait, here's an idea: each region can be represented by a vector of signs for each line. For example, for each line i, compute the value of a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i. Since the point is not on the line, this value is non-zero. So for each line, the sign (positive or negative) determines which side of the line the point is on. Then, two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one line's sign. Because if two regions differ in exactly one line, that implies that they are separated by that line. But wait, maybe that's not entirely accurate. Let me think.\n\nIf two regions are adjacent, they share a common border. That border is a segment of a line. So, moving from one region to another requires crossing exactly one line. Therefore, the regions must differ in exactly one line's sign. Because if you cross a line, you flip the sign of that line. So, the regions that are adjacent are those that differ in exactly one line's sign. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to modeling the regions as nodes, where each node is a binary vector (for each line, the sign is either + or -). Then, two regions are connected if their vectors differ in exactly one position. But how do we model this efficiently?\n\nBut the problem is that the number of possible sign vectors is 2^n, which for n=300 is way too big. So we can't generate all possible regions. However, the home and university are specific points. So, maybe the problem is not to model all regions, but to model the regions that are reachable from the home, and find the minimal steps to reach the university's region.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because each step involves flipping one sign. Wait, but the home's region is determined by the sign of each line. Similarly for the university. So, the problem becomes: starting from the home's sign vector, what is the minimal number of steps (each step flipping exactly one bit) to reach the university's sign vector. But only if the two vectors differ in an even number of bits? No, wait, because each step changes exactly one bit. So the minimal steps would be the number of differing bits between the home and university vectors. Wait, no. Because if two vectors differ in k positions, then the minimal steps needed is k. Because each step flips one bit. But wait, that's only if you can flip each differing bit one by one. However, the problem says that adjacent regions must differ in exactly one line's sign. So, each step is moving through a line, changing exactly one sign. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Because for example, if the home and university differ in two lines, then you can go from home to a region that differs in one line, then to another region that differs in another line. So that would take two steps. Which is the Hamming distance. So the minimal steps would be exactly the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. \n\nBut why? Because each step changes exactly one line's sign. So, the minimal steps required is the number of lines where the home and university have different signs. Because you can flip each differing line one by one. \n\nBut wait, is that possible? Let's take an example. Suppose there are two lines. Home is in a region where both lines are positive. University is in a region where the first line is positive and the second is negative. So the Hamming distance is 1. So steps needed is 1. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: home has signs (+, +), university has (-, -). Hamming distance is 2. Steps: home -> (+, -) (crossing line 1?), then to (-, -) (crossing line 2). So two steps. Which matches the Hamming distance. \n\nBut what if there are three lines, and the home and university differ in three lines. Then, the steps would be three. So yes, the Hamming distance is the answer. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that moving from one block to another requires that their common border has non-zero length. But when you flip one line's sign, you cross that line. But for that to be possible, the regions must be adjacent. However, in some cases, flipping a single line's sign may not be possible? Like, if two regions are separated by multiple lines. But according to the earlier reasoning, each time you cross a line, you change exactly one sign. So the adjacency is equivalent to differing in exactly one sign. \n\nBut is that true? Let me think. Suppose you have two lines, which cross each other. They divide the plane into four regions. Each region is adjacent to two others. For example, regions that are across a line. So, if you have a region with signs (+, +), then it's adjacent to regions (+, -) and (-, +). So, those two regions are adjacent. So the Hamming distance between them is 1. So that's correct. \n\nAnother case: suppose three lines. Suppose a region is (+, +, +). Another region is (+, +, -). Those are adjacent. But what about a region that differs in two lines, like (+, -, -)? Are those regions adjacent? No. Because to get there, you need to cross two lines. So their Hamming distance is 2. But the regions are not adjacent. So, the minimal steps would be two steps. So the Hamming distance is the minimal steps. \n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the number of lines where the home and university have different signs. \n\nWait, but how can that be? Because the answer in the sample input is 2. Let's check that. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x + 1y +0 = 0 → y=0. And 1x +0y +0 = 0 → x=0. \n\nSo the home (1,1) is in the region where for the first line (y=0), the value is 1*1 + 0*... wait, the line is 0x +1y +0 =0 → 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0. For home (1,1), substituting into the equation gives 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0. So the sign is positive. For the second line x=0, the value is 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1>0. So the home's sign vector is [+, +]. \n\nUniversity is (-1,-1). For the first line, y=-1. So 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. For the second line, x=-1 → 1*(-1) +0 +0 =-1 <0. So the sign vector is [-, -]. So the Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nSecond sample input: \n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x + y -3 =0. \n\nFor the home (1,1):\n\nLine 1: x=0 → 1>0 → +.\nLine 2: y=0 → 1>0 → +.\nLine 3: x + y -3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\nSign vector is [+, +, -].\n\nFor the university (-1,-1):\n\nLine 1: x=0 → -1 <0 → -.\nLine 2: y=0 → -1 <0 → -.\nLine 3: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -.\nSign vector is [-, -, -]. \n\nSo the differing lines are the first and second. Hamming distance is 2, which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: for each line, compute the sign of home and the sign of university. Then count the number of lines where the signs differ. That's the answer. \n\nWait, really? That's super simple. So the answer is just the number of lines where (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) * (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i) is negative. Because that would mean that the home and university are on opposite sides of that line. \n\nYes. Because for each line, if the home and university are on opposite sides, then that line is part of the path. So, the number of such lines is the answer. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each line, compute the value for home and for university. \n\n2. For each line, check if the product of the two values is negative. If yes, then count it. \n\n3. The total count is the answer. \n\nThat's so simple. But why? Because each such line contributes to a step. Because each step crosses one line. So the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate home and university. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each line that separates them must be crossed once. And since each step can cross exactly one line, the minimal steps is the number of such lines. \n\nBut how does that hold with the example? Let's see. In the first sample, two lines separate home and university. So answer is 2. Which matches. In the second sample, two lines (the first and second) separate them. The third line: home is -1, university is -5. Both negative. So same sign. So not counted. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n lines. For each line, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c. val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If val1 * val2 < 0, increment the count. \n\nThen output the count. \n\nWait, but how about the lines that are not separating the home and university? For example, if a line is on the same side for both points. Then that line isn't part of the path. \n\nYes. So the answer is the number of lines that separate the home and university. \n\nThis seems to be the case. \n\nBut why? Because each line that separates them must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is the number of such lines. \n\nBut how to prove this? \n\nLet me think. Let's imagine that the home and university are in regions that differ in k lines. Then, the minimal steps is k. Because each step can flip one line. \n\nBut how do we know that there's a path that crosses each of those lines once? \n\nWell, because each line that separates them is a barrier. So you have to cross each of them once. \n\nBut perhaps there's a scenario where two lines are crossed in a way that you can cross them in a single step? No, because each step crosses exactly one line. \n\nThus, the answer is indeed the count of lines that separate the home and university. \n\nThis seems to be the case. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nFor the first line (0x +1y +0 = 0): \n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: 1x +0y +0 = 0. val1 is 1*1 +0 +0 = 1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1. product is negative → count +=1. Total 2 → output 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → line x=0.\n\n0 1 0 → line y=0.\n\n1 1 -3 → line x + y -3 = 0.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nline 1: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1 → val1 =1. \n\nline 2: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1 → val1=1.\n\nline3: 1 +1 -3 = -1 → val1=-1.\n\nuniversity (-1,-1):\n\nline1: 1*(-1) + 0 +0 = -1 → val2=-1.\n\nline2: 0 + 1*(-1) +0 = -1 → val2=-1.\n\nline3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 → val2=-5.\n\nCheck products:\n\nline1: 1 * (-1) = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nline2: 1 * (-1) = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nline3: (-1) * (-5) = 5 >0 → no. \n\nTotal count is 2 → output 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if home and university are on same side of all lines. Then answer is zero. \n\nBut how? For example, if there's one line, and both points are on the same side. Then the answer is 0 steps. Which makes sense because they are in the same region. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, the solution is to count the number of lines where the product of the evaluations at home and university is negative.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of n lines:\n\n   a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n   val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n   val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n   if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n       count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but what about the data types? For example, if the numbers are big, but in Python it's okay. \n\nYes. Because even with 1e6 * 1e6, multiplied by 3, but in Python integers can handle that. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because the problem is equivalent to finding the number of hyperplanes (lines) that separate the two points. Each such hyperplane must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step. \n\nThis seems to be the case. \n\nSo the code is very simple. \n\nNow, let's check the sample input again. \n\nYes, the code works. \n\nSo the answer is to implement this logic. \n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input lines. \n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Wait, the input given in the example is two different test cases. Wait, the first example input is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Or perhaps the example is showing two different test cases, but the actual input is a single test case. \n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1. Second line x2, y2. Third line is n. Then n lines of coefficients. \n\nSo each input is a single test case. The example shows two test cases, but perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. \n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples. But the user's code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? No, the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input is as per the problem's input description. \n\nLooking back, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ... etc. So the code should read one test case. \n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the example. For example, in the example, the first input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSample Output 1: 2\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nSample Output 2: 2\n\nBut the way the user presented the input is as two separate inputs. But in reality, the code should read a single test case. \n\nSo the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is one test case. \n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nCompute count.\n\nPrint count.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead from stdin. \n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the input can be read via input() function. But for multiple lines, perhaps using sys.stdin. \n\nBut for the code, the code will read the first line as x1, y1. Then second line as x2, y2. Then third line as n. Then read n lines. \n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes. \n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1. The second line contains two integers x2, y2. Third line is n. Then n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nThis code would handle all test cases. \n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nThe code reads x1=1, y1=1. x2=-1, y2=-1. n=2. Then two lines. \n\nFor first line, a=0, b=1, c=0. val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. \n\nSecond line: a=1, b=0, c=0. val1=1*1 +0 +0 =1. val2=1*(-1) +0 +0 =-1. product -1 → count becomes 2. \n\nOutput is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nn=3. \n\nFirst line: a=1, b=0, c=0. val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2=1*(-1) +0 +0 =-1. product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line: a=0, b=1, c=0. val1=0 +1*1 +0 =1. val2=0 +1*(-1) +0 =-1. product -1 → count +=1. \n\nThird line: a=1, b=1, c=-3. val1 =1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 =1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. \n\nTotal count 2. Correct. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nSo this is the solution. It's very simple and efficient. For n up to 300, it's O(n) time. \n\nEdge Cases:\n\nWhat if n=0? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1. Wait, no. The input says third line contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n can't be zero. So no problem. \n\nAnother edge case: home and university are separated by zero lines. Then output is 0. \n\nAnother case: all lines separate them. For example, n=300 lines, each separating them. Output is 300. \n\nSo the code handles all cases. \n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. The key insight is that each step involves crossing a line road, and the minimum number of steps corresponds to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions by infinite line roads. Each region (block) is defined by the sign of the equation of each line road. Moving from one block to another requires crossing a line road, which changes the sign of that line's equation.\n2. **Sign Analysis**: For each line road, we evaluate the sign of the equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the signs differ, it means the line road separates the home and university blocks.\n3. **Counting Separating Lines**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equal to the number of line roads that separate these two points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of line roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Signs**: For each line road, we compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the line separates the two points.\n3. **Counting Steps**: Each separating line contributes to one step in the journey from the home block to the university block. The total count of such lines gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of line roads.",
