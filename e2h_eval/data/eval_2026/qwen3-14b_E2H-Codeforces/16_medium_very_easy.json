Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how? Since each road divides the plane into regions, the blocks are determined by the arrangement of these lines. But directly representing all blocks isn't feasible, especially with up to 300 roads. That would be way too many regions.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the problem in terms of BFS. The key is to model the blocks as nodes in a graph, where edges exist between adjacent blocks. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks uniquely? Well, each block can be represented by a set of signs for each line. For example, for each road, the block lies on one side of the line. So, for each line equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0, a point (x,y) not on the line will satisfy either a_i x + b_i y + c_i > 0 or < 0. So, for each line, the block has a sign. The combination of all these signs could uniquely identify the block. However, since there are n roads, each with two possibilities, there are 2^n possible combinations. But with n up to 300, that's impossible to handle directly. Oh wait, but for n=300, 2^300 is way way too big. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nSo, what's another way? Maybe we can model the problem as a graph where each node represents the region (block) we are in, and edges represent adjacency. But again, how to represent the regions?\n\nAlternative idea: Since moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, which implies that the two blocks differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So, two blocks are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one road. Wait, but that's only if the two regions are separated by that road. But perhaps that's the case. So, for example, if two regions are separated by a single road, then they differ in exactly that road's sign. So, the adjacency between blocks is determined by differing in exactly one road's sign.\n\nBut how can we model this? Well, if we can assign to each block a unique identifier based on the signs of each road, then two blocks are adjacent if their identifiers differ in exactly one road's sign. But again, with n=300, storing all possible identifiers is impossible.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that we don't need to explore all possible blocks. We just need to find the shortest path between the home block and the university block. So perhaps we can perform BFS starting from the home block, and track which blocks we've visited, using their sign vectors as identifiers. However, even with n=300, the number of possible sign vectors is 2^300, which is way too big. But in practice, the BFS might not have to explore all of them. But for n=300, even that's impossible. So there's a problem here.\n\nWait, but maybe the number of blocks is actually manageable. Wait no, with n roads, the maximum number of regions created is O(n²), but for n=300, that's 90,000. But that's not the case here. For example, each new line can intersect all previous ones, leading to O(n²) regions. But with 300 roads, that's 90,000 regions. But how can we model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a region, and edges are between regions that are adjacent. But again, how to find the regions and their adjacency?\n\nAnother idea: Since each move between blocks requires crossing a road, and each road divides the plane into two parts. So, for any given point (like home or university), we can determine which side of each road it's on. Then, the home block is uniquely determined by the signs of all roads. Similarly for the university. Now, the problem becomes: find the minimal number of sign flips (each flip corresponds to crossing a road) needed to get from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, such that each step flips exactly one sign (since each step crosses exactly one road).\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Because when you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So, the minimal steps between the two sign vectors would be the number of roads where their signs differ, but that's only if you can flip each differing road once. But that's only possible if the differing roads can be traversed in sequence, each time flipping one sign. However, since each road is a line, and the regions are connected, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of differing roads divided by something? Or maybe not. Wait, suppose the home and university differ in k roads. Then, the minimal steps would be k? Because each step you can cross a road, flipping one sign. So, for example, if you have two differing roads, you can cross one, then cross the other. But wait, but maybe some roads are not adjacent. Wait, but the problem says that two regions are adjacent if they share a common border of non-zero length. Which would require that they differ in exactly one road. Because if two regions differ in exactly one road, then they are separated by that road, so their common border is that road. So, in that case, they are adjacent. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of differing roads between the home and university. Because each differing road can be crossed once. But that can't be right. For example, imagine that the home and university differ in two roads. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. But perhaps there's a way to cross one road, then another, but maybe that's not possible. Wait, but if you have two differing roads, you can cross each one once. So the minimal steps is the number of differing roads. Wait, but that seems too easy. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0, and 1x + 0y +0 =0 → x=0.\n\nSo the home (1,1) is in the region where y>0 (since y=1>0) and x>0 (since x=1>0). So the sign vector is (+, +). The university is (-1,-1): for y=-1 <0, and x=-1 <0. So sign vector is (-, -). The two differ in both roads. So according to this idea, the minimal steps is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. \n\nAnother sample input is the second example. Let me check:\n\nInput is:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nFor the home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1 (x=0): 1>0 → +.\n\nRoad 2 (y=0): 1>0 → +.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\n\nSo sign vector is (+, +, -).\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: -1 <0 → -.\n\nRoad 2: -1 <0 → -.\n\nRoad 3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -.\n\nSo sign vector is (-, -, -). \n\nThe differing roads are the first two. So two differences. So minimal steps is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo this seems to hold. So the answer is the number of roads where the home and university have different signs. \n\nWait, but why? How can we be sure that there's a path that requires exactly that number of steps?\n\nBecause each step can flip one sign. So, if you have k differing roads, you can cross each of those roads once. So the minimal steps is k. \n\nBut how to confirm that there's a path that allows this. For example, suppose that the home and university differ in two roads. Let's say roads A and B. Then, the home is in a region that is +A, +B. The university is -A, -B. How to get there? You can cross A first, changing to -A, +B. Then cross B, changing to -A, -B. So two steps. So yes, that works.\n\nBut what if the roads are arranged such that crossing one road leads to a region that is not adjacent to the target? Like, suppose there are three roads, and the home and university differ in two roads. But maybe the minimal steps is 2. \n\nSo, according to this logic, the answer is simply the number of roads where the home and university have different signs. \n\nBut wait, this seems too simple. What if there's a case where the home and university differ in an even number of roads, but there's a way to reach in fewer steps? Or perhaps not. \n\nLet me think. Suppose the home and university differ in two roads. Then, the minimal steps is 2. Because each step can flip one road. But what if there's a way to cross a road that's not in the differing set? For example, suppose that there's a third road that's same for both. But that wouldn't help. Because flipping a road that's same for both would take you to a region that's different in that road. But that would increase the number of differing roads. \n\nSo, the minimal steps would be the number of differing roads. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to: compute for each road, whether the home and university are on the same side of the road or not. The answer is the count of roads where they are on different sides.\n\nWait, but how can this be? Because the problem says that you can move between blocks if they share a common border. So, each step is moving across a road. So, the number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks. Because each such road must be crossed once. \n\nBut how to confirm that this is the case. Let's think of the home and university being in regions that are separated by k roads. Then, the minimal steps is k. \n\nThis seems to be the case. So the problem is reduced to counting how many roads separate the home and university. \n\nBut how to compute this. For each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. \n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If the signs of these two values are different (i.e., their product is negative), then this road separates the home and university. The number of such roads is the answer.\n\nBut wait, that's the case. Because if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then that road is part of the boundary between their blocks. So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate them.\n\nBut why? Because each such road must be crossed once. And each crossing is one step. \n\nYes. Because, for example, if there are k roads separating them, then each of those roads must be crossed once. And since each step crosses one road, the minimal steps is k. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to this simple calculation. \n\nBut why does this work? Because the regions are connected, and the roads form a planar graph. So, the minimal steps between two regions is the number of roads that separate them. \n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's take an example. Suppose there are two roads, and the home and university are separated by both. Then, the answer is 2. Which matches the first sample. \n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads. The home and university are separated by one road. Then the answer is 1. \n\nBut how can that be? Suppose that the two regions are separated by one road. Then you can cross that road once. So, answer is 1. \n\nSo the problem is really that simple. \n\nBut then why is the problem considered a programming problem? Because the solution is straightforward. \n\nSo the steps to code this are:\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), university coordinates (x2, y2). Read n roads. For each road, compute the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. If they are different, increment the count. Output that count.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So, for each road, the value a_i x + b_i y + c_i is not zero for both points. So, we can safely check the sign.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of the n roads:\n\n    a, b, c = coefficients.\n\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's test that.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0 1 0 (y=0) and 1 0 0 (x=0).\n\nFor first road: val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is negative. So count +=1.\n\nSecond road: val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1. val2 is 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1. product negative. So count is 2. Output is 2. Which matches.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0.\n\n0 1 0 → y=0.\n\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nroad1: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1 → positive.\n\nroad2: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1 → positive.\n\nroad3: 1+1-3 =-1 → negative.\n\nuniversity (-1,-1):\n\nroad1: -1 → negative.\n\nroad2: -1 → negative.\n\nroad3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 → negative.\n\nSo for road1: val1 is positive, val2 is negative. product negative → count +=1.\n\nroad2: same → count +=1.\n\nroad3: val1 is -1, val2 is -5. product is positive → no count.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because each road that separates the home and university must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is the number of such roads. \n\nThis seems to be the case. So the code is very simple. \n\nBut why is the problem considered a competitive programming problem? Because perhaps there's a trick here. Let me think again. Are there cases where the answer is not the count of roads separating the two points?\n\nSuppose there are two roads, and the home and university are separated by both. But the two roads are parallel. So the home and university are on opposite sides of each road. But how can you cross them? Well, you can cross each road once. So steps would be 2. Which matches the count. \n\nAnother case: three roads. Suppose that the home and university are separated by two roads, but those two roads are not adjacent. But the minimal steps would still be 2. \n\nSo the code seems to be correct. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. For each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides. The answer is the count of such roads.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 can't be zero. So the product can't be zero. So the code is safe.\n\nYes, this should work. \n\nBut why is the problem called \"Crazy Town\" and why is it considered a programming problem? Because perhaps the initial thought process is more complicated, but the actual solution is simple. \n\nThus, the code is as above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city with infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move between these regions. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks. \n\nFor each road, we check if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road by evaluating the sign of their respective positions relative to the road equation. If the signs differ, the road separates them, and thus, it must be crossed once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Sign Check for Each Road:** For each road defined by the equation $a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0$, we compute the value of this equation at both the home and university points.\n3. **Determine Separation:** If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road, meaning the road separates them.\n4. **Count Separating Roads:** The total count of such separating roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each road once, resulting in a time complexity of $O(n)$, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
