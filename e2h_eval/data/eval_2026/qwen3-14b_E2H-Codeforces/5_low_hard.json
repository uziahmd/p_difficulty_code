Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) are compatible if they are the same. A question mark (which represents an indefinite color) is compatible with any color, including another question mark. \n\nHmm. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair. So, we need to find a way to pair them optimally.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Let's break down the problem.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. One idea is to first pair the specific colors where both are the same. Then handle the question marks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a bipartite graph matching problem. But with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like maximum bipartite matching (like using Hopcroft-Karp) would be too slow. So we need a greedy approach or some efficient way to count and pair.\n\nSo, perhaps a greedy approach is better here. Let's think about the steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair as many specific color matches as possible. For example, for each color c (a-z), count the number of left boots with color c and the number of right boots with color c. The minimum of these two counts would be the number of pairs we can make for that color. However, we need to make sure that these are not overlapping with other pairings. But how to track which boots are already used?\n\nWait, but if we process each color in order, and pair them, then perhaps we can do that. But how to track which ones are used?\n\nBut given that the problem allows any valid pairing, maybe we can first pair all the same colors, then use the question marks to cover the remaining.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used as wildcards. So, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- First, pair the left and right boots with the same specific color. For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. Once those are paired, they can't be used again.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired), use the question marks. For example, pair left '?' with right '?', or left '?' with right specific color, or right '?' with left specific color.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be broken into three parts:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots with the same specific color (non '?').\n\n2. Pair left '?' with right non-? (but only if the right is not already paired).\n\n3. Pair right '?' with left non-? (but only if the left is not already paired).\n\n4. Pair the remaining '?' from left and right.\n\nBut how to manage the order here to maximize the total?\n\nAnother approach is to first process the same-color pairs. Then, collect all the left '?' and right '?', and pair them. But also, the leftover non-? boots (from left or right) that couldn't be matched with their own color can be matched with '?'s.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFirst, for each color c (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots (l_count[c]) and right boots (r_count[c]). For each color, the number of pairs is min(l_count[c], r_count[c]). However, we need to actually track which boots are used here.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently? Well, perhaps for each color, we can iterate through the left and right boots and pair them. But since the order might affect the rest, perhaps we need to process the colors in some order. But for maximum pairs, it's probably best to process the colors with higher counts first? Or maybe it's not necessary. Let's think: suppose we have a color 'a' with 5 left and 3 right. We pair 3 of them. Then, the remaining 2 left 'a's can be matched with right '?'s. Similarly for other colors.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nPerhaps, for each color c (other than '?'), we can pair as many as possible between left and right. For that, we can create a list of indices for each color in left and right. Then, for each color, take the min of the counts, and pair the first min elements. For example, for color 'a', left_indices and right_indices. Then, pair the first k elements of left with the first k elements of right, where k is min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices)).\n\nOnce those are paired, we can mark them as used. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired), we can collect the left '?' and right '?'.\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors, where a color can be a specific lowercase letter or a wildcard ('?'). The solution involves efficiently pairing boots using a greedy approach.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), pair as many left boots with the same color as right boots. This ensures that specific color matches are utilized first.\n2. **Handle Wildcards**: After pairing specific colors, use the remaining wildcards ('?') from both left and right boots to form pairs. Wildcards can match any color, including other wildcards.\n3. **Track Used Boots**: Maintain arrays to track which boots have been used in pairs to ensure each boot is used at most once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # Prepare data structures\n    left_used = [False] * n\n    right_used = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Pair same color (non-?)\n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # For each color, collect indices of left and right boots\n    left_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    # Process each color\n    for color in left_color_map:\n        if color in right_color_map:\n            left_list = left_color_map[color]\n            right_list = right_color_map[color]\n            min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(min_len):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n                    pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                    left_used[left_idx] = True\n                    right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n    # Step 2: Pair left ? with right non-?\n    # Collect all left ? indices not used\n    left_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not left_used[i]:\n            left_q.append(i)\n\n    # Collect all right non-? indices not used\n    right_nonq = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if r[i] != '?' and not right_used[i]:\n            right_nonq.append(i)\n\n    # Pair left ? with right non-?\n    for left_i in left_q:\n        for right_i in right_nonq:\n            if not left_used[left_i] and not right_used[right_i]:\n                pairs.append((left_i + 1, right_i + 1))\n                left_used[left_i] = True\n                right_used[right_i] = True\n                break  # Each left ? can be used once\n\n    # Step 3: Pair right ? with left non-?\n    # Collect all right ? indices not used\n    right_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if r[i] == '?' and not right_used[i]:\n            right_q.append(i)\n\n    # Collect all left non-? indices not used\n    left_nonq = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?' and not left_used[i]:\n            left_nonq.append(i)\n\n    # Pair right ? with left non-?\n    for right_i in right_q:\n        for left_i in left_nonq:\n            if not left_used[left_i] and not right_used[right_i]:\n                pairs.append((left_i + 1, right_i + 1))\n                left_used[left_i] = True\n                right_used[right_i] = True\n                break  # Each right ? can be used once\n\n    # Step 4: Pair remaining ? with ?\n    # Collect remaining left ? and right ?\n    left_q_remaining = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not left_used[i]:\n            left_q_remaining.append(i)\n    right_q_remaining = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if r[i] == '?' and not right_used[i]:\n            right_q_remaining.append(i)\n\n    # Pair them\n    min_len = min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        left_idx = left_q_remaining[i]\n        right_idx = right_q_remaining[i]\n        if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n            pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n            left_used[left_idx] = True\n            right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\n# To handle large input, use threading to avoid recursion limit issues\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Color Mapping**: We map each specific color (excluding '?') to the indices of left and right boots.\n3. **Pairing Specific Colors**: For each color, we pair the left and right boots with that color, ensuring they haven't been used already.\n4. **Handling Wildcards**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining wildcards by pairing them with non-wildcard boots and then with each other.\n5. **Output**: The results are printed, showing the maximum number of pairs and their indices.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs efficiently, considering both specific colors and wildcards.",
