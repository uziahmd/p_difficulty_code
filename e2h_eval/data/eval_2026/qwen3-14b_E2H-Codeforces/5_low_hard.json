Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about pairing left and right boots with compatible colors. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') is compatible only with another same color or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'.\n\nSo the challenge is to pair as many left and right boots as possible under these rules. And we have to output the actual pairs too, not just the count.\n\nLet me think about the steps required here. Maybe we can approach this by first handling the pairs where both are specific colors. Then handle the ones involving question marks.\n\nBut how to maximize the pairs? Let's think of it as a bipartite graph matching problem. However, given that n can be up to 150,000, standard algorithms like maximum bipartite matching (like Hopcroft-Karp) would be too slow. So we need a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. First, match all left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same specific color. For example, if there's a left boot with color 'a', find a right boot with 'a' and pair them. This would be optimal since they can't be paired with anything else except their own color.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nWe can count the frequencies of each color in left and right boots. For each color c (not '?'), the number of possible pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But since each left and right can be used once, we need to track which ones are already matched.\n\nWait, but this approach might not work directly because the positions matter. For example, if a left boot has color 'a' and a right boot has color 'a', we can pair them. But if there are multiple such pairs, we need to choose which ones to pair.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process the specific colors first, then handle the question marks.\n\nAnother idea: For each color c (excluding '?'), pair as many left and right boots of color c as possible. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either '?', or have colors that couldn't be matched), pair them using the question marks.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots with specific colors.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n- Find all left boots with color c that haven't been paired yet.\n- Find all right boots with color c that haven't been paired yet.\n- Pair them as much as possible. For example, take the minimum of the counts, and pair them.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used? Maybe we can have two arrays (or sets) to track which left and right boots are already used.\n\nBut for large n, we need an efficient way. For example, for each color c, collect the indices of left boots with color c, and same for right boots. Then, for each color, pair the first min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) pairs.\n\nBut how to track which ones are already used? Well, perhaps we can have two boolean arrays (used_left and used_right) that mark whether a boot is already used in a pair.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize used_left and used_right as all False.\n- For each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n   - Collect all left indices with color c and not used.\n   - Collect all right indices with color c and not used.\n   - Pair as many as possible. For each pair, mark them as used.\n\nOnce that's done, we have some left and right boots left. These are either:\n\n- Left boots with color '?', or right boots with color '?', or left/right boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired (but that's impossible since we've already handled all specific colors).\n\nWait, no. For example, if there's a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with color 'a', they are paired. But suppose there are more left 'a's than right 'a's. The excess left 'a's will remain unpaired. Similarly for right.\n\nSo after step 1, the remaining left boots are those with color '?', or specific colors that couldn't be paired (but those specific colors can't be paired with any other specific color except their own, which have been processed already). So the remaining left boots with specific colors can't be paired with any right boots except with '?', but since we've already processed all same-color pairs, those left boots with specific colors can't be paired anymore. So they are left out.\n\nThen, step 2: pair the remaining left and right boots, which can include '?'.\n\nNow, the remaining left and right boots can be paired in any way, as long as their colors are",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to pair left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The compatibility rules are as follows: specific colors must match exactly, while a question mark ('?') can pair with any color, including another question mark.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Specific Color Matching**: First, we match left boots with specific colors to right boots of the same specific color. This ensures that all possible direct matches are made.\n2. **Question Mark Matching**: After handling specific color matches, we use the remaining question marks on both left and right boots to form pairs. Question marks can be paired with any remaining boot (specific or question mark), so we handle these next.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Match specific colors\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    left_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    for c in left_color_map:\n        if c in right_color_map:\n            left_list = left_color_map[c]\n            right_list = right_color_map[c]\n            cnt = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(cnt):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n                    pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                    used_left[left_idx] = True\n                    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\n    # Step 2: Match left '?' with right non-?
