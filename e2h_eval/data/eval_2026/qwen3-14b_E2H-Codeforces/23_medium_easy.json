In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and I have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible cases. For the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimum number of tiles to add to make it possible.\n\nBut how do I check if the current tiles form a mentsu?\n\nFor a triplet: all three tiles must be the same. So for example, 9m 9m 9m. So in that case, output is 0.\n\nFor a sequence: the three tiles must be consecutive numbers in the same suit. Like 1s 2s 3s. But they can be in any order. So for example, 3s 2s 1s is also a sequence.\n\nSo first step: check if the current three tiles already form a triplet or a sequence. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to calculate how many more tiles to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: The three tiles can form a triplet by adding one or two tiles. For example, if there are two same tiles. Then adding one more would make a triplet. So for example, if the tiles are 1m 1m 2m. Then adding another 1m would form a triplet. So in this case, the answer would be 1.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way to form a sequence with fewer additions.\n\nSo the approach is to check all possibilities for forming a triplet or sequence, and find the minimal steps needed.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, for each possible way to form a triplet or sequence, calculate how many tiles are needed to be added, and take the minimum among all possibilities.\n\nSo, for the triplet case:\n\nWe can count the frequency of each tile. For example, if there are two of the same tile, then we need 1 more. If there's one, then need 2 more. But maybe there are multiple possibilities here.\n\nBut for the triplet, the three tiles must be same. So, for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then to form a triplet, you can add one 1m. So the required is 1.\n\nBut if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3m. Then to form a triplet, you need to add two tiles. For example, two 1m's (so you have three 1m's) but that would require two additions. Or maybe other options. But maybe there's a better way to form a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, for the sequence case, perhaps adding one tile can complete a sequence. For example, if the tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then adding 3m would form a sequence. So that's one addition.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal between the required steps for triplet and the required steps for sequence.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCheck if the current tiles already have a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal steps required to form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet's break down into steps.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles can form a triplet. That's when all three are same. If not, then to form a triplet, we need to add some tiles. For example, if there are two same tiles, then adding one more. Or if there's one tile, then adding two more. But maybe there are other possibilities. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Then to form a triplet, you need to add two more of any of them. But that would require two additions. However, maybe forming a sequence is better.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, the minimal steps needed would be based on the counts of each tile. For example, for each tile type, count how many times it appears. Then, for each tile type, the number of tiles needed to reach three is (3 - count). The minimal among these would be the steps required for triplet.\n\nWait, but in the case where there are multiple different tile types, like two different tiles. For example, if the tiles are 1m, 1m, 2p. Then, to form a triplet, you can choose to add one more 1m (so 3-2=1) or add two 2p (3-1=2). So the minimal is 1. So the minimal steps for triplet is min(3 - count for each tile type).\n\nBut wait, the current tiles may have multiple tile types. For example, if there are two different types, then the minimal steps would be the minimal between (3 - count for each type). Because you can choose to form a triplet of any of the existing tile types.\n\nBut if there's no existing tile that has at least one occurrence, then you need to create a new triplet. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then to form a triplet, you need to add two tiles of any type. For example, add two 1m's. So steps is 2.\n\nSo for the triplet case, the minimal steps is min(3 - count for each tile type in the current hand). But since the current hand has three tiles, the count for each tile type can be 1, 2, or 3. For example, if the current tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then the count for 1m is 2, 2m is 1. So for triplet, the minimal steps is 1 (adding one more 1m).\n\nSo for the triplet case, the steps needed would be the minimal (3 - count) for each tile type. But since the current hand has three tiles, the sum of counts is three. So, for example, if there are three different tiles, then each count is 1, so 3 - 1 = 2. So steps would be 2.\n\nNow, for the sequence case. How to check if adding some tiles can form a sequence.\n\nThe sequence requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So, for example, the current tiles may have two tiles of the same suit, but not consecutive. Or one tile of same suit, etc.\n\nSo, for the sequence case, we need to check all possible sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For the three current tiles, perhaps they can be part of a sequence. For example, if the tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then adding 3s gives a sequence. So steps is 1.\n\nOr, if the tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s. Then adding 2s and 4s would form a sequence. But that's two steps. However, maybe there's a way to form a sequence with fewer steps. Wait, but that's not possible. Because for a sequence, you need three consecutive numbers. So in this case, the existing tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s. To form a sequence, you could add 2s and 4s to get 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, or 4-5-6? No. Wait, the existing tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s. Suppose you add 2s and 4s. Then you can have 1s, 2s, 3s (but you have 1s, 3s, and 2s). So that's a sequence. So you need two steps. But maybe there's another way. For example, if you add 2s and 3s, but that would require more steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to form a sequence by adding only one tile. But how? For example, if the current tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Adding 3s gives a sequence. So steps is 1.\n\nSo the idea is to check for all possible sequences that can be formed with the current tiles plus some added tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nFor the sequence, the three tiles must be in the same suit. So first, we can group the current tiles by their suits. For example, if the current tiles are in different suits, then the sequence must be formed in one of the suits. But if there are multiple suits, then perhaps the best option is to try to form a sequence in one of the suits that has the most tiles.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nLet me think: for each suit present in the current tiles, check what's the minimal steps needed to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nFor example, suppose the current tiles are 1s, 2p, 3s. So, the suits are s and p. So for the s suit, the tiles are 1s and 3s. For the p suit, there is 2p. So for each suit, we can look at the numbers present and see what's the minimal steps to form a sequence.\n\nSo, for the suit s, the numbers are 1 and 3. To form a sequence, we need three consecutive numbers. So possible sequences could be 1,2,3 (needs 2s), or 2,3,4 (needs 2s and 4s?), etc. But how to find the minimal steps?\n\nAlternatively, for each suit, collect all the numbers present in the current tiles, then find the minimal steps needed to add tiles to form a sequence.\n\nLet me think of an approach for a particular suit. Suppose in that suit, the current numbers are [a, b, c]. But since there are three tiles in total, but perhaps in the same suit, maybe there are 1, 2, or 3 numbers. For example, if all three tiles are in the same suit, then the numbers are three values. For example, 1s, 2s, 4s. Then, to form a sequence, you need to add 3s. So steps is 1.\n\nBut if the numbers are 1s, 3s, 5s. Then, to form a sequence, you need to add two tiles (like 2s and 4s), steps is 2.\n\nBut what if the numbers are 1s, 1s, 2s. Then, in the same suit, the numbers are 1, 1, 2. So for a sequence, you need three consecutive numbers. So possible sequences could be 1,2,3 (need 3s). So steps is 1. Or 2,3,4 (need 3,4, but you have 2s. So need two tiles. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo how to model this?\n\nFor a given suit, collect the numbers present. For example, for the current tiles in that suit, we can have a list of numbers. Let's say we have a list S of numbers (with duplicates). Then, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For each such possible sequence, compute how many tiles are missing in the current hand for that sequence. Then, the minimal steps needed is the minimal of those counts.\n\nFor example, for the current suit, possible sequences could be 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9. For each of these sequences, check how many of the numbers are already present in the current hand. The required steps is 3 minus the count of numbers present in the current hand for that sequence.\n\nBut since the current hand may have duplicates, but for a sequence, each number is needed once. For example, if the current hand has two 1s and one 2 in the same suit. Then, for the sequence 1-2-3, we need to have at least one 1, one 2, and one 3. So the current hand has 1 and 2, but not 3. So steps is 1 (add 3). For the sequence 1-1-1, that's a triplet, not a sequence. So sequences are only three consecutive numbers, each appearing once.\n\nSo for the sequence case, we need to find for each possible triplet of consecutive numbers in the same suit, how many of the numbers are missing from the current hand. The minimal steps for that suit is the minimal over all possible sequences. Then, for each suit, compute that, and take the overall minimal steps across all suits.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's take the example of the current hand's tiles. For each suit, collect the set of numbers present. For example, if the current hand has 1s, 2s, 4s, then in suit 's', the numbers are {1, 2, 4}.\n\nThen, for all possible sequences (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, etc.), check how many numbers are in the current set. For example, for the sequence 1-2-3, the current set has 1 and 2. So missing is 3. Steps needed is 1. For the sequence 2-3-4, current has 2 and 4. Missing is 3. Steps needed is 1. For the sequence 3-4-5, current has 4. Missing 3 and 5. Steps needed 2. So the minimal steps for this suit is 1.\n\nSo the minimal steps for forming a sequence in this suit is 1. Then, compare that with the steps required for other suits.\n\nSo the overall steps for the sequence case would be the minimal steps across all possible suits.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor the current hand:\n\nCheck if already has a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the minimal steps for triplet (as discussed earlier).\n\nCompute the minimal steps for sequence (as discussed above, for each suit).\n\nTake the minimal between the two (triplet steps and sequence steps).\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nFirst, parse the input. The input is three strings. For example, '1s 2s 3s' is one of the test cases.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of three strings. Wait, looking back at the example input:\n\nThe input is given as ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'].\n\nWait, the input is three strings. Wait, the original problem says the input is three strings. So the input line is three strings separated by spaces. Wait, no, the input is given as a single line with three strings, each being the tile. For example, in the sample input, the input is given as three separate entries, but in code, the user would read them as a list.\n\nBut the actual input is a single line with three strings, separated by spaces. For example, the first example input is '1s 2s 3s', but that's three tiles. Wait, no. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting mistake. Because the actual input is a single line with three strings. For example, the first case is three tiles: \"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\". So the input line would be \"1s 2s 3s\".\n\nSo in Python, the code will read the input as a single line split into three parts. For example, input().split() would give a list of three elements.\n\nSo, the code would read the three tiles as a list, like tiles = input().split().\n\nOnce I have the three tiles, I can process them.\n\nNow, first step: check if the current three tiles form a mentsu (triplet or sequence).\n\nTo check for triplet: all three tiles are same. For example, all three are '9m'.\n\nTo check for sequence: the three tiles are in the same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo, for checking triplet:\n\nif all three are same, then yes.\n\nFor checking sequence:\n\nCheck if all three have the same suit. Then, extract their numbers, sort them, and check if they are consecutive.\n\nFor example, numbers sorted as [1,2,3], then yes.\n\nBut how to handle the numbers? For example, for the three tiles, extract the number part as integers.\n\nSo, for example, tile '1s' has number 1, suit 's'.\n\nSo for the three tiles, let's collect their numbers and suits.\n\nLet me write code for that.\n\nOnce I have the three tiles, I can process them into a list of (number, suit) pairs.\n\nFor example:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\ntiles_info = []\nfor t in tiles:\n    num = int(t[0])\n    suit = t[1]\n    tiles_info.append( (num, suit) )\n\nThen, check for triplet:\n\nif all three have same num and suit.\n\nFor sequence:\n\nall three have same suit, and when sorted, their numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, check:\n\nif all suits are same, then:\n\nsorted_nums = sorted([n for n, s in tiles_info])\n\nif sorted_nums[1] == sorted_nums[0] + 1 and sorted_nums[2] == sorted_nums[1] + 1.\n\nIf yes, then it's a sequence.\n\nIf either of triplet or sequence is true, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, need to compute steps.\n\nNow, if the initial check fails, then we need to compute the minimal steps.\n\nSo, first, compute the steps for triplet.\n\nFor the triplet steps:\n\nWe can count the frequency of each tile. For example, for the three tiles, count how many times each (num, suit) occurs.\n\nBut since the triplet requires three identical tiles, the minimal steps would be (3 - max_count), where max_count is the maximum frequency of any tile in the current hand.\n\nFor example, if the current hand has two of the same tile, then 3 - 2 = 1 step needed. If the current hand has one of a tile, then 3-1=2 steps. But if there are multiple tiles with different counts, like one tile with count 1 and another with count 1, then the max count is 1, so steps would be 2.\n\nSo for triplet steps, the minimal steps is (3 - max_count).\n\nBut wait, what if the current hand has two different tiles, each with count 1 and 2? For example, tiles are 1m, 1m, 2p. Then the max count is 2, steps is 1.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the steps for triplet is 3 - max_count.\n\nNow, for the sequence steps.\n\nFor the sequence steps, we need to check for each suit present in the current hand, what is the minimal steps needed to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nSo, first, group the tiles by suit. For example, for the current tiles, collect for each suit the list of numbers present.\n\nFor example, if the tiles are 1s, 2p, 3s, then for suit 's' we have numbers [1,3], for suit 'p' [2].\n\nThen, for each suit, we need to find the minimal steps to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nFor each suit, collect the set of numbers present in the current hand.\n\nThen, for that suit, generate all possible sequences (three consecutive numbers) and compute how many numbers are missing in the current set.\n\nThe minimal steps for that suit is the minimal (3 - count of numbers present in the current set for that sequence).\n\nFor example, for suit 's' with numbers {1, 3}, the possible sequences are:\n\n1-2-3: current has 1 and 3. Missing 2. Steps needed 1.\n\n2-3-4: current has 3. Missing 2 and 4. Steps needed 2.\n\nSo the minimal steps for this suit is 1.\n\nAnother example: suit 'p' with numbers {2}. Possible sequences:\n\n1-2-3: missing 1 and 3. Steps 2.\n\n2-3-4: missing 3 and 4. Steps 2.\n\netc. So minimal steps is 2.\n\nSo, for the suit, the minimal steps is the minimal among all possible sequences in that suit.\n\nOnce we find that for each suit, then the overall sequence steps is the minimal among all suits.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences for a suit?\n\nEach sequence is a triplet (x, x+1, x+2), where x ranges from 1 to 7 (since x+2 can't exceed 9).\n\nSo for each suit, for x in 1..7:\n\nCheck how many of the numbers x, x+1, x+2 are present in the current suit's numbers.\n\nThe required steps for this sequence is 3 - (number of present numbers in the current set).\n\nBut since the current set may have duplicates, but for a sequence, each number needs to be present at least once.\n\nSo for example, if the current suit has numbers [1, 1, 2], then for the sequence 1-2-3, the numbers 1, 2 are present. So steps needed is 1 (add 3).\n\nSo for each sequence, the count of numbers in the current set is the number of distinct numbers in the current set that are in the sequence.\n\nSo, for the current suit's numbers, we can make a set (to avoid duplicates) and then for each possible sequence, check how many of the three numbers are in the set.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each suit in the current hand:\n\ncurrent_numbers = set of numbers in that suit.\n\nfor x in 1 to 7:\n\nsequence = {x, x+1, x+2}\n\ncount = len( current_numbers & sequence )\n\nsteps_needed = 3 - count\n\nkeep track of the minimal steps_needed for this suit.\n\nSo, for each suit, compute the minimal steps_needed for any of the possible sequences. Then, take the minimal among all suits.\n\nBut if a suit has less than two numbers, then it's possible that no sequence can be formed with adding few tiles. For example, if a suit has only one number, then the minimal steps for that suit is 2 (like adding two numbers to form a sequence).\n\nBut for example, if the suit has one number (say 2), then possible sequences are 1-2-3 (needs 1 and 3) → steps 2, 2-3-4 (needs 3 and 4) → steps 2, etc. So the minimal steps is 2.\n\nSo, the code for the sequence steps is:\n\nmin_sequence_steps = infinity\n\nfor each suit in suits present in the current hand:\n\n    current_numbers = set of numbers in that suit.\n\n    for x in 1..7:\n\n        required = {x, x+1, x+2}\n\n        present = current_numbers & required\n\n        steps = 3 - len(present)\n\n        if steps < min_sequence_steps:\n\n            min_sequence_steps = steps\n\nso the overall sequence steps is min_sequence_steps.\n\nBut what if there are no suits? Well, the current hand has three tiles, so there must be at least one suit.\n\nOnce we compute the minimal steps for triplet and the minimal steps for sequence, the answer is the minimum between the two.\n\nSo, the overall steps for the problem would be:\n\nif current has mentsu: 0\n\nelse:\n\ntriplet_steps = 3 - max_count\n\nsequence_steps = compute as above\n\nresult = min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps)\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple suits? For example, if the current hand has tiles in two suits. For example, 1s, 2s, 3p. Then, for the sequence steps, we check both suits. For suit 's', numbers are 1 and 2. So possible sequences for suit 's' are 1-2-3 (need 3, steps 1). For suit 'p', numbers are 3. So possible sequences for suit 'p' are 1-2-3 (needs 1,2 → steps 2), 2-3-4 (needs 2,4 → steps 2), etc. So the minimal steps for sequence is 1. So the overall sequence steps is 1. So the result would be min( triplet_steps, 1).\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: ['1s', '2s', '3s'].\n\nCheck if it's a sequence. Yes. So output is 0.\n\nSecond example input: ['9m', '9m', '9m']. Triplet, output 0.\n\nThird example input: ['3p', '9m', '2p'].\n\nCheck if it's a mentsu. Not a triplet (they are all different). Check for sequence: the suits are p, m, p. So the suits are not same. So no sequence. So need to compute steps.\n\nTriplet steps: the counts for each tile are:\n\n3p: 1, 9m:1, 2p:1. Max count is 1. So triplet steps is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nSequence steps: check each suit.\n\nSuit 'p' has numbers 3 and 2. Suit 'm' has 9.\n\nFor suit 'p':\n\ncurrent_numbers = {2,3}\n\nCheck all x from 1 to 7:\n\nx=1: sequence 1,2,3. current has 2 and 3. steps 1 (need 1).\n\nx=2: sequence 2,3,4. current has 2 and 3. steps 1 (need 4).\n\nx=3: sequence 3,4,5. current has 3. steps 2.\n\nothers would have higher steps. So for suit p, the minimal steps is 1.\n\nFor suit 'm' has number 9. So possible sequences are 7-8-9 (needs 7 and 8 → steps 2), 8-9-10 (invalid since 10 is beyond 9). So the minimal steps for suit m is 2.\n\nSo overall sequence steps is 1. So the answer is min(2, 1) → 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that works.\n\nAnother example: input is 1m, 1m, 2m. So current tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m.\n\nCheck if it's a mentsu: no triplet (only two 1m), no sequence (numbers are 1,1,2. sorted is 1,1,2. not consecutive. So no. So steps.\n\nTriplet steps: max count is 2 (two 1m). steps is 1.\n\nSequence steps: suit m has numbers {1, 2}.\n\nCheck possible sequences:\n\nx=1: 1,2,3. current has 1 and 2. steps 1 (add 3).\n\nx=2: 2,3,4. current has 2. steps 2.\n\nso minimal steps for suit m is 1. So overall sequence steps is 1. So answer is min(1, 1) → 1.\n\nWhich is correct. Because adding one tile (3m) gives a sequence.\n\nAnother example: tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. So for sequence steps:\n\nsuit m has numbers {1,3,5}.\n\nCheck all sequences:\n\nx=1: 1,2,3. current has 1 and 3 → steps 1 (add 2).\n\nx=2: 2,3,4. current has 3 → steps 2 (add 2 and 4).\n\nx=3: 3,4,5. current has 3 and 5 → steps 1 (add 4).\n\nx=4: 4,5,6 → current has 5 → steps 2.\n\nx=5: 5,6,7 → steps 2.\n\netc. So the minimal steps for suit m is 1. So the answer is min( (triplet steps: 3-1=2), 1) → 1.\n\nSo adding 2m or 4m would allow a sequence.\n\nAnother case: tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. So for sequence steps, the suit m has numbers {1,2,4}.\n\nPossible sequences:\n\nx=1: 1,2,3. current has 1,2 → steps 1 (add 3).\n\nx=2: 2,3,4. current has 2,4 → steps 1 (add 3).\n\nx=3: 3,4,5 → current has 4 → steps 2.\n\nSo minimal steps is 1.\n\nThus, answer is min(3-1=2, 1) → 1.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, what about when the current hand has two tiles in one suit and one in another. For example, tiles are 1s, 1s, 2p. So for triplet steps, max count is 2 → steps 1. For sequence steps, check each suit.\n\nSuit 's' has numbers {1} (since two 1s). So for sequences in suit s:\n\npossible sequences:\n\nx=1: 1-2-3 → current has 1. steps 2 (add 2 and 3).\n\nx=2: 2-3-4 → steps 3 (need 2,3,4).\n\netc. So minimal steps for suit s is 2.\n\nSuit 'p' has {2} → steps for sequences would be 2 (like add 1 and 3). So overall sequence steps is 2. So answer is min(1, 2) → 1.\n\nWhich is correct: adding one tile (another 1s) gives a triplet.\n\nNow, what if the current hand has tiles that can be part of multiple sequences?\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nNow, code implementation steps:\n\nImplement the following steps:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, compute triplet steps and sequence steps.\n\nReturn min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps).\n\nSo, code:\n\nFirst, parse the three tiles into their numbers and suits.\n\nThen check for triplet or sequence.\n\nFor checking triplet:\n\nif all three tiles are same.\n\nFor checking sequence:\n\nif all suits are same, and sorted numbers are consecutive.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\ntiles_info = []\nfor t in tiles:\n    num = int(t[0])\n    suit = t[1]\n    tiles_info.append( (num, suit) )\n\n# Check for mentsu\nis_triplet = (tiles_info[0] == tiles_info[1] == tiles_info[2])\nif is_triplet:\n    print(0)\n    exit()\n\n# Check for sequence\nsuits = [t[1] for t in tiles_info]\nif all(s == suits[0] for s in suits):\n    nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles_info])\n    if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n        print(0)\n        exit()\n\n# Now, no mentsu yet. Compute steps.\n\n# Compute triplet steps\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounts = Counter(tiles_info)\nmax_count = max(counts.values())\ntriplet_steps = 3 - max_count\n\n# Compute sequence steps\n# group by suit\nsuit_dict = {}\nfor num, suit in tiles_info:\n    if suit not in suit_dict:\n        suit_dict[suit] = set()\n    suit_dict[suit].add(num)\n\nmin_sequence_steps = float('inf')\n\nfor suit in suit_dict:\n    current_numbers = suit_dict[suit]\n    # for all possible sequences in this suit\n    for x in range(1, 8):  # x can be 1-7, since x+2 <=9\n        required = {x, x+1, x+2}\n        present = current_numbers & required\n        steps = 3 - len(present)\n        if steps < min_sequence_steps:\n            min_sequence_steps = steps\n\nsequence_steps = min_sequence_steps\n\nresult = min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps)\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple suits, but for none of them can form a sequence? For example, the current hand has one tile in three different suits. Like 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, for each suit, the current numbers are {1}, {2}, {3}.\n\nFor each suit, the minimal steps is 2 (for example, for suit m, the sequence 1-2-3 requires adding 2 and 3 → steps 2). So the sequence_steps would be 2. triplet steps would be 3 - 1 = 2. So the answer is 2.\n\nBut what if there's a better way? For example, adding two tiles to form a triplet. But that would be steps 2. So the code returns 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 3p 9m 2p. As in the third example. The code would compute:\n\ntriplet steps: 3-1=2.\n\nsequence steps:\n\nsuit_dict is {'p': {2,3}, 'm': {9}}.\n\nfor suit p:\n\ncheck x from 1-7:\n\nx=1: required {1,2,3} → present {2,3} → steps 1.\n\nso min_sequence_steps is 1.\n\nfor suit m: required sequences:\n\nfor x=7: {7,8,9} → present {9} → steps 2.\n\nso overall min_sequence_steps is 1. So result is min(2,1)=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1m 1m 2m. triplet steps is 1. sequence steps:\n\nsuit m has {1,2}.\n\nfor x=1: steps 1 (add 3). So sequence steps is 1. result is 1.\n\nSo code returns 1.\n\nAnother case: input is 1m 3m 5m. triplet steps is 3-1=2. sequence steps: for suit m, check x=1 (1,2,3) → present 1,3 → steps 1 (add 2). x=3: 3,4,5 → present 3,5 → steps 1 (add 4). So sequence steps is 1. So answer is 1.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where all three tiles are in different suits and numbers. For example, 1m, 2p, 3s. Then:\n\ntriplet steps is 3-1=2.\n\nsequence steps: for each suit, the numbers are {1}, {2}, {3}. For each suit, the minimal steps is 2 (for example, for suit m, need to add 2 and 3 to form 1-2-3). So sequence steps is 2. So answer is min(2, 2) → 2.\n\nAnother case: tiles are 1m, 1m, 3m. So triplet steps is 3-2=1. For sequence steps, in suit m, numbers are {1,3}. For x=1: 1,2,3 → present 1 and 3 → steps 1 (add 2). So sequence steps is 1. So answer is 1. Which is better than triplet steps (1). So answer is 1.\n\nSo code returns min(1, 1) = 1.\n\nAnother case: tiles are 1m, 1m, 1p. Then triplet steps is 3-2=1 (since two 1m's, but to form triplet, you can choose to add 1m (steps 1) or 1p (steps 2). So the code's triplet steps is 3 - max_count (which is 2) → 1. Correct.\n\nBut what about sequence steps? For suits m and p. For suit m, numbers {1}, steps for sequence is 2. For suit p, numbers {1}, steps for sequence is 2. So sequence steps is 2. So answer is 1.\n\nSo code returns 1.\n\nAnother edge case: tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. So for sequence steps, the suit m has {1,2,4}. For x=1: sequence 1-2-3. present 1 and 2 → steps 1. So sequence steps is 1. triplet steps is 3-1=2. So answer is 1.\n\nAll seems correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut wait, the code for checking the sequence in the initial check is:\n\nif all(s == suits[0] for s in suits):\n\nthen check the sorted numbers.\n\nBut the code for that part is:\n\nsuits = [t[1] for t in tiles_info]\n\nif all(s == suits[0] for s in suits):\n\n    nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles_info])\n\n    if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n\n        print(0)\n\n        exit",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid meld (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking if the current tiles already form a valid meld and, if not, calculating the minimum number of tiles required to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Immediate Meld**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence.\n2. **Triplet Calculation**: If the tiles do not form an immediate meld, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet by considering the frequency of each tile.\n3. **Sequence Calculation**: For each suit present in the tiles, determine the minimum number of tiles needed to form a sequence by checking all possible sequences within that suit.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value between the steps required to form a triplet and the steps required to form a sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    tiles = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    tiles_info = []\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suit = t[1]\n        tiles_info.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Check for triplet\n    is_triplet = (tiles_info[0] == tiles_info[1] == tiles_info[2])\n    if is_triplet:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Check for sequence\n    suits = [t[1] for t in tiles_info]\n    if all(s == suits[0] for s in suits):\n        nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles_info])\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n            print(0)\n            return\n    \n    # Compute triplet steps\n    counts = Counter(tiles_info)\n    max_count = max(counts.values())\n    triplet_steps = 3 - max_count\n    \n    # Compute sequence steps\n    suit_dict = {}\n    for num, suit in tiles_info:\n        if suit not in suit_dict:\n            suit_dict[suit] = set()\n        suit_dict[suit].add(num)\n    \n    min_sequence_steps = float('inf')\n    for suit in suit_dict:\n        current_numbers = suit_dict[suit]\n        for x in range(1, 8):  # x can be 1-7\n            required = {x, x+1, x+2}\n            present = current_numbers & required\n            steps = 3 - len(present)\n            if steps < min_sequence_steps:\n                min_sequence_steps = steps\n    \n    sequence_steps = min_sequence_steps\n    result = min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Immediate Meld Check**: The code first checks if the given tiles form a triplet or a sequence directly. If they do, it prints `0` immediately.\n2. **Triplet Steps Calculation**: Using a counter, the code determines the maximum frequency of any tile. The steps needed to form a triplet are calculated as `3 - max_frequency`.\n3. **Sequence Steps Calculation**: For each suit present in the tiles, the code checks all possible sequences (three consecutive numbers) and calculates how many tiles are needed to complete each sequence. The minimum steps required across all suits are determined.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum of the steps required to form a triplet and the steps required to form a sequence, ensuring the optimal solution is found efficiently.",
