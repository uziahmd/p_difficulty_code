    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to consider each element, remove it, compute the new max and min, and then find the minimum instability. But if we do this naively, it would be O(n^2) time, which isn't feasible for n up to 1e5. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, what's the original instability? It's max(a) - min(a). When we remove one element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nIf the element we remove is not the current max or min, then the max and min remain the same. So the instability remains the same as the original. But if we remove the max, then the new max is the second highest element. Similarly, if we remove the min, the new min is the second lowest. So maybe the optimal choice is to remove either the max or the min, but not sure.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are multiple instances of max or min. For example, if the array has multiple max elements, removing one of them would leave others, so the max remains the same. So in that case, removing a max element doesn't change the max. So the instability would be (max - new min) if we remove a min, or (new max - min) if we remove a max. But how do we find the best option?\n\nSo here's an idea: the minimal instability after removing one element can be achieved by either:\n\n1. Removing the first occurrence of the max, which would make the new max the second max. Then the instability is (second_max - min).\n2. Removing the first occurrence of the min, which would make the new min the second min. Then the instability is (max - second_min).\n3. Or, perhaps, there's a scenario where removing some other element (not the max or min) could lead to a better instability. Wait, but if you remove an element that's not the max or min, then the max and min stay the same, so the instability remains the same as original. So unless the original instability is already the minimal possible, but that's only possible if all elements are the same. Otherwise, removing a non-max/min element would not help. Therefore, the optimal choice must be either removing a max or a min.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple maxes and mins. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 3]. Original instability is 3-1=2. If I remove one of the 3s, the new array is [1,2,3], instability is 2. If I remove the 1, the instability is 3-2=1, which is better. So in this case, removing the min gives a better result. So the key is to find the second min and second max.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimum between (max - second_min) and (second_max - min). Because when you remove the min, the new min is the second_min, and the max remains. Similarly, when you remove the max, the new max is the second_max, and the min remains.\n\nBut how do we compute the second min and second max?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can sort the array. Let's think. If the array is sorted, then the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Now, if we remove the first element (the min), then the new instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If we remove the last element (the max), then the new instability is a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal between these two options would be the answer. But what if there are duplicates?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: [1,3,3,7]. Sorted is [1,3,3,7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 7-3=4. If we remove the last element (7), the instability is 3-1=2. Which is better. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample input: [1,100000]. Removing either element leaves a single element, so instability is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,3,4]. Original instability is 3. If we remove 1, the instability is 3 (4-2). If we remove 4, the instability is 2 (3-1). So the answer is 2.\n\nBut what if the array is [1,1,2,3]. Original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the first 1, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the last element (3), the instability is 2-1=1. Which is better. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo the approach seems to be: after sorting the array, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]). Because when you remove the first element (min), the new instability is a[-1] - a[1], and when you remove the last element (max), it's a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal between those two is the answer.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple elements that are the same as the min or max? For example, [1,1,2,3,3]. The original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 1s, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 3-1=2. But if we remove the 2, the instability is 3-1=2. So in this case, no matter which element you remove, the instability remains the same. So the answer is 2.\n\nBut according to our approach, the sorted array is [1,1,2,3,3]. The options are:\n\nremove first element (1): instability is a[-1] - a[1] = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nremove last element (3): instability is a[-2] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nso the minimum is 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 3, 7]. Sorted, the options are a[-2] - a[0] = 3 -1=2, and a[-1] - a[1] =7-3=4. So the minimum is 2.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the solution is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut wait, what if n is 2? For example, the second sample input. Then, after removing one element, the array has one element, so instability is zero. Which is correct. For n=2, the sorted array is [a, b]. The options are (a[-2] - a[0]) which is a[0] - a[0] = 0 (since n=2, a[-2] is a[0], and a[0] is the first element. Wait, when n=2, the sorted array is [x, y]. If we remove the first element, the array is [y], instability is zero. If we remove the second element, the array is [x], instability is zero. So the answer is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is to sort the array, and then compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut why is that the case?\n\nBecause when you remove the first element (the min), the new array's min is a[1], and the max is a[-1]. So the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. Similarly, when you remove the last element (the max), the new array's max is a[-2], and the min is a[0], so instability is a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal between these two options is the answer.\n\nBut what about if there are other elements that could be removed to get a better instability?\n\nLike, suppose the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. Original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 2, the array becomes [1,4,5], instability is 4. If we remove 4, the array becomes [1,2,5], instability is 4. So the best is to remove either the min or the max. But according to our approach, the options are:\n\na[-2] - a[0] = 4 -1 = 3. a[-1] - a[1] =5-2=3. So the answer is 3. Which is better than removing other elements. So in this case, the approach works.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute the two possibilities (removing first element or last element) and take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements that are min or max? For example, [1, 1, 3, 3]. Original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 1s, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 3-1=2. But according to our approach, the options are (a[-2] - a[0]) = 3-1=2, and (a[-1] - a[1]) = 3-1=2. So the answer is 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The options are a[-2] - a[0] = 4-1=3, and a[-1] -a[1] =5-2=3. So the answer is 3. Which is achieved by removing either the first or last element. However, if you remove the 3, the instability is 4-2=2. Wait, but that's better. Oh wait, this contradicts our previous reasoning. What's going on here?\n\nWait, this example is [1,2,3,4,5]. The original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove the 3, the array becomes [1,2,4,5], instability is 5-1=4. So that's the same as before. So our approach says that the minimum is 3. How?\n\nWait, if we remove the first element (1), the array is [2,3,4,5], instability is 5-2=3. If we remove the last element (5), the array is [1,2,3,4], instability is 4-1=3. So the answer is 3. Which is better than removing the 3. So our approach is correct. So the minimal possible is 3. So the approach is correct.\n\nSo the initial reasoning was correct. The minimal instability is the minimum between those two options.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut why not consider other possibilities? Like, for example, if there's a case where removing a middle element gives a better result?\n\nLet me think of a test case. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Original instability is 6-1=5. If we remove 3, the array becomes [1,4,5,6], instability is 5. If we remove 1, the instability is 6-4=2. If we remove 6, the instability is 5-1=4. So the best is to remove 1. So according to our approach, the options are (a[-2] - a[0]) = 5-1=4, and (a[-1] - a[1]) = 6-3=3. So the minimum is 3, which is better than 4. So the answer is 3. Which is correct. So in this case, the approach gives the correct answer. So the approach is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The sorted array is [1,4,5,6,7]. The two options are (a[-2] - a[0]) = 6-1=5, and (a[-1] - a[1]) =7-4=3. So the answer is 3. Which is achieved by removing the first element (1) or the last element (7). But if we remove 4, the instability is 7-1=6. So no, the approach works.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the correct approach is to sort the array and compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it, then compute the two possibilities and take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 2? For example, n=2, array [1, 2]. Then after sorting, a[-2] is 1, a[0] is 1. So a[-2] - a[0] is 0. Similarly, a[-1] - a[1] is 2-2=0. So the minimum is 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. Array [1, 2, 3]. The two options are a[-2] - a[0] = 2-1=1, and a[-1] - a[1] =3-2=1. So answer is 1. Which is correct. Because if you remove 1, the array is [2,3], instability is 1. If you remove 3, array is [1,2], instability is 1. If you remove 2, array is [1,3], instability is 2. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nIf n is 2, then the answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute min( (a[-2] - a[0]), (a[-1] - a[1]) )\n\nWait, but for n=3, the code would compute the two options. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=3, the code would compute the two options. Let's see for the example [1,2,3], option1 is a[-2] which is 2, minus a[0] 1 → 1. option2 is a[-1] (3) - a[1] (2) → 1. So min is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,3,3,7]. After sorting, [1,3,3,7]. option1 is a[-2] (3) - a[0] (1) → 2. option2 is a[-1] (7) - a[1] (3) →4. min is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [1,1,100000]. sorted is [1,1,100000]. option1 is a[-2] (1) - a[0] (1) →0. option2 is 100000 - a[1] (1) → 99999. So the answer is 0. Which is correct, since removing the 100000 gives instability 1-1=0.\n\nSo this code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple elements that are not min or max. For example, [1, 2, 5, 5, 5, 6]. The original instability is 6-1=5. If we remove 1, instability is 6-2=4. If we remove 6, instability is 5-1=4. But if we remove one of the 5s, the instability is 6-1=5. So the code would compute option1 as a[-2] (5) - a[0] (1) =4, option2 as a[-1] (6) - a[1] (2) =4. So the answer is 4, which is correct.\n\nYes, so the code works.\n\nSo this is the correct approach. The code is efficient because sorting is O(n log n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.\n\nSo the code should be written as follows.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1 is a[-2] - a[0] →3 -1=2.\n\noption2 is a[-1] - a[1] →7-3=4. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]. n is 2, so output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 2, 3]. Output 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [3, 1, 2]. sorted [1,2,3]. option1 is 2-1=1, option2 is 3-2=1. output 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
