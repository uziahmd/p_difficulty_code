The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. The sequences are strings of R, P, S. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what each player plays. Then determine who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, so we can calculate the number of times each scenario occurs in a certain period, then multiply by the number of full periods and add the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think. The sequences A and B are cyclic. So for each round, the move of Nikephoros (A) is determined by (i mod m), where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus (B) it's (i mod k), where k is the length of B.\n\nThe problem is that for each round i (starting from 0?), we need to get A[i % m] and B[i % k], then check who wins.\n\nBut since m and k can be up to 1000, the total possible combinations of (i mod m, i mod k) is m*k. So for each possible pair (a, b) where a is in 0..m-1 and b in 0..k-1, there's a certain outcome. But since the sequences repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because LCM(m, k) is the least common multiple of m and k. So after that many rounds, the pattern of moves repeats.\n\nSo the idea is: find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it T. Then, in each T rounds, the same sequence of moves happens. So we can compute the number of losses for each player in one full cycle of T rounds, then multiply by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the results from the remaining rounds (n mod T).\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute T = LCM(m, k). Since m and k can be up to 1000, T can be up to 1e6 (since LCM(1000,1000) is 1000). Wait, 1000 and 1000's LCM is 1000. But if m and k are coprime, like 1000 and 999, then LCM is 999000. Which is manageable because 1e6 is acceptable for processing.\n\nSo for each round in the first T rounds, we can compute the outcome. Then, the total number of full cycles is n // T, and the remainder is n % T.\n\nSo for each full cycle, we can precompute the number of times Nikephoros loses (countA) and Polycarpus loses (countB). Then multiply those by the number of full cycles. Then process the remaining (remainder) rounds.\n\nBut how to compute T?\n\nWell, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So first compute GCD of m and k.\n\nSo first, I need to compute GCD of m and k. Then compute LCM as (m * k) // GCD.\n\nOnce I have T, then for each of the T rounds, I can compute the moves for each player, check who wins, and accumulate the counts for the full cycle.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round in the cycle?\n\nFor each i in 0 to T-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen check who wins.\n\nSo for each of these T rounds, we can compute the outcome once, and sum up the counts for the full cycles.\n\nOnce that's done, the total for full_cycles = (n // T) * (countA, countB).\n\nThen, for the remaining rounds (remainder = n % T), we process each of the first 'remainder' rounds in the same way and add their counts.\n\nSo the overall steps are:\n\n- Read n, A, B.\n\n- Compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\n- Compute T = LCM(m, k).\n\n- Compute full_cycles = n // T\n\n- remainder = n % T\n\n- Precompute for one full cycle (T rounds) the total number of losses for each player (countA_cycle, countB_cycle)\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, simulating each round directly is infeasible due to the large possible number of rounds, so we use a more efficient approach based on cycles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Cycle Detection**: Recognize that both players' strategies repeat cyclically. The combined cycle length for both players' strategies is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **Precompute Outcomes**: For each round within one full cycle (determined by the LCM), compute the outcomes and count the number of losses for each player.\n3. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate the number of full cycles within the total number of rounds and the remaining rounds after these full cycles. Use the precomputed outcomes for full cycles and process the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // compute_gcd(a, b)\n\ndef count_losses_in_rounds(rounds, a_seq, b_seq):\n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    lcm = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    total_a = 0\n    total_b = 0\n    # Precompute for one LCM cycle\n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine winner\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            total_a += 1\n    return total_a, total_b\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a_seq = input[1]\n    b_seq = input[2]\n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    lcm = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    # Compute losses in one LCM cycle\n    a_cycle_loss, b_cycle_loss = count_losses_in_rounds(lcm, a_seq, b_seq)\n    # Total from full cycles\n    total_a = full_cycles * a_cycle_loss\n    total_b = full_cycles * b_cycle_loss\n    # Compute losses in the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            total_a += 1\n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the period after which both sequences repeat their moves simultaneously.\n2. **Loss Counting**: By precomputing the number of losses for each player within one LCM cycle, we efficiently handle large numbers of rounds by leveraging the repetition of this cycle.\n3. **Efficient Processing**: The total number of rounds is divided into full cycles and a remainder. The results from full cycles are multiplied by the number of such cycles, and the remainder is processed individually to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis approach ensures that even for very large values of n (up to 2 billion), the solution remains efficient and feasible.",
