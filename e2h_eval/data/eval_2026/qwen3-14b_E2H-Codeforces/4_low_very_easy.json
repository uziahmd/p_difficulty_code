The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of times each player loses in n rounds of rock-paper-scissors, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their own sequences. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the sequences work. For example, Nikephoros's sequence A is repeated cyclically. So for each round i (starting from 0?), he uses A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus's sequence B.\n\nThe main challenge here is handling the large n, up to 2e9. So iterating through each round one by one is impossible. We need an efficient way to calculate the number of losses for each player without simulating all rounds.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The idea is to find out for each possible pair of moves (a, b) in the sequences A and B, how many times they occur in the rounds. Then, for each such pair, determine who wins and accumulate the counts accordingly.\n\nBut since the sequences are cyclic, the total number of rounds can be broken down into full cycles of the combined sequences and a remaining partial cycle. However, since the two sequences have different lengths, the combined cycle would be the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. But even that might be computationally expensive if m and k are large. Wait, but m and k are up to 1000, so LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6, which is manageable. Because even for 1e6, we can precompute the number of losses for each possible round in that cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles and add the partial cycle.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it lcm_length. The total number of rounds in one full cycle of both sequences is lcm_length. \n\nBut wait, for each round, the move of Nikephoros is determined by his sequence's position (i mod m), and similarly for Polycarpus (i mod k). So, for each round i (starting from 0?), the moves are A[i % m] and B[i % k]. \n\nSo, the pattern of moves for both players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after that, the positions of both sequences will return to their starting points. So, for example, if m=2 and k=3, LCM(2,3)=6. After 6 rounds, the sequences will repeat.\n\nThus, the total number of rounds n can be divided into:\n\nnumber_of_full_cycles = n // lcm_length\n\nremaining_rounds = n % lcm_length\n\nFor each full cycle, we can compute the number of times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Then multiply by the number of full cycles. Then, process the remaining_rounds rounds separately.\n\nSo first, compute the LCM of m and k. Then, simulate all the rounds in one LCM cycle, count the number of losses for each player in that cycle. Then multiply by the number of full cycles. Then simulate the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how do I compute the LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need to compute the GCD first. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, that's okay. Also, need to handle zero? No, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Compute m and k as the lengths of A and B.\n\n- Compute LCM of m and k.\n\n- For the first part, simulate all rounds in the LCM period. For each round i from 0 to lcm_length - 1:\n\n   - Get A's move: A[i % m]\n\n   - Get B's move: B[i % k]\n\n   - Determine who wins, and increment counts accordingly.\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle (say, per_cycle_nik, per_cycle_poly), then total for full cycles is number_of_full_cycles * per_cycle_nik and same for poly.\n\nThen, process the remaining rounds (remaining_rounds) by simulating each of them, adding to the totals.\n\nBut what if n is smaller than lcm_length? Then, there are no full cycles, and we just process the first n rounds.\n\nThis approach should work, and since the maximum lcm_length is 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000, their product is 1e6, and LCM can't be larger than that), even for n up to 2e9, the simulation for the LCM cycle is manageable.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut first, how to compute the LCM?\n\nImplementing GCD:\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their own sequences. The challenge is to handle a very large number of rounds efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Each player's moves are determined by repeating their respective sequences cyclically. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is \"RPS\", his moves will be R, P, S, R, P, S, etc.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The combined cycle of both players' sequences repeats every Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This LCM helps in breaking down the problem into manageable parts.\n3. **Efficient Simulation**: By simulating one full cycle of the combined sequences (determined by LCM), we can compute the number of losses for each player in one cycle. This allows us to handle large numbers of rounds efficiently by calculating the number of full cycles and remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    b_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n    \n    lcm = m * k // gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full LCM cycle\n    nik_cycle = 0\n    poly_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Check who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            poly_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            nik_cycle += 1\n    \n    # Calculate number of full cycles and remaining rounds\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remaining = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nik = full_cycles * nik_cycle\n    total_poly = full_cycles * poly_cycle\n    \n    # Process remaining rounds\n    for i in range(remaining):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the length of one full cycle of both sequences.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within one LCM cycle, we determine the moves of both players and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remaining Rounds**: The total number of rounds is divided into full cycles and remaining rounds. The results from the full cycles are multiplied by the number of full cycles, and the remaining rounds are processed individually.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses for each player is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that even for very large values of n, the solution remains efficient by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences.",
