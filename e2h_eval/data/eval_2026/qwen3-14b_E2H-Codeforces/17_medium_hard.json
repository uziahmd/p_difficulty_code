He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. But how do we figure out which is which?\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the input gives me. The input has all the improper prefixes and suffixes of some string s. For example, if the original string is \"ababa\" (like in the first example), then for n=5, the prefixes of lengths 1-4 are \"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"abab\", and the suffixes are \"a\", \"ba\", \"aba\", \"baba\". But since the input gives all of them mixed up, I have to find which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes.\n\nThe key here is that the original string s must be such that all the given strings are its prefixes or suffixes. But how can I reconstruct s? Because once I know s, I can check each input string and see if it's a prefix or suffix. But how to find s?\n\nWait, but the problem says that there's at least one possible s that fits the given input. So maybe the approach is to find the correct s, then check each input string against it.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, the original string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. Also, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be such that they are part of the input. But since the input contains exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1, there are two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the prefix of length n-1, and the other must be the suffix of length n-1. But how to determine which is which?\n\nWait, but the original string s is of length n. The prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So the original string s can be determined by combining the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1. Because the prefix of length n-1 is s without the last character, and the suffix of length n-1 is s without the first character. Therefore, if we can find which two strings of length n-1 are the prefix and suffix, then the original string would be the concatenation of the prefix's first n-1 characters plus the last character of the suffix. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me say that the prefix of length n-1 is P, and the suffix of length n-1 is S. Then, the original string s must be P + (last character of S). Because the suffix S is s[1..n-1], so the original string s is s[0] followed by S. But also, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], which is P. So the original string s is P + (s[n-1]). But since the suffix S is s[1..n-1], then s[n-1] is the last character of S. Therefore, s = P + last_char(S). Alternatively, s could be the first character of S (since S is s[1..n-1], so the first character of S is s[1]) plus the suffix of length n-1. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the original string s can be found by taking the prefix of length n-1 and adding the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Because the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1], so its last character is s[n-1], which is the last character of s. So the original string s would be (prefix of length n-1) + (last character of suffix of length n-1). Similarly, if we take the suffix of length n-1 and add the first character of the prefix of length n-1, that would be (suffix of length n-1) + (first character of prefix of length n-1)? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nSo the idea is: among the input strings, there are two strings of length n-1. One is the prefix of length n-1, and the other is the suffix of length n-1. If we can find which pair of these two strings can form the original string s, then we can proceed.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, the strings of length 4 (since n=5) are \"abab\" and \"baba\". Let's say the prefix is \"abab\" (length 4), then the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". Then the original s would be \"abab\" + last character of \"baba\" which is 'a' → \"ababa\". Which matches the note. Alternatively, if the prefix was \"baba\" and the suffix was \"abab\", then the original string would be \"baba\" + last character of \"abab\" which is 'b' → \"babab\". But then, the prefixes and suffixes would be different. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a valid s. So perhaps for each pair of length n-1 strings, we can check if combining them as described gives a string s, and then check if all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Find all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each possible pair (A, B) where A is one of the two and B is the other:\n\n   a. Construct candidate s as A + (last character of B).\n\n   b. Check if all the input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of this s.\n\n   c. If such s is valid, then proceed to assign P and S to each input string accordingly.\n\nOnce we find such an s, then for each input string, we check if it is a prefix of s, or a suffix. But since there are two strings of each length, and for each length, exactly one is a prefix and one is a suffix. So for example, for length 1, there are two strings. One is the prefix of length 1 (the first character of s), and the other is the suffix of length 1 (the last character of s). So for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut how to handle cases where multiple input strings are same? For example, in the second sample input, the input is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nSo the two strings of length 2 are \"aa\" and \"aa\". So when considering the two strings of length 2, the candidate s would be formed by taking one of them as the prefix (length 2) and the other as the suffix (length 2). But since they are the same, combining A (prefix) with last character of B (suffix) would be \"aa\" + last character of \"aa\" → \"aaa\", which is correct. Then all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of \"aaa\".\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each candidate s generated from the two length n-1 strings, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. Once we find such s, we can proceed to assign P/S.\n\nOnce we have s, the rest is straightforward: for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (then mark as P) or a suffix (mark as S). However, there's a possibility that a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of \"aaa\", the string \"aa\" is both a prefix and a suffix. But according to the problem statement, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix. However, since the input is given as all the prefixes and suffixes, for each length, there are exactly two strings. For example, in the case of \"aaa\" of length 3, the prefixes of length 1 and 2 are \"a\", \"aa\"; the suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". So the input would have two \"a\" and two \"aa\". So when checking, for each input string, we need to assign it as P or S, but making sure that for each length, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nBut how to handle when a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the third sample input, the input is:\n\n2\n\na\n\nc\n\nThe original string could be \"ac\" or \"ca\". For \"ac\", the prefixes are \"a\", and the suffixes are \"c\". So the input strings are \"a\" and \"c\". So the output is \"PS\" or \"SP\".\n\nBut for the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, like in the second sample, the input has two \"aa\" strings. For s = \"aaa\", the prefixes of length 2 is \"aa\", and the suffixes of length 2 is \"aa\". So both of them are present in the input. So when processing the input strings, each of the two \"aa\" strings must be assigned as one P and one S. But how do we know which is which?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer can be any valid assignment. So even if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, we can assign it as P or S as long as for each length, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If it is, then assign P, else assign S. However, for cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, we need to ensure that exactly one of the two strings of that length is marked as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, suppose two input strings are same and both are prefixes and suffixes. How to decide which is P and which is S?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer can be any valid assignment. So perhaps for such cases, we can just assign one as P and the other as S. However, during the checking process, we need to make sure that for each length, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nBut how to do that when generating the output? Well, once we have s, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix. If it is, then we can mark it as P. Otherwise, mark as S. However, for cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, but there are two instances of it, we need to make sure that exactly one is marked as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how can that happen? Let's think. Suppose for a certain length l, there are two identical strings. For example, in the second sample input, for l=2, the two strings are \"aa\" and \"aa\". For the correct s=\"aaa\", both are prefixes and suffixes. So each of the two input strings must be assigned as one P and one S.\n\nBut if during checking, we just check for each input string whether it is a prefix, and assign P if yes, else S, then both will be considered as prefixes (since they are), and thus both would be marked as P. Which would violate the condition that for each length, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nSo this approach would not work. Therefore, we need a way to assign P and S for the input strings such that for each length, exactly one is P and one is S. But how?\n\nHmm. Let's think again. For each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two input strings. One is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l. So, for each l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. However, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix of s, then for that particular l, both input strings (which are same) are both prefix and suffix. But that's only possible if the string is same as both the prefix and suffix of that length. But how can that happen?\n\nFor example, for s = \"aaa\", the prefix of length 2 is \"aa\", and the suffix of length 2 is also \"aa\". So for the two input strings of length 2, both are same. So for that length, one must be marked as P and the other as S. But how to choose?\n\nIn this case, the problem allows any assignment. So for the two input strings of length 2, we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do that in code?\n\nThe problem is that when checking for each input string, if we just check if it is a prefix, then both would be considered as prefixes, leading to two P's for that length, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the approach of checking for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix may not be sufficient. We need to make sure that for each length, exactly one is marked as P and the other as S.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is:\n\nOnce we have the correct s, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), collect the two input strings of that length. Then, for each such pair, one is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l. So for each pair, we can check which one is the prefix and which is the suffix.\n\nBut how? Well, for a given length l, the prefix of s of length l is s[0...l-1], and the suffix is s[n-l ... n-1]. So for each l, we can check which of the two input strings matches the prefix, and which matches the suffix.\n\nSo for example, in the second sample input, for l=2, the two input strings are \"aa\" and \"aa\". The prefix of length 2 is \"aa\", and the suffix is also \"aa\". So for the two input strings, both are the same. Therefore, for the pair, one is assigned as P and the other as S. But how to choose which is which?\n\nIn this case, since both are same, we can assign one as P and the other as S arbitrarily. For example, the first occurrence can be marked as P, the second as S.\n\nThus, the approach would be:\n\nOnce we have s, for each length l, collect all input strings of that length (there are two of them). For each such pair, check which one equals the prefix of s of length l, and which equals the suffix. Then assign P to the prefix, S to the suffix.\n\nThis ensures that for each l, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, we need to check which l it belongs to, and then compare with the prefix and suffix of that l.\n\nBut how to group the input strings by their lengths? Well, for each input string, we can note its length. Then, for each l from 1 to n-1, we have two input strings. For each l, we can get the two input strings, check which one is the prefix (s[:l]) and which is the suffix (s[-l:]).\n\nBut in the case where both input strings are same as the prefix and suffix, then both are same, and we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo for example, for a given l, the two input strings are a and b. The prefix is p = s[:l], the suffix is s[-l:]. Now, if a == p and b == s[-l:], then assign a as P and b as S. If a == p and b == p, then assign one as P and the other as S. But how to decide which one?\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can just assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S, or vice versa.\n\nBut how to track which input strings belong to which l?\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, we need to know its length, and then compare it to the prefix and suffix of that length.\n\nSo, for each input string, we can:\n\n- Determine its length l.\n\n- Check if it equals the prefix of s of length l. If yes, then it's a prefix (P).\n\n- Else, check if it equals the suffix of s of length l. If yes, then it's a suffix (S).\n\nBut wait, in the case where the input string is both prefix and suffix of s, then for that l, the two input strings would be same. So for example, if the two input strings for l are both equal to the prefix (and also the suffix), then how to assign P and S?\n\nBut in this case, the two input strings are same. So for the two input strings, one must be marked as P and the other as S. However, when checking each of them, they would both match the prefix and the suffix. So how do we differentiate between them?\n\nBut for each l, there are exactly two input strings. So, for each l, we can collect the two input strings, and for each, check if they are equal to the prefix or suffix. But in this case, both would be equal to both. So how to assign?\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can just assign the first one as P and the second as S, regardless of their actual values.\n\nSo, for each l, we can process the two input strings. Let's say that for a given l, the two strings are str1 and str2. We can check if str1 is the prefix. If yes, then assign P to str1, and S to str2. If str1 is not the prefix, then check if str2 is the prefix. If yes, then assign P to str2 and S to str1. However, in the case where both are the same as the prefix (and suffix), then we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to handle this in code?\n\nLet me think of the steps again.\n\nOnce s is known, for each input string, we can:\n\n- For the input string, check if it's equal to the prefix of s of its length. If yes, then it's a prefix (P). Else, it's a suffix (S). But this approach would fail in cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, if the input string is the same as both the prefix and suffix of that length. Then, how to know whether to assign it as P or S?\n\nBut since for each length l, there are exactly two input strings. One of them must be the prefix, and the other must be the suffix. So, for each l, the two input strings must be the prefix and the suffix. So, if for a given l, the two input strings are the same, then both are the prefix and suffix. So, in that case, one must be marked as P, the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, in the case where the two input strings are same and are both prefix and suffix of s. How to decide which one is which?\n\nThe answer is that for each l, we can check which of the two input strings is the prefix. But since they are same, both are the prefix. So in that case, we can just assign the first one as P and the second as S.\n\nBut how to track which input strings are for which l?\n\nSo, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nGroup the input strings by their lengths. For each length l (from 1 to n-1), collect the two input strings. For each such group, check which of the two is the prefix (s[:l]) and which is the suffix (s[-l:]).\n\nBut since the two input strings may be same, but for each l, exactly one is the prefix and the other is the suffix (even if they are same), we can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each group of two strings of length l:\n\nCheck if the first string equals the prefix. If yes, then assign P to it. The other string must be the suffix, assign S. If the first string is not the prefix, then check if the second is the prefix. Assign accordingly.\n\nBut in the case where both are the same as the prefix (and suffix), then the first is assigned as P, the second as S.\n\nSo, for example, in the group of two \"aa\" strings for l=2, the first is assigned as P, the second as S.\n\nThus, the code steps would be:\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, we need to know which group (by length) it is in. Then, for each group, process the two strings, and assign P and S accordingly.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings into a list.\n\nFind the two strings of length n-1. Try all possible pairs to generate candidate s, and check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of that s.\n\nOnce s is determined, then for each input string, group them by their length. For each group (length l), check which of the two strings is the prefix (s[:l]) and which is the suffix (s[-l:]).\n\nOnce that is determined, assign P and S accordingly.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the correct s. How to do that?\n\nAs discussed earlier, for the two strings of length n-1, let's call them A and B. Then the candidate s can be A + last character of B, or B + last character of A. Because:\n\nIf A is the prefix of length n-1, then the original s is A + (last character of the suffix of length n-1). But the suffix of length n-1 is B. So the original s would be A + B[-1].\n\nSimilarly, if B is the prefix of length n-1, then the original s is B + A[-1].\n\nSo for each of the two possibilities, we can generate the candidate s, and check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of that s.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate s, we can proceed.\n\nSo the steps for finding s are:\n\nCollect all the input strings. Find the two strings of length n-1.\n\nFor each possible combination (A, B) where A and B are the two strings of length n-1:\n\n   Generate candidate s1 = A + B[-1]\n\n   Check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s1.\n\n   If yes, then proceed with this s1.\n\n   Else, try the other combination: s2 = B + A[-1]\n\n   Check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s2.\n\n   If yes, proceed with this s2.\n\nOnce we find a valid s, proceed.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nFor each input string in the list, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with the string) or a suffix of s (i.e., s ends with the string). If all of them satisfy this condition, then s is valid.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nYes, for each input string, check if it is a prefix or a suffix of s. If any input string is neither, then the candidate s is invalid.\n\nOnce we have a valid s, proceed to assign P/S.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce the candidate s is generated, loop through all input strings:\n\nfor string in input_strings:\n\n    if string == s[:len(string)] or string == s[-len(string):]:\n\n        continue\n\n    else:\n\n        invalid candidate.\n\nOnce all pass, proceed.\n\nNow, for example, in the first sample input, the two length 4 strings are \"abab\" and \"baba\".\n\nTesting candidate s1 = \"abab\" + \"a\" (since B is \"baba\", last character is 'a') → \"ababa\".\n\nCheck all input strings:\n\nInput strings are:\n\nba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba.\n\nFor each of these:\n\nCheck if they are prefix or suffix of \"ababa\".\n\nFor example, \"ba\" is the suffix of length 2 (s[-2:] is \"ba\") → yes.\n\n\"a\" is prefix (yes) and suffix (yes).\n\n\"abab\" is prefix of length 4 (yes).\n\n\"a\" is same as before.\n\n\"aba\" is prefix of length 3 (yes) and suffix of length 3 (s[-3:] is \"aba\").\n\n\"baba\" is suffix of length 4 (s[-4:] is \"baba\").\n\n\"ab\" is prefix of length 2 (yes).\n\n\"aba\" is same as before.\n\nSo all are valid.\n\nSo this candidate is valid.\n\nThus, proceed.\n\nNow, once s is determined, the next step is to assign P/S to each input string.\n\nSo, grouping the input strings by their lengths.\n\nFor each length l from 1 to n-1, collect the two input strings.\n\nThen, for each group, check which of the two is the prefix (s[:l]) and which is the suffix (s[-l:]).\n\nFor example, for l=1, the two input strings are \"a\" and \"a\". The prefix of length 1 is \"a\", the suffix is \"a\". So both are same. Assign one as P, the other as S.\n\nBut how to know which one is which in the input list?\n\nThe code would need to process each group of two strings for each l. For example, for l=1, collect the two input strings. Then, check if the first is the prefix. If yes, assign P, else check if the second is the prefix. But since both are same, it's possible that both are prefix and suffix. So in this case, assign the first as P and the second as S.\n\nSo in code, for each group of two strings (for a given l), we can check:\n\nif first_str == s[:l], then assign P to first_str, S to second_str.\n\nelse if second_str == s[:l], assign P to second_str, S to first_str.\n\nelse: (this shouldn't happen because the input is guaranteed to be valid)\n\nBut how to handle the case where both are equal to the prefix (and suffix)?\n\nIn that case, assign P to the first and S to the second.\n\nSo the code can be:\n\nfor each l in 1..n-1:\n\n   collect the two input strings (say, strings_l)\n\n   if strings_l[0] == s[:l]:\n\n       assign P to strings_l[0], S to strings_l[1]\n\n   elif strings_l[1] == s[:l]:\n\n       assign P to strings_l[1], S to strings_l[0]\n\n   else:\n\n       # this should not happen\n\nBut wait, in the case where both are equal to the prefix, then the first condition is true (strings_l[0] == s[:l]) and the code assigns P to the first, S to the second.\n\nSo this would work.\n\nBut how to group the input strings by their length?\n\nWe can create a dictionary, where the keys are the lengths, and the values are lists of the input strings of that length. For example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor string in input_strings:\n\n    l = len(string)\n\n    groups[l].append(string)\n\nThen, for each l in 1 to n-1, groups[l] will have two elements.\n\nOnce that is done, for each group, process as above.\n\nBut the problem is that the order in which the input strings are processed may affect the assignment of P and S. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, this is acceptable.\n\nOnce all groups are processed, we need to assign the P/S to each input string in the original order.\n\nSo the problem is that the groups are stored as per their length, but the original input order needs to be preserved.\n\nThus, the approach is:\n\nOnce the groups are built, for each input string, we can determine which group it belongs to, and then determine if it is the prefix or suffix of that group.\n\nBut how to map back the original input order?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nOnce the groups are built, for each group (l), we can process the two input strings. For each of the two strings, we can note whether they are prefix or suffix. Then, for the original input list, for each string, check if it is the first or second in the group for its length, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut this requires tracking the original order. For example, for each input string, we can store its length and its position in the group (for that length). But this might be complicated.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nOnce the groups are built, for each group (l), we can process the two strings, and for each of them, note whether they are prefix or suffix. Then, for each input string, we can check if it is the prefix or suffix of its group.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For each input string, we can check:\n\nif it is equal to the prefix of s of its length → then it's a prefix (P), else it's a suffix (S).\n\nBut in the case where the input string is same as both the prefix and suffix of that length, this would be true. However, since there are two input strings for that length, one must be P and the other S. But how to decide?\n\nBut the code for the group processing would have already handled that. For example, in the group for l, if both strings are same as the prefix, then the first is assigned as P, the second as S.\n\nSo, the code for the group processing would generate for each of the two input strings in the group, their P/S status.\n\nBut how to map that back to the original input list?\n\nPerhaps, for each group (l), we can process the two strings, and for each, assign their P/S status, and then for the original input list, check for each string whether it's the first or second in the group, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to track which input strings are first or second in the group?\n\nAn alternative idea is to create a list of tuples for each input string, containing (original index, string, length). Then, group them by length, and for each group, process the two strings, and for each, assign P or S. Then, create a list of answers in the original order.\n\nLet me outline this:\n\noriginal_input = list of the 2n-2 strings.\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i, string in enumerate(original_input):\n\n    l = len(string)\n\n    groups[l].append( (i, string) )\n\nThen, for each l in 1..n-1:\n\n    group = groups[l]  # list of (index, string)\n\n    str1 = group[0][1]\n\n    str2 = group[1][1]\n\n    # determine which is prefix and which is suffix\n\n    prefix_l = s[:l]\n\n    suffix_l = s[-l:]\n\n    if str1 == prefix_l:\n\n        # assign P to str1, S to str2\n\n        answer[group[0][0]] = 'P'\n\n        answer[group[1][0]] = 'S'\n\n    elif str2 == prefix_l:\n\n        # assign P to str2, S to str1\n\n        answer[group[1][0]] = 'P'\n\n        answer[group[0][0]] = 'S'\n\n    else:\n\n        # this should not happen\n\n        pass\n\nBut in the case where both are equal to the prefix_l (and suffix_l), then the first condition is true (str1 == prefix_l), and the answer is set accordingly.\n\nOnce all groups are processed, the answer list (initialized with empty strings) will have the correct P/S for each original input string.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings into original_input.\n\nFind the two strings of length n-1.\n\nGenerate the two possible candidates for s (A + B[-1] and B + A[-1], where A and B are the two strings of length n-1).\n\nFor each candidate s:\n\n   Check if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of s.\n\n   If yes, proceed with this s.\n\nOnce s is found, process the groups as above.\n\nNow, the code needs to find the correct s. How to find the two strings of length n-1?\n\nIn Python, we can loop through the original_input list and collect all strings with length n-1.\n\nOnce that is done, generate the two candidates.\n\nNow, for example, in the third sample input, the input is:\n\nn=2, input strings are \"a\" and \"c\".\n\nThe two strings of length 1 (n-1=1) are \"a\" and \"c\".\n\nSo candidate s1 is \"a\" + last character of \"c\" (which is \"c\") → \"ac\".\n\nCandidate s2 is \"c\" + last character of \"a\" → \"ca\".\n\nBoth are valid. So the code needs to check which of these candidates is valid.\n\nBut how? For each candidate, check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nFor s1 = \"ac\", the input strings are \"a\" (prefix of length 1) and \"c\" (suffix of length 1). So all are valid.\n\nFor s2 = \"ca\", the input strings are \"a\" (suffix of length 1, since s[-1:] is \"a\") and \"c\" (prefix of length 1). So both are valid.\n\nSo both candidates are valid. Which one to choose?\n\nThe code can pick the first valid candidate. Since the problem says that there is at least one valid s, and any valid assignment is acceptable.\n\nSo in code, for the two candidates, check in order. Once a valid candidate is found, use it.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s?\n\nIn code, for a given s:\n\nfor string in original_input:\n\n    l = len(string)\n\n    if string != s[:l] and string != s[-l:]:\n\n        return False\n\nreturn True\n\nSo, for each candidate, perform this check.\n\nOnce the correct s is found, proceed.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead n.\n\noriginal_input = [input().strip() for _ in range(2*n - 2)]\n\nFind the two strings of length n-1.\n\ncandidates = []\n\nfor each pair (A, B) in the two strings:\n\n   generate s_candidate = A + B[-1]\n\n   if check_valid(s_candidate):\n\n       candidates.append(s_candidate)\n\n   generate s_candidate = B + A[-1]\n\n   if check_valid(s_candidate):\n\n       candidates.append(s_candidate)\n\nBut wait, the two strings are A and B. So for the first candidate, A is considered as the prefix of length n-1, B as the suffix. Then the s_candidate is A + B[-1].\n\nBut for the two strings, there are two possibilities: A and B. So in code, for the two strings, say, list_of_n_minus_1 = [s1, s2], then the two candidates are:\n\ns1 + s2[-1], and s2 + s1[-1].\n\nOnce generated, check which of these candidates is valid.\n\nOnce found, proceed.\n\nNow, the code can generate the candidates and check them. Once a valid one is found, proceed.\n\nBut how to find the list_of_n_minus_1?\n\nIn code:\n\nn_minus_1_strings = [s for s in original_input if len(s) == n-1]\n\nOnce that is done, proceed.\n\nNow, code for checking validity of a candidate s:\n\ndef is_valid(s_candidate, original_input):\n\n    for string in original_input:\n\n        l = len(string)\n\n        if string != s_candidate[:l] and string != s_candidate[-l:]:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nOnce that is done, generate the candidates and check.\n\nOnce a valid s is found, proceed.\n\nNow, the code can proceed to generate the answer.\n\nNow, putting all this together in code.\n\nBut what if there are multiple valid candidates? For example, in the third sample input, both \"ac\" and \"ca\" are valid. The code can choose the first one found. Since the problem allows any valid assignment, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\noriginal_input = [input().strip() for _ in range(2*n - 2)]\n\nn_minus_1_strings = [s for s in original_input if len(s) == n-1]\n\nfor A in n_minus_1_strings:\n\n    for B in n_minus_1_strings:\n\n        if A == B:\n\n            continue  # avoid duplicate checks? Not sure, but perhaps better to check all combinations.\n\n        # generate candidate s1 = A + B[-1]\n\n        s_candidate = A + B[-1]\n\n        if is_valid(s_candidate, original_input):\n\n            # proceed with this s_candidate\n\n            break\n\n    else:\n\n        continue\n\n    break\n\nelse:\n\n    # try the other way around?\n\n    # perhaps the code above is not handling the case where A and B are the same.\n\n    # Wait, the n_minus_1_strings has exactly two elements, but they may be same.\n\n    # So, for example, in the second sample input, the two strings are same.\n\n    # So in that case, the code would generate A and B as same, and in the for loops, A and B are same.\n\n    # So in that case, the code would generate s_candidate as A + B[-1] = A + A[-1] = A + last character of A.\n\n    # But in that case, the code would check for validity.\n\n    # However, the code above has a check for if A == B, then continue. Which would skip that case. Which is wrong.\n\nAh, here's a problem. The code above loops through all A and B in n_minus_1_strings. But since there are exactly two elements in n_minus_1_strings, the code would generate four possibilities (A and B being each of the two elements). However, the code as written has a check for if A == B, then continue. Which would prevent checking when A and B are same.\n\nBut in the case where the two strings are same (like in the second sample), we need to generate the candidate s_candidate = A + B[-1] (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`.
