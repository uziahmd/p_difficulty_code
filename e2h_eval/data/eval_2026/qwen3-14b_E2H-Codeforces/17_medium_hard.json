He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. The challenge is that we don't know s, but we have to figure out a possible assignment that's valid.\n\nFirst, let's think about the approach. Since the original string s has certain prefixes and suffixes, and all of them are given in the input, but mixed up. Our job is to assign each input string as either a prefix or a suffix such that there exists at least one s that satisfies all these assignments.\n\nBut how do we find what s could be? Well, maybe the key is to find the correct s first. Because once we know s, we can check which of the input strings are its prefixes and which are suffixes, and then assign accordingly.\n\nBut how do we find s? Let's think. For example, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must be of length n-1. But since there are two strings of each length, for length n-1, there are two strings. One of them must be the prefix (of length n-1) and the other the suffix (of length n-1). But wait, the original string s's prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1]. So those two are different unless the entire string is made of same characters. So for example, if the original string is \"aaa\", then the prefix and suffix of length 2 are both \"aa\".\n\nSo, for the case where the original string is all same characters, the two strings of length n-1 would be same, but the problem says that the input has exactly two strings of each length. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so perhaps in such cases, the two strings are same. But in general, how do we find s?\n\nAnother thought: the original string s must have the property that the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 are present in the input. Also, the actual s is formed by combining the prefix of length n-1 and adding the last character (from the suffix of length n-1). Wait, no. For example, the original s is of length n. Its prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So combining these two, the full s would be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Because the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], so the last character of that is s[n-1]. Therefore, the original string s can be determined if we can find the correct prefix of length n-1 and the correct suffix of length n-1. Then, s would be (prefix of length n-1) + (last character of suffix of length n-1).\n\nSo the idea is: find which two strings of length n-1 are the ones that are the prefix and suffix of s. Once we have those, we can construct s. Then, check which of the other strings are prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut how do we choose which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we take one of the length n-1 strings as the prefix (let's call it p), and the other as the suffix (call it s). Then, the original string s would be p + (last character of s). But then, the suffix of length n-1 is s. So the original string's suffix of length n-1 is s. Which implies that the original string is (p + s[-1]), and that the suffix of length n-1 is s. Therefore, the original string's suffix of length n-1 must be equal to s. So:\n\noriginal s = p + c, where c is s[-1]. Then, the suffix of length n-1 is s. Which is the original s[1...n-1]. So the original s is p + c. So the suffix of length n-1 is (p + c)[1...n-1] = p[1...] + c. Which must equal the s (the suffix candidate). So, p[1...] + c must equal the suffix candidate. But the suffix candidate is of length n-1. Since p is of length n-1, p[1...] is of length n-2. Adding c gives length n-1. So:\n\np[1:] + c == suffix_candidate.\n\nBut since c is the last character of the suffix_candidate (because the suffix_candidate is of length n-1, and the original s is p + c, then the suffix_candidate is s[1...n-1] = p[1...n-2] + c. So the suffix_candidate is p[1:] + c. But the suffix_candidate is also the string that we're considering as the suffix. So for the suffix_candidate, the suffix_candidate must be equal to p[1:] + c. But since c is the last character of the suffix_candidate, that would mean that the suffix_candidate's first n-2 characters are p[1:], and the last character is c. Therefore, the suffix_candidate must be p[1:] + (suffix_candidate's last character). Which is always true. Wait, that seems redundant. Maybe I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, when we take a candidate for the prefix (length n-1) and a candidate for the suffix (length n-1), then the original string s must be the prefix plus the last character of the suffix. Then, the suffix (of length n-1) must be equal to s[1...n-1]. Which would be (prefix + last_char_of_suffix)[1...n-1] = prefix[1...n-2] + last_char_of_suffix. But the suffix candidate is supposed to be the suffix of length n-1. So, the suffix candidate must equal prefix[1...n-2] + last_char_of_suffix. But the suffix candidate is of length n-1, which is same as the length of prefix[1...n-2] + last_char_of_suffix. So for example, if the prefix is of length n-1, then prefix[1...n-2] is of length (n-2) - 1 + 1? Wait, no. Let me think: the prefix is length n-1. So for example, if n is 5, then the prefix is length 4. Then, prefix[1:] is from index 1 to 3, which is length 3. Adding the last character (c) gives length 4, which is the length of the suffix candidate. So the suffix candidate must be equal to prefix[1:] + c. But c is the last character of the suffix candidate. Therefore, the suffix candidate's first n-2 characters must be prefix[1:], and the last character is c. So the suffix candidate must be prefix[1:] + (its own last character). Which is trivially true. So this condition is automatically satisfied. Therefore, for any pair of (prefix_candidate, suffix_candidate) of length n-1, we can construct s as prefix_candidate + (suffix_candidate's last character). Then, the suffix_candidate must be the suffix of s. But how do we check that?\n\nWait, because the suffix_candidate is supposed to be s's suffix of length n-1. Which would be s[1...n-1]. So when s is constructed as prefix_candidate + (suffix_candidate[-1]), then s[1...n-1] is (prefix_candidate[1...n-2]) + (suffix_candidate[-1]). But the suffix_candidate is supposed to be equal to that. Therefore, the suffix_candidate must be equal to prefix_candidate[1:] + suffix_candidate[-1]. Which can be rewritten as: the suffix_candidate's first (n-2) characters must be prefix_candidate[1:], and the last character is whatever it is. Therefore, the suffix_candidate's first (n-2) characters must be equal to prefix_candidate[1:].\n\nSo, given two candidates of length n-1, say p (for prefix) and s (for suffix), then we can check if s's first (n-2) characters equal p[1:]. If that is true, then the constructed s is p + s[-1], and that s's suffix of length n-1 is s. Therefore, this pair (p and s) is a possible candidate for the prefix and suffix of length n-1.\n\nSo the approach is: for all possible pairs of the two strings of length n-1, check if the first is a possible prefix and the second a possible suffix. Then, for each such pair, construct the candidate s, and then check if all the other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of this s. If yes, then we can proceed to assign P and S accordingly.\n\nOnce we have the correct s, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. Then, assign P or S accordingly.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Find all the input strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each possible pair (p, s) where p is one of the two and s is the other, check if s starts with p[1:]. If yes, then construct the candidate s_candidate = p + s[-1].\n\n3. Once we have s_candidate, check whether all other input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nIf this is true, then we can proceed to assign P and S for each input string.\n\nOnce we find such an s_candidate, then we can generate the answer.\n\nBut how to handle multiple possibilities? Because there may be more than one valid s_candidate. However, the problem says that we can output any valid answer, so once we find one possible s_candidate that works, we can proceed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate all possible candidates for s_candidate based on the two length n-1 strings.\n\n- For each such candidate, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\n- Once a valid s_candidate is found, proceed to assign P/S for each input string.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, parse the input. Let's read n, then read 2n-2 strings.\n\nWe can collect all the strings in a list, say 'strings'.\n\nThen, collect the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates_n_minus_1. For example, for n=5, the length is 4, and there are two strings of that length.\n\nFor each possible pair (p, s) in candidates_n_minus_1 (so two possibilities: first is p, second is s; or first is s, second is p?), check if s starts with p[1:].\n\nWait, for example, suppose the two candidates are A and B. We can try two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: p is A, s is B. Check if B starts with A[1:]?\n\nCase 2: p is B, s is A. Check if A starts with B[1:]?\n\nIf either case is true, then we can construct the candidate s_candidate.\n\nOnce that is done, we can check if all other input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, we can proceed.\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with the string) or a suffix (s_candidate ends with the string). Then, assign P or S accordingly. However, note that for each input string, there must be exactly one assignment (either P or S), but the problem allows any valid assignment as long as there exists at least one s that fits.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because the same string could be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, if the original string is \"aaa\", then \"aa\" is both a prefix and a suffix. So, in this case, for the input strings, if there are two \"aa\" strings, then one must be assigned as P and the other as S. But according to the problem statement, the input has exactly two strings of each length. So for example, for the input in the second example:\n\nInput is 3, and the strings are a, aa, aa, a. So for the two strings of length 2 (n-1=2), they are both \"aa\". So when trying to construct s_candidate, for example, taking p as \"aa\" and s as \"aa\", then check if s starts with p[1:], which is \"a\". Since s is \"aa\", the first n-2=1 character is \"a\", which matches p[1:] (which is \"a\"). So the s_candidate is p + s[-1] = \"aa\" + \"a\" = \"aaa\". Which is correct.\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, for each input string, we check if it is a prefix or suffix. For example, the input strings are \"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\", \"a\". For the s_candidate \"aaa\", the prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\" (but the input strings are only up to length 2). So the input strings of length 1 are \"a\" and \"a\". Both are prefixes and suffixes. The two \"aa\" are prefixes and suffixes. So for each input string, we can assign either P or S as long as it's correct. However, the problem requires that the total number of P and S is equal (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes). But since the input has exactly 2n-2 strings, and each is assigned as P or S, the count will be correct.\n\nBut when generating the answer, for each input string, we need to decide whether it's a prefix or a suffix. However, for some strings, they may be both. How to choose which to assign? Well, the problem says that any valid assignment is acceptable. So for example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, we can assign it as P or S, as long as the overall counts are correct.\n\nBut how to ensure that when building the answer? Because for the given s_candidate, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix. So for each input string, it's possible that it's both. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so for each input string, it is a prefix or a suffix of the correct s. So for the s_candidate we found, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nBut how to check that? Well, during the validation step when checking if the s_candidate is valid, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. If any of them is neither, then this s_candidate is invalid.\n\nOnce we have a valid s_candidate, then for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix or suffix. However, for some input strings, they may be both. For example, the string \"a\" in the second example. So, when generating the answer, for each input string, we can assign it as P if it is a prefix, or as S if it is a suffix. However, the problem requires that the number of P and S is equal. Since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, and the input has exactly 2n-2 strings, the answer must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. So when building the answer, for each input string, we need to assign it as either P or S, ensuring that the counts are correct. However, the way we choose between P and S for strings that are both may affect the counts. For example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, but we assign it as P, then another string that is only a suffix may need to be assigned as S. But since the problem says that the input is valid, there must be a way to assign the labels correctly.\n\nBut perhaps for our purposes, once we have the correct s_candidate, we can assign for each input string as follows: if it's a prefix, assign P; else assign S. However, this may not work if a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, if a string is both, then assigning it as P would take away one of the P's, but maybe there's a need to assign some other string as S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix. If it is, assign P. Else, assign S. But since the input is guaranteed to be valid, this should work. Because for each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix. So, for example, in the third example input, the input is 2, and the strings are \"a\" and \"c\". The possible s_candidate is \"ac\" or \"ca\". Let's take \"ac\": the prefixes are \"a\" and \"ac\" (but the input strings are of length 1, so only \"a\" is a prefix. The suffixes are \"c\" and \"ac\" (so input strings are \"a\" and \"c\". So \"a\" is a prefix, \"c\" is a suffix. So the answer is PS. Alternatively, if the s_candidate is \"ca\", then \"c\" is a prefix, \"a\" is a suffix. So the answer is SP. Both are acceptable. So in this case, the code can choose either.\n\nSo the approach would be: once we have the correct s_candidate, for each input string, check if it is a prefix. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, for strings that are both, this would assign P. But that's okay, as long as the total number of P and S is correct. However, since the input is valid, the number of prefixes and suffixes in the input must be exactly n-1 each. So for the input strings, each of them is either a prefix or a suffix. So, if we assign P to all prefixes and S to all suffixes, then the counts will be correct.\n\nBut how to check if a string is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate? For example, for a string that is both, like \"a\" in the second example. But in that case, the code can choose either P or S. However, the problem says that any valid answer is acceptable. So perhaps the code can assign P if the string is a prefix, else assign S. But in that case, even if the string is a prefix and a suffix, it's assigned as P. However, the problem requires that the total number of P and S is equal. So how do we ensure that?\n\nWell, since the input is guaranteed to be valid, the number of prefixes in the input is exactly n-1, and the number of suffixes is exactly n-1. So for the s_candidate, each input string is a prefix or a suffix. So if we count how many of the input strings are prefixes of s_candidate, then that number must be exactly n-1. Similarly for suffixes. So, when building the answer, we can assign P to those that are prefixes (even if they are also suffixes), and S to those that are suffixes but not prefixes. However, in cases where a string is both, we need to make sure that we don't overcount. But since the input is valid, the count of prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) will be exactly n-1, and the same for suffixes. Therefore, if we assign P to all prefixes (including those that are also suffixes), then the total number of P's will be n-1, and the rest will be S's.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce we have the correct s_candidate:\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign 'P'; else, assign 'S'.\n\nBut how to check if it's a prefix? Well, the string's length must be less than or equal to n. But since the input strings are of lengths from 1 to n-1, that's already satisfied. So for a given input string, check if s_candidate starts with that string. Similarly for suffix.\n\nSo, for example, the input string is \"a\", and s_candidate is \"ababa\", then \"a\" is a prefix (yes) and a suffix (no, because the suffix of length 1 is \"a\" (the last character). Wait, in this case, the s_candidate is \"ababa\", so the suffixes of length 1 is \"a\", so \"a\" is both a prefix and a suffix. So in that case, the code would assign P, but that's okay.\n\nBut how to ensure that the number of P's is exactly n-1. Well, because the input is generated from the prefixes and suffixes of the original string s_candidate. So the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes. For example, for s_candidate, the prefixes of lengths 1 to n-1 are exactly n-1 strings. Similarly for the suffixes. But the input has exactly two strings for each length. So, for example, for each length, there are two strings. But the original string's prefixes and suffixes of that length may have duplicates. For example, in the case of \"aaa\", the prefixes of length 2 are \"aa\", and the suffixes of length 2 are \"aa\". So the input for that case would have two \"aa\" strings. So for each input string, the code will check if it is a prefix (and assign P) or not (assign S). But since the input has exactly the prefixes and suffixes, the count of P's would be exactly the number of prefixes (n-1), and the count of S's would be exactly the number of suffixes (n-1). So the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps for the code are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings into a list.\n\nCollect all the strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates.\n\nFor each possible pair (p, s) in candidates (there are two possibilities, since there are two elements):\n\n   if s starts with p[1:]:\n\n       construct s_candidate = p + s[-1]\n\n       check if all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\n       if yes:\n\n           then proceed to generate the answer based on s_candidate.\n\nOnce such a valid s_candidate is found, generate the answer by checking for each input string if it is a prefix of s_candidate (then assign 'P') else 'S'.\n\nNow, the problem is how to check if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut how to do that? For each input string, check if it is a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut how to check that. For example, for a given string in the input, say 'str', check if s_candidate.startswith(str) or s_candidate.endswith(str).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, once we have s_candidate, loop through all the input strings, and for each, check if it is a prefix or suffix. If any of them is neither, then this s_candidate is invalid. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all possible pairs of the two candidates of length n-1, and check for each possibility.\n\nBut how to get the two candidates? For example, in the input, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. So, for example, in the first sample input, the n is 5, and the strings of length 4 are 'abab' and 'baba'? Or wait, looking at the first example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is 5, then 8 lines (since 2*5-2=8). The input strings are:\n\nba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba.\n\nThe strings of length 4 (n-1=4) are abab (length 4?), let's see:\n\nabab is length 4. Then, baba is length 4. So the two candidates are abab and baba.\n\nSo, for each pair (p, s) where p is abab and s is baba, check if s starts with p[1:].\n\np[1:] is 'bab' (since p is 'abab', indices 0-3, [1:] is 'bab'). s is 'baba' (length 4). The first n-2 = 5-2 = 3 characters of s is 'bab', which equals p[1:], so yes. Then, the s_candidate is p + s[-1] = abab + 'a' = ababa. Which is the correct string.\n\nThen, check if all input strings are prefix or suffix of ababa.\n\nFor example, the input strings are:\n\nba (length 2). Is it a prefix? ababa starts with 'ba'? No. The first two letters are 'ab'. So no. Is it a suffix? The last two letters are 'ba' (positions 3-4). Yes. So 'ba' is a suffix.\n\nSimilarly, the other strings can be checked. So this s_candidate is valid.\n\nSo the code would generate the answer based on this s_candidate.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all possible pairs of the two length n-1 strings, check if they can form a valid s_candidate, and then check if all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to generate the answer.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen, read 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called 'strings'.\n\nThen, collect all the strings of length n-1. Let's call them 'candidates_n_minus_1' = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]. Since the input is guaranteed to have exactly two of them.\n\nThen, for each possible permutation of these two (i.e., (p, s) and (s, p)), check if s starts with p[1:].\n\nFor example:\n\nfor p in candidates_n_minus_1:\n\n    for s in candidates_n_minus_1:\n\n        if p != s:\n\n            check if s starts with p[1:]\n\nBut since there are exactly two elements, the possible pairs are:\n\n(p1, p2) and (p2, p1).\n\nSo, for each pair (p, s) where p and s are the two candidates, check if s starts with p[1:].\n\nOnce that is done, construct s_candidate as p + s[-1].\n\nThen, check for all input strings if they are a prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, proceed to generate the answer.\n\nOnce the answer is generated, output the corresponding string of P and S.\n\nNow, how to check if all input strings are either prefix or suffix of s_candidate?\n\nFor each string in the input list, check if s_candidate starts with the string or ends with the string.\n\nIf all pass, then proceed.\n\nOnce that is done, generate the answer.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code can loop through the possible pairs, and for each, generate s_candidate and check validity.\n\nOnce a valid one is found, proceed.\n\nNow, what if there are multiple valid s_candidates? For example, in the second sample input, the input is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nThe two candidates of length 2 (n-1=2) are 'aa' and 'aa'. So, for p and s being the same (since both are 'aa'), then check if s starts with p[1:]. p[1:] is 'a' (since p is 'aa'), and s is 'aa', so the first n-2=1 character is 'a', which matches. So the s_candidate is p + s[-1] = 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'.\n\nCheck all input strings. All of them are prefixes or suffixes of 'aaa'.\n\nSo the code proceeds.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n.\n\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2*n - 2)]\n\ncandidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\nfor i in range(2):\n\n    for j in range(2):\n\n        if i == j:\n\n            continue\n\n        p = candidates[i]\n\n        s = candidates[j]\n\n        # check if s starts with p[1:]\n\n        if len(p) == n-1 and len(s) == n-1:\n\n            if s.startswith(p[1:]):\n\n                # construct s_candidate\n\n                s_candidate = p + s[-1]\n\n                # check all strings are prefix or suffix of s_candidate\n\n                valid = True\n\n                for st in strings:\n\n                    if not (s_candidate.startswith(st) or s_candidate.endswith(st)):\n\n                        valid = False\n\n                        break\n\n                if valid:\n\n                    # generate the answer\n\n                    res = []\n\n                    for st in strings:\n\n                        if s_candidate.startswith(st):\n\n                            res.append('P')\n\n                        else:\n\n                            res.append('S')\n\n                    print(''.join(res))\n\n                    exit()\n\nBut wait, the code above checks for i and j in 0 and 1, but for i and j being 0 and 1, and 1 and 0. However, the code above loops i and j in 0 and 1, but skips when i == j. So for the two candidates, the code checks (i=0, j=1) and (i=1, j=0). But for the case where the two candidates are same (like in the second example), then p and s are same. So, for example, when i=0 and j=1, p is same as s. Then, check if s starts with p[1:]. Which is true, since p is same as s. So, the code would generate the s_candidate as p + s[-1] = p + p[-1] = p + p[-1] = p + p[-1] = p + last character of p. But since p is length n-1, adding one character makes it length n.\n\nBut in the case where the two candidates are same, then both (i=0,j=1) and (i=1,j=0) would be considered, but they are same. So the code would process them twice, but once valid is found, it would proceed.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be optimized by considering the two possible permutations (p and s) once.\n\nBut regardless, the code would work.\n\nBut what if there are multiple valid s_candidate? For example, in the third sample input, the two candidates of length 1 (n=2, n-1=1). The two strings are 'a' and 'c'. So, for p = 'a', s = 'c', check if s starts with p[1:]. p is length 1, so p[1:] is empty string. So s (which is 'c') starts with empty string, which is always true. So s_candidate is p + s[-1] = 'a' + 'c' = 'ac'. Then check if all input strings are prefix or suffix. The input strings are 'a' and 'c'. 'a' is a prefix of 'ac', 'c' is a suffix. So valid. Then, the answer is 'PS'.\n\nAlternatively, for p='c' and s='a', check if s starts with p[1:], which is empty string. So yes. Then s_candidate is 'c' + 'a' = 'ca'. Then check input strings: 'a' is a suffix, 'c' is a prefix. So answer is 'SP'.\n\nThe code would generate either of them, depending on which pair is processed first.\n\nBut the code will generate the first valid one it finds. So for the third sample input, the code would generate 'PS' or 'SP' depending on the order of processing.\n\nBut the problem says that any valid answer is acceptable. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code may have to check both possibilities. For example, in the first sample input, the two candidates are 'abab' and 'baba'. So when checking (p=abab, s=baba), the code generates s_candidate ababa, which is valid. When checking the other possibility (p=baba, s=abab), check if abab starts with baba[1:]. baba[1:] is 'aba'. abab starts with 'aba'? The first three characters of abab are 'aba' (since length is 4). So yes. Then, the s_candidate is baba + abab[-1] = baba + 'b' = 'babab'.\n\nNow, check if all input strings are prefix or suffix of 'babab'.\n\nOriginal input strings are:\n\nba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba.\n\nCheck for 'abab' (length 4). The s_candidate is 'babab' (length 5). Does it start with 'abab'? No. Does it end with it? The last four characters are 'abab' (positions 1-4). So yes. So 'abab' is a suffix. Similarly, check for 'baba' (length 4). The s_candidate is 'babab' (length 5). The first four characters are 'baba', so yes. So 'baba' is a prefix. So the code would generate a valid s_candidate here as well.\n\nBut then, the code would generate two possible s_candidates. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have at least one valid s_candidate. But how do we know which one to choose?\n\nIn the first sample input, the correct s_candidate is 'ababa', but the other possibility would be 'babab'. However, the input strings include 'abab' (which is a suffix of 'babab') and 'baba' (which is a prefix of 'babab'). However, the other input strings may not be prefixes or suffixes of 'babab'.\n\nFor example, the input string 'a' (length 1). In 'babab', the prefixes of length 1 is 'b', and the suffixes of length 1 is 'b'. So the input string 'a' is not a prefix or suffix. So the code would reject this s_candidate.\n\nThus, the code would check for the first valid s_candidate, which is 'ababa', and proceed.\n\nSo the code's approach of checking all possible pairs and proceeding with the first valid one is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate the answer once a valid s_candidate is found.\n\nNow, the code must process all possible pairs of the two candidates. For example, in the case where the two candidates are same (like in the second example), then both pairs would generate same s_candidate. But the code would process it once.\n\nNow, what about the code's handling of the candidates? For example, the code may have candidates as a list of two elements. Then, for i in 0 and 1, j in 0 and 1, but skip when i == j. So for i=0, j=1 and i=1, j=0.\n\nBut in the case where the two candidates are same, then for both i=0,j=1 and i=1,j=0, the code would process the same pair (p and s are same). However, the code would check if s starts with p[1:] which is same as p starts with p[1:] (since p and s are same). Which would be true if p[1:] is a prefix of s (which is same as p). So for example, if p is 'aa' (n-1=2), then p[1:] is 'a', and s is 'aa', which starts with 'a' (yes). So the code would generate s_candidate as p + s[-1] = 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'.\n\nNow, the code would process this pair twice, but in both cases, the same s_candidate is generated. However, the code would check for validity, and once it's valid, the code would proceed.\n\nNow, the code may generate the same s_candidate multiple times, but once it's found valid, it would proceed.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where n=2. Then, the input has 2 strings (2*2-2=2). Each of length 1. The two candidates are the two strings. For example, input is 2, and strings are 'a' and 'c'. Then, the code will process the two possible pairs (p and s). For each pair, check if s starts with p[1:]. Since p is of length 1, p[1:] is empty string. So s starts with empty string is always true. Then, s_candidate is p + s[-1] = p + s (since s is length 1). So for p='a', s='c', s_candidate is 'ac'. For p='c', s='a', s_candidate is 'ca'. Now, check for all input strings (which are 'a' and 'c') whether they are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate. For 'ac', 'a' is prefix, 'c' is suffix. For 'ca', 'c' is prefix, 'a' is suffix. Either is valid. So the code would generate either 'PS' or 'SP'.\n\nAnother edge case: when the two candidates are same. For example, n=3, and the two candidates are 'aa' and 'aa'. Then, for both pairs, the code would generate s_candidate as 'aaa', which is valid.\n\nAnother case: when the s_candidate is not valid. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there will be at least one valid s_candidate.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut first, note that in the code, the code needs to read the input. However, the input is given as per the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves constructing a potential string `s` based on the given prefixes and suffixes and then validating it against all input strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the integer `n` and the subsequent `2n-2` strings.\n2. **Identify Candidates**: Extract the two strings of length `n-1` from the input, as they are potential candidates for being the longest prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`.\n3. **Construct Potential String**: For each pair of these candidates, check if they can form a valid string `s` by ensuring that the suffix starts with the appropriate substring of the prefix.\n4. **Validation**: Once a potential string `s` is constructed, validate it against all input strings to ensure each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n5. **Generate Result**: Based on the validated string `s`, determine the correct assignment of 'P' (prefix) and 'S' (suffix) for each input string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\nstrings = [input().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n\n# Find the two strings of length n-1\ncandidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == n-1]\n\n# Try both possible pairs (p, s) and (s, p)\nfor i in range(2):\n    for j in range(2):\n        if i == j:\n            continue\n        p = candidates[i]\n        s = candidates[j]\n        # Check if s starts with p[1:]\n        if s.startswith(p[1:]):\n            # Construct candidate s_candidate\n            s_candidate = p + s[-1]\n            # Check all input strings are prefix or suffix of s_candidate\n            valid = True\n            for st in strings:\n                if not (s_candidate.startswith(st) or s_candidate.endswith(st)):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                # Generate the answer\n                res = []\n                for st in strings:\n                    if s_candidate.startswith(st):\n                        res.append('P')\n                    else:\n                        res.append('S')\n                print(''.join(res))\n                exit()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for forming the unknown string `s`.\n3. **Constructing Potential String**: By checking if one candidate can be a suffix starting with the appropriate substring of the other candidate, we construct a potential string `s_candidate`.\n4. **Validation**: Each input string is checked to ensure it is either a prefix or a suffix of the constructed `s_candidate`. If valid, the solution proceeds to generate the result.\n5. **Generating Result**: For each input string, we determine if it is a prefix or suffix of the validated `s_candidate` and construct the result string accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes using logical checks and validation against all input strings.",
