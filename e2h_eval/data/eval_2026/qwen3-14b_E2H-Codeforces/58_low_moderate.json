You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the minimum number of edges to add to form an odd-length cycle and the number of ways to do that. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's required. A simple cycle of odd length with each vertex appearing once. So, the graph must have such a cycle after adding some edges. The question is about finding the minimal t and the number of ways to achieve that.\n\nWait, but what's the condition for a graph to have an odd-length cycle? Oh right! If the graph is bipartite, then it doesn't have any odd-length cycles. Because bipartite graphs can only have even-length cycles. So if the graph is bipartite, we need to add edges to make it non-bipartite. Otherwise, if there's already an odd-length cycle, then t is zero, and w is 1? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem says that the original graph might not have any odd-length cycles. So first, we need to check whether the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If it does, then t is 0 and w is 1? No, wait, the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges to form such a cycle. But if the graph already has an odd cycle, then t is zero, and the number of ways is the number of possible ways to add zero edges (but that would be one way, but maybe there are multiple existing cycles). Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the output is the number of ways to add t edges to form such a cycle. So if the graph already has at least one odd cycle, then t is zero. But how many ways are there? Because adding zero edges would mean that there's already a cycle. However, the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges. But in this case, adding zero edges would count as one way. But wait, the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add exactly t edges. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then t is zero. But how many ways are there to add zero edges such that the graph has an odd cycle? Well, that's just 1 way, because you don't add any edges. Wait, no. Because there might be multiple existing odd cycles. But the problem says that the ways are considered equal if they have the same set of added edges. Since adding zero edges is only one way, regardless of how many existing cycles there are. So in that case, the answer would be t=0 and w=1. But wait, the example input includes a case where the graph is a triangle (3 nodes connected in a cycle). For that input, the output is '0 1', which matches that idea. So that seems right.\n\nSo the first thing to check is whether the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If yes, then t=0 and w=1. But how to check that?\n\nBut how to check if the graph has an odd-length cycle? Well, that's equivalent to checking if the graph is bipartite. If the graph is bipartite, then there are no odd-length cycles. Otherwise, there is at least one.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Check if the graph is bipartite. If it is not, then t=0 and w=1. But wait, no. Because even if the graph is not bipartite, there might be multiple ways to add zero edges. But since adding zero edges is one way, but the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then t is zero and w is 1. Because the way is to add zero edges. So regardless of how many existing cycles there are, the number of ways is 1. Because the way is determined by the set of edges added. Since adding zero edges is one way. So that's the case.\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem requires that the added edges form a cycle. So even if the graph already has an odd cycle, but there are multiple such cycles, but the way to add zero edges is only one way. So the answer is t=0 and w=1.\n\nSo the first case: if the graph already has an odd cycle, then output is 0 1.\n\nOtherwise, the graph is bipartite. Then, we need to add edges to create an odd-length cycle. What is the minimal number of edges to add?\n\nIn a bipartite graph, any cycle is even-length. To create an odd-length cycle, we need to add edges in such a way that there's a cycle with odd length.\n\nHow can we do that? Let's think about the structure of bipartite graphs. A bipartite graph is divided into two parts, say A and B. All edges go",
