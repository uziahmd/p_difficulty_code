The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many even and odd chests there are, and then count how many even and odd keys there are. Then, the maximum possible is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because each even chest can be matched with an odd key, and each odd chest can be matched with an even key. But since each key can be used once, and each chest once, we need to take the minimum of the counts for each pair.\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\n- Count the number of even chests (even_chest) and odd chests (odd_chest).\n- Count the number of even keys (even_key) and odd keys (odd_key).\n- The answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for example, if there are 3 even chests and 5 odd keys, then we can match 3 of them. Similarly for the other part.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the list of a_i's. Count how many are even and odd.\n3. Read the list of b_j's. Count how many are even and odd.\n4. Compute the sum as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n5. Output that sum.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=5, m=4\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\nLooking at the a's:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So odd_chest is 2, even_chest is 3.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]\nEven keys: 8,4,20 (even_key=3), odd keys: 7 (odd_key=1).\n\nSo min(3,1) + min(2,3) = 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the first output.\n\nSecond example input:\nn=5, m=1\na is [2,4,6,8,10], all even. So even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\nb is [5], which is odd. So odd_key=1, even_key=0.\n\nSo min(5,1) + min(0,0) = 1 + 0 = 1. Correct.\n\nThird example:\nn=1, m=4\na is [10] (even). So even_chest=1, odd_chest=0.\nb is [20,30,40,50], all even. So even_key=4, odd_key=0.\n\nSo min(1,0) + min(0,4) = 0 + 0 = 0. Correct.\n\nSo this logic works for the examples. \n\nNow, the code. How to implement this?\n\nIn Python, read n and m from input. Then read the a list, then the b list.\n\nFor counting even and odd in a:\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\nSimilarly for the keys:\n\neven_key = sum(1 for y in b if y % 2 == 0)\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nThen compute the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where there are more keys than chests? Like, say, even_chest is 3, and odd_key is 5. Then min(3,5) is 3. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead input: first line is n and m. Then second line is n integers. Third line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the user provided the input as a list of strings, but in the actual problem, the input is read from stdin. So in the code, we need to read from stdin.\n\nBut for the code submission, the code should read from stdin. So for example, in Python:\n\nRead the first line as n, m.\n\nThen read the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen read the third line as list of integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute even_chest, etc.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = sum(1 for y in b if y % 2 == 0)\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n\nThat's the code. Let me check for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All chests even, all keys even. Then answer is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: All chests even, keys have some odd. So min(even_chest, odd_key) is the answer.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are more keys than needed. Like, even_chest is 2, odd_key is 5. So min(2,5) is 2. So that's correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na: 9,14,6,2,11 → even_chest is 3 (14,6,2), odd_chest is 2.\n\nb: 8,4,7,20 → even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7). So min(3,1) is 1, min(2,3) is 2 → total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: n=5, m=1. a is all even. b is 5 (odd). So min(5,1) is 1, min(0, 0) is 0. Total 1.\n\nThird sample: a is even, b all even. So min(1,0) is 0 and min(0,4) is 0. Total 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. a is 3 (odd), b is 2 (even). Then min(0, 1) + min(1, 0) → 0 + 0 = 0? Wait no. Wait:\n\neven_chest is 0 (since a is odd). odd_chest is 1.\n\neven_key is 1 (since b is even). odd_key is 0.\n\nSo min(0, 0) (even_chest vs odd_key) → 0. min(1, 1) (odd_chest vs even_key) → 1. So total 1. Which is correct. Because the key is even, and the chest is odd. Their sum is 3+2=5, which is odd. So yes, 1.\n\nSo code would return 1.\n\nYes. So code works.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys, where each chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This requires matching even and odd numbers from the chests and keys appropriately.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Condition**: A chest with an even number can only be opened by a key with an odd number, and vice versa. Therefore, we need to count how many even and odd numbers are present in both the chests and the keys.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: For both the chests and keys, count how many numbers are even and how many are odd.\n3. **Optimal Pairing**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of two minimum values:\n   - The minimum of the count of even chests and the count of odd keys.\n   - The minimum of the count of odd chests and the count of even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\neven_key = sum(1 for y in b if y % 2 == 0)\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of chests and keys, followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We count how many even and odd numbers are present in the list of chests and keys.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Openable Chests**: Using the counts of even and odd numbers from both lists, we determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened by considering the optimal pairings of even-odd and odd-even combinations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the result in linear time relative to the size of the input lists, making it suitable for large inputs up to the constraint limits.",
