For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the note order and how to calculate the distances between them. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C. So each note has a position, and the distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones from the first to the second, moving forward in the sequence.\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. Between C and D is 2, etc. But since the notes are cyclic, if I have a note that's before another in the list, like H and C, the distance from H to C is 1 semitone. But when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the minimal way? No, no. Wait the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. Wait, the example says that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the order: C (0), C# (1), D (2), D# (3), E (4). So from C to E is 4 semitones. That's correct. And between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones? Because if you go forward from E to C, you have E to F (5), F# (6), G (7), G# (8), A (9), B (10), H (11), C (12). Wait, but the distance between E and C would be 8 semitones? Because the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So if the first note is lower than the second, you take the forward direction. But if the first note is higher, then you have to loop around?\n\nWait, no. Wait the problem says: \"the distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one\". So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones from X to Y. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones from Y to X? No, no. Wait, the example says that between E and C is 8 semitones. Let me think. Let's say the notes are arranged in a circle. The distance between E and C can be calculated as follows: if you go forward from E to C, you have to go through all the notes until you reach C again. But that's not the case. Wait, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let me count:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then back to C.\n\nSo from E to C: if you go forward, you have to go E -> F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8). So yes, 8 semitones. But the distance between E and C is 8. However, if we have X and Y, then the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12? No, because if X is before Y, then the distance is Y - X. But if X is after Y, then the distance is (12 - X + Y) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Because that's the number of steps you need to take moving forward from X to reach Y. Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's imagine that the notes are arranged in a circle. The distance between X and Y is the minimal number of semitones when moving forward from X to Y. So for example, if X is E (position 4) and Y is C (position 0), then moving forward from E to C would require going all the way around. So the distance is (0 + 12 - 4) = 8. Which matches the example. So the formula for the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12? No",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is neither. The solution involves calculating the distances between the notes in a specific order and checking if they meet the criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Assign each note a numerical position based on its order in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, calculate the distance in semitones by considering their positions in the scale. The distance from note X to Y is calculated as `(Y_position - X_position) % 12` if moving forward, otherwise `(Y_position + 12 - X_position)`.\n3. **Triad Check**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if they form a major or minor triad. A major triad has a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third. A minor triad has a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_pos(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Calculate distances\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    # Calculate distances\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    # Generate all permutations of the three notes\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_pos = note_to_pos(x)\n        y_pos = note_to_pos(y)\n        z_pos = note_to_pos(z)\n        if is_major(x_pos, y_pos, z_pos):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x_pos, y_pos, z_pos):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\n# Read input\ninput_notes = input().strip().split()\n# Process and print output\nprint(classify_chord(input_notes))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Mapping**: The `note_to_pos` function maps each note to its corresponding position in the musical scale. This allows us to use arithmetic operations to determine distances between notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Triad Check**: The `is_major` and `is_minor` functions check if the distances between the notes in a given permutation match the criteria for major or minor triads. By checking all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that we consider all possible orderings.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the type of chord by leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
