For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So, for example, the distance from C to C# is 1 semitone, and from C to D is 2 semitones, etc. But when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the number of semitones moving upwards. Like, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of steps from X to Y. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance is calculated as (Y's position + 12 - X's position) semitones? Or wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the highest. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because if you go from E up to C, but since it's cyclic, maybe that's not the way. Wait, the example says that between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me think: the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, etc. So from C to E, there are 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, C to D is 2, C to D# is 3, C to E is 4). So yes, that's correct. Then between E and C, the distance is calculated as going from E up to C. But since E is higher than C, perhaps the distance is (C's position + 12 - E's position) semitones. Let me see: the positions can be mapped as follows. Let's assign each note an index. Let's say C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Wait, the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is the 12th note. Wait, but the list has 12 elements. So indexes 0 to 11. So for example, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? No, because if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). But the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper. So for example, between E (index 4) and C (index 0), the distance is (0 + 12 - 4) = 8 semitones. Which matches the example given. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y > X, else (Y + 12 - X). But another way to calculate it is (Y - X) mod 12? No, because if Y is smaller than X, then (Y - X) mod 12 would be (Y - X + 12) mod 12, which would give the same as (Y + 12 - X). So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if positive, else (Y - X + 12). So the distance is (Y - X) % 12? Wait no. Because if Y is larger than X, then (Y - X) mod 12 is (Y - X). If Y is smaller than X, then (Y - X) mod 12 is (Y - X + 12). So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's compute that. Let's say X is E (4), Y is C (0). Then (Y - X) mod 12 is (0 - 4) mod 12 = 8. Yes. So that's correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is from the lower note to the upper, but",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The solution involves checking the distances between the notes in all possible orderings to see if they meet the criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to an index based on its position in the cyclic sequence of 12 notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Check All Permutations**: For each permutation of the three notes, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Determine Result**: Based on the distances found, classify the triad as major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef get_distance(a, b):\n    # Calculate the distance from a to b along the scale (a to b is the number of semitones)\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X-Y is 4 and Y-Z is 3\n    dist_xy = get_distance(x, y)\n    dist_yz = get_distance(y, z)\n    return dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X-Y is 3 and Y-Z is 4\n    dist_xy = get_distance(x, y)\n    dist_yz = get_distance(y, z)\n    return dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` function converts each note into an integer index based on its position in the list of musical notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The `get_distance` function calculates the distance between two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n3. **Triad Checks**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` check if the distances between the notes in a given permutation meet the criteria for major or minor triads.\n4. **Permutations Check**: The `classify_chord` function checks all permutations of the three notes to determine if any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad. If none do, it returns \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the triad are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
