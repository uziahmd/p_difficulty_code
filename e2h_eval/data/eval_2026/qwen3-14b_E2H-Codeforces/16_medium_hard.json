Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from one block (region) to another, where each step involves crossing a road (i.e., moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border). The home and university are in different blocks, and we need to find the shortest path between them.\n\nFirst, I need to model the problem. The key here is to represent each block as a node in a graph, and edges between nodes exist if the corresponding blocks share a common border (so they can be moved between in one step). Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Since there are infinite regions, it's impossible to list them all. However, perhaps there's a way to model the problem using the roads and their intersections. Alternatively, maybe we can model the problem based on the parity of the regions relative to the roads.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each road, a point is either on one side or the other. So for each road, we can determine which side the home and university are on. Then, the problem becomes similar to a graph where each node represents a region, and edges connect regions that are adjacent across a road.\n\nBut how to model the regions? Well, since each road divides the plane into two parts, the regions can be represented by the sign of each road's equation evaluated at a point. However, with multiple roads, the regions are determined by the combination of signs for all roads.\n\nBut considering that each road can be considered as a hyperplane, the regions are the connected components of the arrangement of these hyperplanes. However, the number of regions can be very large, so enumerating them isn't feasible. So, we need another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of each region as being determined by the set of roads that separate it from the home region. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a region, but instead of explicitly representing regions, we can use BFS by considering the regions as being determined by their relation to the roads. However, how to determine adjacency between regions?\n\nAnother thought: Each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. So, the regions can be represented by the signs of the equations. However, since there are n roads, each region can be represented by a binary vector (signs) of length n, but with some constraints. But even then, with n up to 300, that's 2^300 possibilities, which is way too big.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible. We need something else.\n\nLet me think about the movement. To move from one block to another, you must cross a road. Each road is a line. So, two regions are adjacent if they share a common border, which implies that they differ by exactly one road. Because if two regions differ by more than one road, their boundaries might not be adjacent. Wait, maybe not. But perhaps, the adjacency is determined by whether the two regions differ by exactly one road. Or maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each road divides the plane into two. So, any two regions that are separated by exactly one road (i.e., they differ in exactly one road's sign) are adjacent. But that's not necessarily true. Because, suppose there are two roads that cross each other. Then, regions that differ in two roads' signs could be adjacent if they share a common boundary. Wait, no. For example, imagine two perpendicular roads. They divide the plane into four regions. Each region is adjacent to two others. But each region is separated by exactly one road from the adjacent regions. So, the regions that are adjacent differ in exactly one road's sign. Because, for example, if you cross one road, you flip its sign. So maybe the adjacency is equivalent to differing in exactly one road's sign. If that's the case, then the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a state of signs (for each road, whether the point is on one side or the other), and two states are connected if they differ in exactly one road's sign. But again, with 300 roads, this is impossible to model directly.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the home and university positions are fixed. So maybe we can model the problem by considering the home's position and the university's position and how they relate to each road. Then, the problem is to find the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home's region to the university's region.\n\nWait, here's another idea. Let's think of each region as being characterized by the signs of the equations evaluated at that point. For each road, we can compute whether the home is on the positive or negative side of the road. Similarly for the university. Then, the problem becomes finding the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed (i.e., flipped) to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, with the constraint that each step flips exactly one road's sign. But that would imply that the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors. But that's only true if each step can flip exactly one road. However, this is not necessarily correct because flipping one road's sign may not lead to an adjacent region. Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that regions adjacent across a road differ in exactly one road's sign. So, if that's the case, then the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. But this seems too simple, and the example given contradicts this.\n\nLet me check the first example:\n\nInput:\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0; and 1x +0y +0 =0 → x=0. So the roads are x=0 and y=0.\n\nThe home (1,1) is in the region where x>0 and y>0. The university is (-1,-1) which is x<0 and y<0. So the sign vector for home is (for road 1: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0 → positive; road 2: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1>0 → positive. So sign vector is (+, +). For the university, road 1: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → negative; road 2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → negative. So sign vector is (-,-). The Hamming distance is 2, which matches the sample output of 2. So that works.\n\nAnother example: the second input is home (1,1), university (-1,-1), and three roads: x=0, y=0, and x+y-3=0. Let's see. The home (1,1) is on the positive side of x=0 (x>0), positive of y=0 (y>0), and for x+y-3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0. So sign vector is (+, +, -). University (-1,-1): x=-1 <0 → -, y=-1 <0 → -, x+y-3 is -1-1-3 = -5 <0 → -, so sign vector is (-,-,-). Hamming distance is 2 (the first two roads differ). But the sample output is 2. Which matches. So that seems to work.\n\nBut why does this work? Because each step corresponds to crossing a road, which flips exactly one sign. So the minimal steps needed is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. But why?\n\nBecause, each time you cross a road, you flip exactly one sign. So the minimal steps is the number of roads where the signs differ between the home and university. But why can't there be a shorter path?\n\nFor example, suppose two roads are crossed, but the Hamming distance is 2. But maybe there's a way to cross one road and reach the target. But that would require that the sign vectors differ in exactly one road. So if the Hamming distance is 2, then the minimal steps is 2. So the answer is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\nWait, but this seems too easy. How can that be? Let's think of a scenario where the Hamming distance is 2, but you can cross two roads in a way that you reach the target in one step. No, because each step can only cross one road. So to change two signs, you need two steps.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the answer is the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and the university.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross exactly one road, thereby flipping the sign of that road. Thus, the minimal steps required is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nBut wait, what if there are overlapping roads? Or roads that are parallel?\n\nLet me think of a case where two roads are parallel. Suppose there are two parallel roads, say x=0 and x=1. The home is at (-1, 0), which is on the left of both roads. The university is at (2,0), which is on the right of both roads. The sign vectors for the home would be (negative for x=0, negative for x=1?), but wait, the road equation is ax + by + c =0. For x=0, it's 1x + 0y + 0 = 0. So for home (-1, 0), substituting gives -1 <0. For the road x=1, equation is 1x +0y -1=0. So substituting home gives -1 -1 = -2 <0. So the sign vector for home is (-, -). For the university (2,0), substituting into x=0 gives 2>0, and into x=1 gives 2-1=1>0. So sign vector is (+,+). Hamming distance is 2. So the minimal steps would be 2. But how can you move from home to university? You have to cross the first road (x=0) and then cross the second road (x=1). But the two roads are parallel. So the regions between them are adjacent. So the home is in the region left of both roads. To reach the region right of both, you need to cross both roads. So the minimal steps is 2. Which matches the Hamming distance. So that works.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two roads that cross. Home is in one region, and the university is in the opposite region across both roads. So Hamming distance is 2. The minimal steps would be 2. But perhaps there's a way to cross one road and then another. But that's two steps. So yes.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. For each road, compute the sign of the home point (s1) and the sign of the university point (s2).\n\n2. For each road, check if s1 and s2 are different. Count the number of such roads.\n\n3. The answer is that count.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the sign? For each road equation ai x + bi y + ci = 0. For a point (x, y), compute the value of ai x + bi y + ci. If it's positive, the point is on one side; if negative, on the other. Since the home and university are not on any road, their values are non-zero.\n\nSo for each road, we compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i, and val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. Then, if val1 and val2 have different signs, that road contributes 1 to the count. The total count is the answer.\n\nWait, but that's so simple. So the sample input:\n\nFirst case:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0x +1y +0 =0 (y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0).\n\nFor the first road, val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. Different signs → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: val1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0. val2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. Different signs → count +=1. Total is 2 → answer is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample. Second sample:\n\nRoads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. Home (1,1):\n\nval1 for x=0: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0.\n\nval2 for x=0: -1 → <0. So different → count +=1.\n\nSame for y=0: val1 is 1>0, val2 is -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: x + y -3 = 0. For home (1+1-3) = -1 <0. For university (-1-1-3) = -5 <0. Same signs. So no count. Total count is 2 → answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. But why?\n\nBecause each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So the minimal steps required is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. Because you have to cross each of those roads once. And since each step crosses exactly one road, the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads where the signs differ.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads? For example, suppose there are two roads that cross each other. The home is in a region that is on the positive side of both roads. The university is on the negative side of both. Then, the minimal steps is 2. You can cross the first road, then cross the second road. So that's two steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads, and the home and university differ in two roads. Then, the minimal steps is 2. So regardless of the arrangement of roads, the answer is the count of differing signs.\n\nBut why is this correct? Because each road that has different signs between home and university must be crossed once. And since each step can cross exactly one road, the minimal steps is exactly that count.\n\nThis seems to be the case. Therefore, the solution is to compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides, and count the number of such roads.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a road that is not between the home and university? Like, suppose there are two roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads, but the roads are parallel. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. Which is correct. Because you have to cross both roads. So the answer is indeed the count.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), n roads.\n\nFor each road, compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i.\n\nCompute val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i.\n\nIf val1 * val2 < 0 → the signs differ. Increment the count.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nBut wait, this seems too simple. How can this be the case? Because the problem says that the movement is allowed between regions that share a common border. But according to the problem statement, the movement is allowed if the common border has a non-zero length. So, for example, if two regions are separated by a single point (like if two roads cross, and the regions are adjacent across that point), but they don't share a common segment, then movement is not allowed. However, according to our approach, the answer is based on the number of differing roads, which may not account for that.\n\nWait, but how can that happen? Suppose that two regions are separated by a single point. For example, imagine two roads that cross each other. The home is in one region, and the university is in another region that is separated by two roads. But according to our approach, the answer would be 2 steps, but perhaps there is a way to cross one road and reach the other region. But that's not possible. Because to get from one region to another, you have to cross a road. Each crossing changes exactly one sign. So if the home and university differ in two roads, then you need to cross two roads. But how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose there are two roads, x=0 and y=0. The home is at (1,1) (so signs are +, +). The university is at (-1, 1) (signs -, +). So the differing roads is one (the first road). So according to the approach, the answer is 1. Indeed, you can cross the first road (x=0) and reach the region where x is negative, which is the university's region. So that's correct.\n\nNow, imagine a scenario where the home and university differ in exactly one road, but the regions are not adjacent. How?\n\nIs that possible? Let's think. Suppose there are three roads: x=0, y=0, and x + y = 1. Suppose the home is at (1, 0.5) (so x>0, y>0, x+y=1.5>1 → sign for third road is positive). The university is at (-1, 0.5) (x<0, y>0, x + y = -0.5 <1 → sign for third road is negative). So for the first road (x=0), the signs differ. For the second road (y=0), the signs are same (positive). For the third road, signs differ. So the Hamming distance is 2. According to our approach, the answer is 2. But is there a path?\n\nWell, the home is in the region x>0, y>0, x + y > 1. The university is x<0, y>0, x + y <1. So to get from home to university, you need to cross x=0 (road 1) and x + y =1 (road 3). So two steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the home and university differ in one road, but the regions are not adjacent? Let's think. Suppose there are two roads: x=0 and x=1. The home is at (-1, 0) (so x <0, and x <1 → signs for roads 1 and 2 are negative and negative). The university is at (2, 0) → signs for roads 1 and 2 are positive and positive. So Hamming distance is 2. But to get from home to university, you need to cross road 1 (x=0) and road 2 (x=1). So two steps. But the regions are separated by two roads, and the minimal steps is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut suppose there are two roads that are parallel. The home is on one side of both roads, and the university is on the other side of both. So Hamming distance is 2, and the steps are two. Which is correct.\n\nSo, in all cases, the answer is the Hamming distance. Therefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each road:\n\ncompute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i.\n\ncompute val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i.\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0 → count +=1.\n\nOutput count.\n\nBut why is this correct?\n\nBecause for each road that separates the home and university regions, you need to cross it once. And each such crossing is a step. And the minimal steps is the number of such roads.\n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where you cross a road that doesn't separate the home and university, but somehow allows you to reach the university faster?\n\nFor example, suppose there are three roads. Home and university differ in two roads. But there's a way to cross a third road (which doesn't separate them) and then cross another road, leading to a shorter path. But that's impossible, because the Hamming distance is 2, and crossing any road that doesn't separate them would not change the count. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose there are three roads: x=0, y=0, and x + y = 0. Home is at (1, 1), which is on the positive side of x=0, positive of y=0, and positive of x + y = 0 (since 1+1=2>0). The university is at (-1, -1), which is negative of x=0, negative of y=0, and negative of x + y = 0. So the Hamming distance is 3. So according to the code, the answer is 3. But suppose you cross x=0, then y=0, then x+y=0. Three steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there's a way to cross roads in a different order? It's still three steps. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother example: home and university differ in one road. So answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is read from stdin. The first line is x1 y1, second line x2 y2, third line is n, then n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nBut note that the input may be given as multiple lines. For example, the first example input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut in reality, the input comes as lines from stdin. So for the code, we need to read from stdin.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as x1, y1.\n\nRead the second line as x2, y2.\n\nRead the third line as n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nThen for each of the n roads, compute val1 and val2, check if their product is negative.\n\nCount the number of such roads.\n\nPrint the count.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input:\n\nBut sometimes, the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. The input is given as per the problem. For example, the sample input shows two test cases. However, the problem says that the input is given as per the problem. Wait, looking at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1... etc. So, the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input given, the user provided two examples. But the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSample Output 1: 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nSample Output 2: 2.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the code should read from stdin. So the code should process one test case. So the code is supposed to read the input as follows.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\n\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\n\nn = int(input())\n\nroads = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor a, b, c in roads:\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, that's all? That seems too simple. Let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0 1 0 → 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0. And 1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nval1 for first road: 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1. val2: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * (-1) <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 =-1 → product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), univ (-1,-1). Roads are 1 0 0 → x=0. 0 1 0 → y=0. 1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0.\n\nFor first road: val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0=1 → val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1 → product <0 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: val1 = 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 =-1. val2 = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. So total 2 → correct.\n\nYes. So this code would pass the samples.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because the problem's movement allows moving between regions that share a common border. But according to the problem statement, the movement is allowed if the common border has non-zero length. However, according to our approach, the answer is the number of roads separating the home and university. But why is that the case?\n\nBecause, for each road that separates the home and university, you have to cross it once. And each such crossing is a step. And the minimal steps is the number of such roads. Because, each step can cross exactly one road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where two roads are crossed, but the regions are not separated by those roads?\n\nNo. Because if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, then that road is a separator between them. So, to get from home to university, you must cross that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of such roads.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is as written above. Now, implement it.\n\nBut wait, what about when a road is not a separator? For example, if the home and university are on the same side of a road. Then, crossing that road would take you away from the university, but perhaps there's a path through other roads. But the code counts only those roads that are separators. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block to a target block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each road divides the plane into two regions. The home and university are located in different regions, and the minimum number of steps required to move between these regions is determined by the number of roads that separate them. Specifically, if a road separates the home and university, it means that the home and university lie on opposite sides of that road. The minimum number of steps required is thus equal to the count of such separating roads.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Separation**: For each road, we compute the value of the line equation at the home and university coordinates. If these values have opposite signs (indicating the points are on opposite sides of the road), we increment our count.\n3. **Output Result**: The count of such separating roads is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their solutions, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
