Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how? Since each road divides the plane into regions, the blocks are regions divided by these lines. The challenge is to represent each block in a way that allows us to compute adjacency efficiently.\n\nBut considering that the number of blocks can be huge (since each new line can potentially double the number of regions), it's impossible to generate all blocks explicitly. So we need another approach.\n\nWait, the key insight here is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. So each step corresponds to crossing a single road. However, the adjacency between blocks depends on which roads they are separated by.\n\nAnother thought: think of each block as being defined by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, the block is either on one side of the line or the other. So, for each road, we can determine whether the home point is on the positive or negative side of that line. Similarly for the university.\n\nBut how does this help us find the minimum steps? Maybe we can model this as a graph where each node represents a region (block) and edges exist between regions that share a common border. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home region to the university region.\n\nBut again, with n up to 300, the number of regions is exponential, so enumerating all regions isn't feasible. So there must be another way.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled using BFS, but instead of tracking regions, track the number of roads that separate the current region from the home region. Or maybe think in terms of the parity of the number of roads crossed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each region as being determined by the sign of each road's equation. For example, for each road i, the region is either + or -, depending on whether the point satisfies a_i x + b_i y + c_i > 0 or < 0. So, the home's position defines a signature (a tuple of signs for each road). Similarly for the university.\n\nBut two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if two regions differ in exactly one road, then they are separated by that road, hence adjacent. If they differ in more than one road, then they are not adjacent directly. Wait, is that correct?\n\nYes! Because two regions that are adjacent must share a common boundary, which is a single road. So, their signatures would differ in exactly one road's sign. Therefore, the problem becomes similar to finding the minimum number of sign changes needed to go from the home's signature to the university's signature, where each step can flip exactly one sign.\n\nBut wait, that's not entirely accurate. Because flipping a single sign corresponds to crossing that road. So, the minimal steps would be the number of differing roads between the home and university's signatures, but only if those differences can be achieved by flipping one at a time. However, if the home and university signatures differ in k roads, then the minimal steps would be k. But that's only if each step can flip one road's sign. But that's possible, because each step can cross one road, changing the sign for that road. However, this assumes that there's a path where each step flips one differing road. However, this might not be the case. For example, if two regions differ in two roads, but there's no way to reach from one to the other by flipping one road at a time. But according to the problem's setup, perhaps this is possible.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose the home signature is S and the university is T. Let D be the set of roads where S and T differ. The minimal steps would be the size of D. Because you can cross each road once. Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So, if you start from S, and you flip one road's sign (crossing that road), then you get a new signature. Then, flipping another, etc. So the minimal steps is the number of differing roads between S and T.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me take an example.\n\nSuppose there are two roads. Home is in a region where both roads are positive. The university is in a region where both roads are negative. So D has size 2. So according to the idea, the minimal steps is 2. But can you get there in two steps? Yes. Cross the first road, which flips the first sign. Then cross the second road, which flips the second sign. So yes.\n\nAnother example: suppose home is in a region that is + for road 1 and - for road 2. The university is - for road 1 and + for road 2. So D has size 2. So steps would be 2. But is that possible? Well, you can cross road 1 first, changing to - for road 1 and - for road 2. Then cross road 2, changing to - for road 1 and + for road 2. So yes. So the answer would be 2 steps.\n\nBut what if there's a situation where the home and university differ in k roads, but there's some dependency that requires more steps? For example, maybe some roads are parallel, but that doesn't matter. Because each step can cross any road, regardless of others. So, the minimal steps is the number of differing roads between the home and university's signatures.\n\nWait, but what if the home and university are in the same region? Then the answer is zero. But according to the problem statement, the home and university are in different blocks. Wait, no. The problem says that the home and university are located in some block. But they could be in the same block. However, the problem says that the input is such that the home and university are not on any road. But the problem says nothing about them being in the same block. So, the code must handle that possibility. But according to the problem statement, the output is the minimum steps to get to the university's block. So if they are already in the same block, the answer is zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each road, compute the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. Then, count the number of roads where the signs differ. That's the answer.\n\nWait, but why is that the case?\n\nBecause each differing road requires crossing it once. So, the minimal steps is the number of differing roads. Because each step can cross one road, changing the sign for that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of differing roads between the home and university.\n\nBut wait, this seems too simple. Let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x+1y+0=0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0).\n\nSo, home (1,1) is on the positive side of y=0 (since 1*0 +1*1 +0 = 1>0?), wait the equation is a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. So for the first road, 0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0. So for the home point (1,1), substituting into the left-hand side gives 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 >0. So the sign is positive. For the university (-1,-1), substituting into the same road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So the sign is negative. So this road contributes to the difference.\n\nSecond road is x=0. For home (1,1): 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0. For university (-1,-1): 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 <0. So again, differing. So total differences is 2, so answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input: home (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nLet's compute for each road.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → sign +.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → same as before, 1>0 → +.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → sign -.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → 1*(-1) + ... → -1 <0 → sign -.\n\nRoad 2: same as before → -1 <0 → sign -.\n\nRoad 3: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → same sign as home. So, for road 3, same sign.\n\nSo the differences are for roads 1 and 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples. So the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the sign of the home and the sign of the university differ.\n\nBut wait, why is that the case? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads where the signs differ. Because each differing road must be crossed once. And since you can cross them in any order, the steps would be exactly that count.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where you have to cross a road multiple times? For example, suppose there are two roads, and home and university differ in both. So, you cross one road, then cross the other. That's two steps. But suppose that after crossing the first, you have to cross the same road again. But that's not necessary. Because once you cross a road, you are in a region that has the opposite sign. So, if you have to flip the sign of a road once, you cross it once. So, the minimal steps is the number of differing roads.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\nFor each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). For each road, check if the signs of these two values are different. Count the number of roads where this is true. That's the answer.\n\nBut wait, what about when the home and university are in the same region? Then, the count is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems like a very straightforward solution. But why is this the case? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads where the home and university are on different sides. Because you need to cross each of those roads once.\n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where crossing a road more than once is required? For example, imagine that there are three roads, and the home and university differ in two roads. But crossing one road, then another, then the first again. But that would be unnecessary. Because once you cross a road once, you are in a region that has the opposite sign. So, if you cross it again, you flip back. So, the minimal steps would be to cross each differing road once. Hence, the number of differing roads.\n\nThis seems to be correct. Therefore, the solution is to compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, and count the number of such roads.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Read the home and university coordinates, read the roads, for each road, compute the value for home and for university, check if their product is negative (which means they are on opposite sides). Count the number of such roads.\n\nWait, but how to compute the sign? For each road, compute for home point: val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. Similarly val2 for the university. If val1 and val2 have different signs, then the product val1 * val2 is negative. So, for each road, check if val1 * val2 < 0. If yes, increment the count.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count = 0.\n\nFor each a, b, c:\n\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nOutput count.\n\nWait, but that's all? That seems too easy. But according to the sample inputs, it works. Let's check the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0 1 0 (y=0) and 1 0 0 (x=0).\n\nFor first road:\n\nval1 = 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: val1 is 1*1 + 0*1 +0 = 1. val2 is 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1. product -1 <0 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nRoads are x=0, y=0, x + y -3 =0.\n\nHome (1,1):\n\nFor first road (x=0): val1 = 1*1 + 0*1 +0 = 1. University (-1,-1): val2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1. product negative → count +=1.\n\nSecond road (y=0): same as before. val1 = 1, val2 = -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: a=1, b=1, c=-3. val1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no count. So total is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples. But why is this the case? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once. So, the answer is the count of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because the problem's movement is allowed between adjacent regions. Each step moves across a road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two regions. Because each road that separates them must be crossed once.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads once each? Well, since the roads are arranged in a way that allows moving through them. For example, imagine that you have to cross road A and road B. You can cross road A first, then road B. Even if they are not adjacent, but the regions are connected through some path. But since the roads divide the plane into regions, the regions are connected in a way that allows moving through any sequence of roads. So the minimal steps is indeed the count.\n\nBut what if two regions are separated by multiple roads, but the minimal steps is less than the count? For example, if two regions are separated by two roads, but there's a way to cross one road and then another. But according to the previous logic, the steps would be 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach is correct. Therefore, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where home and university are on same side of all roads. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: when a road is such that home is on one side, and university is on the same side. So, no contribution.\n\nWhat about if a road is such that home is on the positive side, and university is on the negative side. So, contributes 1.\n\nBut how to compute val1 and val2?\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of n lines:\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So, val1 and val2 can't be zero. So, their product can't be zero. So, the code is safe.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nBut why is the problem considered hard? Because perhaps the initial approach is not obvious. But once you realize that the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points, it's straightforward.\n\nSo this is the solution. Let me test it against the samples.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nThe code will process the two roads. For each, val1 and val2 are 1 and -1. Their product is -1, so count increases by 1 each time. Total 2. Output is 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nProcessing:\n\nFirst road: a=1, b=0, c=0. val1 is 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1. val2 is 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1. product negative. count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=0, b=1, c=0. val1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0=1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 = -1. product negative. count +=1.\n\nThird road: a=1, b=1, c=-3. val1 is 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 is 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. No count. So total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are same. Suppose x1=x2, y1=y2. Then, for all roads, val1 and val2 are same. So count is zero. So output is zero.\n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by one road. Then output is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct. So this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. The home and university blocks are separated by some of these roads. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the number of roads that separate these two points. This is because each road that separates the home and university must be crossed exactly once, and each crossing corresponds to a step.\n\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the coordinates of the home and university positions, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Sign Calculation**: For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university positions. This value determines which side of the road the point lies on.\n3. **Check Separation**: If the signs of these values for the home and university positions differ, the road separates them. Count such roads.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Linear Equation Evaluation**: For each road defined by the equation $a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0$, evaluate the expressions at the home and university coordinates. These evaluations give values that indicate which side of the road each point lies on.\n3. **Sign Check**: If the product of the evaluated values for the home and university positions is negative, it means the points lie on opposite sides of the road, indicating that this road separates them. The count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their evaluations, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
