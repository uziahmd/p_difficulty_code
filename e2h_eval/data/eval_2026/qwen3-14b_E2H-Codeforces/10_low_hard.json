Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to feed a golorp based on its name, which seems to be a string that encodes some kind of constraints. The output should be the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies those constraints, or 'false' if it's impossible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the golorp's name translates into constraints. Looking at the examples given:\n\nFor instance, the first input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' and the output is '0010'. Let me think about what the name represents. Maybe the name is structured like a Befunge program? Because the note mentions that some scientists think it's Befunge. Befunge is a 2D esoteric programming language where the instruction pointer moves in directions (like up, down, left, right), and the code is a grid.\n\nBut how does that relate to the problem? Well, perhaps the golorp's name is a Befunge-like program, and the variables are the values that the program would process. The problem says that the variables consumed by the golorps can take values from 0 to 9. The diet is determined by the name, which is a program. The jaws determine the number of variables needed. The goal is to find the lex smallest sequence of digits that allows the program to run without errors, possibly with some constraints based on the program's structure.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each golorp's daily diet is defined by its name. So the name is a program, and the variables are the inputs that must be fed through the jaws. The variables get to the stomach via the jaws, so the number of variables is determined by the jaws' shape. But how do I parse the name into these constraints?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is a Befunge program that needs to be executed, and the variables are the inputs that the program uses. But the problem says that the golorp is trying to eat as little as possible, so the sequence of variables is the minimal possible. However, the output is the lex smallest valid sequence.\n\nBut how do I model this? Let's look at the sample input and output again. For example, the first input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' and the output is '0010'.\n\nMaybe the name is structured with certain parts that define the program's behavior, and the variables are the digits that need to be input in a way that the program runs correctly. However, without knowing the exact rules of how the name translates into constraints, this is challenging.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample outputs, perhaps the problem is related to parsing the name into a series of equations or constraints that the digits must satisfy. For example, the first sample's output is four digits, which could correspond to the number of variables required by the jaws. The name might contain operators and operands that form equations which the variables must satisfy.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the name is a string that represents a Befunge program, and the variables are the input values that the program would read. The program's execution would require that certain conditions are met, such as the stack operations, etc. However, since Befunge is a complex language, this seems difficult without more information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the name is structured as a series of patterns that indicate the number of variables and their relationships. For example, the '?' might represent a variable, and the rest of the string defines equations between them. But how?\n\nLooking at the sample input for the first case: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nBreaking it down, perhaps the part before the colon is the definition of variables and operations, and after the colon is the direction of movement or other constraints. For example, the first part could be something like a mathematical equation involving variables, and the second part might indicate the order in which they are processed.\n\nAlternatively, considering the sample output '0010', which is four digits. The first sample input has a structure that may involve four variables. Let me think about the example. The output is the lex smallest sequence. So perhaps each '?' in the name represents a variable that needs to be assigned a digit, and the rest of the string contains constraints that the variables must satisfy.\n\nFor example, the first sample input starts with '?(', which might mean that the first variable is a digit. Then inside the parentheses, there's '-_', which could be an operation. But this is very vague.\n\nAnother idea: the problem may be related to the Befunge-93 interpreter. In Befunge, the program is a grid of characters, and the instruction pointer moves around. The program can push numbers onto the stack, perform operations, etc. However, the input to the program would be the variables that the golorp consumes. The problem states that the variables are fed into the jaws, which might correspond to",
