Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum radius d that the lanterns need to have so that the entire street of length l is illuminated. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. Each lantern at position ai can light up points within distance d. So, the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on [0, l] is within d of at least one lantern.\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Well, the key idea is probably to look for the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would require the largest d.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would be a candidate. Similarly for the end of the street. Because if the first lantern is at position a1, then the area from 0 to a1 - d must be covered. Wait, no. Wait, the lantern's coverage is from ai -d to ai +d. But since the street is from 0 to l, we have to make sure that all points in [0, l] are covered.\n\nSo, for example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the leftmost part of the street (from 0 to a1) must be covered. The maximum distance here would be a1 - 0, but since the lantern can cover up to d, then the leftmost point (0) needs to be within d of some lantern. So if the first lantern is at a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 must be <= d. Similarly for the end.\n\nWait, no. Because if the lantern is at a1, then the leftmost point that it can cover is max(0, a1 -d). For the entire street to be covered, the leftmost point (0) must be covered by some lantern. So the first lantern's coverage must reach at least 0. Which implies that a1 -d <=0. So d >= a1. Or, if there's a lantern before that, but maybe not. So the first lantern's coverage must start at 0, or earlier. Wait, no. For example, if the first lantern is at position x, then the leftmost point it can cover is x -d. To cover 0, x -d <=0. So d >= x. But if there's another lantern to the left of x, then that would take care of it. But if there's no lantern to the left, then the first lantern must cover 0. So the first lantern's position is a1, then d must be at least a1. But that's only if there's no other lantern before it. So, the first step is to sort the lantern positions, right?\n\nYes. Because if the lanterns are not sorted, then the gaps between them could be calculated in order. So the plan is:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Check the distance between the first lantern and 0. That's the first candidate for d.\n- Then check the distances between consecutive lanterns. For each pair, the maximum gap between them divided by 2 is the required d for that gap. Because the middle of the gap would need to be covered. For example, if two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b), then the maximum distance between them is (b -a). The midpoint is at (a + b)/2. The distance from each lantern to the midpoint is (b -a)/2. So d needs to be at least that value. So for each consecutive pair, compute (current - previous)/2, and take the maximum of these values.\n- Then check the distance between the last lantern and l. That's another candidate for d.\n- The answer is the maximum of all these candidates.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me think about the example given.\n\nTake the second sample input: n=2, l=5, positions are 2 and 5. After sorting, they are [2,5]. \n\nFirst, check the distance from 0 to first lantern: 2 - 0 = 2. So candidate is 2. Then between the two lanterns, the gap is 5-2=3. Half of that is 1.5. Then check the last lantern to l: 5 -5 =0. So the maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input is 7 15 with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,1",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ that lanterns must have to ensure the entire street of length $ l $ is illuminated. The key insight is to consider the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the radius $ d $.\n3. **Check Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The required radius for each gap is half the gap size because the midpoint of the gap would be the farthest point from either lantern in that gap.\n4. **Determine Maximum Distance**: The minimum radius $ d $ needed is the maximum value among the distances calculated from the endpoints and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        l = int(input[idx + 1])\n        idx += 2\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n        idx += n\n        \n        a.sort()\n        max_d = 0.0\n        \n        # Check the first lantern's distance from 0\n        max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n        \n        # Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i - 1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        \n        # Check the last lantern's distance from l\n        max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n        \n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in sequentially checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns efficiently.\n- **Endpoint Checks**: The first lantern's position relative to the start of the street (0) and the last lantern's position relative to the end of the street (l) are critical as they determine the coverage from the ends.\n- **Gap Analysis**: By considering the midpoint of each gap between consecutive lanterns, we ensure that the farthest point within each gap is covered, which determines the required radius for that segment.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum radius $ d $ with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, $ O(n \\log n) $, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
