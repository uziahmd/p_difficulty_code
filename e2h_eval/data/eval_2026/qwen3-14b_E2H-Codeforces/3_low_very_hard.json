Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for lanterns so that the entire street is lit. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nSo the problem says that each lantern can light up points within a distance d from it. The street is from 0 to l. The goal is to find the minimal d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input gives n lantern positions, which might not be sorted. So maybe the first step is to sort them. Because if the lanterns are sorted, it's easier to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\nWait, right. The key idea here is that the maximum distance between two consecutive lanterns divided by two will be the required d. But wait, not exactly. Because if two lanterns are placed at positions a and b (a < b), then the middle point between them is (a + b)/2. The distance from each lantern to this midpoint is (b - a)/2. So the maximum of these values across all consecutive pairs would be the minimal d needed. But also, we have to consider the ends of the street.\n\nFor example, if the first lantern is not at position 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is something. Similarly for the end of the street. So the minimal d must be the maximum between the first gap (from 0 to first lantern), the gaps between consecutive lanterns, and the last gap (from last lantern to l).\n\nWait, but how do these gaps translate into required d?\n\nLet me think. For the first part, the first lantern's position is a_0. The area from 0 to a_0 - d must be covered. Wait, no. The lantern's coverage is from a_i -d to a_i +d. But for the start of the street (0), if the first lantern is at a_0, then the leftmost point that can be covered by this lantern is max(0, a_0 -d). To cover the entire street, the leftmost part (0) must be covered. So the first lantern's coverage must reach 0. Which means that a_0 -d <= 0. So d >= a_0. Or wait, if the first lantern is at a_0, then the distance from 0 to a_0 is a_0. So the lantern's coverage needs to reach 0, which requires that d is at least a_0. Because the lantern's coverage extends from a_0 -d to a_0 +d. So for 0 to be covered, a_0 -d <= 0 <= a_0 +d. Since a_0 is positive (assuming the first lantern is not at 0), the left side is a_0 -d <=0 → d >= a_0. Similarly, for the end of the street, the last lantern's position is a_{n-1}, and the coverage must reach l. So l must be <= a_{n-1} +d → d >= l - a_{n-1}.\n\nBut then between two consecutive lanterns, say a and b (sorted), the maximum distance between them is (b - a). The middle point is (a +b)/2. The distance from a to that point is (b -a)/2. So for the coverage to reach that point, d must be at least (b -a)/2. Because the first lantern covers up to a +d, and the next starts at b -d. So the gap between them is (b -a) - 2d. To ensure that this is <=0, so that the two coverage areas overlap. So the maximum of (b -a)/2 for consecutive lanterns is part of the required d.\n\nSo putting it all together, the minimal d is the maximum of:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if it's not 0)\n- the last lantern's distance to l (if it's not l)\n- the maximum (a[i+1] - a[i])/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nBut wait, what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the first part is zero. Similarly for the last lantern.\n\nSo the steps to compute d would be:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the first position. If it's greater than 0, then the initial distance is a[0], else 0.\n3. Check the last position. If it's less than l, then the final distance is l - a[-1], else 0.\n4. For all consecutive pairs in the sorted array, compute (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. Take the maximum of these.\n5. The overall d is the maximum between the initial, final, and the max of consecutive gaps.\n\nYes",
