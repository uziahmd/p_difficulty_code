Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) are compatible if they are the same. A question mark (which represents an indefinite color) is compatible with any color, including another question mark.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the two strings l and r. Each character in l represents a left boot's color, and each in r represents a right boot's color. The problem requires pairing them optimally.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. One idea is to first pair the specific colors where they match. Then handle the question marks. But how?\n\nWait, but question marks can be used as wildcards. So perhaps we should:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots that have specific colors matching. For example, if l[i] is 'a' and r[j] is 'a', pair them. But how to do this optimally? Because there might be multiple possibilities here, and we need to choose which ones to pair to maximize the total.\n\nBut maybe it's better to first pair as many as possible specific colors. For instance, for each color c (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have c and how many right boots have c. The minimum of these counts would be the number of pairs we can make for that color. However, once those are paired, the remaining left and right boots with that color can't be paired with others of the same color unless they are paired with question marks.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not the optimal way. For example, if we have a lot of question marks, maybe it's better to use them to pair with other specific colors. But how to balance that.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n- First, pair all left boots with specific colors with right boots with the same specific color. This way, we can get the maximum possible matches for these specific colors. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which could be either specific or question marks), pair them using the question marks.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's think step by step.\n\nLet me consider the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Pair specific colors. For each color c (not '?'), find the number of left boots with c (let's call it L[c]) and the number of right boots with c (R[c]). The number of pairs for this color is min(L[c], R[c]). However, since we can't pair the same boot more than once, we need to track which ones are used.\n\nBut how to track which left and right boots are used. Maybe we can create for each color c, a list of indices of left boots with that color, and similarly for right boots. Then, for each color c, pair as many as possible from left and right lists. For example, take the first min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) pairs.\n\nOnce these are paired, we can mark those boots as used, so they can't be used again.\n\nBut then, after this step, we have some left boots (with specific colors) that couldn't be paired because there were no matching right boots, and vice versa. Also, there are question marks in both left and right.\n\nStep 2: Now, handle the question marks. The remaining left boots (including those with specific colors that couldn't be matched) and the remaining right boots (same) can be paired with question marks. But how to do this optimally?\n\nFor example, suppose there are some left boots with specific colors that are not yet paired. These can be paired with right boots that are '?' or with left boots that are '?'. But the question marks can be used as wildcards. So, perhaps we can pair the remaining specific left boots with right question marks, and the remaining specific right boots with left question marks, and then pair the remaining question marks between left and right.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nLet me think. After step 1, we have:\n\n- Left boots that are not yet paired: some with specific colors, some with '?'.\n- Right boots that are not yet paired: same.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair as many as possible between left and right boots where at least one is a '?'.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of such pairs.\n\nAn approach could be:\n\n- For each left boot that is not yet paired, if it's a specific color, try to pair it with a right boot that is a '?' (and hasn't been used yet). Similarly, for each right boot that is not yet paired and is a specific color, pair it with a left boot that is '?'.\n\nBut how to efficiently do this.\n\nAnother approach is to collect all the remaining left boots and right boots, and then pair them as follows:\n\n-",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility rules are such that specific colors must match exactly, while question marks ('?') can match any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), pair as many left boots with the same specific color as right boots. This ensures that we use up the most straightforward compatible pairs first.\n2. **Handle Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, use the remaining question marks to pair with any unpaired boots (either specific or question marks). This involves:\n   - Pairing unpaired left boots with specific colors with right boots that are question marks.\n   - Pairing unpaired right boots with specific colors with left boots that are question marks.\n   - Pairing remaining question marks between left and right boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # For each color, keep track of left and right indices\n    left_color_map = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_map = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n    \n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n    \n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors\n    for c in left_color_map:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        if c not in right_color_map:\n            continue\n        left_list = left_color_map[c]\n        right_list = right_color_map[c]\n        count = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(count):\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n            pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n    \n    # Step 2: Pair left specific with right '?'\n    # Collect all left specific not used\n    left_specific = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?':\n            left_specific.append(i)\n    \n    # Collect all right '?' not used\n    right_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?':\n            right_q.append(i)\n    \n    # Pair left specific with right q\n    for left_idx in left_specific:\n        if right_q:\n            right_idx = right_q.pop(0)\n            pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n    \n    # Step 3: Pair right specific with left '?'\n    right_specific = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?':\n            right_specific.append(i)\n    \n    left_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i)\n    \n    for right_idx in right_specific:\n        if left_q:\n            left_idx = left_q.pop(0)\n            pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n    \n    # Step 4: Pair remaining '?' between left and right\n    remaining_left_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n            remaining_left_q.append(i)\n    \n    remaining_right_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?':\n            remaining_right_q.append(i)\n    \n    # Pair them in order\n    min_len = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n        right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n        pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n    \n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(f\"{p[0]} {p[1]}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Mapping Colors**: We create mappings from each color to the list of indices where they appear in both left and right boots.\n3. **Pairing Specific Colors**: We first pair left and right boots with the same specific color.\n4. **Handling Question Marks**: After handling specific colors, we use question marks to pair with remaining specific colors and then pair the remaining question marks between left and right boots.\n5. **Output**: The maximum number of pairs and their indices are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs by leveraging both specific color matches and the flexibility of question marks.",
