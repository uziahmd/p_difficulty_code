Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, we have n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which is a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question marks can match any color. We need to pair left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. Each boot can be in at most one pair. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs and output them.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this? Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, the main idea is to pair as many as possible. Let's think about how to maximize the pairs.\n\nLet me think of two types of matches:\n\n1. Specific matches where both are letters and same.\n2. Using question marks to match with others.\n\nBut how to manage the pairings optimally?\n\nMaybe we can first pair the specific colors first, then use the question marks to fill in the remaining.\n\nWait, but there's a possibility that some question marks can be used to match with other question marks, or with specific ones.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to:\n\n- For each color (excluding '?'), count how many left boots and right boots have that color. Then, for each color c, the number of pairs possible is the minimum of left[c] and right[c]. Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots with '?' can be matched among themselves, but since each '?' can be matched with any, the number is the minimum of the remaining left '?' and right '?'.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not the case. Because maybe some of the '?' can be used to match with specific colors. For example, if there's a left '?' and a right 'a', then pairing them is better than pairing two '?'s. But if there's more of one than the other, maybe we need to find the best way.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs is the sum over all colors (non-?) of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) plus the min(remaining_left_q, remaining_right_q). But wait, maybe not. Because maybe after pairing specific colors, the remaining question marks can be paired with each other, but also with the leftover specific colors.\n\nWait, no. Suppose after pairing specific colors, there are some left and right boots with specific colors that are not matched. For example, suppose there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's. So we pair 2 of them. Then, there's 1 left 'a' left. But if there are some right boots with '?', maybe we can pair that left 'a' with a right '?'. But if we had instead used the '?' to pair with the 'a's first, maybe we could get more pairs.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach is not optimal. Therefore, the problem is more complex.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. How to model this problem optimally.\n\nWe need to find a way to pair left and right boots such that each pair is compatible, and the total is maximized.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of matching between left and right boots. Each left boot can be matched with a right boot if either:\n\n- Both are same (non-?).\n- One is ? and the other is anything.\n- Both are ?.\n\nSo the problem is similar to bipartite graph matching, but with large n (up to 150,000). So standard algorithms like maximum bipartite matching would be too slow.\n\nTherefore, we need a greedy approach that can compute the maximum pairs efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFirst, pair all the left and right boots that have the same specific color. For example, for each color c (not ?), pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either ? or have colors that couldn't be matched because there were not enough on the other side), pair the ?s with the remaining specific colors and with each other.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\n1. For each color c (excluding ?), collect all left boots of color c and all right boots of color c. Pair as many as possible between them. For example, for each c, take min(left_c_count, right_c_count) pairs. Mark those boots as used.\n\n2. After that, collect all left boots that are not yet paired and are either ? or have a color that couldn't be matched. Similarly for the right boots.\n\n3. Now, for the remaining left and right boots, which include ? and possibly some specific colors that couldn't be matched, we can pair the ?s with any available boots. But how?\n\nWait, but the remaining left boots may have specific colors that have no corresponding right boots. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and only 2 right 'a's. After pairing those 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors. Each boot can either be a specific color or an indefinite color represented by a question mark ('?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that their colors are compatible, with each boot being used in at most one pair.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Specific Colors**: First, count the occurrences of each specific color (excluding '?') in both left and right boots.\n2. **Pair Specific Colors**: For each specific color, pair the left and right boots that have the same color. This is done by taking the minimum count of each color from left and right boots.\n3. **Track Used Boots**: Keep track of which boots have been paired to avoid reusing them.\n4. **Handle Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, use the remaining question marks to pair with any available boots (either specific colors or other question marks). This is done by iterating through the remaining boots and forming pairs where possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    left_pairs = []\n    right_pairs = []\n    \n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors first\n    # Create a dictionary to count the number of each color in left and right\n    left_color_count = defaultdict(int)\n    right_color_count = defaultdict(int)\n    left_indices = {}\n    right_indices = {}\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_color_count[l[i]] += 1\n            left_indices[l[i]] = left_indices.get(l[i], []) + [i]\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            right_color_count[r[i]] += 1\n            right_indices[r[i]] = right_indices.get(r[i], []) + [i]\n    \n    # Now, for each color, pair min(left, right)\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n    \n    for c in left_color_count:\n        if c in right_color_count:\n            cnt = min(left_color_count[c], right_color_count[c])\n            left_list = left_indices[c][:cnt]\n            right_list = right_indices[c][:cnt]\n            for i in range(cnt):\n                pairs.append((left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1))\n                used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n                used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n    \n    # Now collect remaining left and right boots that are not used\n    # These include ? and those that couldn't be matched with their specific color\n    remaining_left = []\n    remaining_right = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            remaining_left.append(i)\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            remaining_right.append(i)\n    \n    # Now pair the ?s with remaining\n    # We can create a list of left ? indices and right ? indices\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n    for i in remaining_left:\n        if l[i] == '?':\n            left_q.append(i)\n    for i in remaining_right:\n        if r[i] == '?':\n            right_q.append(i)\n    \n    # Pair the left_q with right_q\n    min_q = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(min_q):\n        pairs.append((left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1))\n        used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n        used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n    \n    # Now, for the remaining left boots (non-?) and right boots (non-?)\n    # Try to pair them with ?s\n    # First, process left non-? remaining\n    for i in remaining_left:\n        if used_left[i]:\n            continue\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            # Find a right ? that is not used\n            for j in remaining_right:\n                if not used_right[j] and r[j] == '?':\n                    pairs.append((i+1, j+1))\n                    used_left[i] = True\n                    used_right[j] = True\n                    break\n    \n    # Then process right non-? remaining\n    for j in remaining_right:\n        if used_right[j]:\n            continue\n        if r[j] != '?':\n            # Find a left ? that is not used\n            for i in remaining_left:\n                if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n                    pairs.append((i+1, j+1))\n                    used_left[i] = True\n                    used_right[j] = True\n                    break\n    \n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Counting Colors**: We count the occurrences of each specific color in both left and right boots, excluding question marks.\n3. **Pairing Specific Colors**: For each specific color found in both left and right boots, we pair them up to the maximum possible extent.\n4. **Handling Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots with question marks by pairing them with each other and then with any remaining specific color boots that haven't been paired yet.\n5. **Output**: The maximum number of pairs and their indices are printed as required.",
