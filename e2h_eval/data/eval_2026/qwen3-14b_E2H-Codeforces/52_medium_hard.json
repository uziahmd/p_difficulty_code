Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones into new candles. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every 'b' used candles, he can make one new candle. And this new candle can be used again, which in turn will become another used candle after burning.\n\nThe question is to find the total hours possible. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2: \n\nFirst, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 used candles can be converted into 4//2 = 2 new candles. He uses those two, adding 2 hours. Now, those two are used, so he has 2 used candles. Convert them into 2//2=1 new. Use that, adding 1 hour. Now, that one is used. But 1 is less than 2, so no more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 used candles. 6/3=2 new. Use them, 2 hours. Now 2 used. Can't make any more. Wait, but the sample output is 8. Wait, 6 + 2 is 8. Oh right. So that's the case.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours, and the number of used candles. Then, whenever you have enough used candles, you can make new ones, which adds to the total hours, and also adds to the used pile again.\n\nSo here's the idea:\n\nInitialize total_hours = a (since each initial candle gives one hour). Then, the number of used candles is a. Then, while the number of used candles is >= b, we can make new candles. \n\nWait, but each time you make a new candle, you subtract b used candles and add 1 new candle. But that new candle will burn for an hour, so the total hours increases by 1. But then, after burning, that becomes another used candle.\n\nSo maybe the process is:\n\nStart with total_hours = a, used = a.\n\nThen, while used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    used = (used % b) + new_candles \n\nRepeat until used < b.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each time you take the used candles, convert as many as possible into new ones. The new ones add to the total hours, and then after burning, they become part of the used pile again.\n\nLet me test this logic with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 4, used=4.\n\nLoop:\n\nused >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 = 2. total_hours becomes 4+2=6. \n\nused = 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nAgain, used >=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7. used is 0 + 1 = 1. Now, 1 < 2. So loop ends. Total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 6, used=6.\n\nLoop:\n\n6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. used is 6%3=0 + 2 = 2. Now 2 <3. So done. Total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial hours 5, used=5. Then 5//5=1. total becomes 6. used is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see.\n\nInitial total=5, used=5.\n\nFirst iteration: 5//2=2. total is 5+2=7. used is 5%2=1 + 2=3.\n\nNext iteration: 3//2=1. total is 7+1=8. used is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nNext iteration: 2//2=1. total is 8+1=9. used is 0 +1=1. Now stop. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually:\n\nOriginal 5 candles: 5 hours. Then 5 used. Make 2 new (using 4 used), 1 left. So 2 hours. Now, used is 1 + 2 = 3 (after burning the 2 new ones). Then make 1 new (using 2 of the 3 used). Add 1 hour. Now used is 1 +1=2. Make another new. Add 1 hour. Now used is 0 +1=1. So total is 5 + 2 +1 +1 = 9. Yes. So the logic works.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Initialize total = a, used = a.\n\n- While used >= b:\n\n   new_candles = used // b\n\n   total += new_candles\n\n   used = (used % b) + new_candles \n\n- Return total.\n\nSo the code needs to read a and b from input, then compute this.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead a and b. For example, the input is two integers on a line. So in Python, we can read the input line, split into two parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen, compute as per the steps.\n\nLet me code this.\n\nSample code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = used % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, that's it. Let me test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 4 2.\n\ntotal starts as 4, used 4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew = 4//2=2. total is 6. used is 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nLoop again: new=2//2=1. total is 7. used is 0 +1=1. Now exit. Output 7. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 6 3. total starts at 6, used 6. new=6//3=2. total is 8. used is 0 + 2=2. Now 2 <3. Exit. Output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2. Output is 9. Correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where a=1, b=2. Then total is 1. Because used is 1, which is less than 2.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Then initial total is 2. used is 2. new is 1. total becomes 3. used is 0 +1=1. So total is 3.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. Initial total is 3. used is 3. new is 1. total is 4. used is 0 +1=1. So total is 4.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3. Let's compute:\n\nInitial total=10, used=10.\n\nLoop:\n\nused >=3. 10//3=3, total becomes 13. used is 10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nAgain, 4//3=1. total is 14. used is 4%3=1 +1=2. Now stop. So total is 14.\n\nLet me check manually:\n\nOriginal 10 candles: 10 hours. Then 10 used. Make 3 new (using 9), 1 left. So 3 hours. Now used is 1 +3 =4. Make 1 new (using 3), 1 left. So 1 hour. Now used is 1 +1=2. No more. Total 10+3+1=14. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, the problem says that the input is a single line with two integers. So the code should read that line, split into a and b, and process.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b. Then perform the steps.\n\nSo the code is:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = used % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFor input 4 2, output is 7. For 6 3, output is 8. Which matches.\n\nI think this should work.\n",
