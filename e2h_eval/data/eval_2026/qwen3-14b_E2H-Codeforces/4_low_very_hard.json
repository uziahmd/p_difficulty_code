The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, we can't simulate each round directly. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Nikephoros uses sequence A, which repeats cyclically. Similarly for Polycarpus with B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find what move each makes, then determine who wins, and count the losses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, compute the number of wins in each cycle, and then multiply by the number of cycles, plus the remainder.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Determine for each round, which move each player makes. Since their sequences are cyclic, for round i (assuming zero-based?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus's move, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nBut since the number of rounds is n, which can be huge, we need to find the total number of times each player loses over all rounds.\n\nThe key idea here is that the sequence of moves for both players is periodic. The combined sequence of their moves (A and B) will have a period equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = T. So every T rounds, the same pattern of moves repeats. Therefore, if we can compute the number of losses for each player in one full period of T rounds, we can multiply that by the number of full periods in n rounds, and then add the result from the remaining rounds (n mod T).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it T.\n- For each of the T rounds, compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and count the losses for each player. Let's call these counts per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n- Then, the total number of full cycles is full_cycles = n // T.\n- The remaining rounds are rem = n % T.\n- So total_nik = full_cycles * per_cycle_nik + count_losses_in_rem_rounds(nik_moves, poly_moves, rem)\n- Same for total_poly.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute the per_cycle counts?\n\nFor each of the T rounds (from 0 to T-1), compute the moves for A and B. Then check who wins. For each such round, increment the counts accordingly.\n\nBut T could be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1,000,000. Because m and k are up to 1000. So LCM(1000, 1000) is 1000. Wait, no. For example, if m=1000 and k=1000, then LCM is 1000 if they are same. But if m and k are coprime, then LCM is m*k, which would be 1e6. So T can be up to 1e6. For each of these T rounds, we can precompute the moves and the outcome.\n\nSo for each of the T rounds, we can compute the moves and check the outcome. Then multiply by the number of full cycles, and then handle the remainder.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, even with T up to 1e6, this would be manageable. Because 1e6 is manageable for precomputing.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute m and k as the lengths of A and B.\n\n2. Compute T = LCM(m, k). How to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, that's okay.\n\n3. For each i in 0..T-1:\n\n   a. Find the move of A: A[i % m]\n\n   b. Find the move of B: B[i % k]\n\n   c. Determine who wins, and increment counts for each player.\n\nBut how to determine the winner?\n\nThe rules are:\n\nRock (R) beats Scissors (S)\n\nScissors (S) beats Paper (P)\n\nPaper (P) beats Rock (R)\n\nIf same, it's a draw.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) on both players after playing a large number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use an efficient approach based on periodicity and least common multiples (LCM).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use sequences that repeat cyclically. The key insight is that the combined sequence of moves from both players repeats every LCM of the lengths of their respective sequences.\n2. **Periodic Pattern**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period, determine the moves of both players and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Scale Up**: Multiply the losses per period by the number of full periods in the total number of rounds and add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\ndef count_rounds(n, A, B):\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    T = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full cycle (T rounds)\n    nik_loss_cycle = 0\n    poly_loss_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine the winner\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            poly_loss_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nik_loss_cycle += 1\n    \n    # Total number of full cycles\n    full_cycles = n // T\n    rem = n % T\n    \n    # Compute total losses from full cycles\n    total_nik = full_cycles * nik_loss_cycle\n    total_poly = full_cycles * poly_loss_cycle\n    \n    # Compute losses from remaining rounds\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    return total_nik, total_poly\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    nik, poly = count_rounds(n, A, B)\n    print(f\"{nik} {poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is calculated to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within one period, the moves of both players are determined, and the number of losses for each player is counted.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles and remaining rounds are computed. The losses from full cycles are scaled up, and the remaining rounds are simulated individually to get the final counts of losses.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring the solution is both optimal and scalable.",
