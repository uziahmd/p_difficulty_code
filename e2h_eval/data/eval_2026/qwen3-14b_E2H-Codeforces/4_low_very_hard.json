The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round, they use their own sequences cyclically. The challenge is to compute how many times each loses in those n rounds.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. We have n, then two strings A and B representing their sequences. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find out what each player plays. Then determine who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round one by one. So we need an efficient approach here.\n\nLet me think. Since the sequences are cyclic, the moves repeat every m and k steps respectively. So for each round i, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nThe problem is to compute for all i from 0 to n-1, how many times Nikephoros loses (so that adds to his red spots) and how many times Polycarpus loses (adds to his).\n\nSo the straightforward approach would be to simulate each round, but with n up to 2e9, that's impossible. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be computed once and then multiplied.\n\nLet me think about the total number of rounds. The key idea here is that the combination of the two sequences repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So for example, if m=3 and k=4, LCM is 12. So the pattern of moves for both players repeats every 12 rounds.\n\nSo, if we can compute the number of losses in one LCM cycle, then we can calculate how many full cycles there are in n rounds, multiply by the counts per cycle, and then add the remaining rounds (the remainder when n is divided by the LCM).\n\nBut what's the LCM of m and k? Let's compute that. Also, since m and k can be up to 1000, their LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000=1e6). So for each possible LCM cycle length (up to 1e6), we can precompute the number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus in that cycle.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k, call it period.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to period-1, compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and count the number of times Nikephoros loses (countA) and Polycarpus loses (countB) in this period.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period. The remaining rounds are rem = n % period.\n\n4. So totalA = total_periods * countA + countA_in_rem, same for totalB.\n\nBut then, how do I compute countA_in_rem and countB_in_rem? For that, I need to compute the number of losses in the first 'rem' rounds of the period.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Precompute for each possible position in the period (from 0 to period-1) what the outcome is. Then, for the full periods, multiply by the counts. For the remaining rounds, iterate through the first rem rounds and add the counts.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9 and period up to 1e6, this approach is feasible. Because even if period is 1e6, the precomputing step is O(1e6), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the LCM of m and k. To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So first compute GCD of m and k.\n\nNow, how to compute GCD? Well, Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, which they are here, so that's okay.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, then proceed as follows.\n\nBut wait, what if the period is larger than n? For example, if n is smaller than the LCM. Then, the total_periods is zero, and rem is n. So the code still works.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n\nCompute for each of the period rounds, the outcome. Then, for the total number of full periods, multiply by the counts in one period, and then add the counts for the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the question",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use an efficient approach leveraging the periodic nature of their strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use sequences that repeat cyclically. The key insight is that the combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period after which the sequence of moves repeats.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period, determine the winner and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Periods and Remainder**: Calculate how many full periods fit into the total number of rounds (n) and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    period = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    \n    # Precompute the results for one period\n    countA = 0  # number of times Nikephoros loses\n    countB = 0  # number of times Polycarpus loses\n    \n    for i in range(period):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            countB += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            countA += 1\n    \n    # Now calculate total periods and remainder\n    total_periods = n // period\n    rem = n % period\n    \n    # Calculate the total counts from full periods\n    total_a = total_periods * countA\n    total_b = total_periods * countB\n    \n    # Calculate the counts from the remaining rounds\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is computed to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within the period, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome is checked to update the loss counts for each player.\n4. **Handling Full Periods and Remainder**: The total number of full periods is calculated, and the remaining rounds are processed separately to account for any incomplete period at the end of the game.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large constraints by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring that the solution is computed in linear time relative to the period length, which is feasible given the problem constraints.",
