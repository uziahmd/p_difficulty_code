Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D. Let me think about the approach here.\n\nThe problem says that the triangle sides must satisfy A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order x ≤ y ≤ z, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.\n\nSo the main idea is to iterate through all possible x, y, z values that fit the constraints and check if x + y > z. However, given the constraints on A, B, C, D (up to 5e5), a brute force approach would be way too slow. So I need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet me break down the constraints:\n\nx ranges from A to B.\ny ranges from B to C (since x ≤ B and y ≥ B).\nz ranges from C to D (since y ≤ C and z ≥ C).\n\nBut also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, and y ≤ C ≤ z, then x ≤ y ≤ z. So for each x, y, z, we have x ≤ y ≤ z. Therefore, the triangle condition is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], z ∈ [C, D], and x + y > z.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about fixing x and y first, then finding the number of z's that are ≤ D and ≥ C, and also less than x + y. Because for a fixed x and y, the valid z's are those between C and min(D, x + y - 1). Because z has to be at least C, but also less than x + y.\n\nWait, but z must be ≥ C, and also satisfy z < x + y. So the valid range for z is [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. But if x + y -1 < C, then there are no valid z's for this x and y. Otherwise, the count is (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1).\n\nSo for each x and y, compute the number of z's as follows:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)\n\nBut then, how do I compute this over all x and y?\n\nBut considering that x can be up to 5e5 and y up to 5e5, iterating over all x and y would be O(B * (C - B + 1)), which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow for Python. So this approach isn't feasible.\n\nI need a smarter way. Let's think about the constraints again.\n\nSince x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let's note that for each x and y, the value of x + y varies. For a given x, y can be from B to C. Let's see if we can find for each x, the number of y's such that when combined with x, the z's contribute a certain amount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find for each possible x and y, the contribution to the total count. But again, the problem is the sheer number of possibilities.\n\nAnother angle: since z is between C and D, and for a valid triangle, z must be < x + y. So for each x and y, the maximum z allowed is min(D, x + y -1). But since z must be ≥ C, the lower bound is C. So the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C, else zero.\n\nBut how to compute the sum over all x and y of this value?\n\nLet me rephrase this. The total number of triangles is the sum for all x in [A,B], y in [B,C], of (number of z in [C, D] where z < x + y).\n\nSo the problem becomes, for each x and y, compute how many z's are in [C, D] and less than x + y. Then sum all these counts.\n\nSo the key is to compute for each x and y, the number of z's that are in [C, D] and less than (x + y). Let me think about how to calculate this efficiently.\n\nLet me define for a given x",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key condition for a non-degenerate triangle is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Given the constraints, a brute-force approach would be too slow, so we use a more optimized method.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: For each valid triangle, the sides must satisfy $x + y > z$ where $x \\leq y \\leq z$. Given the ranges for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we can iterate through possible values of $x$ and $y$, and compute the valid range for $z$.\n2. **Efficient Counting**: For each pair $(x, y)$, the valid $z$ values must be in the range $[C, \\min(D, x + y - 1)]$. This range is derived from the triangle inequality $x + y > z$.\n3. **Summation**: Sum the count of valid $z$ values for all valid pairs $(x, y)$. This avoids iterating through all possible $z$ values directly, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    A = int(data[0])\n    B = int(data[1])\n    C = int(data[2])\n    D = int(data[3])\n    \n    total = 0\n    \n    # Precompute the range for y: from B to C\n    # For each x in [A, B], and y in [B, C]\n    # Compute the number of z in [C, min(D, x + y -
