The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to compute this modulo mod. The constraints are n up to 500, which is quite big. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. Let's see. The total number of permutation pairs where p is lex smaller than q is (total permutations choose 2), since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. But here, we have to consider only those pairs where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the inversion counts. For each permutation, we can compute its inversion count. Then, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, we check if inv(p) > inv(q). The sum over all such pairs is our answer.\n\nBut for n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is way too big to iterate through. So we need a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the possible inversion counts. Let's denote for a permutation p, inv(p) as the number of inversions. Let's say we have a function f(k) that gives the number of permutations with exactly k inversions. Then, for each pair (k1, k2) where k1 > k2, we need to count the number of pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, inv(p) = k1, inv(q) = k2.\n\nBut how do we find the number of such pairs? Because even if we know the counts of permutations with certain inversion counts, the lex order condition complicates things.\n\nWait, but maybe there's some symmetry here. For all pairs of permutations p and q where p != q, exactly half of them will have p < q lex. But that's only true if all permutations are considered, and considering that for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. So the total number of unordered pairs is (total_perms * (total_perms - 1)) / 2. But the problem requires ordered pairs where p < q lex. So the total number of such pairs is (total_perms * (total_perms - 1)) / 2.\n\nBut how does this relate to the inversion counts?\n\nThe key idea here is that for all pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, exactly half of them will have inv(p) > inv(q), and half will have inv(p) < inv(q), assuming that for each pair (p, q) with p < q, the inversion counts are not equal. However, this might not be the case. But perhaps there's some symmetry here.\n\nWait, but what if we consider all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p ≠ q. For each such pair, either p < q or q < p. Now, suppose we look at the inversion counts. Let's think of the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q). How many such pairs are there?\n\nLet me think: For all pairs (p, q) where p ≠ q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q), if the inversion counts are symmetric. However, when inv(p) = inv(q), they contribute nothing. So the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_count) / 2, where same_count is the number of pairs (p, q) where p≠q and inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nBut how does this relate to the problem's required count?\n\nThe problem wants the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q lex and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's denote this as the answer.\n\nNow, considering that for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, and p ≠ q, the total number is T = total_perms * (total_perms - 1)/2. Let's split these into three categories:\n\n- inv(p) > inv(q): A\n- inv(p) < inv(q): B\n- inv(p) = inv(q): C\n\nWe have A + B + C = T.\n\nBut from the earlier observation, the total number of pairs (p, q) with p≠q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_count) / 2, where total_pairs is total_perms * (total_perms - 1), and same_count is the number of pairs with inv(p) = inv(q) and p≠q.\n\nSo the total number of such pairs (including both p < q and q < p) is (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. The solution involves leveraging symmetry and combinatorial properties of permutations and their inversion counts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Inversions and Lexicographical Order**: \n   - A permutation's inversion count is the number of pairs (i, j) such that i < j and a[i] > a[j].\n   - For any two distinct permutations p and q, exactly one of the following holds: p is lexicographically smaller than q or q is lexicographically smaller than p.\n\n2. **Symmetry in Inversion Counts**:\n   - For all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p ≠ q, the number of pairs where the inversion count of p is greater than that of q is equal to the number of pairs where the inversion count of q is greater than that of p, adjusted for pairs with equal inversion counts.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation Using Dynamic Programming**:\n   - Use dynamic programming to compute the number of permutations of length n with exactly k inversions.\n   - Utilize these counts to determine the total number of valid pairs considering both inversion counts and lexicographical order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    mod = int(input[1])\n\n    # dp[i][j] = number of permutations of i elements with j inversions\n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    dp = np.zeros((n+1, max_inv+1), dtype=np.int64)\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(i*(i-1)//2 + 1):\n            for k in range(j+1):\n                if dp[i-1][k] > 0:\n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][k]\n                    if j - k >= 0:\n                        dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j - k]\n                    dp[i][j] %= mod\n        # Wait, no, the recurrence is different.
