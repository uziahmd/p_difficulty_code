Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of the current string S after each modification. The catch is that some Morse code strings are invalid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the Morse code mappings work. Each valid Morse code string is of length 1-4, made up of 0s and 1s, except for four specific ones. So for any substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of those four), it represents a letter. And we need to count all possible sequences of such letters that can be formed by splitting the string into substrings. \n\nWait, but the question says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So, for example, if S is \"111\", then possible substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", \"1\", \"11\", \"1\" (but considering all possible substrings). But each of these substrings that is a valid Morse code contributes to the count. However, the sequences are sequences of letters. For instance, if there are two substrings that are valid, like \"1\" and \"1\", then the sequence \"TT\" would be counted as well as \"T\", etc. \n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". Oh right! So each such sequence is a way to split the string into parts where each part is a valid Morse code. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings that are valid Morse codes are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", \"1\", \"11\", \"1\". But the sequences are the different ways to split the string into valid Morse codes. For example, the entire string can be split as one letter (\"111\"), or as two letters (like \"1\" + \"11\"), or three letters (\"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\"). Each of these splits contributes to the count. So the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible splits of the string into valid Morse code segments. \n\nWait, but how does that work? For example, the first sample input after three 1s is S = \"111\". The answer is 7. Let me check the note: the note says that the sequences are T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT. That's seven sequences. How are these generated?\n\nEach sequence corresponds to a way of breaking the string into parts where each part is a valid Morse code. For example, the string \"111\" can be split as:\n\n- One part: \"111\" → O (counted once)\n- Two parts: \"1\" + \"11\" → T followed by M (counted as a sequence)\n- Two parts: \"11\" + \"1\" → M followed by T (counted as another sequence)\n- Three parts: \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\" → TTT (counted as a sequence)\n- Also, there's \"1\" (split as just the first character) → T, \"11\" (split as the first two characters) → M, \"1\" (third character) → T. But wait, how do those contribute to the count? Because each of these substrings is a valid code. However, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Oh, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Maybe the question is not about splitting the entire string into valid codes, but rather, all possible sequences of letters where each letter is represented by a substring of S. \n\nWait, the wording is ambiguous. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: find the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. So each such sequence is a sequence of letters, each of which is represented by a substring of S. But the substrings could be overlapping? Or maybe each letter in the sequence is represented by a substring of S, and the substrings are not necessarily contiguous? Or perhaps the sequence is formed by taking some substrings of S, each of which is a valid Morse code, and the order of the letters in the sequence corresponds to the order of the substrings in S. \n\nWait, no. For example, the note says that for S being \"111\", the answer includes \"TT\" (which is two Ts, each represented by the first '1' and the second '1' in the string). But how is that possible? Because the substrings for each T would be \"1\" (the first character) and \"1\" (the second character",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code. The string `S` is built incrementally by appending either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1') at each step. Some Morse code strings are invalid and should not be counted.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: We maintain a set of invalid Morse code strings. Any substring of `S` that matches one of these invalid strings is ignored.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string `S`. This helps in efficiently updating the count as new characters are appended to `S`.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, we take modulo $10^9 + 7$ at each step to prevent overflow.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    ops = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    # Set of invalid Morse codes\n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    # dp[i] will store the number of valid sequences ending at position i (0-based)\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # dp[0] is dummy for 1-based indexing\n    total = 0  # total number of valid sequences so far\n    \n    s = []\n    for i in range(m):\n        c = ops[i]\n        s.append(c)\n        curr_len = len(s)\n        \n        # Check all possible substrings ending at current position\n        # For each possible length from 1 to 4, if it's within the current length\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if curr_len - l >= 0:\n                sub = ''.join(s[curr_len - l : curr_len])\n                if sub in invalid:\n                    continue\n                # The number of sequences ending here is 1 (the new single letter)\n                # plus the number of sequences before (dp[curr_len - l]) multiplied by 1 (adding the new letter)\n                # So we add dp[curr_len - l] + 1\n                # But wait, the total is the sum of all dp[j] where j is the start of the new sequence\n                # So for each valid substring, we add dp[start] + 1\n                start = curr_len - l\n                if start == 0:\n                    add = 1\n                else:\n                    add = dp[start] + 1\n                dp[curr_len] = (dp[curr_len] + add) % MOD\n        \n        # The total is the sum of all dp[i] for i from 1 to curr_len\n        # However, since we are building up, we can just accumulate the current dp[curr_len]\n        # Wait, no.

If a substring is valid, we update the `dp` array to include the number of sequences formed by appending this valid substring to previous valid sequences.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Each update to `dp` is taken modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers efficiently.\n5. **Result Calculation**: After processing each character, we subtract 1 from `dp[i]` to exclude the empty sequence and print the result for each step.",
