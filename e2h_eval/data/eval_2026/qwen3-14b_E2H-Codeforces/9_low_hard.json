Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So, the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the time complexity would be O(nm), which for 1e5 * 3e5 is way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm, since the weights are limited to 1, 2, 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. Let me think. For each weight type, I can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight category, I can precompute the prefix sums so that for any number of items taken from that category, I can quickly calculate the total cost.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weight (w=1, w=2, w=3).\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost. This way, taking the first k items gives the maximum possible cost for k items in that group.\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group. For example, for the weight 1 group, prefix_sum_1[i] is the sum of the first i items' costs.\n4. Then, iterate over possible numbers of items taken from each group, considering the total weight constraint.\n\nBut how do I combine these groups efficiently? Let's think about the possible combinations. Let's say I take x items of weight 1, y items of weight 2, z items of weight 3. The total weight is x*1 + y*2 + z*3 ≤ m. We need to maximize the sum of prefix_sum_1[x] + prefix_sum_2[y] + prefix_sum_3[z].\n\nBut trying all possible x, y, z is going to be O(n^3), which is impossible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the weight is small (up to 3), maybe for each possible number of weight 3 items, we can compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nWait, but even that might be tricky. Let's think. Let's say we fix the number of weight 3 items (z). Then the remaining weight is m - 3*z. Let's call this rem = m - 3*z. Now, for rem, we can combine weight 1 and 2 items. How to find the best x and y such that x + 2y ≤ rem. But how?\n\nFor the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can precompute for each possible total weight up to m, the maximum value. But even that might not be feasible if m is up to 3e5, but with some optimizations.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible z (number of weight 3 items), we can compute the maximum possible value from weight 1 and 2 items given the remaining capacity. How to compute that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have a certain amount of capacity left (let's call it cap). For cap, I need to choose x and y such that x + 2y ≤ cap. How can I find the maximum sum of prefix_1[x] + prefix_2[y]?\n\nThis seems like a classic unbounded knapsack problem but with two variables. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps there's a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), we can compute the maximum possible x as min( (cap - 2y), len(prefix_1) ). Then, the total is prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[ min( (cap - 2y), len_1 ) ].\n\nBut since the maximum possible y is up to len_2, and len_2 could be up to 1e5, for each z, this would be O(len_2) time. If we have O(len_3) possible z values, then the total time would be O(len_3 * len_2), which could be up to 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nHmm. Need a better way. Let's think again.\n\nLet me think about the combination of weight 1 and 2 items. Let's say that for a given cap, how to find the optimal x and y. Since the items are sorted by cost, for each y, the maximum x is (cap - 2y), but since we can take up to the available items.\n\nBut maybe for each possible cap, the optimal choice is to take as many of the highest value items as possible. Let me think",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are large, so we need an efficient approach leveraging the limited weight values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Items by Weight**: Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, and 3).\n2. **Sort and Precompute Prefix Sums**: For each group, sort the items by descending cost and compute prefix sums to quickly determine the maximum cost for any number of items taken from that group.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Combinations**: For each possible number of weight 3 items, calculate the remaining capacity and determine the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fits within this remaining capacity.
