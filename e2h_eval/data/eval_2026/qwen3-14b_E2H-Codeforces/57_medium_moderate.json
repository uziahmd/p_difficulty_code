His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in the Olympiad based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the results of two tours, but they are just lists of points without names. So, Vasya's actual scores are some a_i from the first tour and some b_j from the second tour, and their sum is at least x. But since the teacher doesn't know which a and b belong to Vasya, we have to consider all possibilities where there exists some pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. And then determine the best and worst possible positions he could have.\n\nThe key here is that for the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total points (so that he is as high as possible), and for the worst possible rank, we want to minimize his total points (so that he is as low as possible). However, even with that, we need to calculate how many people have higher totals than him, or how many could be placed above him depending on the jury's choice when there are ties.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, for the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, count how many other participants have a total that is strictly greater than this maximum possible value. The best rank would be that count plus one. However, if there are multiple people with the same total as Vasya's maximum, then the jury can arrange them in any order. So, if Vasya's total is the maximum, then he can be placed first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a case where even if someone else has the same total as Vasya's max, the jury could place him first. So for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's total is the maximum possible, and that he is placed first. So the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a pair (a_i + b_j) that is the maximum possible sum.\n\nBut how do I find the maximum possible sum? Well, the maximum possible sum is the maximum a_i plus the maximum b_j. Because if you take the maximum of a and maximum of b, their sum would be the largest possible. So that's the best scenario for Vasya.\n\nSo for the best rank, the best possible is 1. Wait, but maybe there are other participants who have a_i + b_j equal to that maximum. For example, if there are multiple participants with the same max sum. But in that case, the jury can place Vasya first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1, but only if there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) that gives the maximum possible sum. Which is guaranteed by the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So for the best rank, we can choose the maximum possible sum, which is the maximum a_i plus maximum b_j. Then, the best rank is determined by how many people have a sum strictly greater than this maximum. But since that maximum is the highest possible, no one can have a higher sum. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, that's correct. Because for the best case, Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. So no one can have a higher sum than him. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo the first part of the answer is 1. But wait, maybe not. Wait, suppose that there are other participants whose sum is equal to that maximum. Then, the jury can assign the rank as 1 to Vasya. So regardless of others, the best possible rank is 1. Because the jury can arrange the ties in any way.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. So the first number in the output is 1. But wait, in the first example input, the output is 1 5. So that's correct.\n\nSo for the best case, the answer is 1.\n\nNow, the worst possible rank. That's more complicated. For this, we need to find the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (but still at least x) and then find out how many people have a sum strictly greater than that, and then add 1. But since the jury can arrange the ties, if there are people with the same sum as Vasya, they can be placed after him. So the worst possible rank is the number of people with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1. But to get the worst possible rank, we need to choose the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (which is x, but maybe not, because the sum must be at least x).\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So for the worst case, we want to choose the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Because if we choose a higher sum, then there may be fewer people with higher sums than him. So to get the worst possible rank, we need to choose the minimal possible sum that is at least x. Because that way, more people can have higher sums than him.\n\nSo the steps for the worst case:\n\nFind the minimal possible sum s where s >=x, and s is the sum of some a_i and b_j. Then, count the number of participants whose sum (a_i + b_j) is strictly greater than s. Then, the worst possible rank is that count + 1. But how do we find this s?\n\nWait, but the minimal possible s is x. However, there may not be any pair (a_i, b_j) that adds up to exactly x. But the problem says that there is at least one pair that adds up to at least x. So for the worst case, we need to take the minimal possible s that is >=x. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but still at least x). So that as many people as possible have higher sums than him.\n\nSo, the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have is the minimal value s such that s >=x and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j = s. However, since the problem allows for any pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, but for the worst case, we need to select the minimal possible s (so that as many people as possible can have higher sums than him).\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor the worst case, find the minimal possible s (s >=x) such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j = s. Then, count how many participants have a sum strictly greater than s. Then the worst possible rank is that count + 1.\n\nBut how do we find this minimal s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of it as follows: For the worst case, we want to select a sum s that is as small as possible (but still >=x), and then compute the number of people who have sum strictly greater than s. The minimal s is the minimal possible sum that is at least x. However, since the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) with sum >=x, but there could be multiple pairs with different sums.\n\nSo the minimal possible s is the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j).\n\nBut how do we find this s?\n\nWell, perhaps the minimal possible s is x, but only if there's a pair that sums to x. Otherwise, it's the next possible value.\n\nBut how can we find this s efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is determined by considering all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) that are >=x, and for each such pair, compute the number of participants whose sum is strictly greater than (a_i + b_j). Then, the worst possible rank is the maximum among these values. Because to get the worst possible rank, we want to choose the pair (a_i, b_j) that gives the minimal possible sum (so that as many people as possible have higher sums than him).\n\nBut how do I compute that?\n\nBut considering all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) that are >=x is O(n^2), which is impossible for n up to 1e5.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nWait, but for the worst case, the minimal s is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Let's call this s_min. Then, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum > s_min, plus 1.\n\nSo how do we find s_min?\n\ns_min is the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j).\n\nBut how do we find that?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose x is 2, and all a_i and b_j are 1. Then s_min is 2. But if x is 3, and a_i and b_j are 1, then there's no pair with sum >=x. But the problem states that it's guaranteed that there is at least one pair with sum >=x.\n\nSo, to find s_min, the minimal possible sum that is >=x, we can think of the minimal possible sum that is at least x. How can we find that?\n\nBut how to find the minimal sum >=x that exists in the possible pairs (a_i, b_j)?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can generate all possible pairs, but that's O(n^2) time, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal sum for that a_i is a_i + (the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i)).\n\nBut even that approach may not be straightforward. However, perhaps we can sort the b array, and for each a_i, perform a binary search to find the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i). Then, the minimal sum for that a_i is a_i + that b_j. Then, among all these possibilities, we can find the minimal sum across all a_i.\n\nBut wait, this would give us the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Because for each a_i, we find the minimal b_j that, when added to a_i, gives a sum >=x. Then, the overall minimal sum across all these possibilities is s_min.\n\nYes, this makes sense. Because for each a_i, the minimal possible b_j that can be paired with it to reach x is (x - a_i). So if we find the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i), then adding that to a_i gives the minimal possible sum for that a_i. Then, the overall minimal sum is the minimum of all these.\n\nBut how do we handle cases where a_i is already so large that even the minimal b_j (which is 0) gives a sum >=x? For example, if x is 5, and a_i is 5, then any b_j >=0 will do. So the minimal sum is 5+0=5.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nSort the b array. For each a_i in the a array, compute the minimal required value for b_j to be (x - a_i). Then, find the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i). If such a b_j exists, then the sum is a_i + b_j. We take the minimal of all these possible sums across all a_i. That will be our s_min.\n\nBut how do we handle this efficiently?\n\nYes, because once we sort the b array, for each a_i, we can perform a binary search to find the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i). Then, if such a b_j exists, we can calculate the sum and track the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what if there is no such b_j? For example, if x - a_i is larger than all elements of b. But the problem states that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, for at least one a_i, there exists a b_j that meets the requirement. However, for some a_i, there might not be a b_j that meets the requirement. So during the process, we need to check whether for each a_i, there exists such a b_j.\n\nBut since the problem says that there exists at least one pair, then for at least one a_i, there will be a corresponding b_j.\n\nOnce we find the minimal s_min, then the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum > s_min plus 1.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of participants with sum > s_min?\n\nWait, but the participants' sum is the sum of a_i and b_j for each participant. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each participant is present in both tours. But the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but they are given in arbitrary order. So, for each participant, their first tour score is a_i, and their second tour score is b_j. But how are the a and b arrays structured? Are they for the same participants?\n\nNo. Wait, the problem says that the second line contains the participants' points in the first tour, and the third line contains the participants' points in the second tour. But the participants are not ordered. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i, and their second tour score is b_i. Wait, no. Wait, the input is:\n\nThe second line has n numbers: a1, a2,... an — the participants' points in the first tour.\n\nThird line has n numbers: b1, b2,... bn — participants' points in the second tour.\n\nBut the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i, and their second tour score is b_i. Wait, no. Wait, that's not possible. Because the first and second tour are for the same participants. So for example, participant 1 has a1 in first tour and b1 in second tour. Participant 2 has a2 in first tour and b2 in second tour. So the original data is that for each participant, their first and second tour scores are a_i and b_i. But the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but the problem is that the points are given in arbitrary order. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nThe teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names.\n\nSo, the a array is the first tour points of all participants, and the b array is the second tour points of all participants. But the order is arbitrary. So for example, the first participant's first tour is a[0], but their second tour is not necessarily b[0]. So the actual pairing of a_i and b_j for a participant is unknown. However, the problem says that each participant participated in both tours. Therefore, the actual data is that for each participant, there is one a_i and one b_j, but the way they are paired is not known. So the teacher can't know which a_i and b_j belong to which participant.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, when considering the sum of points for each participant, the actual sum is a_i + b_j, but each participant has exactly one a_i and one b_j. However, the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to which participant. Therefore, when trying to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, we have to consider all possible pairings of a and b, but with the constraint that each a and b is used exactly once. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour. So, for example, if there are n participants, then the a array is the first tour scores of all participants, and the b array is the second tour scores of all participants. But the teacher does not know which a_i belongs to which participant. So, for example, participant 1 could have a_i and b_j, but the teacher doesn't know which i and j. However, the problem says that each participant has exactly one a and one b. So the pairing between a and b is a permutation. But for the problem, when considering the possible sums of each participant, the actual sum is a_i + b_{σ(i)} where σ is a permutation of 1..n. But the teacher doesn't know which σ is.\n\nBut this complicates the problem. Because when we are trying to find the best and worst possible rank for Vasya, we need to choose a permutation σ such that there exists i where a_i + b_{σ(i)} ≥ x (which is guaranteed). Then, for the best possible rank, we want to choose σ such that Vasya's sum (a_i + b_{σ(i)}) is as high as possible, and for the worst possible rank, as low as possible.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya is one of the participants. So, in the scenario of the best possible rank, we can choose the permutation σ such that Vasya's a_i and b_j are paired in a way that maximizes his sum. For example, take the maximum a_i and maximum b_j. But the problem is that in that case, the other participants' sums are a_i + b_j, but how are they paired?\n\nWait, but for the purpose of calculating the best and worst possible ranks, the teacher can choose any possible pairing of a and b, as long as each a is paired with exactly one b. However, the problem is to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, given that there exists at least one pairing where his sum is ≥x.\n\nBut this seems very complex. However, the note in the problem gives an example. In the first sample input, all a and b are 1. So for any pairing, each participant's sum is 2. So Vasya can be placed first or fifth, depending on the jury's choice. Hence, the answer is 1 and 5.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because when considering the best possible rank, we can choose the pairing that maximizes Vasya's sum, and then arrange the other participants' sums in a way that minimizes the number of people with higher sum than him. Similarly, for the worst possible rank, we can choose the pairing that minimizes Vasya's sum, and arrange others' sums to maximize the number of people with higher sum than him.\n\nBut how can we compute that?\n\nLet me think again. For the best possible rank of Vasya:\n\nWe want to maximize his sum. To do that, we can take the maximum a_i and the maximum b_j. Because in that case, his sum is as high as possible. Then, the other participants' sums are determined by the remaining a and b. But how?\n\nBut the other participants' sums would be the sum of their a and b. However, since the pairing can be arbitrary, perhaps for the best possible rank, we can arrange the other participants' pairings such that as many as possible have lower sums than Vasya's maximum. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because the pairing is fixed once we choose the pairing. So, for example, if we want to maximize Vasya's sum, we can choose the pairing where Vasya's a is the maximum a_i and his b is the maximum b_j. Then, the rest of the pairings can be arranged in any way, but the other participants' sums are determined by their a and b.\n\nBut the problem is, how to calculate how many participants have a sum greater than Vasya's sum. Because that depends on the pairing. However, in this scenario, the best possible rank is when Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and the other participants' pairings are arranged in such a way that as few as possible have a sum higher than Vasya's.\n\nBut how can we compute this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible sum Vasya can have, and then count how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than that maximum. But since that maximum is the maximum possible, there can't be any participants with higher sum. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the maximum sum is achieved by Vasya. For example, if there are other participants who can also have that maximum sum. But the jury can arrange their ranks in any way, so Vasya can be placed first.\n\nSo the best possible rank is 1. Hence, the first number in the output is always 1.\n\nSo that's the best possible rank.\n\nNow for the worst possible rank.\n\nTo find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible sum s that Vasya can have (>=x), and then count the number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than s. Then, the worst possible rank is that count + 1.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal possible s that Vasya can have?\n\nAs discussed earlier, this is the minimal s >=x that can be formed by any a_i + b_j. Because once we choose that s, then we can arrange the other participants' pairings so that as many as possible have a sum greater than s. However, how do we find the number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than s?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the pairing is arbitrary. So, for example, if we choose s as the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have, then the other participants can be paired in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum >s. Thus, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >s, given that s is the minimal possible sum for Vasya.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that s is the minimal possible sum for Vasya. Now, for the other participants, we can pair their a and b in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum >s. How can we do that?\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) (with each a and b used exactly once) such that their sum is >s. But since we need to maximize this count, given that one pair (Vasya's) is s.\n\nBut how can we compute this maximum number?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can ignore Vasya's pair and compute how many pairs can be formed with sum >s, assuming that we can pair the a and b in any way. Then, the worst possible rank would be that number + 1. Because if there are k participants with sum >s, then Vasya's rank is k+1.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum k?\n\nThis seems like a classic problem of matching two arrays to maximize the number of pairs with sum >s.\n\nWait, but how to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j > s, and each a_i and b_j is used exactly once.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs with sum exceeding a certain value.\n\nThe standard approach for this is to sort one array and use a two-pointer approach for the other array.\n\nFor example, sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet. This would maximize the number of pairs with sum >s.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s:\n\nSort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers approach. Start with the largest a and pair it with the largest possible b that can make the sum exceed s. Then proceed accordingly.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose a is [1, 2, 3], b is [4, 5, 6], and s is 5. We want to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >5. Let's sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then, for the two pointers approach:\n\nStart with the largest a (3) and the largest b (6). 3+6=9>5 → count 1. Then move to next a (2) and next b (5). 2+5=7>5 → count 2. Then a=1 and b=4. 1+4=5 not >5. So total count is 2. Alternatively, if we pair a=3 with b=4, then a=2 with b=5, a=1 with b=6 → all three pairs sum to 7, 7, 7 → count 3. So the previous approach was not optimal. Hence, the two-pointer approach needs to be adjusted.\n\nAh, so the correct way is to sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, try to pair with the largest possible b_j not yet used. Let's see.\n\nIn this example, a sorted ascending is [1,2,3], b sorted descending is [6,5,4].\n\nPair 1 with 6 → sum 7>5. Then 2 with 5 → 7>5. Then 3 with 4 →7>5. All three pairs. So count is 3.\n\nSo the approach is to sort a in ascending, sort b in descending. Then, for each a_i, pair with the first available b_j that hasn't been used yet. So the algorithm would be:\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in descending order.\n\nInitialize two pointers, i=0 (for a) and j=0 (for b).\n\ncount =0.\n\nfor each a_i in a:\n\n   if a_i + b_j >s:\n\n      count +=1\n\n      j +=1\n\n   else:\n\n      continue.\n\nBut this is not correct. Because for example, in the case where a is [1, 3], b is [2, 4], and s=4.\n\nsorted a: [1,3]\n\nsorted b descending: [4,2]\n\ni=0, j=0: a[0]=1, b[0]=4 → sum 5>4 → count=1, j=1.\n\nnext i=1: a[1]=3, b[1]=2 → sum 5>4 → count=2. So total count is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1, 2], b = [3, 4], s=5.\n\nsorted a: [1,2], sorted b descending [4,3].\n\ni=0: 1+4=5 not >5 → no. So j remains 0. Then, next a_i=2. 2+4=6>5 → count=1, j=1. So total count is 1. But there is a better pairing: 1+3=4 <5, 2+4=6>5. So count is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=[1,2,3], b=[2,3,4], s=5.\n\nsorted a: [1,2,3], sorted b descending [4,3,2].\n\ni=0, j=0: 1+4=5 → not >5. So no count. j remains 0.\n\ni=1, j=0: 2+4=6>5 → count=1, j=1.\n\ni=2, j=1: 3+3=6>5 → count=2, j=2.\n\nTotal count is 2. But another pairing: 1+3=4 <5, 2+4=6>5, 3+2=5 → count is 1. Or pairing 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7 → count is 1. So the maximum possible is 2. Which matches the algorithm's result.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. So the algorithm for maximum number of pairs with sum >s is:\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in descending order.\n\nInitialize i=0, j=0, count=0.\n\nLoop through each a_i in a:\n\n   if a_i + b[j] >s:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       j +=1\n\nSo this is O(n log n) time.\n\nThus, to find the worst possible rank, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible s >=x that can be achieved by any pair (a_i, b_j).\n\n   How to find this s?\n\n   For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then take the minimal of all such possible sums.\n\n   As discussed before, this can be done by sorting the b array, and for each a_i, perform a binary search to find the minimal b_j >= (x - a_i). Then, the sum is a_i + b_j. Take the minimal such sum over all a_i.\n\n   However, there's a possibility that for some a_i, there's no such b_j. But the problem says that there's at least one pair.\n\n   So, the code for finding s_min:\n\n   Sort the b array.\n\n   For each a_i in a:\n\n       target = x - a_i.\n\n       find the smallest b_j >= target. If exists, then sum_candidate = a_i + b_j. Keep track of the minimal sum_candidate.\n\n   Then, s_min is the minimal of these sum_candidates.\n\n   Once we have s_min, then we need to compute the maximum number of pairs (a, b) with sum >s_min. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause in the worst case scenario, Vasya has sum s_min. The maximum number of other participants that can have sum >s_min is the maximum possible, which is computed by the two-pointer approach. Then, Vasya's rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how do we ensure that there is a pairing where Vasya's sum is s_min, and the rest of the pairs are arranged to maximize the number of participants with sum >s_min?\n\nYes, because the pairing can be done in such a way. For example, Vasya's pair is (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = s_min. Then, the rest of the pairs can be arranged to maximize the number of participants with sum >s_min.\n\nSo the steps for the worst rank are:\n\n- Find s_min as described.\n\n- Compute the maximum number of pairs (a, b) with sum >s_min.\n\n- The worst rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum number of pairs?\n\nAs explained, by using the two-pointer approach after sorting a and b.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that when we compute this maximum number of pairs, we have to take into account that one of the pairs is fixed as (a_i, b_j) with sum s_min. However, when we compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min, we are assuming that all pairs can be arranged optimally, but one of the pairs is already used for Vasya's sum.\n\nBut this is not considered in the previous approach. How?\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because the previous approach assumes that all pairs can be used, but in reality, one of the pairs (a_i, b_j) is used for Vasya. So when computing the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min, we have to subtract that one pair.\n\nBut how can we handle that?\n\nLet me think. Let's say that s_min is achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). When we compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min, we need to exclude this pair. But since the pairing is arbitrary, perhaps the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min is the maximum possible, and then we can subtract 1 if the pair (a_i, b_j) is included in that maximum.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps the following approach works:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min is computed as before. Then, since Vasya's pair is one of the pairs, but it's sum is s_min (not >s_min), the maximum number of participants with sum >s_min is the computed number.\n\nBecause when we compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min, that includes all possible pairs except Vasya's. Because Vasya's pair is not counted in that number. Because his sum is s_min.\n\nWait, no. The maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min is computed for all possible pairs, including those that could be used for Vasya. However, since Vasya's pair is one of the pairs (a_i, b_j) with sum s_min, which is not >s_min, then the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min is exactly the number of participants with sum >s_min in the optimal pairing, which is what we need.\n\nBut how to ensure that such a pairing exists where Vasya's pair is (a_i, b_j) with sum s_min and the rest of the pairs are arranged to maximize the number of pairs with sum >s_min.\n\nThis seems possible. Because the pairing that achieves the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min may not include the pair (a_i, b_j) used for Vasya. But if it does, then the count would be reduced by one. However, since we are trying to find the maximum possible number of pairs with sum >s_min, we can choose a pairing that uses a different pair for Vasya's sum.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min is to find the maximum possible number of pairs, and then subtract 0 or 1, depending on whether the pair (a_i, b_j) used for Vasya is part of that maximum.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps the following holds: when we compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min, it's possible that there are multiple pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be used for Vasya's sum. So, for example, if there are multiple pairs with sum s_min, then we can choose one of them that is not part of the maximum pairs with sum >s_min. Thus, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min remains the same.\n\nBut how to handle this in code?\n\nMaybe it's safe to proceed with the initial approach, assuming that the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min can be computed without considering Vasya's pair. Because the presence of Vasya's pair (which has sum s_min) doesn't affect the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min, as long as there exists a pairing that includes Vasya's pair and allows the rest to be arranged optimally.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose that s_min is 5. The maximum number of pairs with sum >5 is 3. But one of those pairs is (a_i, b_j) which has sum 6. However, Vasya's pair is (a_i, b_k) which has sum 5. So, in this case, the maximum number of pairs with sum >5 is 3, and Vasya's pair is not part of those 3. So the worst rank is 3 + 1 =4.\n\nAnother example: suppose that the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min is 3, and one of those pairs is the same as Vasya's pair. But since Vasya's pair has sum s_min, not >s_min, then the count is 3. So the worst rank is 3 + 1 =4.\n\nThus, the initial approach is correct. The maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min is computed as the maximum possible, regardless of Vasya's pair. Because Vasya's pair is not part of that count.\n\nTherefore, the steps for the worst rank are:\n\n1. Find s_min as the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\n2. Compute the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with sum >s_min. Let's call this 'max_count'.\n\n3. The worst possible rank is max_count + 1.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nThe code needs to:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the a array.\n\nRead the b array.\n\nFor best rank: output 1.\n\nFor worst rank:\n\nCompute s_min as the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nThen compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min, which is done by the two-pointer approach.\n\nThen the worst rank is max_count + 1.\n\nBut how to compute s_min?\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nSort the b array.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   target = x - a_i.\n\n   find the smallest b_j >= target.\n\n   if exists, then candidate_sum = a_i + b_j.\n\n   keep track of the minimum candidate_sum.\n\nOnce all a_i are processed, s_min is the minimum of all candidate_sums.\n\nBut how to find the smallest b_j >= target?\n\nWe can sort the b array, and for each target, perform a binary search.\n\nFor example, in Python, we can use bisect_left.\n\nSo:\n\nsorted_b = sorted(b)\n\nfor each a_i in a:\n\n    target = x - a_i\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_b, target)\n\n    if idx < len(sorted_b):\n\n        candidate = a_i + sorted_b[idx]\n\n        s_min_candidate = min(s_min_candidate, candidate)\n\nBut what if there are multiple b_j >= target? We choose the smallest one, which gives the minimal candidate sum.\n\nYes.\n\nOnce s_min is found, then proceed to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min.\n\nTo compute that, we need to sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order, and apply the two-pointer approach.\n\nBut wait, the two-pointer approach is to find the maximum number of pairs (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the given scores from both tours to compute these ranks efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: The best possible rank for Vasya is always 1. This is because we can assume that Vasya's score is the highest possible sum of any pair from the first and second tours, which ensures he is at the top of the rankings.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we need to:\n   - Find the minimum possible score Vasya can have that is at least `x`.\n   - Calculate the maximum number of participants who can have a higher score than this minimum score. This is done by sorting the scores and using a two-pointer technique to maximize the count of pairs with sums greater than the minimum score.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n, x = int(input[ptr]), int(input[ptr+1])\n    ptr += 2\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n    ptr += n\n    \n    # Best rank is always 1\n    best = 1\n    \n    # Compute worst rank\n    sorted_b = sorted(b)\n    s_min = float('inf')\n    \n    for ai in a:\n        target = x - ai\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_b, target)\n        if idx < len(sorted_b):\n            candidate = ai + sorted_b[idx]\n            if candidate < s_min:\n                s_min = candidate\n    \n    # Now compute max_count of pairs with sum > s_min\n    # Sort a ascending, b descending\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    \n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    max_count = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] > s_min:\n            max_count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    \n    worst = max_count + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best} {worst}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the scores from the first and second tours stored in lists `a` and `b`.\n\n2. **Best Rank Calculation**: The best possible rank is always 1 because we can assume Vasya's score is the maximum possible sum of any pair from the two tours.\n\n3. **Worst Rank Calculation**:\n   - **Finding Minimum Score (s_min)**: For each score in the first tour, we find the smallest score in the second tour that, when combined, meets or exceeds `x`. This gives us the minimum possible score Vasya can have.\n   - **Max Count Calculation**: Using a two-pointer technique, we sort the first tour scores in ascending order and the second tour scores in descending order. We then count how many pairs have sums greater than the minimum score found earlier. This count helps determine the worst possible rank by adding 1 to account for Vasya's position.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation even for large input sizes, leveraging sorting and binary search for optimal performance.",
