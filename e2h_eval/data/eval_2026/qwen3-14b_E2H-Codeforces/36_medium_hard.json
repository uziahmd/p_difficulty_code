The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about calculating the probability that after building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for this to be possible. \n\nFirst, the signal power setup must cover each town exactly once. Also, the signal from a tower at position i with power p covers cities from i-p+1 to i+p-1? Wait, the problem says |c -i| < p. So that's c in (i - p + 1, i + p -1)? Wait, |c - i| < p implies that c ranges from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1, inclusive? Because if p is an integer, then for example, if p=2, then |c -i| can be 0 or 1. So the range is from i-1 to i+1. So the length is 2p-1. So the signal reaches exactly those cities within a distance less than p. So the radius is p-0.5, but since p is integer, it's easier to think of the coverage as covering cities from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), inclusive. Because for example, if p is 1, then |c-i| < 1 implies c=i, so only the city itself. If p is 2, then |c-i| < 2 → c can be i-1, i, i+1.\n\nSo for each tower, when you set its power, it covers some cities. The problem requires that each city from 1 to n is covered exactly once, and 0 and n+1 are not covered by any.\n\nNow, how can we model the valid configurations of towers?\n\nLet me think. The key is to find the number of subsets S of {1, 2, ..., n} (each subset represents the towers built) such that there exists a way to assign powers to the towers in S to satisfy the constraints. Then, the probability would be (number of such subsets) / 2^n, since each subset has probability 1/(2^n).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of valid subsets S, then compute that divided by 2^n modulo 998244353.\n\nNow the challenge is to compute the number of valid subsets S.\n\nLet me think about the structure of such subsets. For each valid subset S, there must be a way to assign power levels such that:\n\n- Each city 1..n is covered exactly once.\n- Cities 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nSo for the coverage, each city must be covered exactly once. That suggests that the towers' coverage regions form a partition of the cities 1..n. Also, the coverage regions must not reach 0 or n+1.\n\nBut how can this be achieved?\n\nLet me think of the towers as being arranged in a way that their coverage areas are non-overlapping and exactly cover the cities. But since each tower's coverage can be adjusted by choosing the power, perhaps there's a specific pattern that the towers must follow.\n\nFor example, consider that each tower is responsible for a certain interval. Let's think about the following approach: the towers must be arranged such that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain spacing that allows their coverage to be assigned properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid subsets are those where the towers form a structure where each tower is responsible for a certain segment, and these segments are non-overlapping and cover all cities.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's imagine that for a valid configuration, the towers must be placed such that there's a way to assign their power so that each tower covers exactly some contiguous segment of cities, and the segments don't overlap and cover everything.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe the towers must be arranged in a way that they form a \"domino tiling\" or similar structure.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Suppose we have a valid configuration for n-1. How can adding the nth city affect it?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to tiling. For example, each tower must be placed in a way that it covers some cities, and the next tower starts after that coverage.\n\nLet me think of the possible valid tower arrangements. For example, in the first sample input where n=2, the valid case is when both 1 and 2 are towers. Then, each can be set to power 1. Then, city 1 is covered by tower 1, city 2 by tower 2. But also, if only tower 2 is built, then setting its power to 2 would cover cities 1 and 2. However, that would mean city 1 is covered by tower 2, but then city 0 is at position 0. The tower's power is 2, so |0 - 2| = 2, which is not less than 2. So that's okay. But then, city 0 is not covered. However, in this case, the tower is at position 2 with power 2. The coverage is cities where |c -2| < 2 → c=1, 2, 3? Wait, no. Wait, if p is 2, then |c - i| < p → |c - i| can be 0, 1. So for i=2, the coverage is cities 1, 2, 3. But city 3 is n+1 when n=2. So that would mean that city 3 (n+1) is covered, which is not allowed. Therefore, that configuration is invalid. Hence, the case where only tower 2 is built is invalid.\n\nAh right! So the power assignment must ensure that the coverage doesn't reach 0 or n+1. So for a tower at position i, the maximum possible power p is such that i - p + 1 > 0 and i + p - 1 < n+1. Wait, no. Let me rephrase: the coverage of a tower at i with power p must not include 0 or n+1. So for the tower at i, the maximum p that can be chosen is such that:\n\ni - p + 1 > 0 → p < i + 1 → p ≤ i. Also, i + p - 1 < n + 1 → p < n + 1 - i + 1 → p ≤ n - i + 1 ?\n\nWait, solving for |c - i| < p. For city 0, |0 - i| < p → i < p. So p must be greater than i. But if that's the case, then the tower's coverage would reach 0. Which is not allowed. So to avoid covering 0, the tower's power must be such that i ≥ p. Similarly, for city n+1, |(n+1) -i| < p → (n+1 - i) < p → p > (n+1 - i). So to avoid covering city n+1, the power p must be ≤ (n+1 - i). \n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let me re-express. For a tower at position i, the signal must not reach 0 or n+1. Therefore, the maximum possible p for that tower is min(i, n+1 - i). Because:\n\n- To prevent reaching 0, the tower's power p must be ≤ i. Because if p is larger than i, then |0 - i| = i < p → 0 would be covered. So p must be ≤ i.\n\n- Similarly, to prevent reaching n+1, the tower's power must be ≤ (n+1 - i). Because |(n+1) - i| = n+1 -i. So if p exceeds this, then n+1 is covered.\n\nSo the maximum possible p for a tower at i is min(i, n+1 - i). But for the purposes of covering cities, the actual p can be chosen up to this maximum.\n\nBut how does this help us in determining the valid subsets of towers?\n\nPerhaps the key is that the towers must be arranged in such a way that each tower can be assigned a power that covers a certain range of cities, and these ranges don't overlap and cover all cities 1..n.\n\nThis feels similar to the problem of tiling with dominoes or something else. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet's consider dp[i] as the number of valid ways for the first i cities (positions 1 to i). But how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the valid tower configurations as those that can be partitioned into intervals, where each interval is covered by exactly one tower. For example, each tower is responsible for a certain interval [a, b], and the tower is located at some position in this interval. But how to ensure that the tower's power is sufficient to cover the entire interval and not exceed the boundaries.\n\nWait, for a tower at position i to cover exactly the interval [a, b], the power p must be such that:\n\na = i - p + 1\n\nb = i + p - 1\n\nBut since the tower's coverage is all cities c with |c - i| < p, which is equivalent to c ∈ [i - p + 1, i + p -1]. So for the tower to cover exactly the interval [a, b], the length is 2p-1. But the tower's position is in the middle of this interval.\n\nBut in order for the tower to cover [a, b], the power p must be equal to (b - a + 1 + 1)/2. Because the length of the interval is 2p-1, so solving for p gives p = (length + 1)/2. So for example, an interval of length 1 (a single city) requires p=1. An interval of length 3 (three cities) requires p=2, etc.\n\nMoreover, the tower must be located at the center of the interval. For example, for the interval [a, b], the tower must be at position (a + b)/2. Since the positions are integers, this implies that a + b must be even, so that the midpoint is an integer.\n\nBut how does this relate to the problem? Well, for the entire coverage to be a partition of [1, n], each such interval must be covered by exactly one tower, and the tower must be located at the center of the interval. \n\nSo this suggests that the valid subsets of towers are those that correspond to a partition of [1, n] into intervals, each of which is centered at a tower. Moreover, each interval must be of odd length (so that the midpoint is integer), and the tower is located at the center. \n\nThis seems like a promising approach. Let me think again. For example, in the first sample where n=2. The valid case is when towers are built at 1 and 2. Then, each tower covers an interval of length 1 (so p=1). So the intervals are [1,1] and [2,2]. That's valid. Another possible case is when there's a single tower at position 2, but then the interval would have to be [1, 3], but 3 is n+1. Which is invalid. So that's why that case isn't allowed.\n\nAnother example: for n=3. Suppose there's a tower at position 2. Then, the interval [1,3] can be covered with p=2. But since the tower is at 2, the coverage includes cities 1,2,3. However, city 3 is n, which is allowed. But city 0 is not covered. So that's acceptable. So this configuration is valid. So the subset {2} is valid. So for n=3, the valid subsets include {2} (counted once) and {1,2,3} (if they are all built, but then each tower can be set to p=1, but then their coverage would be [1,1], [2,2], [3,3], which is valid). Also, maybe other subsets.\n\nSo according to this idea, the valid subsets are those that can be partitioned into intervals, each of which has an odd length, and each interval is centered at a tower. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S of {1,2,...,n} such that S can be partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a tower (i.e., the tower is in the middle of the interval). \n\nBut how can we model this? It seems similar to tiling problems where each tile is of certain length. For example, the number of ways to tile a 1xn board with tiles of size 1, 3, 5, etc., but each tile must have a center. But how does this translate into the count of subsets?\n\nWait, because each interval corresponds to exactly one tower. So for a given tiling, each tile corresponds to a tower in its center. So the subset S is exactly the set of centers of the tiles. Thus, the number of valid subsets is equal to the number of ways to partition the interval [1, n] into tiles of odd lengths. Because each such partition corresponds to exactly one subset S (the centers of the tiles), and each subset S that can be partitioned in such a way is counted once.\n\nBut then, the number of valid subsets is equal to the number of such tilings. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition the line [1..n] into intervals of odd lengths. Because each such partition corresponds to a valid subset S (the centers of the tiles), and each such subset S can be used to assign the power levels (each tile's length is 2p-1, so p = (length + 1)/2). \n\nBut wait, what about overlapping tiles? No, because the partitioning is into non-overlapping intervals. So each tile is a contiguous block of cities, and they are non-overlapping and cover the entire [1..n].\n\nSo this seems like a key insight. Let me verify with the examples.\n\nIn the first example, n=2. The possible tilings are:\n\n- Two tiles of length 1 (each [1], [2]). This corresponds to subset {1,2}.\n\n- One tile of length 2? No, because 2 is even. So no. So the only valid tiling is the two tiles of length 1. So the count is 1. Hence, the total valid subsets is 1. The total possible subsets is 2^2=4. So the probability is 1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second example, n=3. The possible tilings are:\n\n- Three tiles of length 1: [1], [2], [3]. Subset {1,2,3}.\n\n- One tile of length 3: [1,2,3]. Subset {2}.\n\n- Or, a tile of length 1 followed by a tile of length 2? No, because 2 is even. Not allowed.\n\nOr a tile of length 1 and then another of length 1 and another of length 1. So total of two possibilities. So the count is 2. So the number of valid subsets is 2. Then the probability is 2/(2^3) = 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes! The sample says for n=3, the answer is 1/4, which aligns with this reasoning. So this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to tile the interval [1..n] using tiles of odd lengths. Then, the answer is (number of tilings) / 2^n mod 998244353.\n\nSo now, the problem is to compute the number of such tilings. Let's call this value f(n). Then, the answer is f(n) / 2^n mod MOD.\n\nNow, how to compute f(n)?\n\nThis looks like a classic dynamic programming problem. Let's think recursively. For the first position, we can choose a tile of length 1, 3, 5, ..., up to n (if n is odd). For each possible choice, we add the number of ways to tile the remaining positions.\n\nLet me define dp[i] as the number of ways to tile the first i positions. Then, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[0] = 1 (base case, empty tiling)\ndp[i] = sum_{k=1,3,5,...} dp[i - k], where k is odd and <=i.\n\nBut for large n (up to 2e5), we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet's see. For example, for dp[i], the sum is over all odd numbers k up to i. Let's think about how to express this recurrence.\n\nNote that for each i, the sum is equal to dp[i-1] + dp[i-3] + dp[i-5] + ... \n\nBut how can we find a closed-form formula or find a way to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet's look for a pattern. For example:\n\ndp[0] = 1\n\ndp[1] = dp[0] = 1\n\ndp[2] = dp[1] = 1 (since only k=1 is allowed, because 2 is even. Wait, no. For i=2, the possible k is 1 (since 1 is odd and <=2). Then, dp[2] = dp[2-1] = dp[1] = 1. \n\ndp[3] = dp[2] + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ndp[4] = dp[3] + dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\ndp[5] = dp[4] + dp[2] + dp[0} = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nWait, but for dp[5], the possible k's are 1, 3, 5. So:\n\ndp[5] = dp[4] (k=1) + dp[2] (k=3) + dp[0} (k=5) → 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\nSimilarly, dp[6] = dp[5] + dp[3} + dp[1} = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\ndp[0] = 1\n\ndp[1] = 1\n\ndp[2] = 1\n\ndp[3] = 2\n\ndp[4] = 3\n\ndp[5] = 5\n\ndp[6] = 8\n\ndp[7] = 13?\n\nYes, because dp[7] = dp[6] + dp[4} + dp[2} + dp[0} = 8 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 13. \n\nSo the sequence looks like the Fibonacci numbers. Let's see:\n\ndp[0] = 1\n\ndp[1] = 1\n\ndp[2] = 1\n\ndp[3] = 2\n\ndp[4] = 3\n\ndp[5] = 5\n\ndp[6] = 8\n\ndp[7] = 13\n\nWhich is the Fibonacci sequence shifted. Indeed, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] ?\n\nWait, no. For example, dp[3] = 2, dp[2] = 1, dp[1] = 1. So 1 + 1 = 2. dp[4] = dp[3] + dp[2} = 2 + 1 = 3. dp[5] = dp[4] + dp[3} = 3 + 2 = 5. dp[6] = 5 +3=8. So yes! It seems that dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2}.\n\nWait, how is that possible? Because according to our previous recurrence, dp[i] is the sum over all odd k of dp[i -k]. But how does that reduce to dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2}?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that for any i, the sum over all odd k's is equal to dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} ?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to find a recurrence relation for dp[i]. Let's think about the sum for dp[i].\n\nWe can note that the sum over all odd k is equal to the sum for all k odd, which is the same as the sum for all k = 1, 3, 5, ..., up to i.\n\nBut let's consider that for any i, the sum over odd k is equal to dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} ?\n\nLet me check for i=3: sum is dp[2] (k=1) + dp[0} (k=3) → 1 +1=2. And dp[2] + dp[1} is 1 + 1 = 2. Yes.\n\nFor i=4: sum is dp[3} (k=1) + dp[1} (k=3) → 2 + 1 = 3. And dp[3} + dp[2} = 2 +1 = 3. Yes.\n\nFor i=5: sum is dp[4} + dp[2} + dp[0} = 3 + 1 +1 =5. And dp[4} + dp[3} = 3 + 2 =5. Yes.\n\nSo for i >= 1, dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} ?\n\nThat's interesting. How can this be derived?\n\nLet me think about the original recurrence. The original recurrence is dp[i] = sum_{k is odd} dp[i -k}.\n\nBut notice that the sum for dp[i] can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{k odd} dp[i -k} = sum_{m} dp[m}, where m = i -k, and k is odd. So m = i -k → k = i - m. Since k is odd, i - m must be odd → m has parity opposite to i.\n\nSo for each i, dp[i] = sum_{m: m < i, m ≡ i-1 mod 2} dp[m}.\n\nBut how can this be expressed as dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} ?\n\nAlternatively, think about the generating function for dp[i].\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let me consider that dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} for i ≥ 2, with base cases dp[0] = 1, dp[1} = 1.\n\nIf that's true, then dp[i] is the (i+1)-th Fibonacci number. Let's check:\n\ndp[0] = 1 → Fib(1) = 1\n\ndp[1] = 1 → Fib(2) = 1\n\ndp[2] = 1 → Fib(3) = 2? No, this seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the indexing is different.\n\nWait the Fibonacci sequence is usually defined as F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc. So according to the previous values:\n\ndp[0] = 1 = F(2)\n\ndp[1] = 1 = F(2)\n\ndp[2] = 1 = F(3) ?\n\nNo, maybe not. Let me think again. The dp sequence is:\n\ndp[0] = 1\n\ndp[1] = 1\n\ndp[2] = 1\n\ndp[3] = 2\n\ndp[4] = 3\n\ndp[5] = 5\n\ndp[6] = 8\n\nWhich is the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, F(4) = 3, F(5) = 5, etc. So dp[i] = F(i) where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, F(4)=3, etc. So for example, dp[2] = 1 = F(2), dp[3] = 2 = F(3), dp[4] = 3 = F(4), etc. So dp[i] = F(i) for i ≥ 0. But for i=0, F(0) is 0, but dp[0] is 1. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe dp[i] = F(i+1), where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence. Let's check:\n\nFor i=0, F(1) = 1 → yes.\n\ni=1: F(2) = 1 → yes.\n\ni=2: F(3) = 2 → but dp[2] is 1. No. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe dp[i] = F(i) where F(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=2, etc. Like a variant of Fibonacci. Let's see:\n\nIf dp[0] = 1, dp[1] = 1, dp[2] = dp[1] + dp[0} = 1 +1 = 2? But earlier calculation said dp[2] is 1. So that contradicts. So perhaps my earlier assumption that dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} is wrong.\n\nWait wait, earlier calculations showed that for i=2, dp[2] is 1, but according to the recurrence dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} would give dp[2} = dp[1} + dp[0} = 1 +1 = 2. Which contradicts. So there's a mistake in my previous reasoning.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that dp[i] = sum of dp[i-k] for all odd k. But for i=2, the only possible k is 1. So dp[2} = dp[2-1} = dp[1} = 1. Which is correct. But according to the supposed recurrence dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2}, for i=2, it would be dp[1} + dp[0} = 1 +1 = 2. Which is wrong. So my previous conclusion was wrong. There's a mistake in the earlier analysis.\n\nSo why did the numbers for dp[3} and onwards seem to fit the Fibonacci pattern? Let me recalculate.\n\nLet me re-calculate dp[i} based on the original recurrence.\n\nOriginal recurrence: dp[i} = sum_{k odd, k ≤i} dp[i -k}.\n\ndp[0} = 1 (base case)\n\ndp[1} = sum_{k=1} dp[0} = 1 → 1.\n\ndp[2} = sum_{k=1} dp[2-1} = dp[1} = 1.\n\ndp[3} = sum_{k=1,3} dp[3 -k} → dp[2} + dp[0} = 1 +1 = 2.\n\ndp[4} = sum_{k=1,3} dp[4 -k} → k=1 → dp[3} = 2; k=3 → dp[1} =1. Total 2+1=3.\n\ndp[5} = sum_{k=1,3,5} → dp[4} (k=1) + dp[2} (k=3) + dp[0} (k=5) → 3 +1 +1=5.\n\ndp[6} = sum_{k=1,3,5} → dp[5} (k=1) + dp[3} (k=3) + dp[1} (k=5) →5 +2 +1=8.\n\ndp[7} = dp[6} + dp[4} + dp[2} + dp[0} → 8 +3 +1 +1 =13.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n\ni: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ...\n\ndp:1 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21...\n\nSo this looks like the Fibonacci sequence starting from dp[0}=1, dp[1}=1, dp[2}=1, dp[3}=2, etc. So the recurrence for dp[i} is dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} - dp[i-3} ? Or perhaps another pattern?\n\nWait, looking at the sequence:\n\ndp[0} = 1\n\ndp[1} = 1\n\ndp[2} = 1 = dp[1} \n\ndp[3} = 2 = dp[2} + dp[1} ?\n\nNo, 1 + 1 = 2. So dp[3} = dp[2} + dp[1} ?\n\nYes. dp[3} = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ndp[4} = dp[3} + dp[2} → 2 +1 =3. Yes.\n\ndp[5} = dp[4} + dp[3} → 3+2=5. Yes.\n\ndp[6} = dp[5} + dp[4} →5+3=8. Yes.\n\ndp[7} = 8+5=13. Yes. \n\nSo for i ≥ 3, dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nBut what about for i=2? dp[2} = 1, which equals dp[1} + dp[0} ? 1 + 1 = 2, which is not. So the recurrence holds for i ≥3, but not for i=2. \n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[0} = 1\n\ndp[1} = 1\n\ndp[2} = 1\n\ndp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} for i ≥3.\n\nYes, that fits. For i=3, dp[3} = dp[2} + dp[1} =1+1=2. Correct. For i=4, dp[4} = dp[3} + dp[2} =2+1=3. Correct.\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2], for i ≥ 3.\n\nWith base cases dp[0} =1, dp[1} =1, dp[2} =1.\n\nSo this is a Fibonacci-like sequence, but with different initial terms.\n\nSo now, the problem becomes to compute dp[n], which is the number of valid tilings, and then divide by 2^n mod MOD.\n\nBut how to compute dp[n} for large n (up to 2e5)?\n\nThis can be done with dynamic programming. We can precompute dp up to n.\n\nLet's confirm for the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: n=2. dp[2} =1. 1/(2^2) = 1/4 → correct.\n\nSample 2: n=3. dp[3}=2. 2/8=1/4 → correct.\n\nSample 3: n=5. dp[5} =5. So 5/(2^5) =5/32 → which matches the third sample's note (the answer is 5/32). So yes, this seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute dp[n}, which follows the recurrence:\n\ndp[0} =1\n\ndp[1} =1\n\ndp[2} =1\n\ndp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} for i≥3.\n\nThen, the answer is dp[n} / 2^n mod MOD.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute dp[n} modulo MOD, then compute the modular inverse of 2^n modulo MOD, multiply them together, and output the result.\n\nBut how to compute dp[n}? For n up to 2e5, it's feasible with O(n) time and space.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, even O(n) is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute dp array up to n.\n\n- Compute pow(2, n, MOD), then compute its modular inverse.\n\n- Multiply dp[n} by the inverse mod MOD.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is x/y mod MOD, where x is the number of valid subsets and y is 2^n. Since x and y are coprime? Not necessarily, but the way to compute it is to compute x * y^{-1} mod MOD.\n\nSo the code will be:\n\nCompute x = dp[n} mod MOD.\n\nCompute denominator = pow(2, n, MOD).\n\nCompute inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD-2, MOD).\n\nresult = (x * inv_denominator) % MOD.\n\nSo the main task is to compute dp[n}.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nBut let's think about the initial terms:\n\nFor n=0? Well, the problem states that n ≥1. So the code can handle n=1 and higher.\n\nTesting for n=1:\n\ndp[1} =1. The answer is 1/2. Which would be correct. Because for n=1, the valid subsets are those where the tower is built at position 1. Then, the power can be set to 1, which covers city 1, and does not reach city 0 (since p=1, and 1-1=0, but |0 -1| =1, which is not less than p=1. So it's allowed. So the subset {1} is valid. So the number of valid subsets is 1. Hence 1/2^1 = 1/2.\n\nYes. So the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, we can compute dp as follows:\n\nInitialize dp as a list of size n+1.\n\ndp[0] = 1\n\nif n >=1: dp[1] =1\n\nif n >=2: dp[2] =1\n\nfor i from 3 to n:\n\n    dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD\n\nBut wait, the MOD is 998244353. So during the computation, we should take mod at each step to prevent integer overflow.\n\nBut in Python, integers can be large, but taking mod at each step is better for efficiency and to avoid large numbers.\n\nSo the code for dp is straightforward.\n\nOnce we have dp[n], compute the answer as (dp[n] * pow(2, n, MOD))^{-1} mod MOD.\n\nWait no: the answer is (dp[n] / 2^n) mod MOD, which is equal to (dp[n] * inv(2^n)) mod MOD.\n\nSo the code for that part is:\n\nmod = 998244353\n\nx = dp[n]\n\ndenominator = pow(2, n, mod)\n\ninv_denominator = pow(denominator, mod-2, mod)\n\nans = (x * inv_denominator) % mod\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample 1: n=2.\n\ndp[2} =1.\n\ndenominator is 4.\n\ninv_denominator is 748683265 (since 4^{-1} mod 998244353 is 748683265, as 4 * 748683265 mod MOD = 1).\n\nSo 1 * 748683265 mod MOD is 748683265, which matches the first sample output.\n\nSample 2: n=3. dp[3} =2. denominator is 8. 2/8 = 1/4. 1/4 mod MOD is 748683265. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample 3: n=5. dp[5} is 5. denominator is 32. 5/32 mod MOD is 5 * inv(32) mod MOD. Let's compute inv(32) mod MOD. Since 32^{-1} mod MOD is pow(32, MOD-2, MOD). But regardless, the sample says the answer is 5/32, which is the third sample output. So the code would return that.\n\nThus, this approach is correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, the DP array can be computed efficiently.\n\nBut for n=0, but the problem says n≥1.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nCompute dp array up to n.\n\nBut for n=1, dp[1} =1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nmod = 998244353\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 0:\n    # but n is at least 1\n    pass\n\nmax_n = n\n\ndp = [0]*(max_n +1)\n\ndp[0] =1\n\nif max_n >=1:\n    dp[1] =1\n\nif max_n >=2:\n    dp[2] =1\n\nfor i in range(3, max_n+1):\n    dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % mod\n\nx = dp[n]\n\ndenominator = pow(2, n, mod)\n\ninv_denominator = pow(denominator, mod-2, mod)\n\nans = (x * inv_denominator) % mod\n\nprint(ans)\n\nBut let's test for n=5. dp[5} is 5.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after building radio towers in towns 1 through n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. The solution involves dynamic programming and modular arithmetic to efficiently compute the result for large values of n.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid configurations of towers. The key insight is that valid configurations correspond to tiling the interval [1, n] using tiles of odd lengths, where each tile's center is a tower.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The number of valid tilings up to position i can be derived using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` for `i >= 3`, with base cases `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 1`, and `dp[2] = 1`.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle division operations. Specifically, we compute the modular inverse of `2^n` using Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    max_n = n\n    dp = [0] * (max_n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    if max_n >= 1:\n        dp[1] = 1\n    if max_n >= 2:\n        dp[2] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(3, max_n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD\n    \n    x = dp[n]\n    denominator = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    ans = (x * inv_denominator) % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized to store the number of valid tilings up to each position. The base cases are set based on the initial conditions of the problem.\n2. **Filling DP Array**: Using the recurrence relation, we fill the `dp` array up to the given `n`. This allows us to efficiently compute the number of valid configurations.\n3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: To compute the probability, we use modular arithmetic. The denominator `2^n` is converted to its modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that `a^(MOD-2) % MOD` gives the modular inverse of `a` under modulo `MOD`.\n4. **Final Result Calculation**: The result is obtained by multiplying the number of valid configurations with the modular inverse of `2^n`, ensuring the result is within the required modulo constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and computes the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, ensuring correctness even for large values of `n`.",
