And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I have to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those weeks.\n\nHmm. So first, the input gives me n and k, followed by a list of a_i's. The output needs to be the average of all the possible consecutive k-day periods. \n\nLet me think about the example given. For instance, in the first sample input: n=3, k=2. The days are [3,4,7]. The possible weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their averages are (3+4)/2 = 3.5 and (4+7)/2 = 5.5. The overall average is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? Wait but the sample output is 9.000... Oh wait no, wait the sample output says for that input the output is 9.000... Wait wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me check the note again.\n\nWait the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Oh right, because each week's average is sum divided by k. Then the overall average is (sum of all weeks' sums) divided by (number of weeks) * k? Or wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that for each week, we calculate the average. Then the answer is the average of all those averages. So for each week, the average is (sum of k days)/k. Then the overall average is the sum of all those (sum/k) divided by the number of weeks. Which is equivalent to (sum of all the sums of the weeks) divided by (number of weeks * k). \n\nBut wait, the sum of all the sums of the weeks divided by (number of weeks * k) is the same as the average of the averages. So yes.\n\nBut how do I compute the sum of all the sums of the weeks?\n\nBecause for each consecutive k days, I need to compute their sum, then add all those sums together, then divide by (number_of_weeks * k) ?\n\nWait, the number of weeks is (n -k +1). So the total sum of all the weeks' sums is the sum of all the sliding windows of size k. Then the average of all the averages would be (total_sum_of_windows) / ( (n -k +1) * k )\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of all sliding window sums of size k, then dividing by (number_of_weeks * k).\n\nBut how to compute the sum of all sliding window sums efficiently?\n\nBecause if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach of computing each window sum in O(k) time would be O(nk), which would be 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need an efficient way to compute the sum of all sliding window sums.\n\nLet me think about the sliding window technique. The standard approach for sum of sliding window is to use prefix sums. Let me think.\n\nLet's compute the prefix sum array. Let's say prefix_sum[i] is the sum of the first i elements. Then the sum of the window starting at position i (0-based) and of length k is prefix_sum[i + k] - prefix_sum[i]. \n\nBut the problem is to compute the sum of all these window sums. So for each window starting at i (from 0 to n -k), sum is prefix_sum[i +k] - prefix_sum[i]. So the total sum is sum_{i=0}^{n -k} (prefix_sum[i +k] - prefix_sum[i]).\n\nBut how can I compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me expand that sum. Let's think:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{m} (prefix_sum[i +k] - prefix_sum[i]) where m = n -k.\n\nWhich equals sum_{i=0}^m prefix_sum[i +k] - sum_{i=0}^m prefix_sum[i]\n\nBut the first term is sum_{i=0}^m prefix_sum[i +k] = sum_{i=k}^{m +k} prefix_sum[i] (since when i ranges from 0 to m, i +k ranges from k to m +k, which is n -k +k = n). So that's sum_{i=k}^{n} prefix_sum[i].\n\nThe second term is sum_{i=0}^m prefix_sum[i], where m = n -k.\n\nSo the total sum is [sum_{i=k}^n prefix_sum[i]] - [sum_{i=0}^{n -k} prefix_sum",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of `k` days from a list of `n` days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of all sliding window sums of size `k` and then using this to determine the overall average.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray.\n2. **Sliding Window Sums**: Using the prefix sum array, compute the sum of all sliding windows of size `k`. This is done by leveraging the prefix sums to avoid recalculating sums from scratch for each window.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By breaking down the problem into two parts (summing prefix sums from index `k` to `n` and subtracting the sum of prefix sums from index `0` to `n-k`), we can efficiently compute the total sum of all sliding window sums in linear time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n        idx += n\n        \n        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        for i in range(n):\n            prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]\n        \n        total_windows_sum = 0\n        m = n - k\n        sum_high = sum(prefix_sum[k:n+1])\n        sum_low = sum(prefix_sum[0:m+1])\n        total_windows_sum = sum_high - sum_low\n        \n        number_of_weeks = n - k + 1\n        result = total_windows_sum / (number_of_weeks * k)\n        \n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into a list of strings for easier processing.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We build a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` is the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n3. **Summing Sliding Windows**: Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum of all sliding windows of size `k` by summing the appropriate ranges of the prefix sum array.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The total sum of all sliding window sums is divided by the product of the number of weeks and `k` to get the average sleep time per week, ensuring the result meets the required precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.",
