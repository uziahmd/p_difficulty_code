Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and track their occurrences. But since the maximum length is 100, maybe that's manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan: For each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. If no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. Iterate L from min possible (which is 1) up to the maximum possible (which is len(s)//2, but maybe even longer if overlapping is allowed). Wait, no. For example, in a string of length 5, like 'aaaaa', the maximum possible substring that can appear twice is 4 (like 'aaaa' appears starting at 0 and 1). So the maximum possible L is len(s)-1. Because for a substring of length len(s)-1, there are two positions (0 and 1) where it can start, but they can overlap.\n\nSo for L in range(len(s), 0, -1), check for each substring of length L if it occurs at least twice.\n\nOnce we find the maximum L where this is true, return it.\n\nSo for each possible L, starting from the largest possible down to 1, check all substrings of length L. For each substring, track all starting indices. If any substring has at least two starting indices, then return L as the answer.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check this?\n\nFor example, for a given L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut generating all substrings for each L and checking their counts.\n\nBut since the maximum length is 100, the total number of possible substrings for each L is O(n) where n is up to 100. So for each L, we can collect all substrings of that length, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\nSo for example, for the string 'ababa', when L is 3, the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (positions 1-3), 'aba' (positions 2-4). So 'aba' occurs twice. So we return 3.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n   create a set to track the substrings we've seen so far.\n\n   for each starting index i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr is in the set: return L\n\n       else: add substr to the set\n\n   if after checking all substrings for this L, none are found, proceed to L-1.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because for example, if a substring occurs more than once, but not in consecutive positions. But the code above would check for any occurrence. Let me think: for each substring of length L, when we process it, if we have already seen it before, then we can immediately return L as the answer. Because the first occurrence is stored in the set, and when a second occurrence is found, we can return.\n\nBut this approach would miss cases where the same substring occurs more than once, but not in the order of processing. For example, if the first occurrence is at position i, and then later at j. But when processing i, we add to the set. When processing j, we check if it's in the set. So yes, that would work.\n\nBut the problem is that for a given L, if there are multiple substrings that occur more than once, but the first occurrence of a substring is checked and added, and then the second occurrence is found. So the code would return L as soon as any such substring is found.\n\nBut in this approach, for each L, we check all possible substrings of length L. For each substring, if it's seen again, return L.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping occurrences? Well, the code would capture that. For example, in 'ababa', when L=3, the first substring is 'aba' (i=0). Then when i=2, the substring is 'aba' again. So when processing i=2, the code checks if 'aba' is in the set (it was added when i=0). So returns True.\n\nSo this approach would work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nLoop L from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   for each i in 0 to len",
