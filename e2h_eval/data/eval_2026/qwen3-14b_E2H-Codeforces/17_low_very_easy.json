He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine for each given string whether it's a prefix or a suffix of the original string. The input gives me all the improper prefixes and suffixes of some string s of length n. My job is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each of the 2n-2 input strings such that they correctly represent which are prefixes and which are suffixes. And there might be multiple valid answers, but I just need to output any one that works.\n\nHmm. So first, how do I figure out which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes? Well, the original string s has certain prefixes and suffixes. For example, for a string of length n, the prefixes are of lengths 1 to n-1, and same for suffixes. But the problem is that the input gives all these prefixes and suffixes mixed up, and I need to find a way to assign them.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since the original string s must be such that all the given strings are its prefixes or suffixes, perhaps I can find the correct s first. Once I know s, then I can check each input string to see if it's a prefix or suffix of s, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how do I find s? Because the input strings are all the prefixes and suffixes of s. So for example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be present in the input. Wait, but the input includes all prefixes and suffixes of lengths from 1 to n-1. So for example, for n=5, the input has two strings of each length from 1 to 4. But the original string s is of length 5. So the longest possible prefix is length 4, and the longest possible suffix is also length 4.\n\nBut how can I find s? Well, the original string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. Let me think: the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix (length n-1) is s[1..n-1]. So if I can find those two strings, then the original string s would be the combination of the first string's first character plus the second string. Or wait, the longest prefix is the first n-1 characters of s. The longest suffix is the last n-1 characters of s. So the original string s can be formed by taking the longest prefix (length n-1) and adding the last character of the longest suffix. Wait, because the longest suffix is s[1..n-1], so the last character of that is s[n-1], which is the last character of s. So if I have the longest prefix (s[0..n-2]) and the longest suffix (s[1..n-1]), then the original string s would be s[0..n-2] + s[n-1], where s[n-1] is the last character of the longest suffix. But how do I know which of the input strings are the longest prefix and the longest suffix?\n\nWait, the input has exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for the maximum length (n-1), there are two strings. One of them is the longest prefix, and the other is the longest suffix. So if I can find those two, then I can reconstruct the original string s.\n\nBut how? For example, suppose the original string is 'ababa' (as in the first example). The longest prefix is 'abab' (length 4), and the longest suffix is 'baba' (length 4). Then the original string is the longest prefix (abab) plus the last character of the longest suffix (a), giving 'ababa'.\n\nSo the idea is: take the two strings of length n-1. One of them is the longest prefix, the other is the longest suffix. Then, the original string s can be constructed as (longest prefix) + (last character of longest suffix). But how do I know which one is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nAlternatively, since the longest prefix and the longest suffix must overlap in some way. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must have their first n-2 characters overlapping. Wait, no. Let me think. The original string s is of length n. The longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So the longest prefix is of length n-1, and the longest suffix is of length n-1. So the longest prefix and the longest suffix share the substring s[1..n-2], which is of length n-2. So the longest prefix and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to assign each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S').\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest improper prefix and suffix of `s` are both of length `n-1`. These two strings can be used to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: Using the longest prefix and the longest suffix, we can construct the original string `s`. The original string can be formed by combining the longest prefix with the last character of the longest suffix.\n3. **Check Each Input String**: Once we have the original string `s`, we can check each input string to determine if it is a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    max_len = n - 1\n    candidates = [s for s in strings if len(s) == max_len]\n    \n    # Try each combination of the two candidates as prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Reconstruct the possible original string\n            # The original string is prefix_candidate + last char of suffix_candidate\n            possible_s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Check if the reconstructed string is consistent with all given strings\n            valid = True\n            for s in strings:\n                if len(s) > len(possible_s):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                if not (possible_s.startswith(s) or possible_s.endswith(s)):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                # Now assign P and S\n                result = []\n                for s in strings:\n                    if possible_s.startswith(s):\n                        result.append('P')\n                    else:\n                        result.append('S')\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\nmain()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Finding Longest Prefix and Suffix Candidates**: We identify the two strings of length `n-1` which are the longest improper prefixes and suffixes.\n3. **Reconstructing the Original String**: By combining the longest prefix candidate with the last character of the longest suffix candidate, we form the potential original string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: We check if the reconstructed string `s` is consistent with all given input strings, ensuring each input string is either a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n5. **Assigning 'P' and 'S'**: For each input string, we determine if it is a prefix or suffix of the reconstructed string `s` and generate the result string accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes by leveraging the properties of the original string's structure.",
