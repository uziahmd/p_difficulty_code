He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The original string s has certain prefixes and suffixes. For example, for a string of length n, there are n-1 prefixes (lengths 1 to n-1) and similarly n-1 suffixes. But Ivan gives us all these 2n-2 strings mixed up, and we have to assign each as either a prefix or a suffix. \n\nThe key here is that there must be exactly one string of each length from 1 to n-1. Also, the problem says that it's guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So our job is to find a way to assign each input string to P or S such that there exists at least one possible original string s that fits.\n\nBut how do we find that? Well, the original string s must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. So, for example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be the original string minus the last character. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is the original string minus the first character. \n\nWait, but how can we find what the original string is? Because once we know the original string, we can check which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. However, since the original string isn't given, we need to find it based on the input strings.\n\nSo here's an idea: The original string s must be such that the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) are present in the input. But since there are two strings of each length, for the length n-1, there are two options. Let me think. For example, in the first sample input, n=5, so the input includes two strings of length 4. Those are 'abab' and 'baba'. The correct original string is 'ababa', so the longest prefix is 'abab' (length 4) and the longest suffix is 'baba' (length 4). So the original string is the combination of the longest prefix plus the last character, or the longest suffix plus the first character. Wait, no. The original string s has length n. The longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, if we take the longest prefix (length n-1) and add a character to it, that would be the original string. But which character? Well, the original string's last character would be the one that makes the longest suffix. Alternatively, the original string could be the longest suffix with a character added in front. \n\nBut how can we find this? Let's think. Suppose we take the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B. Then, the original string s could be A + c, where c is the last character of s. But also, since B is a suffix of s, then B must be equal to s[1..n-1]. So, if s is A + c, then the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1] = A[1..n-2] + c. So, B must be equal to that. Therefore, B must be A[1..n-2] + c. But since A is of length n-1, A[1..n-2] is A[1:] (since n-1 -1 = n-2). So, B must be A[1:] + c. But then, since B is of length n-1, that implies that the length of A[1:] is n-2, so adding one character makes it n-1. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, if we take the two strings of length n-1, say A and B, then the original string s could be A + (last character of B), but only if B equals A[1:] + (last character of B). Wait, let me think again. Let me take A as the prefix of length n-1. Then, the original string s is A + c. Then, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1] = A[1..n-2] + c. So B must be equal to A[1..n-2] + c. But B is a string of length n-1. So, if we have B, then c is the last character of B. Therefore, the original string would be A + (last character of B). But then, B must be equal to A[1",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of `2n-2` strings, each of length from 1 to `n-1`, and we must assign each string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that fits the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix and suffix of the original string `s` will be of length `n-1`. These two strings are crucial because they help us reconstruct the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct Original String**: Using the two strings of length `n-1`, we can potentially reconstruct the original string `s`. If one of these strings is a prefix, the original string can be formed by appending the last character of the other string (which should be the suffix).\n3. **Validate and Assign Roles**: Once we have a candidate for the original string, we check all input strings to see if they are prefixes or suffixes of this candidate string. We then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n - 2]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try each candidate as prefix and the other as suffix\n    for prefix_candidate in candidates:\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[0] if candidates[1] == prefix_candidate else candidates[1]\n        # Reconstruct possible s\n        possible_s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n        # Check if the suffix_candidate is indeed a suffix of possible_s\n        if possible_s[1:] == suffix_candidate:\n            s = possible_s\n            break\n    else:\n        # If the above loop didn't find, swap them\n        for suffix_candidate in candidates:\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[0] if candidates[1] == suffix_candidate else candidates[1]\n            possible_s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            if possible_s[1:] == suffix_candidate:\n                s = possible_s\n                break\n    \n    # Now, check all input strings against s\n    result = []\n    for st in strings:\n        if s.startswith(st):\n            result.append('P')\n        elif s.endswith(st):\n            result.append('S')\n        else:\n            # This should not happen according to the problem statement\n            pass\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into individual strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Reconstructing Original String**: By checking if one candidate can be a prefix and the other a suffix, we attempt to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: Each input string is checked against the reconstructed string `s` to determine if it is a prefix or suffix, and the result is built accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes based on the constraints provided.",
