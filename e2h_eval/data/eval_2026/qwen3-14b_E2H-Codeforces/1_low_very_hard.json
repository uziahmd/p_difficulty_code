    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nLet me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For each i-th ring (starting from 1 to k), we need to find the perimeter of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that work? Because each ring is added inward, and each step reduces the dimensions by 4 in each direction? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe first ring is the outermost layer. For example, if the original plate is w x h, then the first ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4, because each corner is counted twice if you just do 2*(w + h). Wait, no. Wait, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*m + 2*(n-2). Because the top and bottom rows have n cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the top and bottom) have (m-2) cells each. So total is 2*n + 2*(m-2) = 2*(n + m - 2). Alternatively, 2*(w + h) - 4. Because 2w + 2h minus 4 (since each corner is counted twice). Wait, for example, if the rectangle is 3x3, then perimeter is 3*4 -4 = 8? Which matches the first example input. Because 3x3, first ring is 8 cells, which is the output for the first example.\n\nSo for each ring i, the dimensions are (w', h') where w' = w - 4*(i-1) and h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for the second ring, it's 2 cells away from the edge. So the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. Then the second ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that's 2 cells in from each side. Which would mean that the width and height are reduced by 2*2 = 4 each. Because for each side, you subtract 2 cells (left and right, top and bottom). So yes, for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). \n\nBut for each such rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(w' + h') -4. Wait, no. Wait, the perimeter formula for a rectangle with m rows and n columns is 2*(m + n) - 4. Because for example, 3x3 gives 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which is correct. So for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(w' + h') -4. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that each ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle. So for each i-th ring, the rectangle is (w' x h'), and the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. So for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(w' + h') -4. \n\nSo the total number of cells is the sum over i from 1 to k of [ 2*(w_i + h_i) -4 ] where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h -4*(i-1). \n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that for each i, the dimensions are valid. For example, when i increases, the w_i and h_i must be at least 1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's ≤ floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w,h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for i=1, the dimensions are w-0 and h-0. For i=2, the dimensions would be w-4 and h-4. But if min(w,h) is 3, then 3-4 would be negative. But the input constraints ensure that k is such that for all i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to check that. \n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h -4*(i-1)), and sum them all.\n\nWait, but let's test this with",
