The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nHmm, let me think about how to model each ring. For the i-th ring (starting from 1), the ring is formed by the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we calculate the number of cells in that border?\n\nRight, for any rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for the number of cells in the border (the perimeter) is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because each side has width cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. So for a rectangle of W columns and H rows, the perimeter cells would be 2*(W + H) - 4. Because for example, a 3x3 rectangle: 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which matches the first example input where output is 8 for 3 3 1.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w', h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Because the first ring is the outermost, then the next is 2 cells inward, so each step reduces the dimensions by 2 on each side. Wait, the problem statement says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) × (h - 4(i-1)). So for example, the first ring (i=1) is the border of the original rectangle. The second ring (i=2) is the border of a rectangle that's 4*(2-1) = 4 units smaller in each dimension. Wait, no, the formula says for the i-th ring, it's (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w × h. Then for i=2, it's (w-4) × (h-4). But wait, that would be the rectangle that's 2 cells inward on each side. Because each ring takes 1 cell, but the next ring is 2 cells away from the edge. So for example, the first ring is the outer edge. The second ring is two cells in, which would require that the rectangle for the second ring is (w - 2*2) × (h - 2*2) ? Wait, maybe the formula is correct. Let me think: for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w and h. For i=2, it's w-4 and h-4. Then, the perimeter of that rectangle is 2*( (w-4) + (h-4) ) - 4. Which would be 2*(w + h - 8) -4? Wait, no, the formula is 2*(W + H) - 4. So for W = w - 4*(i-1), H = h - 4*(i-1). So for each ring, the perimeter is 2*(W + H - 2). Wait, no, 2*(W + H) - 4 equals 2*(W + H - 2). So that's the same as 2*(W + H - 2).\n\nSo for each ring i, we compute 2*( (w' + h' - 2) ), where w' is w - 4*(i-1), h' is h - 4*(i-1). But wait, we need to make sure that for each i, the dimensions are valid. For example, if the original w and h are 3, then for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3. For i=2, 3 - 4*(2-1) = 3-4",
