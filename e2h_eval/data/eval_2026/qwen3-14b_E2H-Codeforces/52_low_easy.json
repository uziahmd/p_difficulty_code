Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the input is two integers, a and b. Initially, he has a candles. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take b of them to make a new one. And this new candle can be used again. So the question is to find the total number of hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he uses 4 candles. That's 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned ones are turned into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are burned out. So he can make 2 / 2 = 1 new candle. Uses that, adding 1 hour. Now, that one is burned out. But 1 is less than 2, so no more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Oh right, that's how it works.\n\nAnother example: 6 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Use them, +2. Now 2 burned. Can't make any more (since 2 <3). Wait but wait, the sample output is 8. Wait 6 + 2 = 8? Oh right. Wait, but then after the initial 6, you have 6 burned. So 6 /3 is 2. So he uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, he has 2 burned. Which is less than 3, so no more. So total 6 + 2 = 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nThe idea is:\n\nTotal hours starts at 0.\n\nWe have a certain number of candles. Each time we burn them, we add to the total hours. Then, collect the burned ones, and see how many new ones can be made. Then repeat.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nburned_candles = 0\n\nWait, but maybe we can model it as:\n\nEach time, we use all the available candles. Then, collect the burned ones, and convert them into new ones. But the process continues until there are not enough burned candles to make a new one.\n\nWait, but how to track the process.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nInitially, the total hours is a. Because each of the a candles is burned once. Then, we have a burned candles. Then, each time we can take b of them to make a new one. Each new candle adds 1 hour, and then becomes another burned candle.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nthen, while burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles\n\nSo this loop continues until burned is less than b.\n\nYes, this seems like the correct approach.\n\nLet me test with the first example.\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal starts at 4. burned is 4.\n\nloop: 4 >=2.\n\nnew_candles =4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. burned is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nAgain, 2 >=2. new_candles=2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7. burned is 0 +1 =1. Now 1 <2. So stop. Total is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal=6, burned=6.\n\nloop: 6//3=2. total=8. burned is 0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So done. Total 8. Correct.\n\nAnother example: let's say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. burned is 5. 5//5=1. total becomes 6. burned is 0 +1=1. Now 1 <5. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 5. burned=5.\n\nFirst iteration: 5//2=2. total becomes 5+2=7. burned is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nSecond iteration: 3//2=1. total becomes 8. burned is 1 +1=2.\n\nThird iteration: 2//2",
