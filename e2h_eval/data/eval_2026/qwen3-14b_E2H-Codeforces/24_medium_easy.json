She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, Luba has n tabs open, numbered 1 to n from left to right. The mouse is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs except those from l to r inclusive. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to do this. Each second she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right of the current position. \n\nHmm. The key is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closes. Let's think about the possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, the tabs that need to be closed are those outside [l, r]. So, if the current [l, r] is already the entire range, then nothing to do. Like the third example where output is 0.\n\nOtherwise, we need to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. But how?\n\nThe operations allowed are moving left/right (each takes one second), or closing all tabs to the left or right (each takes one second). But when you close tabs, the a and b (the min and max indices of unclosed tabs) change. For example, if you close tabs to the left of the current position, then the new a becomes the current position's index (since all tabs left of it are closed). Similarly for closing to the right.\n\nBut how to model this? Well, perhaps we can think about the necessary steps:\n\nWe need to close all tabs left of l and all tabs right of r. So, the problem reduces to figuring out how to reach the positions where we can perform these close operations efficiently.\n\nLet me consider the two cases: closing left and closing right.\n\nFor example, to close the tabs to the left of l, we need to have the cursor at position l, then close all to the left. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, we need to have the cursor at r, then close all to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to close both sides with fewer steps. But perhaps the optimal way is to first close one side, then the other. Or maybe not. Let's think.\n\nWait, but the order might matter. Let's say we need to close left and right. Suppose the initial position is somewhere. Let's take the first example:\n\nInput is 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The desired tabs are 2,3,4. So need to close tabs 1,5,6. How?\n\nIn the example explanation, she moves to tab 2, closes left (which would close tab 1). Then moves to 3, then 4, then closes right (closing 5 and 6). Let's count steps:\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 sec. Close left: 1 sec. Then move from 2 to 3 (1 sec?), then to 4 (another sec?), then close right (1 sec). Total 1+1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. But perhaps the minimal steps involve closing left and right in some order, and moving to the required positions.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\n- Determine whether we need to close left (if l > 1) and/or close right (if r < n).\n\nBut how to compute the steps needed for that?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider the two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: We need to close left (i.e., l > 1). So, we need to reach position l, then close left. Similarly, if we need to close right (r < n), reach position r, then close right.\n\nBut the order in which we do these steps may affect the total time.\n\nFor example, suppose we need to close left and right. Let's say the initial position is pos. Let's think about two options:\n\nOption A: Close left first, then close right.\n\nOption B: Close right first, then close left.\n\nWhich is better?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose l=2, r=4, pos=3. As in the first sample. Closing left first requires moving to l (2) from pos (3): 1 step. Then closing left (1 step). Then moving to r (4) from l (2): 2 steps. Then closing right (1 step). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which is the sample answer.\n\nIf we did option B: Close right first. To close right, we need to move to r (4) from pos (3): 1 step. Close right (1 step). Then move to l (2) from r (4): 2 steps. Close left (1 step). Total steps: 1 +1 + 2 +1 = 5 same as before. So same steps.\n\nSo in this case, order doesn't matter. But what about other scenarios?\n\nAnother example: pos is to the left of l. Let's say n=5, pos=1, l=3, r=3. So need to close left (tabs 1 and 2) and right (tabs 4 and 5). How?\n\nTo close left, need to move to l (3) first. Then close left. Then move to r (3) again? Or maybe after closing left, the a and b would be l and r. Wait, but after closing left, the a is l (since all tabs left of l are closed). Then closing right would be done by moving to r (which is 3) and closing right. But since r is 3, closing right would close tabs 4 and 5. So steps:\n\nStart at 1. Need to move to 3 (steps: 2 steps). Then close left (1 step). Then close right (1 step). Total steps: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. Alternatively, maybe we can do something else. But that seems optimal.\n\nBut another scenario: suppose pos is at 1, l=2, r=4. So need to close left (tab 1) and right (tabs 5, etc). So to close left, move to l (2) and close left (which closes tab 1). Then move to r (4) and close right. So steps: move from 1 to 2 (1 step), close left (1), then move to 4 (2 steps), close right (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5 steps.\n\nAlternatively, if we first close right. But how? Because to close right, you need to be at r (4). So moving from 1 to 4 (3 steps), close right (1). Then move to 2 (from 4, 2 steps), close left (1). Total 3+1 + 2 + 1 = 7 steps. Which is worse. So in this case, closing left first is better.\n\nSo the order matters. Therefore, we need to consider both possibilities (close left first or close right first) and choose the minimal steps.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nSo the general approach would be:\n\nIf there are no tabs to close on the left (i.e., l=1) and no tabs to close on the right (r=n), then answer is 0.\n\nElse, we need to calculate the steps required for both possible orders (left first, then right; or right first, then left) and choose the minimum.\n\nBut how to compute the steps for each scenario?\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nFirst, check if we need to close left: left_needed = (l > 1)\n\nSimilarly, right_needed = (r < n)\n\nIf neither is needed, answer is 0.\n\nIf only left is needed: then steps are the time to move to l, then close left. But wait, maybe the current position is already at l? Or perhaps even closer?\n\nWait, for example, if l is 2, and pos is 3. Then moving to l (2) takes 1 step. Then close left (1 step). So total steps 2.\n\nBut if pos is already at l, then steps are 1 (just close left).\n\nSo, for the left part: the steps required are (distance from pos to l) + 1 (for the close operation).\n\nSimilarly for the right part: steps are (distance from pos to r) + 1.\n\nBut when we have to do both left and right, the order affects the steps.\n\nBecause after closing left, the position is at l (since when you close left, you are at position l, and after that, the a becomes l, so moving is constrained between l and r. But perhaps in the problem, after closing left, the movement is within the current a and b. However, when you close left, the a becomes l, and b is still n (before closing right). Wait, no. Because closing left (tabs from a to i-1) — but when you close left, the current position is i, and you close all tabs to the left. So after that, the new a is i. So, for example, if you are at position l, and close left, then a becomes l. Then, when you want to close right, you need to move to r, but since a is l and b is n (initially). But once you close left, the a is l, and the b remains as n until you close right.\n\nBut perhaps the steps for closing left and then right would be:\n\nTime to move to l (from initial pos) + 1 (close left) + time to move from l to r (since after closing left, the current position is l, and you can move to r, but the a is l and b is n. So moving from l to r is (r - l) steps. Then close right (1 step). Total steps: (distance from pos to l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nAlternatively, if you first close right, then close left: steps are (distance from pos to r) + 1 (close right) + (distance from r to l) + 1 (close left). Which is (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l) + 2.\n\nBut what is the distance from pos to l? It's |pos - l|. Similarly for others.\n\nSo, the total steps for closing left then right is:\n\n|pos - l| + 1 (move to l and close left) + (r - l) (moving from l to r) + 1 (close right) ?\n\nWait, no. Because moving from l to r takes (r - l) steps. Because each step you can move one. So, for example, from l to r, you need (r - l) steps. Then, you close right, which is one step. So total steps for that part is (r - l) + 1.\n\nSo overall, for left then right: |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - l| + r - l + 2.\n\nSimilarly for right then left: |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1? No, wait. If you first close right, then you need to move to r, then close right. Then, you need to move to l, which is (r - l) steps. Then close left. So steps would be |pos - r| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - r| + r - l + 2.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because when you close right, the current position is r. Then, moving to l would be (r - l) steps. So yes.\n\nBut then, the total steps for both options (left then right, or right then left) would be:\n\nOption 1: left then right: steps = (distance to l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (distance to l) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nOption 2: right then left: steps = (distance to r) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (distance to r) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut then, the minimal between these two options would be the minimal of (distance to l) and (distance to r) plus (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut wait, what if the initial position is already in between l and r? For example, pos is in [l, r]. Then, moving to l or r would take steps. But maybe there's a better way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a scenario where you can close left and right in one move. Like, if you are at l, and you close left, and then close right. But that's already considered.\n\nBut what if you can close both left and right in one step? Well, no. Because closing left closes all tabs to the left of current position. Closing right closes all tabs to the right. So, if you are at position l, you can close left (which closes tabs before l). Then, you can close right (which closes tabs after l). But that would require that the current position is at l, and then you close right. But that would close all tabs after l, which includes r and beyond. But in our case, r is the upper bound. So, if r is the upper bound, then after closing left, you need to close right. So, the steps would be as discussed.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let's think of the case where l = 2, r = 4, and pos is 3. Then, the steps for option 1: distance to l is 1 (from 3 to 2). Then (r - l) is 2 (4-2). So total steps 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the sample. For option 2: distance to r is 1 (from 3 to 4), same calculation. So 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. So same result.\n\nBut what if pos is 1, l=2, r=4. Then, distance to l is 1. Option 1 steps: 1 + (4-2) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Option 2: distance to r is 3 steps (from 1 to 4). Then steps 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. So choosing option 1 is better.\n\nSo, in general, the minimal steps when both left and right need to be closed is min( (distance to l) + (r - l) + 2, (distance to r) + (r - l) + 2 ), which simplifies to (r - l) + 2 + min( distance to l, distance to r )\n\nBut wait, (r - l) + 2 is common to both options. So the minimal between the two options is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut then, what about the case when we don't need to do both? For example, if only left is needed. Then, steps are |pos - l| + 1 (move to l and close left). Similarly, if only right is needed, steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut wait, in the case of closing left, after moving to l, you can close left. That's one step. So total steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSimilarly for closing right.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nWe need to check whether we need to close left (l > 1) and/or right (r < n).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nIf left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   total_steps = (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nWait, but why is that?\n\nBecause the (r - l) is the steps to move from l to r (after closing left) or from r to l (after closing right). But in the case where you first close left, you need to move from l to r. Which is (r - l) steps. Then close right (1 step). So adding (r - l) + 1. And the steps to get to l was |pos - l| + 1 (for the close). So total steps is |pos - l| + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = |pos - l| + r - l + 2.\n\nSimilarly for the other option. So the minimal between the two options is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut in the case where you have to close both left and right, the total steps is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut how do I know that this is the correct formula?\n\nLet me take another example. Let's say n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So left_needed is true (l=2>1), right_needed is true (r=4 <5). Then, the formula says:\n\n(r - l) = 4-2=2, 2 + 2 = 4. min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) is min(1, 3) = 1. So total steps 4 + 1 = 5. Which is correct. Because moving to l (1 step), close left (1), then move to r (2 steps), close right (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: pos is 3, l=2, r=4. Then, min(|3-2|, |3-4|) is 1. (r-l) is 2. So 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which matches the first sample.\n\nSo that formula works for the case when both left and right are needed.\n\nNow, what if only left is needed?\n\nFor example, n=5, l=2, r=4. So, the right is not needed (since r=4 <5, but wait, no. r=4 is less than n=5. So right_needed is true. So that's not the case. Let's think of a case where only left is needed.\n\nSay, l=2, r=5. So n=5. So r is 5, which is equal to n. So right_needed is false. So we need to close left (tabs 1).\n\nThen, steps are |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSo, if pos is 3, then steps are |3-2| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps.\n\nBut what if pos is 1? Then steps are |1-2| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Because move to l (2) (1 step), then close left (1 step). So total 2 steps. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, if only right is needed. For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. So need to close right (tabs 4,5). Steps are |pos - r| + 1. So if pos is 3, steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nCheck whether left_needed and right_needed.\n\nIf both are needed: steps is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nIf only left is needed: steps is |pos - l| + 1\n\nIf only right is needed: steps is |pos - r| + 1\n\nIf none are needed: 0.\n\nWait, but what if the initial position is already in the correct place? For example, if l=2, r=4, pos=2. Then, steps for closing left is 0 + 1 = 1. Then, steps to move to r (4) is 2 steps, then close right (1). So total steps is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. But according to the formula for both needed, (r - l) is 2, plus 2, plus min( |pos - l| (0), |pos - r| (2) ) → 2 + 2 + 0 = 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut according to the formula, when both are needed, the steps are (r - l) + 2 + min(...). Which is indeed 2 + 2 + 0 = 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo that formula seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what about when l is 1 and r is n. Then, no steps needed. So output 0.\n\nBut what about when l=1, but r is less than n. Then, need to close right. So steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCompute left_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    return 0\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    return (r - l) + 2 + min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    return abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelse: # right_needed\n\n    return abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nBut wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → output 5.\n\nleft_needed: l=2 >1 → yes. right_needed: r=4 <6 → yes.\n\nso (r - l) = 4-2=2. 2 + 2 = 4. min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 → 1). So total 4 + 1 = 5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3 → output 1.\n\nleft_needed: l=1 → no. right_needed: r=3 <6 → yes. So steps is |3 - 3| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 2 1 5 → output 0. Because left_needed is l=1 → no. right_needed is r=5 (n=5) → no. So 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 5 1 2 4. So n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So left_needed (2>1) yes, right_needed (4<5) yes. So (4-2) is 2. 2 + 2 =4. min( |1-2|=1, |1-4|=3 → 1). total 4 +1 =5 steps. Which would be correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=4. So left_needed is no (l=2>1, but need to close left? Wait, no. Because l is 2. So the left_needed is whether there are tabs to the left of l. So, l=2, so tabs 1 are outside. So left_needed is yes (since l is 2>1). So, need to close left. But in this case, the current pos is 2. So steps for left is |2-2| + 1 = 1. Then steps for right: (r - l) is 2, 2 + 2 + min( |2-2|, |2-4|=2) → 2 + 2 + 0 → 4. So total steps 1 + 4 = 5? Or according to the formula, since both are needed, the formula returns (4-2) + 2 + min( |2-2|, |2-4| ) → 2 + 2 + 0 = 4? Wait, but that would be the case. But why?\n\nBecause according to the formula, when both are needed, the steps are (r - l) + 2 + min( ... ). So in this case, (4-2) is 2. 2 + 2 = 4. min( |2-2|, |2-4| ) is 0. So total 4 + 0 = 4 steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's see. The steps would be:\n\nOption: close left first. pos is already at l (2). So steps to move to l is 0. Close left (1 step). Then move from l (2) to r (4) → 2 steps. Close right (1 step). Total 0 +1 + 2 +1 = 4 steps. Which is correct. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo the code logic seems to hold.\n\nBut what about when l is 1 and r is n? Then, no steps needed. So code returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, pos=1, l=1, r=3. Output is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=1, l=1, r=2. Then, right_needed is r=2 <3. So steps is |1 - 2| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Let's see: move from 1 to 2 (1 step), close right (1 step). Total 2 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=1, l=2, r=2. So need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 3). So steps: (r - l) is 0. 0 + 2 + min( |1-2|, |1-2| ) → 0 + 2 + 1 = 3 steps. Let's see:\n\nOption: move to l (2) (1 step), close left (1 step). Then move to r (2) (0 steps), close right (1 step). Total 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 steps. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nThe code needs to read four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCompute left_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nThen, based on the conditions above.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is n? Then, no steps needed. So code returns 0.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r is less than n? Then, need to close right. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nleft_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_needed = (r < n)\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    steps = (r - l) + 2 + min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\n    print(steps)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    print( abs(pos - l) + 1 )\n\nelse:\n\n    print( abs(pos - r) + 1 )\n\nWait, but what if l is 1 and r is n? Then, both left_needed and right_needed are false. So output 0. Correct.\n\nBut let's check the sample input 2:\n\nSample input 2: 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. n=6. So right_needed is r < n → 3 < 6 → yes. So code will go to elif left_needed and right_needed?\n\nWait, left_needed is l > 1? l is 1, so left_needed is false. So code goes to else clause (right_needed is true). So steps is abs(3 - 3) + 1 → 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=5, n=5. So right_needed is false (r=5 =n). left_needed is false. So output 0.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=5, n=6. So right_needed is true. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when l is 1 and r is less than n. For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. So need to close right. So steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3. So right_needed is 3 <5 → yes. steps is |3-3| +1 = 1. Which is correct: close right (from pos 3, close right, which closes 4 and 5. So one step.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's test the sample input 2 again. Input is 6 3 1 3. The code:\n\nleft_needed is 1>1? No. right_needed is 3 <6 → yes. So code goes to else clause (right_needed). So steps is |3 -3| + 1 → 1. Correct.\n\nSample input 1: 6 3 2 4. left_needed is 2>1 → yes. right_needed is 4 <6 → yes. So steps is (4-2) +2 + min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) → 2 + 2 + 1 → 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5. So left_needed is false, right_needed is false. Output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=4. So right_needed is yes. steps is |2-4| +1 = 2 +1=3. So steps: move from 2 to 4 (2 steps), close right (1 step). Total 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead input: the input is a single line with four integers. But the examples show that there are multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as a single line of input, but in the sample input, there are three lines. Wait, no. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user provided the following input examples:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says:\n\n\"The only line of input contains four integer numbers ...\"\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines. Oh, perhaps the user provided multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case. So perhaps the original problem is for a single test case, and the sample input is three different test cases, each on their own line. But the code needs to read one line of input.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo, the code should read from stdin, process one line of input, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one test case per run.\n\nSo, the code should read a single line of input, split into four integers.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the line, split into four integers, then compute.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as per the logic above.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    steps = (r - l) + 2 + min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\n    print(steps)\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    print( abs(pos - l) + 1 )\n\nelse:\n\n    print( abs(pos - r) + 1 )\n\nBut wait, let's test this code with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 6 3 2 4 → output 5. Let's compute.\n\nleft_needed: 2>1 → True.\n\nright_needed: 4 <6 → True.\n\nsteps = (4-2) + 2 + min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 ) → 2 + 2 + 1 → 5. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: 6 3 1 3 → output 1.\n\nleft_needed: 1>1? No. right_needed: 3 <6 → yes. So code goes to else clause (right_needed). steps is |3-3| +1 = 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 5 2 1 5 → left_needed is 1>1? No. right_needed is 5 <5? No. So print 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So code returns (4-2) +2 + min( |1-2|=1, |1-4|=3) → 2+2+1=5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=4. left_needed is 2>1 → yes. right_needed is 4<5 → yes. steps: (4-2) +2 + min( |2-2|=0, |2-4|=2) → 2 + 2 +0 =4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=1, l=2, r=2. left_needed is yes, right_needed is yes. steps: (2-2) +2 + min( |1-2|=1, |1-2|=1) → 0 +2 +1=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs except those within a specified range [l, r]. The solution involves efficiently moving the cursor and closing tabs to minimize the time spent.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` (i.e., `l > 1`) and/or to the right of `r` (i.e., `r < n`).\n2. **No Tabs to Close**: If neither left nor right tabs need to be closed, the answer is 0.\n3. **Only Left Tabs to Close**: If only left tabs need to be closed, calculate the time to move the cursor to `l` and close the tabs to the left.\n4. **Only Right Tabs to Close**: If only right tabs need to be closed, calculate the time to move the cursor to `r` and close the tabs to the right.\n5. **Both Left and Right Tabs to Close**: Calculate the minimum time required by considering both possible orders (closing left first or right first) and choosing the optimal path.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\nleft_needed = l > 1\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif not left_needed and not right_needed:\n    print(0)\nelif left_needed and right_needed:\n    steps = (r - l) + 2 + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))\n    print(steps)\nelif left_needed:\n    print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\nelse:\n    print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Tabs to Close**: Check if there are tabs to close on the left (`l > 1`) and/or on the right (`r < n`).\n- **No Tabs to Close**: Directly return 0 if no tabs need closing.\n- **Only Left Tabs to Close**: Calculate the time to move the cursor to `l` and close the left tabs.\n- **Only Right Tabs to Close**: Calculate the time to move the cursor to `r` and close the right tabs.\n- **Both Tabs to Close**: Compute the minimum time by considering both possible paths (closing left first or right first) and using the shortest distance from the current position to either `l` or `r`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum time required by leveraging the shortest path calculations and considering both possible sequences of operations.",
