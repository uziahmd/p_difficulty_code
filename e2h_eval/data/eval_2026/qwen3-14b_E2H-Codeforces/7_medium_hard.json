    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a certain way, and I need to find out the conditions under which such a graph can exist.\n\nLet me first understand the structure of the snowflake. According to the description:\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so those leaves) are each connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. \n\nSo the process is like building layers. Let's think about how the number of vertices grows with each step.\n\nLet me think of it as layers. The first layer is the root (1 node). Then, the first expansion adds k children to the root. Now, each of those k nodes is a leaf. Then, in the next step, each of those leaves gets k new children. So each time, we add more layers. But the process requires that the step of adding new children to leaves is done at least once. So the minimum snowflake would have two layers: the root and the first layer. Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step of adding to leaves is done once. So for example, if we do the first expansion (adding k children), then for each of those leaves, we add k children. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k*k. But wait, the problem says that the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have two expansions: the initial step (adding k children), then expanding each leaf once. So the minimal n would be 1 + k + k^2. For example, when k=4, the minimal is 1 +4 + 16 = 21? But the example given in the problem says that the minimal for k=4 is shown in the figure. However, the sample input includes n=13 as a possible case. Let's see. Let me check the sample input.\n\nIn the sample input, for n=13, the answer is YES. Let's think. How can 13 be formed?\n\nLet me think about the general formula for the number of nodes. Let's say that the snowflake has m layers. Wait, maybe the structure is such that each time you expand, you add a new layer. Let me think recursively.\n\nThe initial node is layer 0. Then, layer 1 is the first expansion: k nodes. Then, each node in layer 1 is expanded to add k nodes (layer 2). Then, each node in layer 2 is expanded to add k nodes (layer 3), etc. But the process requires that the expansion is done at least once. So the minimal case is when there are two layers (the initial step plus one expansion). Wait, but the first expansion is adding k nodes (layer 1), then the second step is expanding each of those k nodes, adding k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k^2. But for the case where there's only one expansion (the first step), then the total is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding to leaves (i.e., expanding) must be done at least once. So the first expansion (adding k nodes) is part of the initial construction, and then the second step (expanding those leaves) is required. So the minimal number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. But then, what about if there are more layers? Like, after expanding layer 1 to layer 2, then expanding layer 2 to layer 3, etc. So for m layers (where m >= 2?), the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m ?\n\nWait, no. Because each expansion is done on all the leaves. Let me think again. Let's model the snowflake as follows:\n\n- The snowflake is built in stages. The first stage is the root. Then, each stage adds new nodes by expanding all current leaves.\n\nBut the rules are:\n\nInitially, there's one node. Then, we add k nodes connected to the root. Then, each node that is a leaf (connected to only one other) is connected to k new nodes. This step must be done at least once. So the first expansion (adding k nodes) is the first step. Then, the second step (expanding each of those leaves) is required. So the total number of nodes after two steps is 1 +k +k*k. But if there are more steps, like after expanding the leaves again, then for each step, the number of new nodes added is k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step.\n\nBut the leaves in each step are the ones added in the previous step. For example:\n\n- Stage 0: 1 node (root). Leaves: 1 node (root is connected to zero nodes, but maybe not? Wait, the root is connected to k nodes in the first step. So during the initial step, the root is not a leaf. Let's think about the process:\n\nInitial state: 1 node (root). It's a leaf? Well, since it has zero edges. But according to the rules, the first step is adding k nodes connected to the root. Then, the root has degree k, so it's not a leaf. The k nodes added in the first step are leaves (each connected to only one node, the root). Then, the second step is to connect each of these leaves to k new nodes. So each of those k leaves is now connected to one node (the root) plus k new nodes. So after the second step, those leaves are no longer leaves. The new nodes added in the second step are leaves. So the third step would expand those leaves again, adding k nodes per each of them.\n\nSo the number of nodes depends on how many times we perform the expansion steps. Let's denote the number of expansion steps as s. The initial step (adding k children to the root) is required, and then we must perform at least one expansion step (s ≥ 1). So the total number of nodes can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet me think of the expansion steps as levels. Let's define the number of expansion steps as m. For example:\n\n- m = 0: only the root. But according to the problem, the initial step is required (adding k children), so m cannot be 0. Wait, no. The initial step is part of the construction. The problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the expansion step (connecting each leaf to k new nodes) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when the expansion step is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 (root) + k (from first step) + k * k (from the expansion step). So that's 1 +k +k^2. \n\nIf we do another expansion step, then the nodes added in the second expansion step are the leaves from the previous step. The previous step added k^2 nodes. Each of those is a leaf. So the next expansion step would add k^3 nodes. So the total number of nodes would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. But the expansion steps can be done multiple times. So for m expansion steps (with m ≥ 1), the total number of nodes is 1 +k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). Wait, let me think again. \n\nThe initial step (adding k nodes) is the first part. Then, the expansion steps are done m times. Let's think of the total number of nodes as:\n\nTotal = 1 (root) + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} (k^i) ? No. Wait, the first expansion (adding k nodes) is the first level. Then, each expansion step adds k times the number of leaves from the previous step. So the first expansion step (after the initial) adds k^1 nodes. Then, the next expansion adds k^2 nodes. Then, the next adds k^3 nodes, etc. So if there are m expansion steps, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1}? No. Wait, initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the first expansion step adds k * k = k^2 nodes. Then the next expansion step adds k * k^2 = k^3. So for m expansion steps, the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^{m+1}? Wait, no. The initial step is 1 node, then adding k nodes (so total 1 +k). Then, the first expansion step adds k^2 nodes (total 1 +k +k^2). Then the next expansion step adds k^3 nodes (total 1 +k +k^2 +k^3). So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i ?\n\nWait, no. Because the initial step is the first addition of k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds another layer. For example:\n\nNumber of expansion steps (s) can be 1 or more. Let me think:\n\ns=1: initial step (adding k nodes) and then one expansion step (adding k^2 nodes). Total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\ns=2: initial step, then expansion step 1 (k^2), then expansion step 2 (k^3). Total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{s+1} k^i ?\n\nNo. Because for s expansion steps, the sum is k + k^2 + ... +k^{s+1}? No, because initial step is k, then expansion steps add k^2, k^3, etc. So for s expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s+1}? No, wait:\n\nThe initial step adds k nodes. Then each expansion step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. The leaves after the initial step are k nodes. After the first expansion step, those k leaves are replaced by k *k new leaves. So the next expansion step adds k * k^2 = k^3 nodes. So the sum for the expansion steps is k (from initial step) + k^2 (first expansion) + k^3 (second expansion) + ... + k^{s+1} (after s expansion steps). Wait, no. Because the initial step is part of the structure. So the total number of nodes is 1 (the root) plus the sum of all added nodes. The added nodes are:\n\n- First step: k nodes.\n\n- Then, for each expansion step, we add k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. Since each expansion step adds new leaves, and the number of leaves is k^i for the i-th expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of nodes can be represented as follows:\n\nLet’s think of the snowflake as having a certain depth. The root is depth 0. Then, the first expansion (adding k children) creates depth 1. Then, each expansion step increases the depth by 1. The number of nodes added at depth d is k^d. But the initial step is depth 1, and then expansion steps add depths 2, 3, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{d=1}^m k^d, where m is the maximum depth. However, the problem states that the expansion steps must be done at least once. Which implies that m must be at least 2. Because the initial step is adding depth 1, and then expansion steps add depth 2. So for m=2, the total is 1 +k +k^2. For m=3, it's 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc.\n\nWait, but the initial step is adding depth 1. Then, the expansion steps are done once (adding depth 2) or more. So the maximum depth is m, where m ≥ 2. Therefore, the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{d=1}^m k^d. Which equals 1 + (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1). Because the sum from d=1 to m of k^d is (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1).\n\nAlternatively, the sum from d=0 to m of k^d is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So subtracting the d=0 term (which is 1) gives us sum from d=1 to m of k^d is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) - 1 = (k^{m+1} -1 - (k-1))/(k-1) ) = (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1).\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + [k^{m+1} -k]/(k-1) = [ (k-1) + k^{m+1} -k ]/(k-1) ) = [k^{m+1} -1 ]/(k-1) - 1 + 1? Wait, no. Let me re-calculate:\n\nOriginal total nodes is 1 + sum_{d=1}^m k^d. Which equals 1 + [sum_{d=0}^m k^d - 1] = sum_{d=0}^m k^d = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). Wait, that's interesting. Because sum_{d=0}^m k^d is equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So the total number of nodes is exactly that. Because the initial step plus all the expansion steps is equivalent to sum_{d=0}^m k^d. But how?\n\nWait, the root is 1 node. Then, the sum from d=1 to m of k^d is the number of nodes added in each level. So total nodes is 1 + sum_{d=1}^m k^d = sum_{d=0}^m k^d. Which is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But for this to be valid, the maximum depth m must be at least 1. Because the initial step (adding depth 1) is required. However, the problem says that the expansion steps must be done at least once. Which implies that the maximum depth m must be at least 2. Because the expansion steps are done once (adding depth 2). So m must be ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but if m is 1, then the total nodes would be sum_{d=0}^1 k^d = 1 +k. But according to the problem's rules, the expansion steps must be done at least once. Which means that the initial step (adding k nodes) is followed by an expansion step. Which would require m to be 2. Because the expansion step adds depth 2. So for the snowflake to be valid, m must be ≥ 2. Hence, the total number of nodes is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2. Wait, but m is the maximum depth. Let me re-express:\n\nThe snowflake is constructed as follows:\n\n- Start with root (depth 0).\n\n- Add k children to root (depth 1). This is the initial step.\n\n- Then, perform expansion steps. Each expansion step adds children to all leaves (current leaves are the nodes added in the previous step). Each expansion step increases the depth by 1.\n\nSo the expansion steps are done at least once. So after the initial step, we do at least one expansion step. So the maximum depth is at least 2. Thus, the total number of nodes is sum_{d=0}^m k^d, where m ≥ 2.\n\nSo for any n, it must be possible to write it as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where k ≥ 2, m ≥ 2. Or wait, maybe m is the number of expansion steps. Let me recheck.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of nodes is (k^s -1)/(k-1), where s ≥ 3. Because:\n\nFor example, when m is the number of expansion steps, which must be ≥1. Then the total number of nodes is sum_{d=0}^{m+1} k^d? No, earlier analysis said that sum_{d=0}^m k^d equals the total nodes, and that m is the maximum depth. For example, if the maximum depth is 2 (so two layers of expansion steps?), then the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So yes, the formula is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m is the maximum depth. And since the expansion steps must be done at least once, the maximum depth is at least 2, so m ≥2. Therefore, the total number of nodes is (k^{s} -1)/(k-1) where s ≥3. Because m+1 = s. So s is the exponent. For example, when s=3, the formula gives (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. Which matches our earlier example.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^s -1)/(k-1), where k ≥2, s ≥3. But wait, what about other possibilities? Are there other ways to construct the snowflake?\n\nWait, the snowflake is built by adding layers. For example, after the initial step and one expansion step (s=3, m=2), the total is 1 +k +k^2. But what if we have more expansion steps? For example, adding another expansion step (so s=4, m=3). Then the total is (k^4 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the problem is to check if n can be written as (k^s -1)/(k-1), where k≥2, s≥3. Also note that for s=2, the formula would give (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would be the case when the snowflake has only the initial step (adding k nodes) and no expansion steps. But according to the problem's rules, the expansion steps must be done at least once. Therefore, s must be ≥3. So the allowed values of n are numbers that can be written in the form (k^s -1)/(k-1) for integers k≥2 and s≥3.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given n, check whether there exists integers k≥2 and s≥3 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) = n. If such k and s exist, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nFirst, note that (k^s -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1}. So for example, when s=3, it's 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo for each test case n, we need to check if there exists k≥2 and s≥3 such that the sum equals n.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for a given n, whether such k and s exist.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nApproach:\n\nFor each n, iterate over possible s (starting from 3 up to some maximum value), and for each s, check if there exists a k≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to find an efficient way to check this.\n\nLet me think about the possible range of s. For a fixed s, the minimal value of the sum is when k=2. So for s, the minimal sum is 1 +2 +2^2 + ... +2^{s-1} = 2^s -1. For example, when s=3, the minimal sum is 1+2+4=7. So for a given n, the maximum possible s is log_2(n+1). Since for s=3, the minimal sum is 7, for s=4 it's 15, etc. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum s is about 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18).\n\nSo for each n, we can iterate s from 3 up to log_2(n) + 1. For each s, we can check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nNow, for each s, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} = n. Let's denote this sum as f(k, s) = (k^s -1)/(k-1). We need to solve for k ≥2, integer, such that f(k,s) =n.\n\nSo for each s, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for fixed s, f(k,s) is strictly increasing with k. For example, for s=3, f(k,3)=1 +k +k². As k increases, this increases. So for a given s, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... upper_bound], and check if there exists a k such that f(k,s)=n.\n\nBut how to compute upper bound for k for each s?\n\nFor fixed s, the minimal value of f(k,s) is when k=2, which is 2^s -1. The maximal possible k for which f(k,s) ≤n is such that k^{s-1} ≤n. Because the sum is at least k^{s-1} (since 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} ≥k^{s-1} for k≥2 and s≥3). So for example, k^{s-1} ≤n → k ≤ n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nTherefore, for each s, the upper bound for k is around n^(1/(s-1)). Since s can be up to 60, for n up to 1e18, the upper bound for k is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n is less than 7 (the minimal possible value for s=3, k=2: 1+2+4=7), then output NO.\n\nElse:\n\n- For each possible s from 3 up to max_s (which can be found as the maximum s for which 2^s -1 <=n), do the following:\n\n   - Check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\n   - To check this, perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (as discussed).\n\n   - If for any s and k, this equation holds, return YES.\n\nIf after checking all possible s and k, no solution is found, return NO.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, and t up to 1e4, we need to make sure that this approach is efficient enough.\n\nLet's think about the maximum possible s for each n. For example, for n=1e18, the maximum possible s is such that 2^s -1 ≤n. Let's compute log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60. So for each n, the maximum s is up to 60. So for each test case, we loop s from 3 to 60. For each s, perform a binary search on k. For each binary search, the number of steps is O(log (upper_bound)), which for s up to 60, upper_bound is up to (1e18)^(1/(s-1)). For s=3, upper_bound is sqrt(1e18) = 1e9, which would take about 30 steps. For larger s, upper_bound is smaller. So for each test case, the total steps would be about 60 * 30 = 1800 steps. For t=1e4, this is 1.8e7 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute f(k,s) for given k and s. But since k can be up to 1e9 and s up to 60, computing k^s could be a problem for very large exponents. However, since we are comparing f(k,s) with n, which is up to 1e18, we can compute f(k,s) incrementally and check if it exceeds n during the computation to avoid overflow.\n\nAlternatively, for a given k and s, compute the sum 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1}.\n\nBut for large exponents, even for k=2 and s=60, the sum is 2^60 -1, which is about 1e18, which is manageable as a 64-bit integer. So in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nSo the steps for each s and binary search for k:\n\nFor a given s, the function f(k,s) = sum_{i=0}^{s-1} k^i = (k^s -1)/(k-1). But for the purposes of checking equality with n, perhaps it's easier to compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow.\n\nBut for binary search, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor i in 0 to s-1:\n\n   total += k^i\n\nBut for large exponents, this could be expensive. However, since s is up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, compute the sum using the formula (k^s -1) // (k-1). But this requires that k !=1, which is true here since k≥2.\n\nBut we need to be careful with possible overflows. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so this isn't a problem.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking whether the sum equals n, perhaps using the formula is better. However, when k is large, even for s=3, the formula (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. Which is easy to compute.\n\nSo for a given k and s, compute the formula (k^s -1) // (k-1) and compare with n.\n\nBut how to compute k^s? For example, if s is 60 and k is 1e9, then k^s is 1e540, which is way beyond even 1e18. However, during the binary search, we can check if the computed value exceeds n and adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, but during binary search, for a given k and s, we need to compute the sum. If the sum is larger than n, we can adjust the binary search accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute the sum without overflowing? Well, in Python, it's not a problem, but for efficiency, perhaps we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nLet me think. For example, for a given k and s, compute the sum step by step. Start with term = 1 (for i=0), then add term *=k for each next term. For each step, add to the total. If at any point the total exceeds n, we can break early and return that the sum is larger than n.\n\nThis is important because for large k and s, the sum could be way larger than n. So during the calculation, we can check if the sum exceeds n and break early.\n\nSo here's a helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current_term = 1\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current_term\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current_term *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut this is for s steps. For example, for s=3, the loop runs 3 times, adding 1, then k, then k^2.\n\nSo for a given k and s, compute_sum returns the sum. If it's larger than n, returns infinity, else returns the actual sum.\n\nThis is useful during binary search.\n\nSo during binary search for a particular s, for a candidate k, we can compute the sum and check if it's equal to n.\n\nNow, for each s, the binary search for k:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = upper_bound (which can be determined as something like n^(1/(s-1)) )\n\nBut how to compute upper_bound?\n\nWell, for the sum to be equal to n, the sum must be at least k^{s-1} (since the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} ≥k^{s-1} for k≥2, s≥3). So k^{s-1} ≤n → k ≤ n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nBut since k is integer ≥2, we can set high to be floor(n^(1/(s-1))) +1. However, calculating n^(1/(s-1)) can be done via binary search or via taking the integer part of the exponent.\n\nBut in Python, we can use the math.pow function, but for very large exponents, we can use binary search to find the upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, for binary search, we can start with low=2 and high=2, and double high until compute_sum(high, s, n) >=n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute an initial upper bound for k as follows:\n\nThe maximum possible k for a given s is when the sum is equal to n. Since the sum is at least k^{s-1}, so k^{s-1} ≤n → k ≤n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nSo for example, for s=3, the upper bound is sqrt(n).\n\nBut in Python, we can calculate this as int(n ** (1/(s-1))) + 2. However, due to floating point inaccuracies, this might not be precise, but for the purposes of binary search, we can set high to something like 2, and then keep doubling until compute_sum(high, s, n) exceeds n.\n\nSo here's the plan for each s:\n\nFor a given s, find the minimal and maximal possible k.\n\nInitialize low=2, high=2.\n\nWhile compute_sum(high, s, n) <n:\n\n   high *=2\n\nOnce we have a high that gives sum >=n, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut during the binary search, for mid, compute the sum. If sum <n, move low up. Else, move high down. If during the process, the sum equals n, return True.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the sum is exactly n?\n\nSo for each s, perform this binary search. If any of the s's yields a valid k, return YES.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6\n\n13\n\n15\n\n255\n\n10101\n\n1000000000000000000\n\nSample Output:\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nLet's take n=13. For which s and k?\n\nCheck for s=3: sum is 1 +k +k^2 =13 →k^2 +k +1 =13 →k^2 +k -12=0 →k=(-1 ±sqrt(1+48))/2 → sqrt(49)=7 → ( -1 +7)/2= 3. So k=3. So yes. So for s=3, k=3, sum is 1+3+9=13. So YES.\n\nAnother example is n=15. For s=3, 1 +k +k^2=15 →k^2 +k -14=0 →k=( -1 + sqrt(1+56 )) /2 → sqrt(57) is ~7.5 → (6.5)/2=3.25. Not integer. So no. What about s=4? sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =15. Let's try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes! So s=4, k=2. So 15 is valid.\n\nSo for n=15, answer is YES.\n\nAnother example is n=255. Let's see. 255 can be written as 2^8 -1 = 255. So (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. Which is sum from i=0 to 7 of 2^i. So s=8. So yes. So for s=8, k=2, sum is 255. So answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000. The output is NO. Let's think why. Maybe there's no k and s for which the sum equals that number.\n\nNow, let's think about how to code this.\n\nFirst, for each test case n:\n\nif n <7: return NO.\n\nElse:\n\nloop s from 3 to max_s (say, up to 60, since for s=60, 2^s is 1e18, but 2^60 is about 1.15e18. So for n up to 1e18, s can go up to 60.)\n\nfor each s in 3 to max_s:\n\n   compute the possible k via binary search.\n\nSo how to compute max_s? For example, for n=1e18, the maximum s is when k=2. So 2^s -1 <=n → s_max is about log2(n+1). For n=1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60.\n\nSo for each n, the max_s can be computed as the maximum s where 2^s -1 <=n. But since for each test case, we can just loop s up to 60, even if some of those s's are not possible.\n\nSo in code, for each n, loop s from 3 to 60:\n\nfor s in range(3, 61):\n\n   check if possible.\n\nNow, for each s, perform the binary search for k.\n\nImplementing the helper function compute_sum(k, s, n):\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(s):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, for big exponents, this could be slow? Well, for s up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nNow, for each s:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, s, n) < n:\n\n    high *=2\n\nOnce we have high, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut during the binary search, for mid, compute the sum. If it's equal to n, return True.\n\nBut there's a possibility that the sum could be exactly n. So during the binary search, for each mid, check if compute_sum(mid, s, n) ==n.\n\nBut how to handle cases where compute_sum returns infinity? For example, when mid is too big, the sum exceeds n, so we can adjust the binary search accordingly.\n\nSo the binary search steps:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = initial_high (found by doubling)\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n    val = compute_sum(mid, s, n)\n\n    if val ==n:\n\n        return True\n\n    elif val <n:\n\n        low = mid +1\n\n    else:\n\n        high = mid -1\n\nIf after the binary search, no value is found, proceed to next s.\n\nBut what about when compute_sum returns infinity? For example, when mid is too big, the sum exceeds n. So in that case, we treat it as val >n.\n\nSo the code for the binary search part would work.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase n=7: s=3, k=2. 1+2+4=7. So YES.\n\nCase n=15: as discussed, s=4, k=2.\n\nAnother case: n=31. For s=5, k=2: 1+2+4+8+16=31. So YES.\n\nWhat about n=3? It's less than 7, so output is NO.\n\nAnother case: n= 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^s. For example, for s=3 and k=2, 7. For s=3 and k=3, 13. For s=3 and k=4, 1+4+16=21.\n\nSo the code would find these.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting with a root node and expanding iteratively. The key insight is to check if `n` can be represented in the form of a geometric series sum for some integers `k ≥ 2` and `s ≥ 3`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one node and expands iteratively. The number of nodes after `s` expansions can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: $ (k^s - 1) / (k - 1) $, where `k` is the number of children each node gets in each expansion step and `s` is the number of such steps.\n\n2. **Constraints Check**: For each test case, check if `n` can be expressed in the form of the geometric series sum for any valid `k` and `s`.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: For each possible value of `s` (from 3 up to a reasonable maximum, say 60), perform a binary search on `k` to check if there exists an integer `k` such that the sum equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(s):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return float('inf')\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_s = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for s in range(3, max_s + 1):\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        while compute_sum(high, s, n) < n:\n            high *= 2\n        # Binary search between low and high\n        left = 2\n        right = high\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            val = compute_sum(mid, s, n)\n            if val == n:\n                return True\n            elif val < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum Function**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series for given `k`, `s`, and `n`. It stops early if the sum exceeds `n` to avoid unnecessary computations.\n- **is_possible Function**: This function checks for each possible `s` (from 3 to 60) whether there exists an integer `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`. It uses binary search to efficiently find such `k`.\n- **Main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case, and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on whether the number of vertices can form a valid snowflake graph.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible values of `s` and `k` within feasible limits, leveraging binary search for optimal performance even for large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
