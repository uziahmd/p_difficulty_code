The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake graph as defined. Let's think about the structure of such a graph.\n\nThe snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the construction steps again. \n\nInitially, there's one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must each get k new vertices connected to them. And this process is repeated at least once. Wait, the problem says that each vertex connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. And this step should be done at least once. So the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, for each of those children (which are leaves), we add k more children. But this step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. Wait, maybe the process is that after the initial step, we perform some number of expansions. Let me think of it as levels.\n\nLet me model the snowflake's structure. The snowflake is a tree, since all edges are added in a way that each new node is connected to exactly one parent. So the structure is a tree.\n\nLet me think about how the number of nodes grows with each step. Let's consider the example given. For k=4, the smallest snowflake. The initial node is 1. Then, step 1 adds 4 nodes. Now, each of those 4 nodes is a leaf. Then, each of those must be expanded by adding k=4 nodes. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? But the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe the expansion steps are done in a certain way. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe construction steps:\n\n- Start with one vertex.\n\n- Then, connect it to k new vertices (so now there are 1 + k nodes).\n\n- Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So after the initial step, we do this step once. So for example, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the next step is adding k children to each of those k nodes. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k * k = 1 +k +k². But for the example input, n=13. Let's see: 1 +k +k² =13. Let's check for k=3: 1+3+9=13. So yes. That would be the case where k=3 and the expansion was done once. So that's why n=13 is a yes.\n\nSo the snowflake can be constructed in different ways. The question is, given n, can we find some k>1 and some number of expansion steps such that the total number of nodes equals n.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's think about the process as building layers. The root is layer 0. Then, layer 1 consists of the k children of the root. Then, each node in layer 1 has k children in layer 2. Then each node in layer 2 has k children in layer 3, etc. But the expansion steps must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step is adding the first layer. Then, the expansion steps (adding layers) must be done at least once. So the minimum number of layers is 2. Because the initial step (layer 1) is added, then the expansion step (layer 2) is done once. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. But also, perhaps the expansion steps can be done multiple times. For example, if we have layers up to m, then the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. Wait, no. Wait, each expansion step adds a new layer. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step: layer 0 (root) has 1 node. Then, layer 1 has k nodes. Then, for each node in layer 1, we add k children. So layer 2 has k * k = k² nodes. Then, if we do another expansion step (adding layer 3), each node in layer 2 would get k children, so layer 3 has k³ nodes. And so on. However, the expansion step (adding new layers) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two layers (layers 0 and 1, but then the expansion step is done once, adding layer 2). Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. \n\nSo the initial step is adding layer 1 (k nodes). Then, the step of adding k new nodes to each leaf (which are the nodes in layer 1) is done once. So that's layer 2. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. \n\nBut what if after that, we do more steps? Like, for example, after adding layer 2, we can again take all leaves (layer 2 nodes) and add k children to each. Then the total is 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on. But the expansion step (the step of adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when the expansion step is done once (so layers up to 2). But the expansion steps can be done more than once. \n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m, where m >= 2? Or wait, let me think again. \n\nThe initial step is adding the first layer (layer 1) with k nodes. Then, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) is done once. Which adds layer 2. Then, if we do another expansion step, adding k children to each leaf (layer 2 nodes) which gives layer 3. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of layers minus 1. But how many times is the expansion step done?\n\nThe initial step (adding the first layer) is required. Then, the expansion step (adding new layers) is done at least once. So the total number of layers is at least 2 (layers 0, 1, 2). So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. But if the expansion step is done again, then it's 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc. \n\nSo the general formula for the number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >= 2. Wait, no. Because the expansion steps are done once or more. Let me think again. The first expansion (after the initial step) is done once. So for example, m is the number of layers. Let me model this as follows:\n\nThe initial step adds layer 1. Then, the expansion steps are done t times. Each expansion step adds a new layer. So for t=1, we have layers 0, 1, 2. For t=2, layers 0,1,2,3. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{t+1} k^i} - 1? Wait, no. Because the initial sum is 1 (layer 0) plus k (layer 1) plus k^2 (layer 2) plus ... up to k^{t+1}? No. Let me think again. \n\nThe sum S is 1 (root) + k (layer 1) + k^2 (layer 2) + ... + k^m (layer m). The expansion steps are done (m-1) times. Because the initial step (adding layer 1) is done once. Then, the expansion steps (adding layers 2, 3, etc.) are done (m-1) times. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So m-1 >= 1 → m >= 2. Thus, the total number of nodes is S = sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m >= 2. Wait, no. Because sum_{i=0}^m k^i = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. But in this case, the initial step (adding layer 1) is part of the process. So for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is correct. For m=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the possible values of n are numbers that can be written as sum_{i=0}^m k^i, for some integer m ≥ 2 and integer k ≥ 2. \n\nWait, but what if the expansion steps are not done for all layers? For example, maybe after adding layer 1, you add layer 2 once, but then stop. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Or you could add layer 1, then layer 2, then layer 3. So sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^m - 1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥ 2 and m ≥ 2. Wait, because sum_{i=0}^m k^i is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). Wait, no. Wait, the sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). But according to our earlier analysis, the snowflake can be constructed as this sum, where m+1 is the number of layers? Or perhaps m is the number of layers. Let me recheck:\n\nIf m is the number of layers, then the sum is from i=0 to m-1. For example, layers 0, 1, 2 (m=3 layers) → sum is 1 +k +k^2 = sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So for the snowflake, the total number of nodes is (k^{m} - 1)/(k-1), where m is the number of layers. But the expansion steps must be done at least once. Which implies that m ≥ 2. Because the initial step (adding layer 1) and then the expansion step (adding layer 2) is done once. So m is the number of layers, which is at least 2. Wait, no. Let me think again. For m layers, the sum is (k^m - 1)/(k-1). But when m=1, that's (k^1 -1)/(k-1) = 1. Which is the initial state (only root). But the problem requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. So the minimal m is 2 (layers 0 and 1?), no. Wait, the initial step is adding layer 1. Then, the expansion step (adding layer 2) is done once. So the total layers are 0,1,2. So m is 3? Or m is the exponent. \n\nThis seems confusing. Let me rephrase. The snowflake can be represented as a tree where each node except the leaves has exactly k children. The root has k children. Each node in layer 1 has k children. Each node in layer 2 has k children, etc. But the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the tree must have at least two layers of children. For example, the root (layer 0) has k children (layer 1). Each of those has k children (layer 2). So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So here, m is 3 (the exponent in the numerator). So in general, the total number of nodes is (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 3? Or m ≥ 2?\n\nWait, let's take m as the number of layers. So for the minimal case (layers 0, 1, 2), the number of layers is 3. So m=3. Then the sum is 1 +k +k^2 = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So for the general case, the number of nodes is (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 3? Or m ≥ 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m is the number of expansion steps. Let me think again. The initial step (adding the first layer) is required. Then, the expansion steps (adding new layers) must be done at least once. So the number of expansion steps is t ≥ 1. Each expansion step adds a new layer. So the total number of layers is 1 (initial) + t (expansion steps). For example, t=1 → layers 1 (initial) and 1 expansion step adding layer 2. So total layers is 2 (layers 0, 1, 2?) Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think of the tree structure. The root (level 0) has k children (level 1). Then, each node in level 1 has k children (level 2). Then, each node in level 2 has k children (level 3), etc. So the number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d is the depth. For example, depth 0: 1 node. Depth 1: 1 +k. Depth 2: 1 +k +k². Depth 3: 1 +k +k² +k³. \n\nBut the problem requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. The expansion steps refer to the process of adding children to leaves. Initially, after creating the root and its children (depth 1), we must perform at least one expansion step. Which would be adding the children of the level 1 nodes (depth 2). So the minimal depth is 2. Therefore, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k². Which corresponds to depth 2. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d ≥ 2. \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as sum_{i=0}^d k^i for some integers k ≥ 2, d ≥ 2. \n\nBut sum_{i=0}^d k^i = (k^{d+1} - 1) / (k-1). So for each n, we need to check if there exists integers k ≥ 2 and d ≥ 2 such that (k^{d+1} -1) / (k-1) = n. \n\nSo the problem becomes: given n, check if there exists k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that (k^{d+1} -1) / (k-1) =n. \n\nNow, how can I check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)? \n\nLet me think about possible approaches. For each test case n, we need to check if there exists any k and d such that the above equation holds. \n\nFirst, note that for d ≥ 2, d+1 ≥3. So the equation is equivalent to n = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d, where d ≥2. \n\nBut for a given n, how can I find possible k and d?\n\nLet me think of possible values of d. For example, for each possible d, check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n. \n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, trying all possible d for each n may be feasible if the number of possible d's is small. \n\nFor example, for a fixed d, the sum is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. Let me denote m =d+1. Then m ≥3. So the equation is (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n. \n\nSo for each possible m ≥3, check if there exists k≥2 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n. \n\nBut how can I check for each m?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible m (starting from 3 up to some maximum value), check if there exists k such that the equation holds. \n\nWhat is the maximum possible m for a given n? For example, when k=2, the minimal value of the sum for m is 2^m-1. Because (2^m -1)/(2-1) = 2^m -1. So for n, the maximum m is such that 2^m -1 ≤n. For n up to 1e18, 2^60 is around 1e18. So m can be up to 60. So for each n, checking m from 3 to log2(n)+1 is feasible. \n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n can be expressed as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some m ≥3 and k≥2. \n\nBut how to check this for each m?\n\nFor each m from 3 up to log2(n)+1:\n\n   We can perform a binary search on k to find if there exists a k such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently? Let's think about the function f(k) = (k^m -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}. For fixed m, this function is strictly increasing in k. So for a given m, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there exists a k such that f(k)=n. \n\nBut for large m, even k=2 can result in a value larger than n. For example, for m=60, 2^60 is around 1e18. So for n=1e18, m=60 and k=2 would give 2^60-1/(2-1) = 2^60-1 ≈ 1e18, which is possible. \n\nSo for each m (from 3 up to say 60), we can perform a binary search for k. \n\nBut how to compute f(k) for given k and m? For example, when m is up to 60, and k is up to something like 1e6 (since for m=3, k^3-1/(k-1) =k² +k +1. For n up to 1e18, k can be up to sqrt(1e18) = 1e9, but for m=3, solving k² +k +1 =n. So binary search for k up to sqrt(n) is feasible. \n\nBut for m up to 60, and for each m, binary search over k up to, say, 1e6 (but depends on m). However, for large m, the possible k is small. For example, for m=60, even k=2 gives 2^60-1/(2-1) = 1.15e18. If n is 1e18, then for m=60, k=2 gives 1.15e18 which is larger than n. So we can adjust the upper bound for k in binary search. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   If n is 1: output NO (since m ≥3 implies sum is at least 1+2+4=7? Wait for m=3, k=2, the sum is 1 +2 + 2² =7. So n=1 is impossible. Similarly for n=2, 3, etc.)\n\n   For each m from 3 to max_m (like 60):\n\n      Compute the minimal and maximal possible k for this m.\n\n      Perform a binary search on k to see if there exists a k ≥2 such that f(k) =n.\n\n      If found, return YES.\n\n   Also, check for m=2? Wait, no. Because m is d+1, and d ≥2. So m is d+1 ≥3. So m starts from 3. \n\nBut what about when the sum is 1 +k, which would correspond to m=2. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal case is m=3 (d+1=3, d=2). \n\nSo for each m ≥3, check for possible k. \n\nBut there's another case. What if the snowflake is constructed with multiple layers, but not all layers filled? For example, maybe the tree has some layers filled, but others not. Wait no, the construction is such that every node that is a leaf (connected to only one other) must be expanded. So the tree is a full k-ary tree. So the sum is exactly the sum of geometric series. \n\nSo the approach is correct. \n\nNow, the problem is how to implement this for very large n. \n\nBut for each m, the binary search on k can be done. \n\nBut how to compute f(k) for given k and m? For example, for k=2 and m=60, f(k) = 2^60 -1. But for very large exponents, we need to compute this without overflow. However, since in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, this is manageable. \n\nBut during the binary search, we need to compute f(k) and compare it to n. However, for large m and large k, this might take O(m) time. But since m is up to 60, this is acceptable. \n\nAlternatively, we can compute f(k) as follows: \n\nf(k) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} \n\nWhich can be calculated as (k^m -1) // (k-1). But for k=1, this is undefined. However, since k ≥2, this is valid. \n\nSo for a given k and m, compute (k^m -1) // (k-1) and compare to n. \n\nBut calculating k^m can be done with exponentiation. However, for very large k and m, this can be a big number. But since we are comparing to n (up to 1e18), during the binary search, if the computed value exceeds n, we can stop early. \n\nSo the steps for binary search for a given m:\n\nlow = 2, high = some upper bound. What's the upper bound for k?\n\nFor a given m, the minimal value of f(k) is when k=2: f(2) = 2^m -1. \n\nBut for n, we need f(k) =n. So for k, the upper bound can be something like n^(1/(m-1)), since for f(k) =k^{m-1} + ... +1 ≥k^{m-1} ≤n → k ≤n^(1/(m-1)). \n\nBut for binary search, we can set high to something like n. But that might be too slow. Alternatively, we can compute high as the maximum between 2 and the integer part of n^(1/(m-1)) + 1. \n\nBut how to compute that in Python? Well, for each m, we can compute the upper bound as follows: since 1 +k + ... +k^{m-1} ≥k^{m-1}, so k^{m-1} ≤n → k ≤n^(1/(m-1)). So for binary search, high can be set to n^(1/(m-1)) + 1. \n\nBut in practice, for each m, we can perform a binary search between low=2 and high= some value. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose m=3, and n=13. Then the equation is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k^2 +k +1 =13. Solving for k: k^2 +k +1=13 →k^2 +k -12=0 →k=( -1 ± sqrt(1 +48 ))/2 → ( -1 +7)/2 =3. So k=3. So for m=3, the binary search would find k=3. \n\nAnother example: n=6. For m=3, k^2 +k +1=6 →k² +k -5=0 → roots are (-1 ± sqrt(21))/2 → positive root is approx 1.79. Not integer. So no solution. So for m=3, no. What about other m? For m=2, which is not allowed. So n=6 can't be formed. Hence the sample input says for n=6, output is NO. \n\nSo the approach is correct. \n\nNow, how to code this. \n\nFirst, for each test case n:\n\n   if n is 1, output NO.\n\n   else:\n\n      check for all possible m from 3 up to max_m. \n\nWhat is max_m? For m, the minimal value of f(k) is when k=2. So 2^m -1 ≤n → m ≤ log2(n+1). For n up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So m can be up to 60. So for each n, iterate m from 3 to 60. \n\nFor each m in 3..60:\n\n   compute the value of k such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n. \n\n   How to find k? \n\n   Since f(k) increases with k, binary search can be used. \n\n   For binary search, the low is 2, and the high can be something like n^(1/(m-1)) + 1. \n\n   For example, for m=3, the upper bound for k is n^(1/2) +1. \n\nBut how to compute this in Python. Well, for a given m, we can calculate the upper bound as follows:\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile (high ** (m-1)) < n:\n\n   high *= 2 \n\nBut this can be done to find an upper bound. \n\nOnce we have low and high, we can perform binary search. \n\nBut for each candidate k in binary search, compute (k^m -1) // (k-1) and check if it equals n. However, computing k^m can be expensive for large m. But since m is up to 60, and k is up to say 1e6, this is manageable. \n\nBut even better, during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and check if it exceeds n. For example, for a given k and m, compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}. If during the computation, the sum exceeds n, we can break early. \n\nBut for the purposes of code, perhaps using the formula (k^m -1) // (k-1) is easier, but we have to be careful with integer division. \n\nBut let's think: when k >=2 and m >=3, (k^m -1) divided by (k-1) is indeed equal to the sum. \n\nSo code steps for a given m:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2 \n\nwhile compute_sum(high, m) < n:\n\n   high *=2 \n\nthen perform binary search between low and high. \n\nBut how to compute compute_sum(k, m) ?\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    # returns 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}\n\n    # which is (k^m -1) // (k-1)\n\n    # but for large exponents, perhaps compute via loop to avoid overflow?\n\n    # but in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so no problem. \n\n    # However, for k=1, it's m, but since k >=2, no problem.\n\n    # So:\n\n    return (k**m -1) // (k-1)\n\nBut for large k and m, this could take time. For example, k=1e6 and m=60, k**m is a huge number. But for Python, exponentiation is optimized. However, during binary search, we may not need to compute this for all cases. \n\nBut for the binary search, we can compute this and compare with n. \n\nBut for some cases, when k is large, the value (k^m -1) // (k-1) could be larger than n. So during the binary search, we can check if the computed value is equal to n. \n\nBut how to handle the case when k is too big. \n\nSo for example, for a given m, during binary search, for mid = (low + high)//2, compute the value. If it's less than n, we need to search higher. If it's greater than n, search lower. \n\nBut there's a problem: when m is large, even for small k, the value could be very large. However, since in the binary search, we start with high as a value that's sufficient to cover n, perhaps. \n\nBut how to find the initial high. \n\nAlternative approach for finding high: since the sum is at least k^{m-1} (since 1 +k + ... +k^{m-1} ≥k^{m-1}), then k^{m-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(m-1)}. So high can be set to n^{1/(m-1)} + 1. \n\nBut in Python, we can compute this as int(n ** (1/(m-1))) + 2. However, due to floating point inaccuracies, this may not be precise. So perhaps the better approach is to find high via doubling. \n\nSo here's a code outline for each m:\n\ndef check(n, m):\n\n    # check if there exists k >=2 such that (k^m -1) // (k-1) ==n\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    while compute_sum(high, m) < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # Now, binary search between low and high\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, m)\n\n        if s ==n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif s <n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut how to compute compute_sum?\n\nBut for m=3 and k=3, compute_sum(3,3) is (3^3 -1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 = 13, which is correct. \n\nBut for very large exponents, like m=60, and k=2, compute_sum(2, 60) is (2^60 -1)/1 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,975. \n\nBut for n up to 1e18, this is manageable. \n\nBut for m=60 and k=2, the value is 1.15e18, which is larger than 1e18. \n\nSo during the binary search, when the compute_sum is called, it may return a value larger than n, which would lead to adjusting high. \n\nNow, the problem is that for some m, the compute_sum may take a long time. But given that m is up to 60, and for each test case, for each m, the binary search is O(log(high)), which is acceptable. \n\nNow, let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1 → output NO\n\n2 → NO\n\n3 → NO\n\n6 → NO\n\n13 → YES (for m=3, k=3)\n\n15 → ?\n\nFor 15: Let's see. For m=3, check if there's k such that k^2 +k +1 =15 →k² +k -14=0 →k=(-1 ± sqrt(1 +56))/2 → sqrt(57)=~7.54 →k=( -1 +7.54)/2 ~ 3.27 → no integer. \n\nCheck m=4: (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =15. Try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15. Yes! So for m=4, k=2. So 15 is possible. Hence output YES. \n\nWhich matches the sample. \n\nAnother sample input is 255. Let's see:\n\n255 can be written as (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So m=8. So yes. \n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000 (1e18). Let's see. The sample output says NO. \n\nSo the code needs to check for all possible m. \n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases. For example, n=7 (for m=3, k=2: 1+2+4=7). So yes. So output YES. \n\nAnother case: n=3. For m=3, k=2 would give 7. For m=3, no. For m=2, not allowed. So output NO. \n\nNow, coding this in Python. \n\nBut for very large exponents, computing k^m can be computationally heavy. However, since m is up to 60 and k is up to say 1e6, in practice, it's manageable. \n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the sum. For example, during the binary search, instead of computing (k^m -1)//(k-1), compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow. \n\nBut for code, perhaps the formula is easier. \n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead t test cases. For each n:\n\nif n ==1: print NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   flag = False\n\n   for m in 3 to 60:\n\n       if check(n, m):\n\n           flag = True\n\n           break\n\n   if flag: print YES else NO\n\nBut what about other possibilities where the sum is not a full geometric series? For example, the snowflake could be built with varying expansion steps. Wait no. The snowflake is built by expanding each leaf once. So the structure is a perfect k-ary tree. Hence the sum must be the geometric series. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nNow, code for the check function. \n\nBut what about when m is 3 and k=2, the sum is 7. For n=7, returns True. \n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the check function. \n\nBut for m up to 60. \n\nBut how to handle m up to 60. \n\nNow, in Python, for exponents, pow(k, m) is manageable. \n\nBut for very large k and m, the calculation of (k^m -1) // (k-1) may be slow. However, for the constraints of the problem, with t up to 1e4 and m up to 60, it's manageable. \n\nAnother thing to note: for m=3, the maximum possible k is sqrt(n). For example, for n=1e18, m=3, the maximum k is around 1e9. \n\nBut binary search for that would take about 30 steps. For each step, calculating k^3 is manageable. \n\nBut for m=60, even k=2, the calculation is 2^60, which is manageable. \n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the function compute_sum can be written as:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    return (pow(k, m) - 1) // (k - 1)\n\nBut for k=1, this would be a division by zero. However, since k starts from 2, this is okay. \n\nBut in the code, during the binary search, for m=3, and k=2, compute_sum(2,3) = (8-1)/1 =7. \n\nNow, code for the check function. \n\nBut during the binary search, when we compute the sum, we have to be careful about possible overflows. However, in Python, integers are arbitrary precision. \n\nBut for very large numbers, even if the sum is larger than n, the code will handle it. \n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for each m, we need to check whether there exists a k. \n\nNow, code for the check function:\n\ndef check(n, m):\n\n    # check if there exists k >=2 such that (k^m -1) // (k-1) ==n\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    # find upper bound\n\n    while compute_sum(high, m) < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # Now binary search between low and high\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number $ n $ can be the number of vertices in a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake graph is constructed in such a way that it forms a perfect $ k $-ary tree with at least two layers of expansion. The challenge is to check if there exists any integer $ k > 1 $ and an integer $ m \\geq 3 $ such that the sum of the geometric series $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^{m-1} $ equals $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph is a perfect $ k $-ary tree. The number of vertices in such a tree can be represented by the sum of a geometric series $ S = \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} $ for some integers $ k \\geq 2 $ and $ m \\geq 3 $.\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each test case, we check all possible values of $ m $ starting from 3 up to a reasonable upper bound (60 in this case, as $ 2^{60} $ exceeds $ 10^{18} $).\n3. **Binary Search for $ k $**: For each $ m $, we perform a binary search on $ k $ to see if the geometric series sum equals $ n $. This involves checking if there exists a $ k $ such that $ \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} = n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n    return (pow(k, m) - 1) // (k - 1)\n\ndef check(n, m):\n    low = 2\n    high = 2\n    # Find an upper bound for high\n    while compute_sum(high, m) < n:\n        high *= 2\n    # Binary search between low and high\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        s = compute_sum(mid, m)\n        if s == n:\n            return True\n        elif s < n:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if n == 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        # Check for m from 3 to 60\n        for m in range(3, 61):\n            if check(n, m):\n                found = True\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Geometric Series Calculation**: The function `compute_sum` calculates the sum of the geometric series using the formula $ \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} $.\n3. **Binary Search**: For each possible value of $ m $ (from 3 to 60), we use binary search to determine if there exists a $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $.\n4. **Edge Cases**: Special handling for $ n = 1 $, which cannot form a valid snowflake graph as per the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the snowflake graph using geometric series properties and binary search, ensuring correctness and performance even for very large values of $ n $.",
