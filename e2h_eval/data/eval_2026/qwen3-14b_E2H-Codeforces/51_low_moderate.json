Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from the first two lines (guest and host), they should exactly match the letters in the third line (the pile). And also, there shouldn't be any extra letters in the pile. So, the total count of each character in the first two lines combined must exactly match the count in the third line.\n\nSo the approach here would be to:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines (guest + host) into a single string.\n3. Check if the combined string has the same character counts as the third line (the pile).\n4. If yes, output \"YES\"; else, \"NO\".\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nHmm. So, for each of the three lines, we can count the frequency of each character. Then, the sum of the counts from the first two lines should equal the counts in the third line.\n\nWait, but maybe the third line has more letters than the sum of the first two? Or fewer? For example, if the combined length of the first two lines is not equal to the length of the third line, then it's automatically a \"NO\".\n\nYes, that's a good point. So first, check if the total length of the first two lines equals the length of the third line. If not, output \"NO\".\n\nOtherwise, proceed to check each character's count.\n\nSo steps:\n\nFor each test case (each of the three input lines):\n\n- Combine guest and host into a single string, say combined = guest + host.\n- Check if len(combined) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n- Else, check if the frequency of each character in combined equals that in pile.\n\nHow to check the frequencies?\n\nIn Python, we can use the collections.Counter class. For example, Counter(combined) should be equal to Counter(pile).\n\nBut wait, Counter objects can be compared directly. So if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile), then return YES else NO.\n\nYes. So the code would be something like:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined string has the same length but different characters? For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → yes. But if pile is \"AA\", then the counts would differ. So the Counter approach would catch that.\n\nYes. So this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\nHost: DEDMOROZ\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined length: len(\"SANTACLAUS\") + len(\"DEDMOROZ\") ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S → wait, let me count: S(1), A(2), N(3), T(4), A(5), C(6), L(7), A(8), U(9), S(10) → yes, 10 letters.\n\nDEDMOROZ: D E D M O R O Z → that's 8 letters. So combined length is 18.\n\nThe pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nBut perhaps the code will handle that. The Counter approach would compare the counts.\n\nIn the first sample, the combined string is \"SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ\" and the pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\". Let me check if the counts are same.\n\nBut maybe the code will handle that correctly.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the second sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined length: len(\"PAPAINOEL\") is 9 letters. JOULUPUKKI is 10 letters. Total 19. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nBut the sample output says \"NO\" because there's a missing P and an extra L. So the code would check that the combined counts don't match the pile's counts.\n\nSo the code would return NO.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nBABBONATALE\nFATHERCHR",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the characters in the pile exactly match the combined characters of the guest and host names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Length Check**: First, check if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, it is immediately clear that the pile cannot be rearranged to form the combined names.\n3. **Character Frequency Check**: Use a frequency counter to compare the characters in the combined string of the guest and host names with the characters in the pile. If both frequency counters match, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three lines from input\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    # Check if lengths are equal\n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    # Check if the character counts match\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure compatibility with standard input handling.\n- **Combined Length Check**: The combined length of the guest and host names is compared with the length of the pile. If they differ, the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n- **Character Frequency Comparison**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string of the guest and host names and the pile. If these counts match exactly, the answer is \"YES\", indicating the pile can be rearranged to form the names; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both the length and character composition requirements, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
