The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. Each round, they use their own sequences cyclically. The key here is to simulate the rounds efficiently because n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big for a straightforward simulation.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to model their choices for each round. Since their sequences repeat cyclically, the choice for round i depends on i modulo the length of their sequence. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is length m, then in round i (starting from 0?), he uses A[i % m]. Wait, but the rounds are numbered from 1 to n? Or 0-based? Well, the problem says that the first round is the first one. Let me check the example.\n\nIn the first sample input, n is 7. The sequences are A = RPS (length 3), B = RSPP (length 4). Let's look at the rounds:\n\nRound 1: A's first element is R, B's first is R. Draw. So no spots.\n\nRound 2: A's second element P, B's second S. P vs S: S beats P? Wait, the rules are: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock. So, S (scissors) beats P (paper). So in this case, Nikephoros has P, Polycarpus has S. So S beats P, so Nikephoros loses. So he gets a spot. So Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the example explanation, the first sample output is 3 and 2. Let me check the example again.\n\nThe example's explanation says that in the first sample:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (since S beats P). So Nikephoros gets a spot (so his count is 1).\n\nRound 3: S vs P → S beats P. So Polycarpus loses. So his count increases by 1 (so Polycarpus has 1).\n\nRound 4: R vs P → P beats R. Nikephoros loses again (count 2).\n\nRound 5: P vs R → R beats P? No. Wait, Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock. So R (rock) beats S (scissors). P (paper) beats R (rock). So in round 5, Nikephoros has P, Polycarpus has R. P beats R, so Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So his count becomes 2.\n\nWait, but the example says in round 5, Polycarpus loses. Wait, the example's explanation says:\n\nRound 5: P - R. Polycarpus loses. Wait, how? Let me think again. If Nikephoros plays P (paper) and Polycarpus plays R (rock). Paper beats rock. So Nikephoros wins. Therefore, Polycarpus is the loser. So he gets a spot. So Polycarpus's count increases by 1. That's correct.\n\nSo the example's explanation says that in round 5, Polycarpus loses. So that's correct. So the counts are Nikephoros has 3, Polycarpus 2. \n\nSo the main idea is for each round, we need to determine who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFind out the pattern of wins and losses over the cycles of A and B. Since both sequences repeat, the combination of their choices will also repeat after some period. The period would be the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of A and B. Let me see: For example, if A has length m and B has length k, then after LCM(m, k) rounds, the pattern of their choices repeats. Because each sequence cycles every m and k rounds respectively. So the combined pattern repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo, the idea is to compute the number of wins for each player in one full cycle (of LCM(m, k) rounds), then multiply by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the results for the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of wins in one cycle?\n\nLet's think. Let's compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it T. Then, for each of the T rounds, we can compute what A and B choose, determine the outcome, and count how many times each player",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use an optimized approach leveraging the periodicity of their strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Patterns**: Both players use sequences that repeat cyclically. The combined pattern of their choices repeats every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **Calculate LCM**: Determine the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to find the period after which their choices repeat.\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: Simulate one full cycle of length LCM(m, k) to count the number of wins for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Calculate how many full cycles fit into n rounds and compute the wins from these cycles. Then, simulate the remaining rounds after the full cycles to get the final counts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    b_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    lcm = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of wins in one LCM cycle\n    nikephoros_wins = 0\n    polycarpus_wins = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a = a_seq[i % m]\n        b = b_seq[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            polycarpus_wins += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            nikephoros_wins += 1\n    \n    # Number of full cycles\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nike = full_cycles * nikephoros_wins\n    total_poly = full_cycles * polycarpus_wins\n    \n    # Process the remaining rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = a_seq[i % m]\n        b = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nike += 1\n    \n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the period after which their choices repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round in one LCM cycle, we determine the outcome and count the wins for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: We calculate the number of full cycles that fit into n rounds and compute the wins from these cycles. The remaining rounds after the full cycles are simulated individually to account for any leftover rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of n by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring the solution is both optimal and scalable.",
