The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, Nikephoros and Polycarpus are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each round, we need to determine who wins, and count the number of times each gets pinched (i.e., loses a round). The output is two numbers: the count for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 2e9, which is really big. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need an efficient approach.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to model their move sequences. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus's move, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nThe challenge is to compute for all n rounds, how many times each loses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't iterate through each round. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, and calculate the number of losses in each cycle, then multiply by the number of cycles and add the remainder.\n\nLet me think: the sequences of moves for both players repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the combination of moves (A_i, B_i) will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. So if we can compute the number of losses in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, then we can compute how many full cycles there are in n rounds, multiply by the losses per cycle, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nYes, that seems like the way to go.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call this period_length.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to period_length - 1, compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and count the number of times each loses in this period.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period_length.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % period_length.\n\n5. So total losses for each player is total_periods * (losses_per_period for each) + losses in the first rem rounds of the period.\n\nBut how do I compute the losses in the period and in the rem rounds?\n\nSo first, I need to precompute for each possible round in the period (from 0 to period_length-1) what the outcome is.\n\nBut period_length could be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1,000,000. Since m and k are up to 1000 each. So LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6. For each of these 1e6 rounds, we can compute the outcome once. Then, for the total number of periods, multiply by the counts in the period, and then process the remaining rounds.\n\nThis would be feasible, since even 1e6 is manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute for each round in 0 to period_length-1:\n\n- A's move: A[ i % m ]\n\n- B's move: B[ i % k ]\n\nThen determine who wins. For each such round, we can record whether Nikephoros loses (so add 1 to his count), or Polycarpus loses (add 1 to his count), or it's a draw.\n\nOnce we have that, we can compute the total for the full periods and the remainder.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the LCM of m and k. To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD.\n\nIn Python, there's math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, it's okay. So for m and k, which are positive, we can compute GCD(m, k), then LCM is m*k // gcd.\n\nOnce we have the period_length, then:\n\nCompute for each of the period_length rounds, the number of times each player loses in that period. Let's call them period_nik and period_poly.\n\nThen, total_periods = n // period_length\n\nrem = n % period_length\n\nThen, the total for the full periods is total_periods * period_nik and total_periods * period_poly.\n\nThen, we need to compute the number of losses in the first rem rounds of the period. So we can precompute an array for the first period, and for each index up to rem-1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy. The challenge is to handle up to 2 billion rounds efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cycles**: Both players use cyclic sequences for their moves. The combined sequence of moves from both players repeats every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their individual sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the period after which the move combinations repeat.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period (up to LCM length), determine the outcome of each round and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Periods and Remainder**: Calculate the number of full periods in the total number of rounds and the remaining rounds after these full periods. Use the precomputed counts from one period to quickly determine the total losses for all full periods and simulate the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    b_seq = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one full period\n    nik_period = 0\n    poly_period = 0\n    \n    for i in range(period_length):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        \n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n             (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n             (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            poly_period += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nik_period += 1\n    \n    total_periods = n // period_length\n    rem = n % period_length\n    \n    # Calculate total from full periods\n    total_nik = total_periods * nik_period\n    total_poly = total_periods * poly_period\n    \n    # Calculate remaining rounds\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n             (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n             (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the period after which the move combinations repeat.\n3. **Precompute Outcomes**: For each round within one period, the outcomes are determined and the number of losses for each player is counted.\n4. **Full Periods and Remainder**: The total number of full periods and the remaining rounds are calculated. The results from the full periods are multiplied by the number of periods, and the remaining rounds are processed individually to get the final counts of losses for each player.\n\nThis approach ensures that even for very large numbers of rounds, the solution remains efficient by leveraging the periodic nature of the move sequences.",
