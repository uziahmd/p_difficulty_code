He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, which might be Roman.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Read a and b (but b can be 'R' for Roman).\n2. Read the number c as a string in base a.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n4. Then convert that decimal integer to base b. If b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as usual.\n\nSo the main steps are converting the input string to decimal, then converting that decimal to the target base or Roman.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting the input string c (base a) to decimal. How to do that?\n\nFor example, if c is \"10\" in base 2, that's 2 in decimal. But the input can have letters for digits higher than 9. Wait, the problem says that in bases greater than 10, letters A, B, etc. are used. So for example, in base 12, the digits go up to 'B' (11). So when converting the input string to decimal, I need to handle digits as characters, possibly uppercase or lowercase? Well, the input says that the input c may contain letters. But according to the problem statement, the input c is given as a string that may contain letters for digits above 9. However, the problem says that the input is given as a non-negative integer in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the input may have letters. But the problem says that in the input, the c is given as a string that may contain letters. However, the input is given as a single line, so I need to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3.\" So the digits of c are in base a. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9, A-F (uppercase?), but the input may have letters. However, the problem says that in the case where Roman numerals are involved, the number is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 3000 in decimal. Also, in other cases, the number is not greater than 1e15.\n\nSo for the first step, converting c from base a to decimal. How to do that?\n\nI need to process each character in the string, convert it to its value, then compute the decimal equivalent.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"A\" in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nBut how to handle letters? The problem says that for bases greater than 10, letters A, B, etc. are used. So for example, in base 12, the digits are 0-9, A (10), B (11). So the input c's digits can be 0-9 and letters A-Z (uppercase?) for higher digits. However, the problem says that the input is given as a string. So I need to process each character in the string as a digit in base a.\n\nSo, the code for converting the input string to decimal would be:\n\nTake each character in the string, convert it to its numerical value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. Then, for each digit, multiply the current total by a and add the digit's value.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the input has letters? For example, if the input is \"1A\" in base 16, that's 1*16 + 10 = 26.\n\nSo, the function to convert the input string to decimal would be something like:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the input has lowercase letters? The problem says that the input is given as a string, but probably it's in uppercase. However, the problem says that in the input, the c may have letters. But the problem says that in the examples, for instance, the input '16 R\\n5' gives output 'V', which is 5 in decimal. So the input c is given as a string, which may have letters. But the problem says that for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which can either be a standard numerical base or Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number to a decimal (base 10) integer first and then converting it to the target base or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: Convert the given number `c` from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer. This involves handling digits that may be letters (for bases greater than 10).\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a numerical base or Roman numerals, convert the decimal number accordingly:\n   - **Numerical Base Conversion**: Convert the decimal number to the specified base `b` using standard base conversion techniques.\n   - **Roman Numeral Conversion**: Convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in val:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in inputs:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        a_part = parts[0]\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        c_str = ' '.join(parts[2:])  # In case there are spaces in c?

Otherwise, it is converted to the specified base using `decimal_to_base`, which handles digit values greater than 9 by converting them to letters (e.g., 10 becomes 'A', 11 becomes 'B', etc.).",
