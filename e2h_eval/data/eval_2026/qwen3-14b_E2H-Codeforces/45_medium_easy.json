There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a specific rule. The rule says that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, I need to figure out, for a given n (number of players), what's the maximum possible games the winner could have.\n\nLet me think about the examples given. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner plays two games. How does that work? Like, maybe first the winner plays against one player, then the other player. But how does the rule apply here? Let's see: the first game is between two players. Suppose player 1 beats player 2. Then, the next game would be between player 1 and player 3. Since player 1 has played 1 game, and player 3 has played 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's why the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. The note says that you can't have the winner play three games. Because after two games, the other players would have 0 games. So the maximum is 2. So the structure here is that the tournament is arranged in a way that the winner plays two games, but not more.\n\nHmm. So the problem seems to relate to the structure of a binary tree. Because in a standard knockout tournament, each game eliminates one player, so for n players, there are n-1 games. But the maximum number of games the winner can play depends on how the tournament is structured.\n\nBut the rule here complicates things. The key is that when two players play, their number of previous games must differ by at most one. So, for the winner to play as many games as possible, we need to arrange the tournament such that each time the winner plays, they are matched against someone who has played either the same number of games or one less.\n\nThis feels similar to building a binary tree where each level represents a game. For example, the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the depth of the tree. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Suppose the winner has to play k games. Each time they play, they must have faced opponents who have played either k-1, k-2, etc. games. Maybe the problem reduces to finding the largest k such that the sum of the first k numbers (or something similar) is less than or equal to n-1?\n\nWait, let's think about the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games. Let's denote f(k) as the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can play k games.\n\nFor example, for k=1, the minimal n is 2 (since one game). For k=2, the minimal n is 3. Because the winner plays two games. Let's see: first, the winner plays against someone (so 2 players). Then, the winner has to play another game. But the next opponent must have played 0 or 1 games. If the winner has played 1 game, the opponent can have 0 or 1. But to get that, perhaps the opponent has to have played one game. So maybe the opponent is someone who has already played once. So, how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as each time the winner plays a game, they need to have an opponent. For the first game, there's one opponent. For the second game, the opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. But to get that, maybe the opponent has to be someone who has played once. So, how does that work?\n\nLet me think recursively. To have the winner play k games, the first game is against someone. Then, for each subsequent game, the winner must face someone who has played either the same number of games as the winner's previous count, or one less. Wait, perhaps this is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because for the winner to play k games, the number of players required would be the sum of the players required for the previous steps.\n\nLet me think. Let's say that for the winner to play k games, he must have played k-1 games before the last one. So, for each game, the winner's opponent must be someone who has played a certain number of games. Let's model this as follows:\n\nTo have the winner play k games, the first game requires one player. Then, for each subsequent game, the opponent must have a certain number of games. For example, to get the winner to play a second game, the opponent must have played 0 or 1 game. But to have that opponent, perhaps that opponent had to win their own matches. So, for the second game, the opponent must have played 1 game (if the winner has played 1 game already). Wait, maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a binary tree where each node represents a game. The winner's path through the tournament is a chain of games, and each time, the opponent must have a path that's at most one shorter. So for the maximum number of games, the structure would be such that each time the winner plays, the opponent comes from a subtree that allows for the maximum depth.\n\nThis reminds me of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is F(k+2), where F is the Fibonacci sequence. Let me check:\n\nFor k=1, F(3) = 2. Correct. For k=2, F(4)=3. Correct. For k=3, F(5)=5. Let's see: if n=5, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nLet's imagine:\n\nFirst, the winner plays against someone (game 1). Then, the winner plays against someone else (game 2). Then, the winner plays against another person (game 3). How can that happen?\n\nIn order for that to happen, the third game's opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the winner has played 2 games. The opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. For the opponent to have played 2 games, they must have won two games. So, perhaps the tournament is structured as follows:\n\nPlayers A, B, C, D, E. Winner is A.\n\nFirst, A plays against B. A wins. Then, A plays against C. A wins. Then, A needs to play against someone who has played 1 or 2 games. Let's say that D and E have played their own matches. For example, D and E play first (D wins). Then, A plays against D. Now, A has played 2 games, D has played 1. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's possible. So with n=5, the answer is 3. Which would fit with the idea that the minimal n for k is Fibonacci(k+2). So for k=3, n=5.\n\nThen, for n=5, the answer is 3. For n=6, perhaps the answer is still 3. Because the minimal n for k=3 is 5, and for k=4, the minimal n is 8 (F(6) = 8). So for n=6, the maximum is 3. For n=8, the maximum is 4.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest k such that F(k+2) ≤ n. Then, the answer is k.\n\nWait, but let's test with the sample input. For example, when n=3, the answer is 2. According to this formula, F(2+2) = F(4) = 3. Which equals n=3. So k=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: n=4. The minimal n for k=3 is 5, which is larger than 4. So the maximum k is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSimilarly, for n=10. Let's compute the Fibonacci numbers. Let's list them:\n\nF(1) = 1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13.\n\nSo for k=4, F(6) = 8. So for n=10, since 8 ≤ 10, the maximum k is 4. Which matches the sample output (the sample input for 10 gives output 4).\n\nYes! So the problem becomes finding the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤ n. So the answer is k.\n\nSo the approach is to find the largest k such that the (k+2)th Fibonacci number is ≤n.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute this for very large n (up to 1e18)? We need to generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n, and then find the maximum k.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Generate Fibonacci numbers until the current number exceeds n.\n\n2. For each Fibonacci number, track the index. For example, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.\n\n3. Find the largest m such that F(m) ≤n. Then, the answer is (m-2).\n\nWait, because for the k-th game, the minimal n is F(k+2). So, if F(m) is the largest Fibonacci number ≤n, then m = k+2. Therefore, k = m-2.\n\nFor example, in the case where n=3, F(4)=3. m=4, k=4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5. F(5)=5. m=5. k=5-2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum m where F(m) ≤n, and then the answer is m-2.\n\nBut what about numbers that are not Fibonacci numbers? For example, n=4. The Fibonacci numbers are 1,1,2,3,5, etc. So the largest F(m) ≤4 is 3 (m=4). Then answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=6. The largest F(m) is 5 (m=5). Answer is 5-2=3. Which would be correct. Because for n=6, the maximum number of games is 3. Let's see: the minimal n for k=3 is 5. So with 6 players, the answer is 3.\n\nSo the plan is to generate Fibonacci numbers up to the point where they exceed n, then find the largest m where F(m) <=n. Then the answer is m-2.\n\nSo now, the task is to generate the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. Let's think about how many terms that would take. The Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially. Let's see:\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nF(6) = 8\n\nF(7) = 13\n\nF(8) = 21\n\nF(9) = 34\n\nF(10)=55\n\n...\n\nF(80) is about 2.34e16 (I remember that F(80) is around that value). F(85) is about 2.1e17, F(90) is about 2.8e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum m is around 90. So generating up to 90 terms is manageable.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers until the current value exceeds n.\n\n- Find the largest m where F(m) <=n.\n\n- The answer is m-2.\n\nBut how to handle cases where n is exactly a Fibonacci number. For example, n=5, answer is 3 (since m=5, 5-2=3).\n\nBut let's test for n=2. The Fibonacci numbers are F(3)=2. So m=3, answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the Fibonacci sequence until the current term exceeds n.\n\nOnce the list is generated, find the maximum m where F(m) <=n.\n\nThen, the answer is m-2.\n\nNow, how to generate the Fibonacci sequence?\n\nWe can start with F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, and then each next term is sum of previous two.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can generate the list as follows:\n\nInitialize a list fibs = [1, 1]\n\nthen while the last element is <= n:\n\n   next = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n   append to fibs.\n\nOnce that loop ends, the largest element in fibs is the largest F(m) <=n.\n\nWait, but for example, if n is 1, but according to the problem statement, n is >=2. So no problem.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nif n is 1, but according to the input constraints, n starts at 2.\n\nSo for n=2, the fibs list will be [1,1,2]. Then the largest is 2, which is F(3). m is 3. answer is 3-2=1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the Fibonacci numbers up to the first one exceeding n.\n\nOnce generated, find the largest F(m) <=n.\n\nThen answer is m-2.\n\nBut how to find m?\n\nFor example, the list of Fibonacci numbers is stored as a list, say, fibs. Then, the length of the list is the m for the last element. Wait, no. Because the list starts with F(1) and F(2). So for example:\n\nfibs = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5...]\n\nSo the index in the list is i, and the corresponding m is i+1. Because for the first element (index 0), it's F(1). So for the list, the index is i, and m is i+1.\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nInitially, fibs = [1, 1]. These are F(1) and F(2).\n\nThen, adding F(3) = 2. So the list becomes [1,1,2]. So for the third element (index 2), it's F(3).\n\nSo the m is len(fibs) for the last element. Because for the list [F(1), F(2), F(3), ..., F(k)], the length is k. So for the last element, m is len(fibs).\n\nWait, for example, the initial list is [F(1), F(2)] (length 2). Then, adding F(3) makes the list length 3. So the last element is F(3), which is m=3.\n\nSo yes, the m for the last element is len(fibs).\n\nSo, once we generate the list, the largest F(m) <=n is the last element in the list. So m is len(fibs).\n\nBut wait, suppose the next term would be larger than n, but the previous term is the largest. So the code would be:\n\nInitialize fibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n   next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n   if next_fib >n:\n\n       break\n\n   fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nSo after this loop, the last element in fibs is the largest F(m) <=n. So m is len(fibs).\n\nBut let's see for example:\n\nn=3.\n\nfibs starts as [1,1]. next is 2 (<=3) added. Now fibs is [1,1,2]. next is 3 (<=3) added. Now fibs is [1,1,2,3]. next is 5>3. So break. So the last element is 3, which is F(4) (m=4). len(fibs) is 4. So yes.\n\nThus, the answer is m-2 = 4-2=2. Which is correct for n=3.\n\nAnother example: n=4. The fibs list would be [1,1,2,3,5]. Wait no, the loop adds next_fib only if it's <=n. So let's see:\n\nInitial fibs [1,1].\n\nnext_fib = 2 <=4 → append. fibs is [1,1,2]\n\nnext_fib = 3 <=4 → append. [1,1,2,3]\n\nnext_fib = 5 >4 → break. So the last element is 3, which is F(4). m=4. answer is 4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n < 2: ... but according to input constraints, n is ≥2.\n\nInitialize fibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n   next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n   if next_fib >n:\n\n       break\n\n   fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nThen, m = len(fibs). answer is m-2.\n\nWait, but for n=2, the fibs list would be [1,1,2], since next_fib is 2 which is not larger than n=2. So the loop adds it. Then, next_fib is 3, which is larger than 2. So the loop breaks. So the last element is 2, len(fibs) is 3. answer is 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2: n=3 → output is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=4 → output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 10: the fibs list would be [1,1,2,3,5,8,13]. Let's see:\n\nn=10.\n\nThe loop adds 1,1,2,3,5,8. Next is 13>10. So the list is [1,1,2,3,5,8]. len is 6. answer is 6-2=4. Which matches the sample output of 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=5. The list would be [1,1,2,3,5]. len is 5. answer 5-2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling n=2, which returns 1. Correct.\n\nWhat about n=1? Well, the problem says n≥2, so no need to handle.\n\nNow, what about n=6. The fibs list is [1,1,2,3,5,8]. Wait, 8 is bigger than 6. So the list is [1,1,2,3,5]. len is 5. answer 5-2=3. Which is correct. Because the maximum number of games is 3.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nHandle n=2, etc.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for n=1, but input is 2 <=n <=1e18.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nInitialize fibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n   next_fib = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n   if next_fib >n:\n\n       break\n\n   fibs.append(next_fib)\n\nThen, m = len(fibs)\n\nans = m-2\n\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, but let's check for n=2:\n\nfibs starts as [1,1]. next_fib is 2, which is <=2 → append. Now fibs is [1,1,2]. Then next_fib is 3>2 → break. len(fibs) is 3. ans is 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=5. The list is [1,1,2,3,5]. len is 5. 5-2=3. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the input constraints say n≥2.\n\nBut what about n=1? Well, the problem says n is between 2 and 1e18. So no problem.\n\nBut what about when the fibs list is [1,1], and n is 1? Well, the code would not process that. But since n is at least 2, the code is okay.\n\nNow, testing for n=2, output is 1. Correct.\n\nNow, what about n=6. The answer is 3. Let's see:\n\nThe maximum number of games is 3. How?\n\nThe minimal players for 3 games is 5. So with 6 players, the winner can have 3 games. So the code returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut for very large n, like 1e18, how long would this take? Well, the loop would generate up to around 90 terms. Because the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. So even for 1e18, the loop will run about 85 times. Which is trivial.\n\nSo the code is efficient.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nBut n can be up to 1e18. So in Python, we can read it as integer.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 1:\n\n    print(0) # but according to input constraints, n is at least 2.\n\nBut since the input is guaranteed to be >=2, we don't need to handle that.\n\nSo code:\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_f > n:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_f)\n\nm = len(fibs)\n\nprint(m-2)\n\nWait, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input 2: n=3.\n\nfibs starts as [1,1]. next is 2 <=3 → added. Then next is 3 <=3 → added. Then next is 5>3 → break. len(fibs) is 4. 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample input 4: n=4. The fibs list is [1,1,2,3]. Next is 5>4. len is 4. 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample input 10: len(fibs) is 6 (elements [1,1,2,3,5,8]). 6-2=4. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: n=2. len is 3 → 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5. len(fibs) is 5. 5-2=3. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut wait, what if the n is exactly a Fibonacci number? For example, n=8. The code would generate [1,1,2,3,5,8]. len is 6. 6-2=4. Which is correct. Because the maximum number of games is 4.\n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nSo the Python code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be reduced to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given number of players, `n`. This is because the structure of the tournament, under the given constraints, resembles a Fibonacci sequence where each player's progression through the tournament mirrors the growth of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is given by the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`, and then determining the corresponding number of games from this Fibonacci index.\n\n2. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers up to the point where they exceed `n`. The largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n` will give us the necessary index to compute the maximum number of games.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\nfibs = [1, 1]\nwhile True:\n    next_f = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n    if next_f > n:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_f)\n\nprint(len(fibs) - 2)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n`, representing the number of players.\n2. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We start with the first two Fibonacci numbers, 1 and 1. We continue generating subsequent Fibonacci numbers until the next number exceeds `n`.\n3. **Finding Maximum Games**: The length of the list of generated Fibonacci numbers gives us the index `m` such that the `m`-th Fibonacci number is the largest less than or equal to `n`. The maximum number of games the winner can play is then calculated as `m - 2`, derived from the relationship between Fibonacci indices and the number of games.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
