Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So Valera needs to check if the letters on his square paper form an 'X' according to specific rules. Let me think about what those rules are.\n\nThe problem says that the paper forms an 'X' if two conditions are met. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to check all the cells on the two diagonals. Let me think about how to identify those cells. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). \n\nWait, but for each cell in the diagonals, how do I check if they are all the same? Also, the two diagonals must have the same letters. Like, the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal must all be the same letter. But wait, maybe they can be different? No, no. Wait the problem says: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So both diagonals must have all their letters same. But also, the two diagonals must have the same letter? Or can they have different letters as long as each diagonal is uniform?\n\nWait the problem says that the letters on the diagonals are the same. Let me re-read the condition:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nAh, so the two diagonals must have all their letters the same. But the diagonals themselves can have different letters? No, because the first part says that on both diagonals, all letters are the same. So for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then that's okay. But if one is 'x' and the other is 'y', then that's not okay. Because the problem says that both diagonals must have all letters same. But does that mean that the two diagonals must be the same as each other? Because the second condition says that the other squares have a letter different from the letters on the diagonals. So if the diagonals have different letters, then the other squares would have to be different from both. But that's impossible, because the other squares have only one letter. So the two diagonals must have the same letter. Because otherwise, the other squares would need to be different from both, but they can't be two different letters. Therefore, the two diagonals must have the same letter. So the first step is to check that all the cells on both diagonals are the same letter. Then, check that all non-diagonal cells are the same letter, different from that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this diagonal_char.\n\n2. Check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same, and that they are different from diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, I need to iterate through all cells in the grid. For each cell, determine if it's on either of the two diagonals.\n\nFor a cell (i,j) in a square of size n, it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, check if it's on either of these.\n\nSo, first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the other characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, what if there are overlapping cells? Like, in the case of n being odd, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when collecting the diagonal characters, we need to make sure that we don't count duplicates. But for checking that all are same, even if there are duplicates, it's okay. Because if the cell is on both diagonals, it's part of both. But for the check, we just need that all the cells in the diagonals are same. So, for example, if the center cell is part of both diagonals, but all cells in the diagonals are same, then it's okay.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCollect all the characters on the diagonals. Check that all of them are the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonals?\n\nLet me think. For each cell (i, j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. So for all such cells, collect their characters.\n\nThen, check that all of them are same. Let's say that the diagonal_char is the first character of the diagonals. Then check that all others are same as that.\n\nOnce that's done, check all the non-diagonal cells. Let's collect all their characters, check that they are all same and different from diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal cells? For each cell (i,j), if it's not on either diagonal, then check if it's part of the non-diagonal group.\n\nBut for the non-diagonal cells, there's a possibility that they are all same. But how to handle that?\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead the grid.\n\nCheck if n is odd (but input says n is given as odd, so maybe no need to check that).\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n    for j in 0..n-1:\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut wait, that's not sufficient. Because, for example, if the diagonals have all same characters, but the non-diagonal has same as diagonals. Then the condition would be invalid.\n\nBut the problem says that the non-diagonal letters must be same and different from the diagonals.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) == 1 and len(non_diagonal_chars) == 1 and diagonal_chars != non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut wait, the diagonal_chars is a set. So if the set has only one element, then that's the diagonal_char. Similarly for non_diagonal_chars.\n\nBut in Python, sets can't have multiple elements. So for example, if all the diagonal cells are same, then diagonal_chars will have length 1. Similarly for non-diagonal.\n\nBut what about the case where the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, when n is 3, for example, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 (since the center is counted twice) cells. So for n=3, the diagonals have 3+3-1=5 cells. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4. So in that case, the non_diagonal_chars will have 4 elements, but if all are same, then len is 1.\n\nBut for the case when n=1? Well, the input says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut for the code, the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell, check if it is on a diagonal.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal characters and non-diagonal.\n\nBut perhaps, in code:\n\ndiagonal_char = None\n\nnon_diagonal_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            if diagonal_char is None:\n\n                diagonal_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            else:\n\n                if grid[i][j] != diagonal_char:\n\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n                    exit\n\n        else:\n\n            if non_diagonal_char is None:\n\n                non_diagonal_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            else:\n\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diagonal_char:\n\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n                    exit\n\nBut this approach would have to check for all cells. However, this approach may not work because for the first cell in the diagonal, we set the diagonal_char, and then compare all other diagonal cells against it. Similarly for non-diagonal. But what if the non-diagonal cells are empty? Well, when n is 3, the non-diagonal cells are 4. So in that case, non_diagonal_char will be set.\n\nBut what if the grid is all diagonal cells? Like n=1? But n is >=3.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the following steps:\n\nCheck all the diagonal cells are same.\n\nCheck all non-diagonal cells are same.\n\nCheck that the two are different.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For the first part, check that all diagonal cells are same. For that, take the first diagonal cell (say, (0,0)), and check that all other diagonal cells are same as that.\n\nSimilarly for the non-diagonal cells. Take the first non-diagonal cell, check that all others are same as that.\n\nThen check that the two are different.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So for example, in n=3, the non-diagonal cells are the ones not on the diagonals. So for the first cell (0,1) and (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) etc.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell? For example, in the case of n=3, the first cell (0,0) is diagonal. Then (0,1) is not. So for the first non-diagonal cell, we can check in the loop.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the grid as a list of strings.\n\nCheck for all cells in the diagonals:\n\nCheck that they are all the same as the first diagonal cell.\n\nThen check for all non-diagonal cells that they are all same as the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nThen check that the two are different.\n\nBut how to find the first diagonal cell and first non-diagonal cell?\n\nWell, for the first diagonal cell, it's (0,0). For the first non-diagonal cell, perhaps (0,1) if n>1. But for example, in n=3, (0,1) is non-diagonal. For n=5, same.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\ndiagonal_char = grid[0][0]\n\nnon_diagonal_char = None\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diagonal_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit\n\n        else:\n\n            if non_diagonal_char is None:\n\n                non_diagonal_char = grid[i][j]\n\n            else:\n\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diagonal_char:\n\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\n                    exit\n\nBut then, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So in our case, for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So for example, in n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So the code will find non_diagonal_char.\n\nBut what if the first non-diagonal cell is not found? For example, if n is 1. But the code is given n >=3. So no problem.\n\nBut then, after checking all the cells, we need to check that non_diagonal_char is different from diagonal_char.\n\nSo after that, check if diagonal_char != non_diagonal_char.\n\nIf all that is true, then output YES, else NO.\n\nBut what about cases where all the non-diagonal cells are same as the diagonal_char? Then the code would check that non_diagonal_char is same as diagonal_char, and thus return NO.\n\nYes.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the non-diagonal cells are empty? Well, for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So the code will process them.\n\nBut what if the non-diagonal cells are not present? Well, for n=1, but the input constraints say n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut in code, for example, when n=3, the code checks for all cells. For the first non-diagonal cell, it is set. So the code should work.\n\nLet me test with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nNow, the diagonals are:\n\ncells where i==j or i+j=4.\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (i==j) and i=0, j=4 (i + j = 4). So first row: x and x.\n\nSecond row: i=1, j=1 (x) and j=3 (x). So those are part of diagonals.\n\nThird row: i=2, j=2 (x) and i=2, j=2 (since i + j = 2+2=4? For n=5, n-1=4. So yes. So i=2, j=2 is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo for the third row, the cell (2,2) is x. But the other cells in row 2 are s, o, x, o, o. So the cell (2,0) is s, which is not on any diagonal. So the non-diagonal cells include s, etc.\n\nSo in the first sample input, the diagonals are all x? Let's see:\n\nLooking at row 0: first and last are x.\n\nRow 1: positions (1,1) and (1,3) are x and x.\n\nRow 2: (2,2) is x. Also, (2, 2) is part of the diagonals. What about (2, 2) is part of both.\n\nRow 3: (3,1) and (3,3) are x and x.\n\nRow 4: (4,0) and (4,4) are x and x.\n\nBut what about the cell (2, 2) is x. So all diagonals are x. But in row 2, there's a cell (2,0) which is s. Which is non-diagonal. So the non-diagonal_char would be s. But then, in the non-diagonal cells, there are other letters. For example, in row 0, j=1,2,3 are o, o, o. So non-diagonal_char would be o. But in row 2, j=0 is s. So the code would check that all non-diagonal cells are same. But here, there are some o's and s. So the code would detect that during the loop. For example, in row 2, cell (2,0) is s. Then, the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is o. Then, when processing (2,0), which is s, the code checks if it's equal to non_diagonal_char (o). Since it's not, the code returns NO. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nSo the first sample input gives NO.\n\nSecond sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are cells (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2).\n\nSo the cells are:\n\n(0,0): w\n\n(0,2): w\n\n(1,1): w\n\n(2,0): w\n\n(2,2): w\n\nSo all diagonals are w. Then, the non-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1): s\n\n(1,0): s\n\n(1,2): s\n\n(2,1): s\n\nSo all non-diagonal cells are s. And s != w. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input is:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals are (0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So the diagonals have x, x, x, x, e. So during the check, the first diagonal cell is x. The cell (2,2) is e, which is not equal to x. So the code would detect that and return NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as a list of strings, but in the problem statement, the input is given as first line n, then n lines each with n letters.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Each of the next n lines contains n letters.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nWait, that's probably a mistake in the way the sample input is presented. But in reality, the code should read from standard input. So the code will read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut the sample input is given as a list of test cases. But the actual code should read from stdin. So for example, in the code, the user would input n, then n lines, etc.\n\nBut the code needs to process multiple test cases? Wait no. Wait the sample input shows that the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of inputs, like:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. But the actual problem says that the input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, each with their own input. However, the code is supposed to process one test case at a time. So the code must read from stdin, which for the problem is one test case. But perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but in practice, the code should read one test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the code should read one n, then n lines. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the code is supposed to read one test case. However, in the sample input, the output is given as a list of outputs for each input. So in practice, the code should process one test case. But how to handle multiple test cases?\n\nWait, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So in programming competition problems, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases. However, the problem's input format says that each test case is given as n followed by n lines. So the code must process exactly one test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first line is a list of three test cases. But perhaps that's a formatting error. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code should process them one by one. However, in programming competition problems, the code usually reads from standard input, which is given as a single test case. However, in the problem statement, the sample input is written in a way that suggests that the code is to process multiple test cases. But that's not the case. The problem's input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, but the code is supposed to process one.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nWhich implies that the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as three separate test cases. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThird test case is:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is described as the first line being n, then n lines. Which suggests that each test case is given as such. So the code must read multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement may not have mentioned that. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. That's probably a mistake in the way the sample is presented. For example, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code must process them. But how would that be possible? Because the problem's input description says that the code must read one test case. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual problem. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases, but the problem statement doesn't mention that.\n\nBut looking at the sample output, it's a list of outputs for each input. So the code should process multiple test cases. But the problem statement's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. Which implies that the code should read one test case. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is given as three separate test cases, and the output is three answers.\n\nBut how to read that? Well, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases until EOF. But in programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem expects that.\n\nBut the original problem's input description may be incorrect. However, the user provided the sample input and output as lists. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut the user's note says that the problem is a hard question. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as a single string. For example, the first input line is a string that starts with n, then the next n lines. But in the sample input, the first element is '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox' which represents n=5 followed by 5 lines.\n\nSo in code, the input is read as a series of test cases, each being a single string. But how to process that? For example, the code may need to read from stdin, but in practice, the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code must read all test cases, each of which is given as n followed by n lines. So the code must read until EOF.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the code reads all lines at once, then processes them.\n\nBut perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases and outputs. But this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a mistake. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\".\n\nSo the code must process one test case. So the sample input is probably written in a way that each test case is given as a separate input. But the code is supposed to process one test case. So the sample input is three separate test cases, but the code must read one test case. But why would the sample input show three test cases? Perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the code is supposed to read one.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code must read from stdin and output to stdout. So for example, in the sample input, the code is given three test cases, but the code must process each of them. However, that's not clear from the problem statement. But given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So for multiple test cases, the code would read n, then n lines, then another n, then n lines, etc.\n\nSo, the code should process multiple test cases. For example, in Python, read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut how to read the input properly. For example, in the sample input, each test case is given as a single string, such as '5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox' which is n=5 followed by five lines. So in code, the code can read all the input as a list of lines, and process each test case.\n\nBut how to do that in Python.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given as per the input description.\n\nBut how to know when to stop reading? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the code reads until EOF. So the code would read all the input, split into test cases, and process each.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving the problem, perhaps the code should read one test case. But the sample input and output suggest that multiple test cases are processed. However, the original problem statement says that the code should process one test case.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. But given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nBut how to read multiple test cases in Python? For example, in the code, read all lines from stdin, then process them.\n\nBut the code can read all lines at once, then process them in groups.\n\nFor example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, process the lines as per test cases.\n\nBut for each test case, the first line is n, then n lines follow. So for example, the first test case is:\n\nn = int(lines[0])\n\nthen the next n lines are lines[1 ... n], then the next test case starts at line n+1.\n\nSo the code can process the lines in a loop.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nBut given the sample input, the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original description says that the code is supposed to process one test case. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the sample input and output show three test cases. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original statement may not have mentioned that. But given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut in that case, the code must read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut the problem statement's input description says that the first line is n. So the code must process multiple test cases, each with their own n and grid.\n\nSo, in code, the approach is:\n\nRead all input lines.\n\nProcess each test case by reading n, then the next n lines.\n\nBut how to do that in code.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndata = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, process data as a list of lines.\n\nThen, for each test case, take the first line as n, then take the next n lines as the grid.\n\nBut the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for the first test case, the input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the code must read each test case in sequence.\n\nThus, the code can process the data as follows:\n\ncurrent_line = 0\n\nwhile current_line < len(data):\n\n    n = int(data[current_line])\n\n    current_line +=1\n\n    grid = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        grid.append(data[current_line])\n\n        current_line +=1\n\n    # process grid and n\n\nSo for each test case, process it.\n\nBut then, the code must process multiple test cases. But the problem's original input description says that the code must process one test case. However, given the sample input and output, this seems necessary.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the sample input and output are given as lists, which may be a formatting issue. But given the sample input, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nNow, back to the problem.\n\nSo, the code must process each test case, and for each, determine whether the grid forms an 'X'.\n\nNow, for each grid, the code must check:\n\nAll diagonal cells are same, all non-diagonal are same, and different.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef is_x(grid, n):\n\n    # check diagonals\n\n    diagonal_char = grid[0][0]\n\n    non_diagonal_char = None\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n                if grid[i][j] != diagonal_char:\n\n                    return False\n\n            else:\n\n                if non_diagonal_char is None:\n\n                    non_diagonal_char = grid[i][j]\n\n                else:\n\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diagonal_char:\n\n                        return False\n\n    if non_diagonal_char is None:\n\n        # all cells are diagonal? Not possible for n >=3.\n\n        # for example, n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\n        return False\n\n    return diagonal_char != non_diagonal_char\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, the code will process the non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, for each test case, after reading the grid, call this function. If returns True, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut what about cases where the non_diagonal_char is not set? For example, if all cells are on diagonals. But for n >=3, this is not possible.\n\nFor example, for n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells. The total is 9, so 4 non-diagonal. So non_diagonal_char will be set.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nBut what about the case where the non-diagonal cells are empty? Well, no.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, testing this function.\n\nIn the first sample input, the first test case:\n\ngrid is:\n\n['xooox', 'oxoxo', 'soxoo', 'oxoxo', 'xooox']\n\nn=5.\n\nThe first diagonal cell is grid[0][0] = 'x'.\n\nThen, for cell (2,0) which is 's', which is not on a diagonal. So non_diagonal_char is set to 'o' (from (0,1)). Then, when processing cell (2,0) which is 's', which is not equal to 'o', returns False. So the function returns False, hence output is NO.\n\nIn the second test case, grid is:\n\n['wsw', 'sws', 'wsw']\n\nn=3.\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0) = 'w', (0,2) = 'w', (1,1) = 'w', (2,0) = 'w', (2,2) = 'w'. All are 'w'. Non-diagonal cells are (0,1) = 's', (1,0) = 's', (1,2) = 's', (2,1) = 's'. So non_diagonal_char is 's', and 'w' != 's' → returns True. So output YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\ngrid is ['xpx', 'pxp', 'xpe']\n\nn=3.\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0)=x, (0,2)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,0)=x, (2,2)=e. So during the check, when i=2, j=2, the code checks if grid[2][2] is equal to diagonal_char (x). It's e, so returns False. Hence output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut what about when the non-diagonal cells are same as diagonal_char?\n\nFor example, n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen, all cells are on diagonals? No. For n=3, the non-diagonal cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). So in this case, the non_diagonal_char is 'a', same as diagonal_char. So the function returns False. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, grid is:\n\naxa\n\nxaa\n\naxa\n\nThen the diagonals are a, a, a, a, a. The non-diagonal cells are x, x, x, x. So non_diagonal_char is x. So returns True. Hence output YES.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut need to read multiple test cases.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each test case.\n\nNow, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(data):\n\n        n = int(data[idx])\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(data[idx])\n\n            idx += 1\n\n        # process grid\n\n        # check if it's X\n\n        diagonal_char = grid[0][0]\n\n        non_diagonal_char = None\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n                    if grid[i][j] != diagonal_char:\n\n                        valid = False\n\n                        break\n\n                else:\n\n                    if non_diagonal_char is None:\n\n                        non_diagonal_char = grid[i][j]\n\n                    else:\n\n                        if grid[i][j] != non_diagonal_char:\n\n                            valid = False\n\n                            break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            if non_diagonal_char is None:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n            else:\n\n                if diagonal_char != non_diagonal_char:\n\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n                else:\n\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if non_diagonal_char is None? That can only happen if there are no non-diagonal cells. Which for n >=3 is impossible. So perhaps that check is redundant. But in code, for example, if n=1, but the code is given n=3, etc. So in the code, the non_diagonal_char is set, since for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut during the loops, for example, if all cells are on diagonals (which is not possible for n >=3), then non_diagonal_char remains None. But in that case, the code would print 'NO' because non_diagonal_char is None. However, for n >=3, this is not possible. But code-wise, it's better to handle that case.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, n is at least 3. So the code can assume that non_diagonal_char is not None. But during the processing, in case of some error, the code can check.\n\nBut in the code above, after processing the grid, the code checks if non_diagonal_char",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The grid forms an \"X\" if all cells on both diagonals are the same letter, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) are the same letter but different from the diagonal letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the input values which include multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: For each grid, check if all cells on both diagonals (main diagonal and anti-diagonal) are the same letter.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Ensure that all non-diagonal cells are the same letter and different from the diagonal letter.\n4. **Validation**: If both checks pass, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(data):\n        n = int(data[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(data[idx])\n            idx += 1\n        \n        diagonal_char = grid[0][0]\n        non_diagonal_char = None\n        valid = True\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    if grid[i][j] != diagonal_char:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                else:\n                    if non_diagonal_char is None:\n                        non_diagonal_char = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        if grid[i][j] != non_diagonal_char:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        \n        if not valid:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if non_diagonal_char is None or diagonal_char == non_diagonal_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing. Each test case is processed sequentially.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The main diagonal is identified by cells where the row index equals the column index (`i == j`). The anti-diagonal is identified by cells where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1` (`i + j == n - 1`). All these cells must be the same character.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Cells not on either diagonal must all be the same character, which is different from the character used on the diagonals.\n4. **Validation**: After checking both diagonals and non-diagonal cells, the result is printed as \"YES\" if all conditions are met, otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the required conditions for each grid, adhering to the constraints and providing the correct results for each test case.",
