Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. Let me think about the requirements.\n\nThe problem says that the letters form an X if two conditions are met. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right. The other diagonal is top-right to bottom-left. All the cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping cells? Since n is odd, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is on both diagonals. So, all the cells on both diagonals must be the same. So, for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the other diagonal has 'y', then that's invalid. But if both diagonals have 'x', then the center cell is part of both, so it's okay.\n\nSo first step: check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n\nSecond step: check that all other cells (those not on either diagonal) are the same character 'o', and that 'o' is not equal to 'd'.\n\nSo how do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the input. The first line is n, then n lines of n characters each.\n\n2. For each cell in the grid, determine if it's on either of the two diagonals.\n\nFor a cell at (i, j) (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), let's think. Let's assume 0-based indices.\n\nIn a square matrix, the main diagonal is where i == j. The other diagonal is where i + j == n - 1. Because for 0-based indices, the top-right corner is (0, n-1), and bottom-left is (n-1, 0). So for any cell (i,j), if i + j equals n-1, it's on the anti-diagonal.\n\nSo for each cell, if it's on either of the two diagonals, it's part of the diagonals. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal area.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think. For each cell (i, j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1 → part of diagonals.\n\nElse → part of non-diagonals.\n\nSo first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal character as the reference. Then check that all other diagonal characters are the same as this.\n\nSimilarly for the non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut wait, the diagonals might have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x' as well. Then that's okay. But if one is 'x' and the other is 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo first, check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. So collect all the diagonal cells and check they are the same.\n\nSo for example, for the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the diagonals would be:\n\nFirst row: x (i=0, j=0) and (0,4) → x and x.\n\nSecond row: (1,1) is o, (1,3) is o.\n\nThird row: (2,2) is x. (2, 2) is also part of both diagonals? Wait for n=5, i + j = 4. For i=2, j=2 → 2+2=4 → yes. So the center cell is part of both diagonals.\n\nSo the diagonals for this sample:\n\nLooking at each cell on the diagonals:\n\nRow 0: positions 0 and 4 → x and x.\n\nRow 1: positions 1 and 3 → o and o.\n\nRow 2: position 2 (since i=j=2, and i+j=4) → x.\n\nRow 3: positions 1 and 3 → o and o.\n\nRow 4: positions 0 and 4 → x and x.\n\nSo the diagonal characters are x, o, x, o, x, o, x, o, x? Wait, no. Let me count:\n\nFor each cell on the diagonals:\n\nIn row 0: (0,0) and (0,4) → x and x.\n\nRow 1: (1,1) and (1,3) → o and o.\n\nRow 2: (2,2) → x.\n\nRow 3: (3,1) and (3,3) → o and o.\n\nRow 4: (4,0) and (4,4) → x and x.\n\nSo total of 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 9 cells. Which is correct since for n=5, the number of cells on the diagonals is 2n - 1 (since the center is counted once). So 2*5-1=9.\n\nSo the diagonal characters are x, x, o, o, x, o, o, x, x? Or maybe I should collect all the characters on the diagonals and check if they are all the same. In this case, the first cell is x, then o, then x, etc. So there are multiple different characters. So the first sample input would not satisfy the first condition. Hence output is NO, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the first step is to check that all the diagonal cells have the same character.\n\nOnce that is done, check that all non-diagonal cells have the same character, different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo how to proceed:\n\n- Iterate through all cells.\n\n- For each cell, check if it is on a diagonal. If yes, collect it into the diagonal set. Else, collect into non-diagonal set.\n\nBut perhaps more efficiently, we can check:\n\n- Find the first diagonal cell's character. Then check that all other diagonal cells are the same as this. Similarly for the non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut what if the first diagonal cell is part of the non-diagonal? No, because the first cell is (0,0), which is on the main diagonal.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Check if all diagonal cells are same. Let's get the first diagonal cell's value (say, diag_char). Then for every other cell on the diagonals, check if they are equal to diag_char. If any is not, return NO.\n\n2. Then check all non-diagonal cells. Get the first non-diagonal cell's value (non_diag_char). Then check that all other non-diagonal cells are equal to non_diag_char. Also, check that non_diag_char != diag_char. If any of these conditions fail, return NO.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells (each diagonal has 3, but overlapping in the center). So non-diagonal cells are 9 - 5 = 4 cells. So for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo how to find the first non-diagonal cell? For example, in the first sample input, the first non-diagonal cell would be (0,1) (since (0,0) is diagonal, (0,1) is not. Let's check for (0,1): i=0, j=1. i + j = 1, which is not equal to n-1 (which is 4). And i !=j. So yes, it's non-diagonal.\n\nSo for the first non-diagonal cell, we can iterate through the grid until we find the first cell that's not on a diagonal. Once found, take that character as the non_diag_char. Then check all other non-diagonal cells against it.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo the steps for code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n. Let's store them as a list of lists, grid.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck for all diagonal cells:\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for j in 0..n-1:\n\n      if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n          if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n              return NO\n\nThen check for non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diag_char = ?\n\nWe need to find the first cell that is not on the diagonal. For example, check (0,1) first. If that's not on a diagonal, then take it. Else, check (0,2), etc.\n\nOnce we have non_diag_char, check all non-diagonal cells are equal to it, and that it's different from diag_char.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell?\n\nWell, for the first row, the first cell that's not on the diagonal. For example, in row 0, j=0 is diagonal. j=1 is not, since 0+1 = 1 != n-1 (for n >=3, n-1 is 2 or higher). So for row 0, j=1 is non-diagonal. So the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1).\n\nBut wait, for n=3, the first row is (0,0) (diagonal), (0,1) (non-diagonal?), (0,2) (diagonal). So (0,1) is non-diagonal. So yes.\n\nSo for the first non-diagonal cell, we can check (0,1) first. If that's not on the diagonal, then take it. Else, check (0,2), etc. But for n >=3, (0,1) is not on the diagonal.\n\nWait, for i=0, j=1: i + j = 1. For n >=3, n-1 is >=2. So i + j is 1 < n-1. So (0,1) is not on the diagonal. So the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1). So in code, we can take that as the first non-diagonal cell.\n\nBut what if the first non-diagonal cell is not (0,1)? Like, for example, if n=3, and the first row is all diagonal. But no, in the first row, (0,0) is diagonal, (0,1) is non-diagonal, (0,2) is diagonal. So (0,1) is non-diagonal.\n\nSo in code, for the first non-diagonal cell, we can check (0,1). Then, if that's not on the diagonal, take it. Otherwise, check (0,2) etc. But for n >=3, (0,1) is not on the diagonal.\n\nSo for code, we can take the first non-diagonal cell as (0,1). But perhaps in some cases, like when n=3, the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1). So, in code:\n\nnon_diag_char = grid[0][1]\n\nBut then, we need to check that this cell is indeed not on the diagonal. Well, for n >=3, (0,1) is not on the diagonal. Because for i=0, j=1: i != j (since 0 != 1), and i + j = 1, which is not equal to n-1 (which is 2 for n=3). So yes, it's non-diagonal.\n\nSo, once we have non_diag_char, then check that all non-diagonal cells are equal to it. Also, check that non_diag_char != diag_char.\n\nBut how to check all non-diagonal cells?\n\nLoop through all cells, check if it's not on the diagonal. For each such cell, check if it's equal to non_diag_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3, so for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So no problem.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid as list of strings.\n\nCheck for diagonals:\n\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit\n\nThen check non-diagonal cells:\n\nnon_diag_char = grid[0][1]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n            if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n                exit\n\nif non_diag_char == diag_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but what if the non-diagonal cells are empty? Well, no, for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut what if all non-diagonal cells are same, but same as diag_char?\n\nLike, for example, if all cells are same. Then the diagonals are same, and non-diagonal cells are same, but same as diag_char. So the answer is NO.\n\nSo in code, after checking that all non-diagonal cells are same, check that they are different from diag_char.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nOnce we have checked that all non-diagonal cells are same as non_diag_char, then check if non_diag_char != diag_char.\n\nIf that is true, then YES, else NO.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nTest case 1: n=3, all diagonals are 'x', non-diagonal are 'o' → YES.\n\nTest case 2: n=3, diagonals are 'x', non-diagonal are 'x' → NO (because same as diag).\n\nTest case 3: diagonals are 'x' and 'y' → NO.\n\nAnother case: non-diagonal cells have different characters. For example, one is 'a', another is 'b' → NO.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nThe input is given as a list of strings, but according to the sample input, the first line is n, then n lines of n characters each.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWait, but that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. But the actual input for the program is from stdin. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. So for example, the first line is n, then n lines of strings.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is 5 followed by 5 lines, then another input is 3 followed by 3 lines, etc. But the sample shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, but looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as a list of inputs. But the actual problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. For example, the sample input shows three separate test cases, each with their own input, and the output is three corresponding outputs.\n\nBut in reality, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem would be one test case. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input seems to be multiple test cases, but perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n ... \n\nSo for each test case, the input is n followed by n lines. So the code should process one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases, but the output shows three answers. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code can process multiple test cases, but the problem statement isn't clear. However, looking back at the problem statement, the sample input is written as a list of input strings, but the actual code is supposed to process a single input.\n\nWait, the original problem's sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nBut that's probably not the actual input format. It's more likely that the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code is supposed to process each of them. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample shows three test cases, which suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is conflicting. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer n ... \n\nEach of the next n lines contains n small letters...\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. But the sample shows multiple test cases. However, the sample output is given as a list of outputs. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code is to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases. For example, the first input line is 5 followed by 5 lines, then another input line is 3 followed by 3 lines, etc. But in practice, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases. However, the problem statement is not clear on this. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is given as a list of test cases, and the output is a list of answers. But for the programming competition problem, it's more likely that the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nWhich seems to be a list of three test cases. But in reality, the code should read from stdin, which would be, for example, the first line is n, then n lines, then another n, etc. But how can we know?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. So for example, the input is a single test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. However, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. But how to reconcile this?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases. The sample output is a list of three answers. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line is n. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous.\n\nWait, looking at the original problem statement again:\n\nThe input is described as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n... Each of the next n lines contains n letters...\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. However, the sample shows three test cases. But in the problem's sample input, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases. For example, the first line is the number of test cases, then each test case is given. However, the problem's input description does not mention that. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a representation of the input as a list of strings. For example, the first input is the string \"5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox\", then the second is \"3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw\", etc. But in reality, the code should read from stdin as per the problem's input description.\n\nThis is a critical point. Because if the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, the code will need to read all of them. But if the code is supposed to process a single test case, then the sample input is perhaps a mistake.\n\nLooking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample input:\n\nThe input is given as three separate test cases. The output is three separate answers. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, then n lines. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that each test case is provided as a separate input. But the code should process one test case. However, the sample output shows three answers. This is very confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original statement, the sample input and output are given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut this is likely a formatting mistake. Because in programming competition problems, the input is typically one test case per run. However, the sample input is presented as a list of inputs, which may be a mistake. But given that the sample output is a list of answers, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is n, followed by n lines, then another line with n, etc. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThen the third test case is:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo the code should process multiple test cases. But how many? How to read them?\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, which suggests that the code is to process a single test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample output, which is ['NO', 'YES', 'NO'], which corresponds to the three test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is not clear on this. But given the sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the problem statement again, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, which may be a way to represent that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description is not clear. But given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, I think that the code must handle multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases, but the problem's input description is wrong. For example, the code should read t test cases, but the problem's input doesn't mention t. Alternatively, perhaps the code should process all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut without more information, perhaps I should look back at the original problem's sample input and output.\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three inputs. Each input represents a separate test case. For example, the first input is for n=5, then the next for n=3, etc. So the code must read multiple test cases. However, how to know how many test cases there are?\n\nIn programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, and the code must read until EOF. For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases.\n\nBut how to parse the input. For example, each test case starts with an integer n, then n lines of n characters each. So the code can read the input line by line, processing each test case as follows:\n\nRead n, then read n lines, then process, then repeat until no more input.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen comes another test case with n=3, then another with n=3.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, and process each test case until there is no more input.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n, which suggests that it's a single test case. However, the sample input suggests that multiple test cases are present.\n\nThis is a problem. But given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle this in Python? Well, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them as per test cases.\n\nBut how to read the input properly.\n\nFor example, the code could read all lines into a list, then process them sequentially.\n\nLet me think. For example, the code can read all lines into a list, then process them as follows:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, process the lines as per test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach test case starts with a line containing n. Then n lines follow.\n\nSo, for example, the code can have a pointer i starting at 0. While i < len(lines):\n\n   read n = int(lines[i])\n\n   i += 1\n\n   read next n lines as the grid.\n\n   process the grid.\n\n   i += n\n\nSo the code can process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n. So perhaps the code is supposed to process only one test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases.\n\nThis is very confusing. However, looking at the sample output, which is a list of outputs, and the sample input is a list of inputs, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, I think that the code should process multiple test cases, reading each one as per the input format.\n\nBut the problem's original input description is unclear. However, given the sample input and output, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them as per the test cases.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[ptr])\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[ptr])\n\n            ptr += 1\n\n        # process grid\n\n        # compute and print result\n\nBut then, for each test case, process the grid.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the input is not properly formatted. However, the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nNow, for the code for processing a single test case.\n\nSo, inside the loop for each test case:\n\nCheck the diagonals and non-diagonals.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef is_x(grid, n):\n\n    # check diagonals\n\n    diag_char = grid[0][0]\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n                if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                    return False\n\n    # check non-diagonal cells\n\n    # find first non-diagonal cell\n\n    # (0, 1) is non-diagonal\n\n    # check if it's non-diagonal\n\n    # for n >=3, it's non-diagonal.\n\n    non_diag_char = grid[0][1]\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n                if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n\n                    return False\n\n    if non_diag_char == diag_char:\n\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? For n=1, but n is at least 3.\n\nSo in the code, for the non-diagonal check, we have to ensure that all non-diagonal cells are same and different from diag_char.\n\nSo in the code, for each test case, after reading the grid, call this function and print YES or NO accordingly.\n\nBut what if the grid is empty? Well, n is at least 3.\n\nBut for example, for the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=5\n\ngrid:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\nCheck for each cell on the diagonals.\n\nFirst row: x and x (positions 0,0 and 0,4).\n\nSecond row: o and o (positions 1,1 and 1,3).\n\nThird row: position 2,2 is x.\n\nFourth row: o and o (positions 3,1 and 3,3).\n\nFifth row: x and x.\n\nBut the third row's first cell is 's' (i=2, j=0) is not on the diagonal. But the cell (2,2) is x. But the cell (2,0) is not on the diagonal. So the code checks for all cells on the diagonals. So for the third row, the cell (2,2) is on the diagonal. What about the cell (2,0)? It's not on the diagonal. So the code checks for all diagonal cells.\n\nBut in the third row, the cell (2,2) is x. But in the first row, the first cell is x, and others are o, etc. But in this test case, the diagonals have x and o. For example, the cell (1,1) is o. So the code would detect that the diagonals are not all same. So returns false.\n\nThus, the first test case returns NO.\n\nIn the second sample input, the grid is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nrow 0: w s w\n\nrow 1: s w s\n\nrow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0) = w, (0,2) = w.\n\ncells (1,1) = w.\n\ncells (2,0) = w, (2,2) = w.\n\nSo all diagonals are w.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are:\n\ncells (0,1) = s.\n\ncells (1,0) = s, (1,2) = s.\n\ncells (2,1) = s.\n\nSo non-diagonal cells are all s. Which is different from w. So returns YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nrow 0: x p x\n\nrow 1: p x p\n\nrow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals are:\n\n(0,0) = x, (0,2) = x.\n\n(1,1) = x.\n\n(2,0) = x, (2,2) = e.\n\nSo the diagonals have x, x, x, x, e. So the code checks if all diagonal cells are same. The first diagonal cell is x. The cell (2,2) is e, which is not equal to x. So returns false. Hence output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement this logic.\n\nBut in Python, the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[ptr])\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[ptr])\n\n            ptr += 1\n\n        # process grid\n\n        # check diagonals\n\n        diag_char = grid[0][0]\n\n        valid = True\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n                    if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n\n                        valid = False\n\n                        break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        # check non-diagonal cells\n\n        # find first non-diagonal cell (0,1)\n\n        non_diag_char = grid[0][1]\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if not (i == j or i + j == n-1):\n\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n\n                        valid = False\n\n                        break\n\n            if not valid:\n\n                break\n\n        if not valid:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            continue\n\n        if non_diag_char == diag_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the first non-diagonal cell is not present? But n >=3, so for the first row, (0,1) is not on the diagonal. So the code can safely take grid[0][1].\n\nBut what if the grid is empty? No, since n is at least 3.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=5, grid as before. The code checks the diagonals. For i=0, j=0, it's x. Then, for i=0, j=4 (i + j = 4, n-1=4). So grid[0][4] is x. Then i=1, j=1: o. Which is not equal to diag_char (x). So valid becomes false. So print NO.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe diagonals are all w. Then non-diagonal cells are s. So check that all non-diagonal cells are s. Then compare s != w. So YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) = x, (0,2)=x.\n\n(1,1) =x.\n\n(2,0)=x, (2,2)=e. So during the check for diagonals, when i=2, j=2, grid[i][j] is e != x. So valid becomes false, print NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all cells are x. Then diagonals are x, but non-diagonal cells are x. So non_diag_char is x, which equals diag_char. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are x, non-diagonal are y. Output YES.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code needs to be written in Python.\n\nBut in the code, the grid is stored as a list of strings. So for grid[i][j], it's correct.\n\nNow, what about cases where the non-diagonal cells are not all same?\n\nFor example, n=3, grid:\n\nxax\n\naxa\n\nxax\n\nThe diagonals are x. The non-diagonal cells are a, a, a, a. So all are a. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: non-diagonal cells have different letters. For example, grid:\n\nxax\n\naxb\n\nxax\n\nThen during the non-diagonal check, the cell (1,1) is x (part of diagonal?), no. Wait, for i=1, j=1 is diagonal. So the non-diagonal cells are (0,1) = a, (1,0) = a, (1,2) = b, (2,1) = a. So during the check, the code would check for (1,2) which is b. The first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is a. So during the check, the code would find that (1,2) is b != a, so returns NO.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code is ready.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other characters (those not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the input values which include multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: For each test case, check if all characters on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Check if all characters not on the diagonals are the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n        n = int(lines[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(lines[ptr])\n            ptr += 1\n        \n        # Check diagonals\n        diag_char = grid[0][0]\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Check non-diagonal cells\n        non_diag_char = grid[0][1]\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        \n        if non_diag_char == diag_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of strings, where each string represents a line from the input. This allows us to handle multiple test cases efficiently.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: We iterate through each cell in the grid to check if it lies on either of the two diagonals. If any cell on these diagonals does not match the first diagonal character (`diag_char`), the test case is immediately deemed invalid.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: After confirming the diagonals are consistent, we check the non-diagonal cells. The first non-diagonal cell is taken as the reference character (`non_diag_char`). If any non-diagonal cell does not match this reference, the test case is invalid.\n4. **Final Check**: Ensure that the non-diagonal character is different from the diagonal character. If all checks pass, the result is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently validate each test case by leveraging direct checks on the grid structure, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
