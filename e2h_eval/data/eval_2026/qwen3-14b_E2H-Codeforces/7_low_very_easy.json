The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake is built in a certain way, and we need to check if such a graph can have exactly n vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the snowflake. Let me re-read the description.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, that initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so those leaves) are connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So, the process is like building layers. Each time, all the leaves (vertices with degree 1) get new children. But the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, each of those leaves (the first layer) must be expanded again. So, the snowflake has to have at least two layers of expansion.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's model it.\n\nLet's think of the snowflake as being built in stages. Let's say that the initial stage (stage 0) has 1 node. Then, in stage 1, we add k nodes connected to the root. So total nodes after stage 1 is 1 + k. But then, for stage 2, each of the k nodes from stage 1 (which are leaves) will have k new children. So adding k * k nodes. Total nodes after stage 2: 1 + k + k^2. Then, if we do another stage (stage 3), each of those k^2 nodes would get k children, adding k^3 nodes. So total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding new vertices to the leaves must be done at least once. So, the minimal snowflake is when we have two stages. For example, with k=4, the minimal snowflake would have 1 + 4 + 4^2 = 21 nodes? Wait, but the example input says that for n=6, the answer is NO. Let me check the sample input.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample input includes n=6, output is NO. Let's think. For example, if k=2, then possible stages:\n\nStage 1: 1 + 2 = 3 nodes. Then stage 2 adds 2*2=4 nodes. Total 3+4=7. So 7 nodes. But maybe there's another way?\n\nWait, the problem says that the step of adding new vertices to leaves is done at least once. So, the process must have at least two steps. So the minimal is when you have two steps. So the initial step (adding k children) is the first step, then the second step is adding k children to each of the leaves from the first step. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k*k.\n\nBut for example, for k=2, that's 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. For k=3, it's 1+3+9=13. Which matches the sample input where n=13 outputs YES. So that's the case.\n\nSo the snowflake can be constructed with any number of stages (layers) as long as there are at least two stages. So the total number of nodes is the sum of a geometric series. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet m be the number of stages. The first stage is adding k children to the root. Then each subsequent stage adds k times the previous stage's number of leaves. So for m stages, the total number of nodes is:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{m} k^i ?\n\nWait, no. Because the initial node is 1, then in stage 1 (first expansion) we add k nodes. Stage 2 adds k * k nodes. Stage 3 adds k^3 nodes. So the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. But the number of stages m must be at least 2. Because the step of expanding the leaves must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step is adding the first k nodes. Then the next step is expanding the leaves (which are those k nodes) once. So the minimal is m=2. So the total is 1 + k + k^2. So the sum S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) ?\n\nYes. Because the sum of a geometric series from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). But in our case, the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. So for m stages, where the first",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a \"snowflake\" graph as defined. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, starting with one vertex and expanding in layers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers. Each layer adds `k` new vertices to every leaf node from the previous layer. This process must be done at least once after the initial expansion.\n2. **Geometric Series Insight**: The total number of vertices after `m` layers (with `m ≥ 2`) can be represented as a geometric series sum: `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`. This sum can be expressed as `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n3. **Check for Valid `k`**: For each given `n`, we need to check if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that `n` can be represented as the sum of a geometric series with at least two terms. This involves iterating through possible values of `k` and checking if `n` fits the series sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    # Try all possible k > 1\n    # We need to check for any k > 1, whether there exists m >= 2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n\n    # Which is equivalent to (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1) = n\n    # So for each k, check if there's some m >= 2 such that this equation holds\n    # But since n can be up to 1e18, we need to iterate k efficiently\n    # Let's try k from 2 up to sqrt(n) or similar\n    max_k = int(math.isqrt(n)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        # Check if there exists m >= 2 such that (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k-1) == n\n        # We can compute the sum incrementally until it exceeds n\n        total = 1  # sum for m=0\n        m = 0\n        while True:\n            m += 1\n            total += k ** m\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            elif total > n:\n                break\n    # Also check for cases where m=1 (but according to problem statement, m must be >=2)\n    # Wait, no.
