And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The problem says that each week is k consecutive days, and for each of those weeks, I have to compute the average sleep time. Then, I have to find the average of all those averages. Oh right, but wait, the example shows that for the third input, they sum all the weeks' totals and divide by the number of weeks. Wait, because the average of averages is the same as the total sum divided by the number of weeks, right? Because each week's average is sum of that week divided by k. Then the average of all those averages would be (sum of all the week sums) / (k * number of weeks). But wait, the problem says that the answer is the average of all the weeks' averages. So for each week, compute the average (sum of k days divided by k), then take the average of all those values. Which is equivalent to (total sum of all the weeks' sums) divided by (k * number of weeks). But since each week is k days, the total sum of all weeks' sums is the sum of each window of k days. So the problem reduces to calculating the sum of all those window sums, then dividing by (k * number_of_weeks). But since the number of weeks is (n - k + 1), that's the denominator.\n\nBut how do I compute the sum of all the window sums efficiently?\n\nBecause n can be up to 2e5, and k can be up to n. So a naive approach where I compute each window sum by adding up k elements each time would be O(nk), which would be 4e10 operations in worst case. That's way too slow. So I need a more efficient way.\n\nSo the standard approach for sliding window sums is to use a prefix sum array. Let me think. For example, the sum of the first window (days 1 to k) is sum(a[0..k-1]). The next window is sum(a[1..k]), etc. The prefix sum array can help compute each window sum in O(1) time. Then, the total sum of all window sums can be computed by iterating through each window and adding their sums. That would be O(n) time.\n\nYes. Let's think about how to compute that.\n\nLet's create a prefix sum array, where prefix[i] is the sum of the first i elements. So prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc. Then, the sum of the window starting at index i (0-based) and of length k is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]. So for each window starting at i (from 0 to n - k), we can compute the sum as prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]. Then, the total sum of all these window sums is the sum over all i from 0 to (n -k) of (prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]).\n\nOnce I have that total sum, the average is (total_sum) / ( (n -k +1) * k ). Because each window's average is (sum)/k, and there are (n -k +1) windows. So the average of all averages is total_sum / ( (n -k +1) * k )\n\nWait, yes. Because each window's average is (sum of window)/k. Then the average of all these averages is (sum of all window sums) / (k * number_of_windows). Because sum of averages is (sum1/k + sum2/k + ... + sum_m/k) where m is the number of windows. Which equals (sum_total) /k. Then divide by m to get the average of averages. So (sum_total)/(k*m). Which is the same as (sum_total) divided by (k*(n -k +1)).\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the sum of all the window sums, then dividing by (k*(n -k +1)).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array.\n\n2. Iterate over each possible window (from i=0 to i = n -k), compute the sum of that window as prefix[i +k] - prefix[i], and add all those together.\n\n3. Divide that total by (k * (n -k +1)).\n\nBut how to compute the prefix sum?\n\nIn Python, for a list a of n elements, the prefix sum can be computed with a list of size n+1, where prefix[0] = 0, and prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1].\n\nOnce that is done, for each window starting at i (0-based), the sum is prefix[i +k] - prefix[i].\n\nSo for example, the first window is i=0, sum is prefix[k] - prefix[0].\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute the sum of all those window sums.\n\nLet me think about the example given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nprefix array would be [0, 3, 7, 14]\n\nThe windows are:\n\ni=0: sum is prefix[2] - prefix[0] = 7 - 0 =7. Then the average is 7/2 = 3.5.\n\ni=1: sum is prefix[3] - prefix[1] =14-3=11. average is 11/2=5.5.\n\nTotal sum of averages is 3.5 +5.5 =9. Divided by 2 (number of weeks) gives 4.5? Wait but the sample output is 9.000000... Wait wait no, the sample output says that for the first input, the output is 9.000000... Wait what's the actual calculation here?\n\nWait the first example input is:\n\nInput is 3 2 and the array [3,4,7]. So the weeks are two days each. The weeks are days 1-2 and days 2-3. The average for the first week is (3+4)/2 = 3.5. The average for the second week is (4+7)/2 = 5.5. The average of these two averages is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 =4.5. But the sample output is 9.000000... Wait that's conflicting. Wait no, looking back at the sample input:\n\nWait the first example's output is '9.0000000000'. Wait that suggests that the answer is 9. But according to my calculation, it's 4.5. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Let me check the first example again.\n\nWait the problem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the example is not given, but the sample input says that the first input's output is 9.000000. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the problem says that Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So for each week, he calculates the average. Then the output is the average of all those averages.\n\nWait in the first sample input, the output is 9.0. But according to the example, the sum of the averages is 3.5 +5.5 =9.0, and the average of that is 9.0 / 2 =4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. So clearly, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"the average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\nWait the problem says that the answer is the average of the averages. But in the sample input, the output is 9.0. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait the sample input says:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output: 9.0000000000.\n\nBut according to the example in the problem statement, when k=2, n=3, a=[3,4,7], the result is ?\n\nThe problem says that the result is \"the result is .\", but the sample input seems to show that the output is 9.0. So perhaps the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the sum of the averages?\n\nWait no. Let me re-examine the note in the problem statement.\n\nIn the third example, the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So the sum of the weeks' averages divided by the number of weeks. Wait, the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Wait, but that would be the average of the weeks' averages. Because each week's average is sum of the week divided by k. So the average of the averages is (sum of all week sums /k ) divided by the number of weeks. Which is (sum of all week sums) / (k * number of weeks).\n\nBut the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which would be the sum of the week sums divided by 7. Which is (sum of all week sums) / (number of weeks). Which would be the average of the week sums. Which would be different than the average of the averages.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem is actually to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the averages. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait let me read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nPolycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n -k +1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k=2, n=3 and a = [3,4,7], then the result is ... \n\nThe problem says that the output is the average sleep time over all weeks. So for each week, the average is (sum of the week)/k. Then, the average of all these averages is the answer. But according to the sample input, in the first case, the output is 9.0. Let's recalculate.\n\nIn the first sample input, the two weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their averages are 3.5 and 5.5. The average of these two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 =4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. So why is that?\n\nAh! Wait perhaps the problem is not asking for the average of the averages, but the average of the sum of the weeks. Because in that case, the sum of the two weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 weeks, that's 9. Which matches the sample output. So that's the case. But why?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nThe problem says that the output is the average sleeping time over all weeks. But what is the average? The problem says that the answer is the average of the averages of each week. But according to the sample input, that's not the case.\n\nWait maybe the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. But that would be the average of the sum, not the average of the averages. So why does the sample output match that?\n\nLet me look at the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output: 9.0000000000.\n\nIf the answer is the average of the sum of each week, then the two weeks have sums 7 and 11. Average is (7+11)/2 = 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut the problem says that the average is the average of the averages. So why is this the case?\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\".\n\nSo for each week, the average is the sum of that week divided by k. Then the overall average is the average of these per-week averages. But according to the sample, that's not what's happening.\n\nBut according to the sample, the output is 9.0, which is the average of the per-week sums. So why is that?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's note:\n\n\"In the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\nAh! So the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which is the average of the sum of each week. So that's the answer. Not the average of the averages. So that's a contradiction with the problem statement.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nBut the sample input shows that the output is 9.0, which is the average of the sum of the weeks.\n\nSo according to the note, the answer is sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which is the average of the sum of each week. But that's not the average of the average per week. So what's the correct approach here?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"the average amount of hours of sleep per week.\"\n\nBut Polycarp is considering each week as k consecutive days. So for each week, the average is the sum of the k days divided by k. Then the overall average is the average of all these per-week averages.\n\nBut according to the note, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which would be the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the averages.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So what's the correct way?\n\nLet me look at the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nThe weeks are:\n\nWeek 1: days 1 and 2 → sum 7 → average 3.5\n\nWeek 2: days 2 and 3 → sum 11 → average 5.5\n\nThe average of these two averages is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5.\n\nBut the sample output is 9.0. Which suggests that the problem is expecting us to compute the average of the sum of the weeks, not the average of the averages. Which would be (7 + 11)/2 = 9.0.\n\nBut why is that?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's description:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"You should write a program which will calculate average sleeping time of Polycarp over all weeks.\"\n\nSo the average of the per-week averages. But according to the sample input, that's not the case. So why?\n\nWait perhaps the problem statement's note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nLooking at the note:\n\n\"In the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\nSo the answer is sum of all weeks divided by number of weeks. Which is the average of the sum of the weeks. Which is not the average of the averages.\n\nSo that suggests that the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which is the same as the sum of all the weeks' sums divided by the number of weeks. Which is different from the average of the averages.\n\nBut why is that?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement:\n\nThe doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). \n\nSo, the average per week. So for each week, compute the average, then compute the average of those averages. But according to the sample input, that's not what's being done.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the average of the total hours per week. Which would be the average of the sum of each week. Which would be the same as the average of the per-week averages multiplied by k. Because the per-week average is sum /k. The average of those is (sum_total / (number_of_weeks *k )).\n\nSo the average of the per-week averages is (sum_total) / (number_of_weeks *k). Which is the same as the average of the sum of the weeks divided by k.\n\nBut according to the sample input, the output is 9.0 which is sum_total / number_of_weeks.\n\nWhich would imply that the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the per-week averages.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the doctor asked for the average amount of hours of sleep per week. So that would be the average of the per-week averages. So why is the sample output different?\n\nThis is confusing. Let's look at the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output: 9.0000000000.\n\nWhich is sum of the weeks (7 + 11 = 18) divided by 2 weeks = 9.0. So that's the average of the sum of the weeks. Which is not the average of the per-week averages. Which would be 4.5. But the sample output says 9.0.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem statement is not correctly described. Or perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement's output description:\n\n\"Output average sleeping time over all weeks.\"\n\nAh! Maybe the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the total sleep time per week. Which would be the sum of the total sleep times divided by the number of weeks. Which is the same as the sample.\n\nSo the problem statement's wording may be ambiguous. However, the sample indicates that the correct answer is the average of the sum of each week. Which is the sum of all the weeks' total sleep time divided by the number of weeks.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input has two weeks. The sum of their total sleep times is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 weeks, that's 9.0. Which is the sample output.\n\nSo the problem is not to compute the average of the per-week averages, but the average of the total sleep time per week. Which is the same as the average of the sum of each week.\n\nBut why does the problem say \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\"?\n\nThat would imply that for each week, you compute the average, and then take the average of those. But perhaps the problem is using \"average\" in a different way. Like, the average over all weeks of the total hours per week. Which is the same as the average of the sum of the weeks.\n\nBut that would be a bit odd. However, the sample indicates that this is the case.\n\nSo the problem requires us to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which is (sum of all the window sums) divided by the number of weeks.\n\nSo the formula is (sum_total) / (number_of_weeks), where sum_total is the sum of all window sums.\n\nSo the initial approach was wrong. Now I need to adjust.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the sum of all the window sums (each window is k days, sum them all), then divide by the number of weeks (n -k +1).\n\nSo for the first sample input, that's (7 + 11) / 2 = 9.0, which matches the sample.\n\nSo why did the problem statement mention average per week? Perhaps it's a translation error or misunderstanding. But the sample makes it clear.\n\nSo now, the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which is the same as the sum of all the window sums divided by the number of weeks.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute the sum of all window sums (each window is k consecutive days), then divide by the number of weeks (which is m = n -k +1).\n\nThus, the formula is:\n\ntotal_sum = sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (sum of a[i..i+k-1])\n\naverage = total_sum / m\n\nSo how to compute total_sum efficiently.\n\nAs before, using the prefix sum array.\n\nSo for each window, sum is prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]. So the total_sum is sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]).\n\nBut how to compute this sum quickly.\n\nLet me think about the sum of all (prefix[i +k] - prefix[i]) for i from 0 to m-1, where m = n -k +1.\n\nLet me expand this sum.\n\nEach term is prefix[i +k] - prefix[i].\n\nSo the total_sum is sum_{i=0}^{m-1} prefix[i +k] - sum_{i=0}^{m-1} prefix[i].\n\nLet me compute each part separately.\n\nFor the first part, sum_{i=0}^{m-1} prefix[i +k] = sum_{i=0}^{m-1} prefix[i +k].\n\nBut since m = n -k +1, then i ranges from 0 to (n -k +1 -1) = n -k.\n\nSo i +k ranges from 0 +k =k to (n -k) +k =n. So the sum is prefix[k] + prefix[k+1] + ... + prefix[n].\n\nSimilarly, the second part is sum_{i=0}^{m-1} prefix[i] = prefix[0] + prefix[1] + ... + prefix[m-1].\n\nSo the total_sum is equal to (sum_{x=k}^n prefix[x]) - (sum_{x=0}^{m-1} prefix[x]).\n\nSo how to compute this?\n\nWe can precompute the prefix array, and then compute the sum of prefix from k to n, and subtract the sum of prefix from 0 to m-1.\n\nBut how to compute these sums quickly. Well, we can compute a prefix sum of the prefix array. Let's call it prefix_prefix.\n\nFor example, prefix_prefix[i] = sum_{j=0}^i prefix[j].\n\nThen, sum from a to b (inclusive) of prefix[j] is prefix_prefix[b] - prefix_prefix[a-1].\n\nSo for the first part, sum from x=k to x=n of prefix[x] is prefix_prefix[n] - prefix_prefix[k-1].\n\nFor the second part, sum from x=0 to x=m-1 of prefix[x] is prefix_prefix[m-1] - prefix_prefix[-1], but since prefix_prefix[-1] is zero (assuming prefix_prefix starts from 0).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\ntotal_sum = (prefix_prefix[n] - prefix_prefix[k-1]) - (prefix_prefix[m-1] - prefix_prefix[-1]).\n\nBut since prefix_prefix[-1] is zero, that's just prefix_prefix[n] - prefix_prefix[k-1] - prefix_prefix[m-1].\n\nSo this approach allows us to compute total_sum in O(1) time after building the prefix array and the prefix_prefix array.\n\nBut how to build the prefix_prefix array?\n\nWell, the prefix array has length n+1. So the prefix_prefix array can be of length n+1, where prefix_prefix[i] = sum_{j=0}^i prefix[j].\n\nSo for example, prefix_prefix[0] = prefix[0], prefix_prefix[1] = prefix_prefix[0] + prefix[1], etc.\n\nSo this would allow us to compute the required sums.\n\nBut let's think about the time and space complexity.\n\nThe original prefix array is O(n) in space. The prefix_prefix array is also O(n) in space. So for n up to 2e5, this is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n, k.\n\n2. Read the array a.\n\n3. Compute the prefix array.\n\n4. Compute the prefix_prefix array.\n\n5. Compute m = n -k +1.\n\n6. Compute sum1 = sum of prefix[k] to prefix[n] = prefix_prefix[n] - prefix_prefix[k-1].\n\n7. Compute sum2 = sum of prefix[0] to prefix[m-1] = prefix_prefix[m-1].\n\n8. total_sum = sum1 - sum2.\n\n9. average = total_sum / m.\n\nThen, output this average with sufficient decimal digits.\n\nLet me test this with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: n=3, k=2, a = [3,4,7].\n\nprefix array:\n\nprefix[0] = 0\n\nprefix[1] = 3\n\nprefix[2] = 3+4=7\n\nprefix[3] = 7+7=14.\n\nprefix_prefix array:\n\nprefix_prefix[0] = 0\n\nprefix_prefix[1] = 0 +3 =3\n\nprefix_prefix[2] = 3 +7=10\n\nprefix_prefix[3] =10 +14=24.\n\nm =3-2+1=2.\n\nsum1 = prefix_prefix[3] - prefix_prefix[2-1] = prefix_prefix[3] - prefix_prefix[1] = 24 -3 =21.\n\nsum2 = prefix_prefix[m-1] = prefix_prefix[1] =3.\n\ntotal_sum = 21 -3 =18. average =18/2=9.0 → correct.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is '1 1\\n10'.\n\nn=1, k=1. m=1-1+1=1.\n\nprefix array is [0, 10].\n\nprefix_prefix array is [0, 0+10=10].\n\nsum1 = prefix_prefix[1] - prefix_prefix[1-1] = prefix_prefix[1] - prefix_prefix[0] =10 -0=10.\n\nsum2 = prefix_prefix[0] =0.\n\ntotal_sum =10-0=10. average is 10/1=10.0 → correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n8 2\n\narray is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nn=8, k=2. m=8-2+1=7.\n\nSo the sum of all window sums is sum of each pair of consecutive elements.\n\nThe sum of the window sums is:\n\n(1+2) + (2+4) + (4+100000) + (100000+123) + (123+456) + (456+789) + (789+1) \n\nWhich is:\n\n3 + 6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 → \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 +6 =9; +100004 = 100013; +100123 = 200136; +579 = 200715; +1245 = 201960; +790 = 202750.\n\nSo total_sum is 202750. Divided by 7 → 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... which matches the sample output of '28964.2857142857'.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nSo the code needs to compute this.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, how to compute the prefix array and prefix_prefix array.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nRead n and k.\n\nThen read the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix array:\n\nprefix = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nThen compute prefix_prefix array:\n\nprefix_prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    prefix_prefix[i] = prefix_prefix[i-1] + prefix[i]\n\nWait, no. The prefix_prefix array is the sum of the prefix array up to index i. So for example, prefix_prefix[0] = prefix[0], prefix_prefix[1] = prefix[0] + prefix[1], etc. So the code for prefix_prefix would be:\n\nprefix_prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n\nprefix_prefix[0] = prefix[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    prefix_prefix[i] = prefix_prefix[i-1] + prefix[i]\n\nBut in Python, we can compute it as:\n\nprefix_prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n+1):\n\n    if i ==0:\n\n        prefix_prefix[i] = prefix[i]\n\n    else:\n\n        prefix_prefix[i] = prefix_prefix[i-1] + prefix[i]\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute with a loop.\n\nOnce that is done, compute m = n -k +1.\n\nThen sum1 is prefix_prefix[n] - prefix_prefix[k-1]\n\nsum2 is prefix_prefix[m-1]\n\ntotal_sum = sum1 - sum2\n\naverage = total_sum / m\n\nThen output average with enough decimal digits.\n\nBut what about when m is zero? Well, since k <=n, m is at least 1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nBut for large n (up to 2e5), the code should run in O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the input. However, the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of inputs, like:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and print the outputs. So perhaps the input is multiple test cases, but the problem's input format is unclear. Wait no, the problem says that the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo each test case is two lines. But the sample input shows that there are three test cases, but the user input is given as a list of strings. However, in the actual programming competition problem, the input is one test case. But in the sample provided, the user has given multiple test cases, but perhaps that's just for the purpose of the example.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. However, in the sample input, there are three test cases. But perhaps that's just an example of the outputs. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nWait looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nSo this suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. This is confusing.\n\nWait the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the sample input is multiple test cases, but the actual problem is for a single test case. But the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should handle multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. However, the sample input seems to have multiple test cases, but perhaps that's just a way to present multiple examples. So the actual code should read one test case.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should be ready to run and handle the input. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input is for a single test case. This is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the code should process multiple test cases. For example, the first sample input line is '3 2\\n3 4 7', which is one test case, and the output is '9.0000000000'. But in the sample input, there are three test cases. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut the problem statement's input is not clear on that. However, the original problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's for multiple test cases, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the user's note, the code should read input from stdin. So the code should read the input as per the problem statement, which is for a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, perhaps the user's code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem statement says nothing about that.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nBut the sample shows three test cases. So perhaps the user's code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement doesn't mention that. This is a bit confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement's input and output description, it's likely that the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input and output provided by the user seems to have multiple test cases. But perhaps that's just for illustration. For example, the user might have written that the code should read multiple test cases, but the problem statement says otherwise.\n\nThis is a critical point. If the code is supposed to process a single test case, then the code can read n and k, then the array, compute the answer, and print it. But if the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, then the code should read all lines and process them accordingly.\n\nBut looking at the original problem statement's input and output examples, the first sample input is one test case, and the output is one line. So the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input given in the user's message is a list of three test cases, which may be for the purpose of showing multiple examples. However, the code should process a single test case. Thus, the code should read two lines from stdin: the first line with n and k, the second line with the array.\n\nBut in the user's note, the code is supposed to read from stdin and output to stdout. So the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is a single test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read n and k, then the array, compute the answer, and print it with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code structure in Python would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and k.\n\nRead the second line as the list of integers.\n\nCompute the prefix array.\n\nCompute the prefix_prefix array.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nCompute sum1 and sum2 as explained.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum1 - sum2.\n\naverage = total_sum / m.\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut for Python, handling large n (up to 2e5) is okay, since O(n) is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the prefix_prefix array, perhaps there's a way to compute it without creating an extra array. Let's think.\n\nBut for the code, let's proceed.\n\nSample code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n\n    ptr +=1\n\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n\n    ptr +=1\n\n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))\n\n    # compute prefix array\n\n    prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n\n        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n    # compute prefix_prefix array\n\n    prefix_prefix = [0]*(n+1)\n\n    for i in range(n+1):\n\n        if i ==0:\n\n            prefix_prefix[i] = prefix[i]\n\n        else:\n\n            prefix_prefix[i] = prefix_prefix[i-1] + prefix[i]\n\n    m = n -k +1\n\n    sum1 = prefix_prefix[n] - prefix_prefix[k-1]\n\n    sum2 = prefix_prefix[m-1]\n\n    total_sum = sum1 - sum2\n\n    average = total_sum / m\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, for the prefix_prefix array, the code is:\n\nprefix_prefix[i] is the sum of prefix[0] to prefix[i].\n\nSo for example, when i=0, it's prefix[0].\n\nWhen i=1, it's prefix[0] + prefix[1], etc.\n\nBut in the code above, the loop for prefix",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week consists of `k` consecutive days from a given list of `n` days. The solution involves efficiently calculating the sum of sleep times for each possible week and then computing the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time.\n2. **Prefix Sum of Prefix Sums**: Construct another array that holds the cumulative sum of the prefix sums.
