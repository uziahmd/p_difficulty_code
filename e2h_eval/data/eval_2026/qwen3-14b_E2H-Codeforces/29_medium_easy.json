Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits. Each query replaces all occurrences of a certain digit di with another string ti. After all queries, I have to compute the number represented by the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. But there's a catch: leading zeros are ignored when considering the number, but the string itself might have leading zeros. However, if the string is empty, the number is considered zero.\n\nThe challenge is to handle these substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If I try to process each substitution naively by replacing every occurrence in the string each time, that could be O(n * m) where m is the length of the string, which might be too slow for large inputs. For example, if each query replaces a digit that's present many times, doing a string replacement each time could be O(n * len(s)) per query, leading to O(n^2) time overall, which might not be feasible for n=1e5.\n\nHmm, so I need a smarter way to represent the substitutions. Let me think about the order of operations. Since each query replaces all instances of a digit, but subsequent queries can replace digits that were introduced by previous substitutions. For example, if I first replace '2' with '00', then later replace '0' with '1', then all the original '2's would become '00's and then those would be replaced by '11's. So the order of processing queries matters, and we need to process them in the given order.\n\nBut how can I model the substitutions efficiently? One approach is to track for each digit, what it gets replaced with. However, since replacements can be done multiple times, we need to make sure that when a digit is replaced, we don't overwrite previous replacements. Wait, but each query replaces all occurrences of di with ti. So for example, if a digit 'd' is replaced in a query, then any subsequent query that replaces another digit (say 'e') will not affect the previous replacement unless 'e' is part of the ti string from earlier substitutions.\n\nWait, but the substitution is done in the order of the queries. So, for example, if the initial string is '2', and the first query is '2->00', then the string becomes '00'. Then a query '0->11' would replace both 0s with '11's, resulting in '1111'.\n\nSo the key is that each substitution replaces all instances of a digit in the current string. Therefore, the substitutions are applied sequentially. But if we process each substitution naively by replacing the digits in the string, it's going to be too slow for large strings and many queries.\n\nAn alternative idea is to model the substitutions as a mapping from digits to their replacement strings, but considering that replacements can be applied recursively. However, since each query replaces all instances of a digit, the order of processing is important. For example, if we first replace '2' with '3', and then replace '3' with '4', then the original '2's would be replaced with '3's, then those '3's would be replaced with '4's. So the final result for '2' would be '4'.\n\nBut if we process the queries in reverse order, perhaps we can build a mapping that represents the final expansion of each digit. Wait, but that's not possible because the order of processing is crucial. For example, if a query replaces '2' with '3', and then another query replaces '3' with '4', then the first substitution is applied first. So the final expansion of '2' is '4', but if the order was reversed, the '3's would not be replaced by '4's if the first query was replacing '3's.\n\nSo the idea is that each digit's replacement depends on the queries that are processed after it. Therefore, if we process the queries in reverse order, we can track for each digit what it's expanded to. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider that for each digit d, we want to know what it expands to after all substitutions. However, substitutions can be applied multiple times. For example, suppose there's a query that replaces 'd' with something, and then another query that replaces the same 'd' again. The second query would overwrite the previous replacement. Because each query replaces all occurrences of di in the current string. So if a digit is replaced again, the previous replacement is no longer valid. For example, if the initial string is 'd', and the first query is d→a, then the string becomes 'a'. Then, a query d→b would not affect the string, since there are no more 'd's in it. But if the query is a→b, then the string becomes 'b'.\n\nSo, the key is that the substitution for a digit is only applied once, and subsequent substitutions for that same digit would only affect the digits that were added by later substitutions. Wait, no. For example, if you have a query that replaces 'a' with 'b', then another query that replaces 'a' with 'c', then the first substitution is applied first, and the second substitution would replace any remaining 'a's (which may be none). So the second query would have no effect.\n\nBut if a query replaces 'a' with 'b', and then a query replaces 'b' with 'c', then the original 'a's would be replaced by 'b's, then those 'b's would be replaced by 'c's.\n\nSo the problem is that substitutions can be applied to digits that were introduced by previous substitutions. Therefore, the order of processing queries is important, and we need to track how each substitution affects the current state of the digits.\n\nBut how can we model this without actually expanding the string each time?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the expansion of each digit as a function. For example, for each digit d, we can track what it expands to after all substitutions. However, since substitutions can be applied in sequence, we need to process the queries in the order they are given and update the mappings accordingly.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's maintain a mapping for each digit (from 0-9) to its replacement string. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each query, when we process it, we replace the mapping of di with ti. However, this approach would not account for the fact that when a substitution is made, all existing instances of di in the current string are replaced. But if we track the expansion for each digit, then when a substitution is made, the new ti can be built using the current mappings of the digits in ti. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that we have a mapping for each digit, which represents what that digit expands to. For example, initially, the mapping for each digit is the digit itself. When we process a query \"d -> t\", we need to update the mapping for d to be t, but with the understanding that any digits in t are expanded according to their current mappings. Wait, no. Because when we perform the substitution, we replace all instances of d in the current string with t. However, the t string may contain digits that are later replaced in subsequent queries. Therefore, the expansion of the original d's would be t, but then those digits in t would be expanded further.\n\nWait, but if we process the queries in the order they are given, and for each query, we can track for each digit what it expands to, considering the previous substitutions. For example:\n\nInitially, the mapping is: each digit maps to itself.\n\nWhen a query comes in, say d → t. Now, the current mapping for d is whatever it was before. But when we process this query, we need to set the mapping for d to t, but with the understanding that when we expand d, it's replaced by t, and the digits in t are expanded according to their current mappings. No, that's not correct. Because when the substitution is done, the t is inserted as-is. Then, in subsequent substitutions, if any of the digits in t are replaced, those replacements will happen. So, the expansion of d is t, but then when we process other substitutions, the digits in t may be replaced.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively. Suppose that for each digit d, we have a function f(d) that returns the string it expands to after all substitutions. Then, when a substitution is made for d → t, we can set f(d) = t, but then for each digit in t, we need to expand them according to their current f. Wait, no. Because when the substitution occurs, the current string is modified by replacing all instances of d with t. Then, in future substitutions, any digits that are present in t will be replaced if there are queries for them. Therefore, the expansion of d is t, and the expansion of the digits in t is handled by their own mappings. So, if we have a query that replaces d with t, then the expansion of d is t, but the expansion of the digits in t is based on their current mappings (which may have been updated in previous steps).\n\nWait, but this suggests that when processing the query d → t, we need to set the mapping for d to be t, but with the digits in t already expanded. Because when the substitution is performed, the t is inserted into the string, and any subsequent substitutions would apply to the digits in t. However, if we process the queries in order, and for each query, we update the mapping for d to be t, then when we later process another query that replaces some digit in t, the existing mappings for d would not automatically include that change. Therefore, the approach of maintaining for each digit a string that represents its expansion after all substitutions is not possible unless we recompute the mapping each time a substitution occurs.\n\nFor example, let's say:\n\nOriginal mapping: d → d.\n\nFirst query: d → a. Now, the mapping for d is a.\n\nSecond query: a → b. Now, the mapping for a is b. But the mapping for d is still a. However, if we process the substitution for d, then the original d would be replaced by a, which would then be replaced by b. Therefore, the correct expansion of d is b. But our current mapping for d is a, which is not correct. Therefore, we need to update the mapping for d whenever a substitution is made for any digit that is in the expansion of d.\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we manage this efficiently?\n\nThis suggests that the mapping for each digit must be updated whenever a substitution occurs for any digit that is in the expansion of that digit. But how can we track that?\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with memoization or dynamic programming, but with dependencies between the digits. For example, when a substitution is made for a digit d, we need to update all digits whose expansion includes d. However, this could be computationally expensive if done naively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the expansion of each digit as a string, and whenever a substitution is made for a digit, we update the mapping for that digit to be the new ti, and then for any other digits that may have had their expansion depend on this digit, we need to recompute their expansions. However, this seems complex and could lead to high computational overhead.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that substitutions are processed in order, and that each substitution replaces all instances of a digit in the current string. Therefore, the order of substitutions is crucial. However, if we can find a way to represent the final expansion of the original string by applying all substitutions in order, without modifying the string each time.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of keeping track of the actual string, we can model the transformations as a series of replacements. For example, each character in the original string is transformed through the substitutions. However, since substitutions can affect digits introduced by previous substitutions, we need to track for each digit what it is currently mapped to.\n\nBut how can we do that? Let's think of the substitutions as building a tree. For example, when we process a substitution for digit d, we can note that any occurrence of d in the current string will be replaced by the ti string. However, when ti contains digits that are later substituted, those substitutions will take effect. So, the expansion of d is ti, and the expansion of the digits in ti will be handled by their own mappings.\n\nTherefore, if we can track for each digit, what it's currently mapped to (the string that replaces it), and when we need to compute the final value, we can recursively expand each digit's mapping.\n\nBut how can we do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following data structure: a dictionary (or array, since digits are 0-9) where for each digit, we store the current replacement string. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a query comes in, say di → ti, we update the mapping for di to be ti. However, when we later need to compute the expansion of a digit, we need to recursively expand the replacement strings, considering the current mappings.\n\nBut this approach would require that when we process a substitution, we don't immediately expand the replacement string. For example, if we have a substitution d → a, and then a substitution a → b, then the expansion of d is a, but the expansion of a is b. Therefore, the expansion of d is a, which would be replaced by b when processed. However, if we need to compute the expansion of d, we would first get a, then expand that to b. Therefore, the expansion of d is a followed by the expansion of a, which is b.\n\nWait, but in reality, when the substitution is applied, the original d's are replaced with a's, and then the a's are replaced with b's. Therefore, the final expansion of d is b. So the mapping for d should be updated to b, not a. But how can we track that?\n\nAh, here's the crux of the problem. If we process the substitution d → a, then later process a → b, the original d's would first be replaced with a's, then those a's would be replaced with b's. Therefore, the effective expansion of d is b. However, if we just keep the mapping for d as a, then when we need to compute the expansion of d, we would get a, which would then expand to b. So the expansion of d would be the expansion of a. Therefore, if we have a way to compute the expansion of a digit recursively, then the mapping for d can be a, and when we expand d, we expand a, which is now mapped to b.\n\nSo, the key idea is that the mapping for each digit is the immediate replacement string. When expanding, we recursively expand each character in the replacement string.\n\nThis way, even if the replacement string of a digit changes later, the expansion will take that into account. For example, the mapping for d is a, and the mapping for a is b. When expanding d, we first look up the mapping for d (a), then expand that string, which is the mapping for a (b), and so on.\n\nThis seems manageable. Therefore, the approach is:\n\n- Maintain a mapping for each digit (0-9) to a string (initially, each digit maps to itself).\n\n- For each query, update the mapping of di to ti.\n\n- Once all queries are processed, we need to process the original string s, replacing each digit with its current mapping, recursively expanding as needed.\n\nHowever, the problem is that expanding each character recursively could be very slow, especially for large strings and deep expansions.\n\nFor example, if the original string is a single digit 'd', and after several substitutions, the expansion of 'd' is a very long string. Processing this recursively for each character in the original string would take O(k) time per character, where k is the depth of substitutions. This could be O(n * k) time, which may be too slow for large n and large k.\n\nBut given the constraints (sum of lengths of ti across all queries is up to 1e5), perhaps we can find a way to memoize the expansion of each digit. Let's think about memoization.\n\nWe can memoize the expansion of each digit. For example, when we compute the expansion of a digit, we can cache it so that if we need to expand the same digit again, we can retrieve the cached value. However, since substitutions can change the mappings, the memoization would need to be invalidated when a substitution is made. This complicates things, but perhaps we can manage it.\n\nAlternatively, since substitutions are processed in order, and once a substitution is made, the mappings are updated. Therefore, for the final expansion, after all substitutions are done, we can compute the expansion of each digit once, using memoization, and then process the original string.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize a map (let's call it replace_map) where for each digit, the value is the string it's replaced with. Initially, replace_map[d] = d for all digits d.\n\n2. Process each query in order. For each query, parse di and ti, then set replace_map[di] = ti. However, note that ti can be an empty string.\n\n3. After all queries, we need to process the original string s by replacing each character with their expanded versions, recursively.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nFor example, for each character in the original string, we can generate the expanded string by recursively expanding the replace_map for that character. But if we do this naively, for each character, it could take O(L) time where L is the length of the expanded string, leading to O(|s| * L) total time. Which could be bad if the expanded strings are very long.\n\nBut given that the sum of the lengths of all ti across queries is up to 1e5, and the original string is up to 1e5, perhaps the total length of the final expanded string is manageable. However, for the purposes of computing the modulus, we can't actually build the entire string, because for very large expansions (like 1e5 substitutions each adding a few digits), the final string could be extremely long, leading to memory issues and computational time.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to compute the number modulo 1e9+7. Therefore, we can't build the entire string. Instead, we need to compute the numeric value mod 1e9+7 as we process the substitutions.\n\nSo, the key insight here is that we can model the expansion of each digit as a value mod MOD, and also track the length of the expansion (since when appending digits, the contribution to the number depends on the position).\n\nWait, here's a better idea. For each digit d, we can precompute two values:\n\n- The numeric value of the expansion of d mod MOD, which we'll call val[d].\n\n- The length of the expansion of d, which we'll call len[d]. This is important because when you append a number to another, you need to multiply the existing value by 10^k, where k is the length of the new number.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a number A, and you append a number B. The new number is A * 10^len(B) + B. Therefore, to compute the combined value mod MOD, we need to track both the value and the length of each expansion.\n\nSo, for each digit d, we can compute val[d] and len[d], where:\n\nval[d] = value of expansion of d mod MOD.\n\nlen[d] = length of expansion of d.\n\nInitially, for each digit d, val[d] = int(d) mod MOD, len[d] = 1.\n\nThen, for each query, when we replace di with ti, we need to compute the new val[di] and len[di] based on ti's expansion.\n\nBut how do we compute ti's expansion? Well, ti is a string of digits, which themselves can be expanded. So, for example, if ti is \"ab\", then the expansion of ti is the expansion of 'a' followed by the expansion of 'b'. Therefore, the value of ti's expansion is (val[a] * 10^len[b] + val[b]) mod MOD, and the length is len[a] + len[b].\n\nSo, during the processing of the queries, whenever we update the replace_map for a digit di, we need to compute the new val[di] and len[di] based on the ti string. But ti can consist of multiple digits, each of which has their own val and len.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a string ti. For each character c in ti, we can compute the contribution to the value and the length. However, since the expansion of each c is known (based on the current val and len arrays), we can compute the total value and length of ti's expansion.\n\nFor example, for ti = \"abc\", the expansion would be the expansion of a, followed by expansion of b, followed by expansion of c. The total value is:\n\nvalue = ( (val_a * 10^{len_b + len_c} ) + (val_b * 10^{len_c}) + val_c ) mod MOD.\n\nBut calculating this directly for each ti string during each query may be computationally intensive, but perhaps manageable.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe idea is that for a given string ti, we can compute its value and length incrementally. Let's say we start with value = 0 and length = 0. For each character c in ti, we compute the contribution of c's expansion. The new value is (current_value * 10^{len_c} + val_c) mod MOD. The new length is current_length + len_c.\n\nBut to compute 10^{len_c} mod MOD, we need to precompute powers of 10 mod MOD. However, since len_c can be up to the maximum possible length of the expansion, which could be very large (but in practice, since the sum of ti lengths is 1e5, the maximum len for any ti is manageable).\n\nWait, but during the processing of queries, when we process a query that replaces di with ti, we need to compute the value and length of ti's expansion. To do that, we can process each character in ti, and for each character, we look up its current val and len. Then, we compute the combined value and length.\n\nSo, for example, for ti = \"abc\":\n\nInitialize current_val = 0, current_len = 0.\n\nFor each character in ti:\n\ncurrent_val = (current_val * pow(10, len_c, MOD) + val_c) % MOD\n\ncurrent_len += len_c\n\nSo, for the first character 'a', current_val becomes (0 * 10^len_a + val_a) mod MOD, which is val_a. current_len is len_a.\n\nThen, for the next character 'b', current_val is (val_a * 10^len_b + val_b) mod MOD. current_len is len_a + len_b.\n\nThen, for 'c', current_val is (previous_val * 10^len_c + val_c) mod MOD, and current_len is len_a + len_b + len_c.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo, the key is that for each query, when we replace di with ti, we compute the value and length of ti's expansion, and set val[di] and len[di] to these computed values.\n\nBut how do we compute pow(10, len_c, MOD) efficiently? Because len_c can be up to ... well, for each character in ti, we have to compute 10 raised to the len of that character's expansion. However, since len_c is stored as len[c], which is a precomputed value, we can compute pow(10, len_c, MOD) on the fly. However, calculating pow(10, len_c, MOD) each time may be expensive if done naively. So, perhaps we can precompute a power of 10 array up to the maximum possible len, but since the maximum possible len can be very large (depending on substitutions), this may not be feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: use modular exponentiation. For each exponent, compute pow(10, e, MOD) using the built-in pow function with three arguments (which is efficient).\n\nBut for each character in ti, we need to compute 10^len_c mod MOD. Let's see. For example, if the current character is 'a', and len[a] is 3, then 10^3 mod MOD is 1000.\n\nBut since MOD is 1e9+7, which is a prime, and 10 and MOD are coprime, we can compute this as pow(10, len_c, MOD).\n\nBut for each character in ti, we have to compute this. However, since the sum of ti lengths is 1e5, and each ti is processed once per query, the total number of such operations is O(1e5), which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each digit, val and len arrays.\n\n- For each query, when replacing di with ti, compute the val and len of ti's expansion, then set val[di] and len[di] to these values.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, we need to compute the value of the original string s. For this, we can process each character in s, and for each character, compute its contribution to the overall value.\n\nAgain, the same logic applies. For example, processing the original string s as a sequence of characters, each of which is expanded into a value and length. The overall value is computed by combining each character's expansion in sequence.\n\nSo, for example, if the original string is 'abc', then the value is ((val_a * 10^{len_b + len_c} + val_b * 10^{len_c} + val_c) mod MOD).\n\nWhich can be computed by initializing current_val = 0, current_len = 0, and for each character in s:\n\ncurrent_val = (current_val * pow(10, len_c, MOD) + val_c) % MOD\n\ncurrent_len += len_c\n\nThus, after processing all characters in s, the current_val is the desired value mod MOD.\n\nBut there's one edge case: if the final string is empty. According to the problem statement, in that case, the number is zero. However, since the original string s is non-empty (per the input constraints), but after substitutions, it can become empty. For example, if s is '3' and a query replaces '3' with empty string.\n\nSo, during processing of the original string, we need to check if the final current_len is zero. If yes, output 0. Otherwise, output current_val.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because during the processing of the original string, if the current_len is zero, that means all characters in the original string have been replaced with empty strings. Therefore, the final number is zero.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nInitialize val and len arrays for digits 0-9.\n\nInitially, for each digit d (0-9):\n\nval[d] = int(d) mod MOD\n\nlen[d] = 1\n\nProcess each query:\n\nfor each query in order:\n\n   parse di and ti.\n\n   compute the value and length of ti's expansion.\n\n   set val[di] and len[di] to these computed values.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, process the original string s:\n\ninitialize current_val = 0, current_len = 0\n\nfor each c in s:\n\n   compute the contribution of c's expansion.\n\n   current_val = (current_val * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n\n   current_len += len[c]\n\nif current_len == 0:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   print(current_val)\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros? According to the problem statement, leading zeros are ignored when representing the number. However, the problem says that when you represent s as a decimal number, you ignore leading zeros. But the actual value computed by the code above is the numeric value of the string, including leading zeros. For example, if the string is '00123', the numeric value is 123. However, the code would compute (0 * 10^... + ...) which would be 123 mod MOD. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nThe code computes the value as if the string is parsed as a number, which ignores leading zeros. For example, the string '00123' would be treated as 123. However, the code's approach of combining the values would compute the actual numeric value of the string. For example, the code would compute 0*10^5 + 0*10^4 + 1*10^3 + 2*10^2 + 3*10^1 + ... etc. Wait, no. The code's approach is to compute the numeric value of the string as a number, including leading zeros. However, the problem says that leading zeros are ignored. But according to the problem statement, the number is considered as the decimal representation of the string, ignoring leading zeros. However, if the string is empty, it's considered zero.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when you represent s as a decimal number, you ignore leading zeros. However, the code's approach computes the numeric value of the string as a number, which is the same as ignoring leading zeros. For example, '00123' is 123. However, the code's approach would compute the value as follows:\n\nLet's take the original string as '00123', and during processing, each character is expanded (assuming no substitutions). So for each character:\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0, current_len at 0.\n\nProcessing first '0':\n\ncurrent_val = (0 * 10^1 + 0) mod MOD = 0.\n\ncurrent_len = 1.\n\nProcessing second '0':\n\ncurrent_val = (0 * 10^1 + 0) mod MOD = 0.\n\ncurrent_len = 2.\n\nProcessing '1':\n\ncurrent_val = (0 * 10^1 + 1) mod MOD = 1.\n\ncurrent_len = 3.\n\nProcessing '2':\n\ncurrent_val = (1 * 10^1 + 2) mod MOD = 12.\n\ncurrent_len = 4.\n\nProcessing '3':\n\ncurrent_val = (12 * 10^1 + 3) mod MOD = 123.\n\ncurrent_len = 5.\n\nWhich is correct. So the code's approach correctly computes the numeric value of the string, which is the same as the number formed by the string with leading zeros ignored. Because the numeric value is the same regardless of leading zeros. For example, the string '00123' is 123, which is exactly what the code computes. So the code's approach is correct.\n\nBut what if the entire string is zeros? For example, the string is '0000'. The code would compute current_val as 0, current_len 4. Then, the output is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the string is empty. But according to the input constraints, the original string s is non-empty. However, after substitutions, the string can be empty. For example, if the original string is '3', and the query replaces '3' with empty string. Then, the code would process the original string as follows: current_val starts at 0, current_len 0. Then, processing '3', which has len[3] = 0 (because ti is empty). So current_val = (0 * pow(10, 0) + val[3]) mod MOD. But val[3] is computed as the expansion of ti, which is empty string. So how do we handle that?\n\nAh, here's a problem. How do we compute the val and len for ti when ti is empty?\n\nLet me think. For ti being empty, the expansion of the digit di is the empty string. So, the value of the empty string is zero. However, the length is zero.\n\nBut when processing ti as empty, how do we compute its value and length? For example, when a query replaces di with ti (empty string), then the expansion of di is empty string, so val[di] = 0, len[di] = 0.\n\nBut during the processing of the original string, if a character is replaced with empty string, then during the processing of the original string, that character contributes nothing. For example, if the original string is '3', and after substitution, len[3] is 0, then during processing of the original string, current_val is (0 * pow(10, 0) + val[3]) mod MOD. But val[3] is 0. So current_val is 0. current_len is 0. So the output is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut how to compute the val and len of ti when ti is empty? For example, when processing a query, ti is empty. So for the ti string, which is empty, the value is 0 and length is 0.\n\nTherefore, during the processing of ti for a query, we need to compute the value and length of ti. For ti being empty, that's straightforward.\n\nSo, during the query processing, for ti, we need to compute the value and length as follows:\n\nIf ti is empty, then the value is 0, length is 0.\n\nElse, process each character in ti, and compute the value and length as explained before.\n\nTherefore, the code for processing ti would be:\n\ndef compute_ti_value_and_length(ti, val, len, MOD):\n    current_val = 0\n    current_len = 0\n    for c in ti:\n        # get the value and length of c's expansion\n        c_val = val[int(c)]\n        c_len = len[int(c)]\n        # compute the new current_val and current_len\n        # current_val = current_val * 10^c_len + c_val\n        power = pow(10, c_len, MOD)\n        current_val = (current_val * power + c_val) % MOD\n        current_len += c_len\n    return (current_val, current_len)\n\nBut if ti is empty, return (0, 0).\n\nSo, during the processing of each query, when we have ti, we call this function to compute the value and length of ti, and then assign val[di] and len[di] to these values.\n\nNow, the question is, how to handle the case when ti is empty. For example, when ti is empty, the expansion of di is empty, so val[di] is 0, len[di] is 0.\n\nBut what if during the processing of ti, the ti is non-empty? For example, ti is \"0\", then the expansion of ti is \"0\" (assuming no substitutions), which has val 0, len 1.\n\nSo, the code for processing ti is correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the val and len arrays as lists of size 10 (digits 0-9).\n\nInitialize:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nval = [i % MOD for i in range(10)]\n\nlen_ = [1 for _ in range(10)]\n\nThen, for each query:\n\nparse di and ti.\n\ncompute the value and length of ti as per the function above.\n\nset val[di] = computed_val, len_[di] = computed_len.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, process the original string s:\n\ncurrent_val = 0\n\ncurrent_len = 0\n\nfor c in s:\n\n    digit = int(c)\n\n    c_val = val[digit]\n\n    c_len = len_[digit]\n\n    power = pow(10, c_len, MOD)\n\n    current_val = (current_val * power + c_val) % MOD\n\n    current_len += c_len\n\nif current_len == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print(current_val)\n\nBut wait, what about when the current_val is zero but current_len is non-zero? For example, the string is '0000', then current_val is 0 and current_len is 4. The output is 0, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nInput:\n\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\nBut the code is supposed to output the mod value. Let's look at the first sample.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nOriginal string is '123123'\n\nn=1, query is 2->00.\n\nAfter substitution, the string becomes 10031003.\n\nThe numeric value is 10031003 mod 1e9+7.\n\nBut according to the code:\n\nProcessing the query 2->00.\n\nti is \"00\".\n\nCompute the value and length of ti.\n\nProcessing each character in ti:\n\nFirst character is '0', which has val[0] = 0, len_ is 1.\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0, current_len 0.\n\nAfter first '0':\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\ncurrent_len = 1.\n\nSecond character is '0', again val[0] is 0, len_ 1.\n\npower = 10^1 = 10.\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0.\n\ncurrent_len = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo the value for ti is 0, len is 2.\n\nSo, val[2] = 0, len[2] = 2.\n\nNow, processing the original string '123123'.\n\nEach character:\n\n'1' → val[1] is 1, len 1.\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10^1 + 1 = 1.\n\ncurrent_len = 1.\n\nNext '2' → val is 0, len 2.\n\npower",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to efficiently process a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The key challenge is to handle multiple substitutions efficiently without explicitly constructing potentially very large strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Maintain two arrays, `val` and `len`, where `val[d]` stores the numeric value of the expansion of digit `d` modulo $10^9 + 7$, and `len[d]` stores the length of this expansion.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, update the `val` and `len` arrays based on the substitution rules. This involves computing the new value and length for the substituted digit by considering the current values of the digits in the replacement string.\n3. **Final Calculation**: After processing all queries, compute the final numeric value of the original string using the updated `val` and `len` arrays, taking care to handle leading zeros and empty strings appropriately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            line = ''\n        else:\n            line = input[idx].strip()\n        idx += 1\n        queries.append(line)\n    \n    # Initialize val and len arrays\n    val = [i % MOD for i in range(10)]\n    length = [1] * 10\n    \n    for query in queries:\n        if not query:\n            continue\n        # Parse the query: di->ti\n        parts = query.split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1]\n        di_int = int(di)\n        \n        # Compute the value and length of ti\n        current_val = 0\n        current_len = 0\n        for c in ti:\n            c_int = int(c)\n            c_val = val[c_int]\n            c_len = length[c_int]\n            power = pow(10, c_len, MOD)\n            current_val = (current_val * power + c_val) % MOD\n            current_len += c_len\n        # If ti is empty, current_val is 0 and current_len is 0\n        if not ti:\n            current_val = 0\n            current_len = 0\n        \n        # Update the val and length for di\n        val[di_int] = current_val\n        length[di_int] = current_len\n    \n    # Process the original string s\n    current_val = 0\n    current_len = 0\n    for c in s:\n        digit = int(c)\n        c_val = val[digit]\n        c_len = length[digit]\n        power = pow(10, c_len, MOD)\n        current_val = (current_val * power + c_val) % MOD\n        current_len += c_len\n    \n    if current_len == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(current_val)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The `val` array is initialized with each digit's value, and `length` with each digit's length (initially 1).\n2. **Query Processing**: Each query updates the substitution rules.
