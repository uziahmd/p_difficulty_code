He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that matches the assignments.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that fits the assignments.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to approach this. For each possible candidate string s, we can check if all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. But since the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., there exists at least one s), we need to find any valid assignment.\n\nBut how do we find the correct assignments? Since the input strings are all the prefixes and suffixes of some s, perhaps we can find the correct s first. Once we have s, we can check which input strings are its prefixes and which are suffixes, then assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, for the correct s, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be present in the input. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) must be present. Also, the full string s must be such that all its prefixes and suffixes are present in the input.\n\nWait, but the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes of s. So for example, for the correct s, the input contains all the prefixes of s (of lengths 1 to n-1) and all the suffixes (same lengths). But the input is given as a mix of these, and we need to determine which is which.\n\nBut how can we reconstruct s? Let's think: the correct s must have the property that the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) are both present in the input. Moreover, the full string s can be determined by combining these two. Wait, for example, if the correct s is of length n, then the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So if we take the longest prefix (say, P) and the longest suffix (say, S), then the full string s would be P + last character of S (since the longest suffix is of length n-1, so the last character is the same as the last character of s). Alternatively, the full string can be formed by taking the longest suffix and adding the first character of the longest prefix. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose s is \"ababa\" (as in the first example). Then the longest prefix is \"abab\" (length 4) and the longest suffix is \"baba\" (length 4). The full string is \"ababa\". So combining the longest prefix (abab) with the last character of the longest suffix (a) gives ababa. Similarly, combining the longest suffix (baba) with the first character of the longest prefix (a) gives ababa. So the full string can be reconstructed by taking the longest prefix and appending the last character of the longest suffix, or the longest suffix and prepending the first character of the longest prefix. However, this only works if the longest prefix and suffix overlap correctly.\n\nSo here's an idea: for the correct s, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap in such a way that their combination gives s. Therefore, perhaps the correct s can be found by checking all pairs of the input strings of length n-1, and seeing if combining them in the above way gives a possible s. Then, once we have s, we can check which input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of s.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all the strings of length n-1 from the input. There are exactly two of them (since for each length from 1 to n-1, there are two strings). Let's call them candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n\n2. For each pair of these two strings (since there are two of them, there are two possibilities: one is the longest prefix and the other the longest suffix, or vice versa?), wait, no. Wait, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. One of them must be the longest prefix of s, and the other must be the longest suffix. Because for the correct s, the longest prefix (length",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and our task is to assign 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) to each input string such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix Candidates**: The longest prefix and suffix of `s` (each of length `n-1`) must be among the input strings. We consider all pairs of these candidates.\n2. **Reconstruct Possible String `s`**: For each pair of candidate longest prefix and suffix, check if they can form a valid string `s` by overlapping them correctly.\n3. **Validate Candidates**: Once a valid string `s` is found, verify that all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n4. **Generate Output**: Assign 'P' or 'S' based on whether each input string is a prefix or suffix of the valid `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Group the strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    candidates = len_to_strings[n-1]\n    \n    # Try each possible combination of prefix and suffix candidates\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Try to reconstruct s\n            # Case 1: prefix_candidate + last char of suffix_candidate\n            s1 = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Case 2: first char of prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate\n            s2 = prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate\n            # Check if s1 or s2 is valid\n            for s in [s1, s2]:\n                valid = True\n                # Check all prefixes and suffixes of s\n                for l in range(1, n):\n                    prefix = s[:l]\n                    suffix = s[-l:]\n                    # Check if both prefix and suffix are present in the input\n                    count_prefix = 0\n                    count_suffix = 0\n                    for st in strings:\n                        if len(st) == l:\n                            if st == prefix:\n                                count_prefix += 1\n                            if st == suffix:\n                                count_suffix += 1\n                    if count_prefix < 1 or count_suffix < 1:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                if valid:\n                    # Now assign P and S\n                    result = []\n                    for st in strings:\n                        is_prefix = False\n                        for l in range(1, n):\n                            if len(st) == l:\n                                if st == s[:l]:\n                                    is_prefix = True\n                                    break\n                        if is_prefix:\n                            result.append('P')\n                        else:\n                            result.append('S')\n                    print(''.join(result))\n                    return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Grouping Strings by Length**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to easily access those of length `n-1`, which are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Reconstructing `s`**: For each pair of candidate longest prefix and suffix, we attempt to reconstruct the string `s` by combining them appropriately.\n4. **Validation**: Once a potential `s` is reconstructed, we validate that all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n5. **Output Assignment**: If a valid `s` is found, we generate the result string by checking each input string against the prefixes and suffixes of `s` and assigning 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes using the properties of string overlaps and validation checks.",
