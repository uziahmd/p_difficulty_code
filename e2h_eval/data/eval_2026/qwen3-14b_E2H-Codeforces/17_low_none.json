He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. The key is that there might be multiple possible correct answers, but we just need to find any one that's valid.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to find the original string s. Because once we know s, we can check each input string to see if it's a prefix or suffix. But how do we find s?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input gives all improper prefixes and suffixes. So for example, for a string of length n, there are n-1 prefixes (lengths 1 to n-1) and n-1 suffixes. But the input gives all of them mixed up. So our job is to figure out which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes such that there exists some s that satisfies all of them.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, the original string s must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. So, for example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be part of the input. But since the input contains all prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the original string can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the original string s must be such that the longest prefix (which is of length n-1) and the longest suffix (also of length n-1) must be such that their combination forms s. For example, if the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S, then s must be P + last character of S, but wait, that's not necessarily correct. Wait, the longest prefix of s is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So combining these two, the original string s would be the first n-1 characters (prefix) plus the last character of the suffix. But since the suffix is of length n-1, the last character of the suffix is the last character of s. So if we have both the longest prefix and the longest suffix, then the original string can be constructed by taking the longest prefix and appending the last character of the longest suffix. However, this requires that the longest prefix and longest suffix overlap correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original string can be determined by looking for the unique string that is a prefix and a suffix. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. For example, in the first sample input, the original string is ababa. The prefixes of length 4 are abab and aba (wait, no, for length 5, the prefixes of length 4 is abab, and the suffixes of length 4 are baba. So the original string is ababa. So the longest prefix (length 4) is abab, the longest suffix (length 4) is baba. Then the original string is abab + a (the last character of the suffix) but that would be ababa, which is correct. But how do we know which of the input strings is the longest prefix and which is the longest suffix?\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. Find the longest possible prefix (length n-1) and the longest possible suffix (length n-1). But since the input contains two strings of each length, including length n-1, we need to find which of them are the actual prefix and suffix.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother thought: For the original string s, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix (length n-1) is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the original string s is equal to the longest prefix concatenated with the last character of the longest suffix. But since the longest prefix and the longest suffix both are of length n-1, their overlap is n-2 characters. So the first n-2 characters of the longest prefix must be the same as the last n-2 characters of the longest suffix. Because the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So the first n-2 characters of the longest prefix is s[0..n-3], and the last n-2 characters of the longest suffix is s[1..n-2]. These two must be equal. Therefore, for the longest prefix (P) and the longest suffix (S), the first n-2 characters of P must equal the last n-2 characters of S. Also, the last character of S is s[n-1], which is the last character of the original string. So the original string s would be P + last character of S.\n\nBut how do I find which two strings (of length",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the original string `s` by analyzing the longest possible prefixes and suffixes provided in the input.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest improper prefix and suffix of the string `s` are both of length `n-1`. These two strings must overlap correctly to form the original string `s`.\n2. **Determine Original String**: By checking all pairs of strings of length `n-1`, we can find the correct combination where the first `n-2` characters of the prefix match the last `n-2` characters of the suffix. This allows us to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n3. **Classify Other Strings**: Once we have the original string `s`, we can check each input string to determine if it is a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all pairs of these two candidates to find the correct s\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Check if the first n-2 chars of prefix match last n-2 chars of suffix\n            if prefix_candidate[:-1] == suffix_candidate[1:]:\n                # Reconstruct the original string s\n                s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    # Now classify all input strings as P or S\n    result = []\n    for s_str in strings:\n        if s.startswith(s_str):\n            result.append('P')\n        elif s.endswith(s_str):\n            result.append('S')\n        else:\n            # This should not happen according to the problem statement\n            result.append('P')  # fallback, though not expected\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`, and the subsequent lines contain the prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Finding Longest Prefix and Suffix**: We identify the two strings of length `n-1` from the input. These are potential candidates for the longest improper prefix and suffix.\n3. **Reconstructing Original String**: By checking the overlap between the two candidates of length `n-1`, we determine the correct original string `s`.\n4. **Classifying Strings**: For each input string, we check if it is a prefix or suffix of the reconstructed string `s` and build the result string accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the original string and classify each input string as either a prefix or a suffix, meeting the problem constraints and requirements.",
