He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, Polycarp has n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He wants to practice for exactly k days. Each day he solves at least one problem, and the order is fixed. So each day he takes a contiguous block starting from the previous day's end. So, the first day starts at problem 1, then the next day starts where the previous left off, etc. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty in that day's problems. The total profit is the sum of these maxima. I need to find the maximum possible total profit and the distribution of the number of problems per day.\n\nHmm. The example given is when n=8, k=3, and the array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]. The best split is [3,2,3], giving maxes 5,6,9 summing to 20.\n\nSo the challenge is to split the array into k contiguous parts, each part non-empty, and maximize the sum of maxima of each part.\n\nNow, how to approach this?\n\nFirst, I think dynamic programming (DP) might be useful here. Let's think about DP states.\n\nLet me think: Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days.\n\nThen, the recurrence would be something like: For each possible split point m (where m ranges from j-1 to i-1, since each day must have at least one problem), we can take dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut for n up to 2000 and k up to 2000, this would be O(n^2 *k) time. Wait, but n is 2000, so n^2 is 4 million, multiplied by k (2000) gives 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo this approach might not be feasible for the given constraints. Hmm. Need to think of optimizations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to precompute the max values for ranges. Like, for any interval [l, r], compute the maximum quickly. This can be done with a 2D array max_range[l][r], which stores the maximum of a[l..r]. But even with that, the DP approach would still be O(n^2 *k), which may not be feasible for n=2000.\n\nWait, but let's check the numbers. For n=2000, and k=2000, the DP would have O(n*k) states. For each state, we need to consider O(n) possibilities. So O(n^2 *k) = 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10 operations. That's way too big. Definitely not going to work.\n\nHmm. So perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about the problem again. Since the splits are contiguous and each day must take some consecutive problems from the start, maybe there's a greedy approach? But I don't think that's possible. Because the optimal split depends on future choices. For example, taking a larger maximum early might allow smaller maxima later, but it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for the DP approach, we can find a way to optimize the transitions. Let's think about the DP recurrence again.\n\nThe DP[i][j] represents the maximum total profit for the first i problems divided into j days. To compute this, we can look for all possible m < i where the j-1th day ends at m, and then the jth day is from m+1 to i. So:\n\ndp[i][j] = max over m from j-1 to i-1 of (dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]))\n\nBut the problem is computing max(a[m+1..i]) for all possible m and i. How can we compute that efficiently?\n\nWe can precompute a 2D array max_range where max_range[l][r] is the maximum value in a[l..r]. Then, for any m and i, the max from m+1 to i is max_range[m+1][i].\n\nBut how to compute max_range? Well, for each l from 1 to n, and r from l to n, we can compute the max. This can be done in O(n^2) time. For n=2000, that's 4 million operations, which is manageable.\n\nOnce that's precomputed, the DP transitions can be done with O(1) per transition. However, the overall time complexity remains O(n^2 *k), which for n=2000 and k=2000 is 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nSo we need to find another way.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum value of k? It's up to n. For example, if k = n, then each day must have exactly one problem. Then the total profit is sum of all elements. So for that case, the answer is straightforward.\n\nBut for general cases, perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP transitions. Let's think about the constraints on the problem.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the DP. For each j, when we compute dp[i][j], we need to find the best m for splitting into j-1 days up to m, and then the j-th day is m+1 to i.\n\nNow, for j=1, dp[i][1] is the max of a[1..i]. For j=2, dp[i][2] is max over m from 1 to i-1 of (dp[m][1] + max(a[m+1..i])).\n\nBut how can we compute this more efficiently?\n\nAnother idea: For each j, when computing dp[i][j], perhaps we can find a way to compute the max in O(1) or O(log n) time per i.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find that for certain ranges, the optimal m is determined in a way that allows us to compute the transitions faster.\n\nWait, here's an observation: when considering splitting into j days, the optimal way to split the first i problems is to have the last day be some interval [m+1, i], and the first j-1 days split the first m problems optimally. So for each i and j, we need to choose the best m.\n\nBut the problem is that for each i and j, we need to check all possible m's. However, perhaps for some j, we can find that the optimal m for i is somewhere in a certain range, allowing us to compute it more efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to the classic DP problem of splitting into k parts to maximize some function, but with the function being the sum of maxima.\n\nAnother thought: For each j, when computing dp[i][j], maybe the optimal m is such that the max of the last segment is as large as possible. However, since the max of the last segment is part of the sum, but the earlier segments are also contributing.\n\nBut how to exploit that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each i and j, the optimal split for the j-th day is to take as long as possible, but that's probably not correct. For example, in the sample input, the third day's split is [1,9,2], which includes the 9. But if you take the last day as longer, maybe you can capture higher maxima. But in other cases, splitting earlier could be better.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me think about the DP again. Suppose I have precomputed the max_range array. Then, for each dp[i][j], the transition is:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m+1][i] ), for m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nBut for each j, we can compute the dp[i][j] for all i. Let's think about the possible values of j. For example, when j is small, like 1 or 2, maybe we can compute the transitions efficiently.\n\nBut for the worst case, when k is up to 2000 and n is 2000, the O(n^2 *k) approach is not feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe n and k are both 2000, but in practice, for each j, the inner loop for i runs from j to n. So for j from 1 to k, and i from j to n.\n\nBut even that, the total number of operations is O(k * n^2) = 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10, which is way too big. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of the maximums. Each day's contribution is the maximum of the segment. Since the segments are contiguous and non-overlapping, and cover the entire array, perhaps the maximums are determined by certain key points in the array.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the maximums are 5, 6, 9. These are the peaks in their respective segments. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to split the array such that each segment contains a local maximum, and those maxima are as large as possible.\n\nBut how to formalize this?\n\nAnother angle: Since each day's segment is a prefix of the remaining array, perhaps we can model this as choosing the positions where we split. For example, the first split is after some position m1, then after m2, etc., such that m1 < m2 < ... < mk = n.\n\nBut again, this seems similar to the DP approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the DP, we can optimize the transitions. Let me think about the recurrence again.\n\nFor dp[i][j], we need to find m such that dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) is maximized. Now, the max(a[m+1..i]) is the maximum of the subarray from m+1 to i. Let's denote that as max_val(m+1, i).\n\nSo, for a fixed i and j, the question is to find the best m (from j-1 to i-1) to split.\n\nNow, for each i and j, can we find a way to compute this maximum more efficiently than O(i) time?\n\nLet me think about the following: For a fixed j and varying i, can we find a way to compute the max_val(m+1, i) for all possible m?\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed i and j, can we find a way to compute the max over m of (dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i}))?\n\nLet me think about the term max(a[m+1..i]). For each i, and for varying m (from 0 to i-1), the max(a[m+1..i]) can be computed using a sliding window approach. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For each i, the max(a[m+1..i]) is non-decreasing as m decreases. Because when you include more elements (as m decreases), the maximum can't decrease. So for a fixed i, as m decreases from i-1 to 0, the max increases or stays the same.\n\nBut how does that help us? Let's suppose that for a fixed i and j, when we look for the best m, the function dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i}) may have some properties that allow us to find the maximum quickly.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of an example. Suppose for j=2 and i=5, and for m from 1 to 4. The max(a[m+1..5]) increases as m decreases. But dp[m][1] is the max of a[1..m]. So adding them together... Not sure if there's any monotonicity here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a fixed j and i, we can find that the optimal m is the one that balances between the dp[m][j-1] and the max_val(m+1, i). But I don't see an obvious way.\n\nAnother thought: For each j, when building dp[i][j], perhaps we can precompute for each i the max_val for ranges ending at i. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each j, we can compute dp[i][j] based on the previous j-1 layer. For example, for j=2, dp[i][2] = max over m from 1 to i-1 of (max(a[1..m]) + max(a[m+1..i})). How can this be optimized?\n\nLet me think about the case where j=2. For each i, the optimal m is such that the sum of the max of the first part and the max of the second part is maximized.\n\nBut how to find this m efficiently. For example, for each i, the max(a[m+1..i}) is the maximum between a[m+1] to a[i]. So for m ranging from 1 to i-1, the max is non-decreasing as m decreases. So for m from 1 to i-1, the max increases as m decreases.\n\nOn the other hand, dp[m][1] is the max of a[1..m], which is non-decreasing as m increases. So for each m, dp[m][1] increases with m. So when combining these two terms, the sum could have a single peak, allowing us to find the optimal m using ternary search. But I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each i and j, the optimal m is the one where the max of the current segment is as large as possible. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For the j-th day, the last segment is from m+1 to i. The maximum of that segment is some value. To maximize the total sum, we want to maximize the sum of the previous j-1 days plus this maximum. But how?\n\nThis feels stuck. Maybe I should look for some hints or similar problems.\n\nWait, this problem resembles the problem of splitting an array into k segments to maximize the sum of the maximums of each segment. And the solution for that is typically dynamic programming with O(n^2k) time, but with some optimizations.\n\nBut given the constraints of n up to 2000, and k up to 2000, even O(n^2k) is way too slow. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP for this specific problem.\n\nLet me think about the possible maximum value of k. If k is small, say up to 100, then O(n^2k) is 2000*2000*100 = 4e8 operations, which is manageable. But for k up to 2000, it's 8e10 operations, which is way too big.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that k can be up to n. So, perhaps there's a way to optimize for the case when k is large. For example, when k is large, the number of splits is high, so each day's segment is small. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to reduce the time complexity by noting that for each j, the DP[i][j] can be computed in O(n) time. But how?\n\nWait, here's a thought. Let's think about the recurrence again. For dp[i][j], the maximum is over m in [j-1, i-1] of dp[m][j-1] + max(m+1, i).\n\nNow, for each j, when computing dp[i][j], perhaps we can find a way to compute this max efficiently by maintaining some data structure.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Another idea: For each j, and for each i, we can precompute the max from m+1 to i. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each j and i, the term max(m+1, i) can be rewritten as the maximum of a[m+1..i], which can be found using a segment tree or sparse table for range maximum queries. However, for each m and i, this is O(1) with O(n log n) preprocessing. But even then, the DP would still be O(n^2k) time.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the constraints again. Let's try to compute the maximum possible time for the DP approach. For n=2000, and k=2000, O(n^2k) is 8e10 operations. Which is way beyond what Python can handle in reasonable time. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the splits are contiguous, and each day's segment starts where the previous ended, perhaps the problem can be transformed into selecting k-1 split points. For example, the split points are positions between elements, such that the first split is after position m1, then after m2, etc. But again, this doesn't immediately suggest a better approach.\n\nAnother observation: For the maximum sum, each day's segment must contain at least one element that is the maximum of that segment. Also, the overall maximum of the entire array must be in one of the segments. So, perhaps the optimal way is to have each segment include a local maximum.\n\nBut how to use this.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: For each day, the maximum of that day's segment contributes to the total. So, to maximize the sum, we want as many large maxima as possible. However, since each segment is contiguous, we can't just take the top k elements. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 2, 4], and k=2, the best is [1,3], [2,4] with sum 3+4=7. Alternatively, [1,3,2], [4] gives sum 3+4=7. Same result. But if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and k=2, the best is [1,2,3,4], [5], sum 4+5=9. Or [1,2,3], [4,5], sum 3+5=8. So taking the largest element as a separate segment is better.\n\nThis suggests that the optimal strategy is to have each segment contain a peak, and arrange the splits such that the largest elements are each in their own segments. But how to implement this.\n\nBut this seems like a greedy approach, but I'm not sure. For example, in the sample input, the array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]. The largest element is 9. So the last day's segment must include it. The second largest is 6, which is in the second day. The third is 5, which is in the first day. So the splits are made such that each of these maxima is in their own segment.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Perhaps the optimal strategy is to split the array into k segments, where each segment contains one of the top k elements. But how to select which ones and where to split.\n\nBut even this is not straightforward. For example, if there are multiple elements with the same value, or if the top elements are close together.\n\nBut this line of thinking might lead us to a greedy approach. However, I'm not sure how to implement it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be viewed as selecting k-1 split points to maximize the sum of the maxima of each segment. For example, for the first split, we can choose where to split to get the best possible sum for the first two segments, then recursively do the same for the remaining segments. However, this greedy approach may not yield the optimal solution.\n\nBut given that the DP approach is too slow, perhaps we need to find some way to optimize it.\n\nWait, what if we note that for the DP[i][j], the value of j can be up to k, and for each j, we can compute the DP[i][j] for all i in O(n) time? How?\n\nLet me think again about the recurrence:\n\ndp[i][j] = max_{m} (dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]))\n\nLet me consider that for j, we can compute dp[i][j] for all i from j to n. Now, for each j, we can process i in increasing order.\n\nNow, for each i, the max(a[m+1..i]) can be computed for m in [j-1, i-1]. But for a fixed i, as m increases, the range [m+1, i] becomes smaller. So the max(a[m+1..i]) is non-increasing as m increases. Because when m increases by 1, the range is [m+1, i], which is a subset of the previous range [m, i], so the maximum can only stay the same or decrease.\n\nSo, for a fixed i and j, the term max(a[m+1..i]) is non-increasing as m increases. Meanwhile, dp[m][j-1] is non-decreasing as m increases (since adding more elements to the first m elements can't decrease the maximum for j-1 days). Wait, no. dp[m][j-1] is the maximum total profit for splitting the first m elements into j-1 days. How does this behave as m increases? For example, if m increases by 1, the new dp[m+1][j-1] is the maximum between previous splits and adding the new element as a new day. So, it's possible that dp[m][j-1] is non-decreasing as m increases. Because adding more elements allows for more flexibility in splitting, which can't decrease the maximum sum.\n\nAssuming that dp[m][j-1] is non-decreasing as m increases, and the max(a[m+1..i]) is non-increasing as m increases, then the sum of these two terms could have a single maximum point. Thus, for each i and j, we can perform a binary search on m to find the optimal split point.\n\nBut how to verify this assumption?\n\nLet me think about the dp[m][j-1] being non-decreasing. For example, when you increase m by 1, the new dp[m+1][j-1] is the maximum over all possible splits for m+1 elements into j-1 days. Since the previous splits for m elements are included in the possibilities for m+1 elements, the maximum can't decrease. Hence, dp[m][j-1] is non-decreasing in m.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So dp[m][j-1] increases as m increases. And the max(a[m+1..i]) decreases as m increases. So the function f(m) = dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i}) is the sum of a non-decreasing function and a non-increasing function. This function may have a single maximum point, which can be found via ternary search.\n\nIf this is true, then for each i and j, we can perform a ternary search on m in the range [j-1, i-1] to find the optimal m. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n^2k) to O(nk log n), which is acceptable for n=2000 and k=2000. Let's calculate: 2000 * 2000 * log(2000) ≈ 2000*2000*11 ≈ 44 million operations. That's manageable in Python.\n\nBut how to confirm that the function f(m) is unimodal (has a single maximum), so that ternary search can be applied. Well, for the sum of a non-decreasing and non-increasing function, it's possible that the function is unimodal, but not guaranteed. However, in practice, it may work, and perhaps there's a way to prove it.\n\nAlternatively, even if it's not strictly unimodal, ternary search may find a good enough maximum. However, this approach may not be correct in all cases. So, this is a risky assumption.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that for each i and j, the optimal m is the one where a[m+1..i] has its maximum as large as possible. But again, not sure.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps trying this approach is worth it. Let's proceed under the assumption that the function is unimodal and that ternary search can find the maximum.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the max_range array for all intervals [l, r].\n\n2. Initialize the DP table. For j=1, dp[i][1] = max_range[1][i].\n\n3. For each j from 2 to k:\n\n   a. For each i from j to n:\n\n      i. Perform a ternary search on m in [j-1, i-1] to find the m that maximizes dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m+1][i].\n\n      ii. Set dp[i][j] to this maximum value.\n\nBut how to handle the ternary search. For each i and j, the range of m is from low = j-1 to high = i-1. We need to find the m in this range that maximizes the function f(m).\n\nHowever, ternary search works on unimodal functions. If the function is not unimodal, the ternary search may not find the correct maximum. But given that the function is the sum of a non-decreasing and non-increasing function, it's possible that the function has a single peak. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose dp[m][j-1] increases with m, and max_range[m+1][i] decreases with m. Then f(m) = increasing + decreasing. The function could be unimodal. For example, initially, as m increases, the increasing part dominates, so f increases. After a certain point, the decreasing part dominates, and f decreases. Hence, there's a single maximum.\n\nIn this case, ternary search would work.\n\nBut what if there are multiple peaks? For example, if the function first increases, then decreases, then increases again. But I think that this is unlikely given the nature of the functions.\n\nThus, proceeding with this approach.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, then we need to reconstruct the path to find the split points. For that, we need to keep track of the m that was chosen for each dp[i][j].\n\nSo, during the DP computation, we can also store a parent array, say, prev[i][j], which stores the m that gives the optimal split for dp[i][j].\n\nOnce the DP is filled, we can backtrack from dp[n][k] to find the split points.\n\nNow, the steps to implement:\n\nFirst, precompute the max_range array. For that, we can use dynamic programming as well. For each l from 1 to n, and for each r >= l, max_range[l][r] = max( max_range[l][r-1], a[r] ). This can be computed in O(n^2) time.\n\nThen, the DP:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (k+1). Similarly for the prev array.\n\nFor j=1, dp[i][1] = max_range[1][i].\n\nFor j > 1, for each i >= j, compute dp[i][j] using ternary search on m in [j-1, i-1].\n\nBut implementing ternary search for each i and j.\n\nBut how to implement the ternary search. Let's think of the code for that part.\n\nFor each i and j, the low is j-1 (since for j-1 days, you need at least j-1 problems, so m must be >= j-1), and high is i-1 (since m+1 <= i).\n\nThe function to evaluate is f(m) = dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m+1][i].\n\nSo, during the ternary search, we can find the m that maximizes this function.\n\nBut in practice, since the function may not be strictly unimodal, we need to check all possible candidates around the ternary search's midpoint. Alternatively, we can use a binary search approach that finds the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, since the range of m is small (for i up to 2000, the range is up to 2000 elements), even for each i and j, iterating through all possible m in the range is O(n) per i and j. Which brings us back to O(n^2k) time. Which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the ternary search approach could reduce the time complexity. However, if the ternary search is not reliable, then this is not helpful. So, what's the alternative?\n\nAnother idea: For each j and i, the optimal m for dp[i][j] is such that the max_range[m+1][i] is as large as possible. But since the max_range[m+1][i] is non-increasing with m, perhaps the optimal m is the one where the max_range[m+1][i] is as large as possible, but also considering the dp[m][j-1].\n\nBut how to find this balance.\n\nAlternatively, for each i and j, we can iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, and keep track of the maximum value. But since for each i and j, the m ranges from j-1 to i-1, which is O(n) per i and j, leading to O(n^2k) time again.\n\nBut with n=2000 and k=2000, this is 8e10 operations, which is way too slow for Python.\n\nWait, but perhaps in practice, for many test cases, k is small. However, the problem requires handling all possible cases.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find a way to optimize the DP for this particular problem.\n\nLet me think about the following: for each j, when computing dp[i][j], can we find a way to compute it using the previous j-1 layer in a more efficient way.\n\nAnother observation: For a fixed j, the maximum number of days is j. So, for j=2, the previous layer is j-1=1, which is the max of the first m elements. For j=2, the dp[i][2] is the max over m of (max of first m elements) + max of (m+1 to i).\n\nBut for j=2, the max of first m elements is simply a[1..m], and the max of m+1 to i is a[m+1..i]. So, for j=2, we can precompute for each i the best m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think for j=2. For each i, we need to find m in 1..i-1, and compute max(1..m) + max(m+1..i). How can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: For each i, we can iterate m from 1 to i-1, and compute the sum. But again, this is O(n^2) for j=2.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the max of a[m+1..i] is the maximum of the suffix starting at m+1. So for each i, the max of a[m+1..i] can be precomputed for all m. Let's call this suffix_max[m], which is the maximum from m to i. Wait, but for each i, we can compute the suffix maximums once.\n\nFor example, for a given i, we can compute an array suffix_max where suffix_max[m] is the maximum of a[m..i], for m from 1 to i.\n\nThis can be computed in O(n) time for each i. Then, for j=2, for each i, we can compute for each m from 1 to i-1, the value dp[m][1] (which is the max of a[1..m]) + suffix_max[m+1].\n\nBut again, this is O(n^2) time for j=2.\n\nBut with j up to 2000, this is not helpful.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: For each j, the dp[i][j] can be computed using the previous j-1 layer, and for each i, the optimal m is the one that maximizes dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i}).\n\nNow, for a fixed j and i, the max(a[m+1..i}) can be represented as the maximum of the suffix from m+1 to i. Let's denote this as suffix_max[m+1][i]. \n\nNow, for each j and i, we can think of this as finding the maximum of (dp[m][j-1] + suffix_max[m+1][i}) for m in [j-1, i-1].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, for each j and i, the suffix_max[m+1][i} can be written as the maximum of a[m+1..i}. Let's think of this as the maximum of the suffix from position m+1 to i. For a fixed i, as m increases, this suffix becomes shorter and the maximum can only decrease or stay the same.\n\nSo for a fixed i and j, the suffix_max[m+1][i} is non-increasing as m increases.\n\nAnd dp[m][j-1} is non-decreasing as m increases.\n\nSo, the function f(m) = non-decreasing + non-increasing.\n\nThis function may have a single maximum. So, for each i and j, we can find the optimal m by checking all possible m in a certain range, but perhaps we can find it using a two-pointer approach.\n\nFor example, for a fixed i and j, we can start with m = j-1 and move forward until the function starts to decrease. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the function is non-decreasing then non-increasing, the maximum is achieved where the derivative changes sign. But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, for each i and j, we can find the m where the maximum of the suffix is equal to the maximum of the dp[m][j-1} + ... .\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear way to do this.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should proceed with the original DP approach, but try to optimize it as much as possible, given the time constraints.\n\nLet me think about the original DP approach, with O(n^2k) time. For n=2000, and k=2000, it's 8e10 operations, which is way too slow. But what if k is small? For example, if k=3, then it's 2000*2000*3 = 12 million operations. Which is manageable.\n\nBut for the worst case, it's not feasible. However, maybe the problem expects this solution, and the test cases are not too strict for Python.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constraints are not as tight as I think. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe constraints are 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2000. So n is up to 2000. For the worst case, n=2000, k=2000. But for this case, the answer is simply the sum of all elements, because each day has exactly one problem. So in this case, the DP would have to compute for j from 1 to 2000, but for j=2000, i=2000, and for each i and j, the computation is trivial.\n\nBut for cases where k is small, like k=2, the DP would be O(n^2 * 2) = 8 million operations.\n\nBut for k=1000, it would be O(2000^2 * 1000) = 4e9 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nSo, this suggests that the DP approach is not feasible for the given constraints.\n\nHmm. What's the alternative?\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Since the segments are contiguous and must cover the entire array, perhaps we can model the problem as choosing k-1 split points, and the total profit is the sum of the maximum of each segment.\n\nThe problem now becomes: choose k-1 split points to divide the array into k segments, such that the sum of the maxima of each segment is maximized.\n\nNow, this is similar to the problem of splitting the array into k segments to maximize the sum of segment maxima.\n\nI recall that this problem can be solved with dynamic programming, but with optimizations.\n\nLet me think about the following optimization: for each j, when computing dp[i][j], instead of checking all possible m, we can find that the optimal m is the one where the maximum of the current segment is the global maximum of the array. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that for each segment, the maximum is at least as large as the maximum of the previous segments. No, that's not necessarily true.\n\nAnother idea: For the j-th segment, the maximum of that segment is the maximum of the entire array. But if we have to split into k segments, then we can choose to put the global maximum in one of the segments, and then recursively split the remaining parts.\n\nBut how to determine which segments to split.\n\nFor example, let's say the global maximum is at position p. We must include it in one of the segments. To maximize the total profit, we should have this segment contain only the global maximum, or as much as possible. But this is not necessarily always the case.\n\nBut this suggests that the optimal solution involves including the global maximum in its own segment. Then, recursively apply the same logic to the remaining segments.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the sample input: [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]. The global maximum is 9, which is at position 7. To include it in its own segment,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute `n` problems into `k` days such that the total profit, defined as the sum of the maximum difficulty of each day's problems, is maximized.
