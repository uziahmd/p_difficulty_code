Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about Leha choosing two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x days, and they don't overlap. And we need to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If it's not possible, output -1.\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, each voucher has a duration of ri - li + 1. Let's call this duration d. For two vouchers i and j, their durations must sum to x. So for each voucher, if its duration is d, we need another voucher with duration x - d. Also, these two vouchers must not overlap. So either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to efficiently find for each voucher, the minimal cost of a voucher that has the required duration and does not overlap with it.\n\nBut how do I do that efficiently given the constraints on n (up to 2e5)?\n\nLet me think about grouping vouchers by their duration. For example, for each possible duration d, we can have a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we look for vouchers with duration x - d, and check if there's one that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut even that might be too slow if done naively. Because for each voucher, checking all vouchers of the other duration could take O(n^2) time in the worst case.\n\nSo we need an efficient way to find, for a given voucher, the minimum cost voucher in the other duration group that does not overlap with it.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the vouchers for a given duration. Suppose we have all vouchers of duration d. For a voucher A (with duration d), we need to find a voucher B with duration (x - d) that ends before A starts (so B's ri < A's li) or starts after A ends (B's li > A's ri). The minimal cost for such B's would be what we need.\n\nBut how to find that quickly?\n\nFor each duration, maybe we can pre-process the vouchers in a sorted manner. For example, for vouchers of duration k, sort them by their end date (ri), and also by their start date (li). Then, for a given voucher A, when looking for vouchers B of duration (x - d) that end before A's start, we can find the earliest ones and take the minimum cost. Similarly for those that start after A ends.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration k, we can have two sorted lists: one sorted by ri (end date), and another sorted by li (start date). Wait, but for vouchers of duration k, the start and end dates are related. Since the duration is fixed, ri = li + k - 1. So perhaps we can store for each duration k, the list of vouchers sorted by their start date (li), and also sorted by their end date (ri).\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's consider that for a voucher A with duration d, we need to find vouchers B with duration (x - d) that are non-overlapping. So:\n\nCase 1: B ends before A starts. That is, B's ri < A's li.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A ends. That is, B's li > A's ri.\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can look for vouchers B in the other duration group that satisfy either case 1 or case 2. For each case, we need to find the minimum cost among those B's.\n\nNow, for each duration group (say, for duration k), if we have the vouchers sorted by their end date (ri), then for case 1, we can find all B's where ri < A's li. The minimal cost in that subset would be the minimum of all such B's. Similarly, for case 2, if the vouchers are sorted by start date (li), we can find all B's where li > A's ri, and take the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to find these minima quickly?\n\nAh, here's an idea. For each duration k, we can pre-process two arrays:\n\n- Sorted list of vouchers by their end date (ri), and for each position in this sorted list, have a prefix minimum of the cost. So that for any query of \"find the minimal cost among vouchers with end date < X\", we can binary search for X in the sorted list of end dates, and then take the prefix min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the same duration k, have a sorted list of vouchers by their start date (li), and a suffix min array. So that for a query of \"find the minimal cost among vouchers with start date > Y\", we can binary search for Y in the sorted list of start dates, and then take the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nWait, but for the same duration, the vouchers may have varying start and end dates. So for each duration k, we can pre-process two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by ri (end date), and for each position in this list, the prefix min cost.\n\n- Another sorted by li (start date), and for each position in this list, the suffix min cost.\n\nThen, for a voucher A with duration d, and looking for vouchers B with duration k = x - d:\n\n- For case 1: find all B's with ri < A's li. Since the list is sorted by ri, we can binary search for the largest ri less than A's li, and get the prefix min up to that index.\n\n- For case 2: find all B's with li > A's ri. The list is sorted by li, so we can binary search for the first li greater than A's ri, and get the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nIf we can find these minima for both cases, then the minimal between them (if any) would be the best option for B for this A.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Pre-process all vouchers into groups by their duration. For each duration, we have two sorted lists (by ri and by li), along with prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\n2. For each voucher A (with duration d), compute k = x - d. If k is not present in the duration groups, skip. Otherwise:\n\n   a. Check for case 1: B's ri < A's li. Use the sorted ri list of duration k to find the minimal cost.\n\n   b. Check for case 2: B's li > A's ri. Use the sorted li list of duration k to find the minimal cost.\n\n   c. Take the minimum between a and b (if any), and add to the current voucher's cost. Keep track of the global minimum.\n\n3. After processing all vouchers, return the global minimum if found, else -1.\n\nThis approach should be efficient because for each voucher, we perform two binary searches and lookups in O(log m) time, where m is the number of vouchers in the group of duration k. Since the total number of vouchers is n, the overall time complexity would be O(n log n) in the worst case.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, group the vouchers by their duration. Let's create a dictionary, say duration_map, where the key is the duration, and the value is a tuple of two sorted lists (sorted by ri and sorted by li), along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nBut wait, for each duration, we need to have two sorted lists. Let's see:\n\nFor each duration k:\n\n- Sort the list of vouchers by ri (end date). Then create a prefix min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 elements.\n\n- Sort the list of vouchers by li (start date). Then create a suffix min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among elements from i to end.\n\nBut how to handle the sorted lists? Let's take an example.\n\nFor the first part (sorted by ri):\n\nSuppose we have vouchers for duration k. We sort them in increasing order of ri. Then, for each position i in this sorted list, the prefix_min[i] is the minimum of cost from 0 to i.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted by li list, we sort the vouchers by li in increasing order. Then, for each position i, the suffix_min[i] is the minimum of cost from i to end.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for a given voucher A, when looking for case 1 (B's ri < A's li), we can perform a binary search on the sorted ri list of duration k. Find the largest ri that is less than A's li. Then, the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost for case 1.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2 (B's li > A's ri), we perform a binary search on the sorted li list of duration k. Find the first li that is larger than A's ri. Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost for case 2.\n\nBut how to implement the binary search for these cases?\n\nFor case 1: sorted_ri_list is a list of vouchers sorted by ri. We want to find the maximum index where ri < A_li. So, in Python, we can use bisect_left to find the insertion point of A_li in the sorted list of ri's. Then, the number of elements before that insertion point is the count. So the prefix_min up to that index (insertion_point - 1) would be the minimal cost.\n\nBut if insertion_point is zero, then there are no such elements.\n\nFor case 2: sorted_li_list is a list of vouchers sorted by li. We want to find the first index where li > A_ri. Using bisect_right for A_ri in the sorted list of li's. Then, all elements from that index onwards have li > A_ri. The suffix_min for that index would give the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to handle the suffix min?\n\nFor example, if the sorted_li_list is [l1, l2, l3, ...], sorted in increasing order, and we find that the first element greater than A_ri is at index 'pos', then the suffix_min for pos to end is the minimal cost.\n\nSo, for each duration, we need to precompute:\n\n- sorted_ri_list (sorted by ri) and prefix_min array.\n\n- sorted_li_list (sorted by li) and suffix_min array.\n\nNow, how to build these?\n\nLet me think. For each duration k in duration_map:\n\nsorted_ri = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_ri)\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_ri[0].cost\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_ri)-1:\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_ri[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for sorted_li:\n\nsorted_li = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_li)\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_li[-1].cost\nfor i in range(len(sorted_li)-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_li[i].cost)\n\nOnce these are built, then during processing, for each voucher A with duration d, we check if x - d is in the duration_map. If not, skip. Else:\n\nk = x - d\n\nCheck if there are any vouchers in k's group.\n\nFor case 1: find in k's sorted_ri list the max ri < A.li. If exists, get the min cost from prefix_min.\n\nFor case 2: find in k's sorted_li list the first li > A.ri. If exists, get the min cost from suffix_min.\n\nNow, for each voucher A, we can get the possible min cost for case 1 and case 2, and take the minimum between them (if any exist), then add to A's cost, and keep track of the global min.\n\nBut how to handle when there are multiple vouchers in k's group?\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers. For each voucher, compute its duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup the vouchers into a dictionary, where the key is d, and the value is a list of vouchers. Then, for each key in the dictionary, process the sorted_ri and sorted_li lists, and their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through all vouchers again. For each voucher A:\n\nCompute d = duration of A. Then, k = x - d.\n\nIf k is not in the duration_map, skip.\n\nElse, check for possible B vouchers in k's group.\n\nFor case 1:\n\nIn k's group, sorted_ri list. We need to find all vouchers with ri < A's li. The minimal cost among them.\n\nTo find the insertion point for A's li in the sorted_ri list's ri values.\n\nFor example, in Python, we can have a list of the ri values for the sorted_ri list, and perform bisect_left on that.\n\nWait, but for the sorted_ri list, each voucher is sorted by ri. So we can create a list of ri's for that group. Let's say for each duration group, we have:\n\nsorted_ri = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nThen, the list of ri's is [v.ri for v in sorted_ri]\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each duration group, we can store:\n\n- sorted_ri_list (the list of vouchers sorted by ri)\n\n- ri_values (the list of ri's for these vouchers)\n\n- prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_li_list and li_values.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can generate these as needed.\n\nOnce we have the ri_values list, for case 1:\n\nWe can perform a bisect_left on ri_values to find the insertion point of A.li. The index is pos. Then, the number of elements before pos is pos elements. If pos == 0, then no elements. Else, the minimum cost is prefix_min[pos - 1].\n\nSimilarly for case 2:\n\nsorted_li_list is sorted by li. The li_values is the list of li's. We can perform a bisect_right on li_values for A.ri. The pos gives the first index where li > A.ri. Then, if pos is less than len(li_values), then the suffix_min[pos] is the minimal cost in that suffix.\n\nSo, for example, if the li_values is [1, 2, 3, 4], and A.ri is 2, then bisect_right returns 2 (since elements before index 2 are <= 2). So the elements starting at index 2 are 3 and 4, which are > 2.\n\nThus, the suffix_min for pos=2 would be the minimal cost in that part.\n\nSo, during the code:\n\nFor each voucher A:\n\nd = A's duration\n\nk = x - d\n\nif k not in duration_map: continue\n\nElse:\n\ngroup = duration_map[k]\n\nprocess case 1:\n\nsorted_ri_list = group's sorted_ri list\n\nri_values = [v.ri for v in sorted_ri_list]\n\nprefix_min = group's prefix_min array\n\npos = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, A.li)\n\nif pos > 0:\n\n    min_case1 = prefix_min[pos - 1]\n\nelse:\n\n    min_case1 = infinity\n\nprocess case 2:\n\nsorted_li_list = group's sorted_li list\n\nli_values = [v.li for v in sorted_li_list]\n\nsuffix_min = group's suffix_min array\n\npos = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, A.ri)\n\nif pos < len(li_values):\n\n    min_case2 = suffix_min[pos]\n\nelse:\n\n    min_case2 = infinity\n\nthen, the minimal between min_case1 and min_case2 is the best for this voucher A and group k.\n\nIf either is valid, then add A.cost + min_val to the global min.\n\nBut we have to make sure that the group k is not the same as the current voucher's group. Wait, no. Because the problem says that i != j. So when k equals d (i.e., x = 2d), then the group k is same as d. So when we process voucher A, and k is same as d, we need to make sure that there is another voucher in the group. For example, if x is 2d, then we need two vouchers in the same group. But how to ensure that when we process voucher A, we find a voucher B in the same group that does not overlap with A.\n\nBut in the current approach, when k = d, and the group is same as the current voucher's group, then during case 1 and case 2 processing, the code may pick voucher A itself. But since we need two different vouchers, we need to make sure that in the group, there are at least two vouchers, and that the voucher B is not the same as A.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because when k = d, and the group is the same as the current voucher's group, the code may include the same voucher as A. For example, if there's only one voucher in the group, then it's impossible. But if there are multiple vouchers, then when we process voucher A, the code may find a voucher B that is A itself. Which is invalid.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nAh, right. So the code as described would not check for i != j. Because when k is same as d, and we are looking for vouchers in the same group, we need to make sure that the voucher B is different from A.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nHmm. For example, suppose the group has multiple vouchers. When processing voucher A, during the case 1 and case 2 checks, the code may find the minimal cost in the group, but that could be the same voucher. How to avoid that?\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's think about the scenario where x is 2d, and the group has multiple vouchers. For example, suppose there are two vouchers in the group. When processing voucher A, the code may find voucher B in the same group. But if B is A itself, then it's invalid. However, if there are at least two vouchers in the group, then during the processing of A, the code could find another voucher B.\n\nBut how to ensure that the code finds a B that is different from A?\n\nOne approach is to, during the processing of the group, for case 1 and case 2, find the minimal cost among all vouchers except A. But how?\n\nBut that would complicate things. Because for each voucher A in the group, when we process it, we need to check if the minimal cost in the group is from another voucher.\n\nAlternative idea: when k is equal to d, then during the processing of voucher A, the group is the same as the group of A. Therefore, when looking for vouchers B in the group, we need to exclude A.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of an example. Suppose the group has multiple vouchers. For case 1, when we find the minimal cost in the group for vouchers with ri < A.li, but if the minimal is achieved by a voucher B that is not A, then it's okay. If the minimal is achieved by A itself, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in that subset.\n\nBut how to do that without checking all vouchers in the subset?\n\nThis seems challenging. Perhaps the solution is to allow the code to find the minimal cost, and then check whether there exists at least one voucher in the subset that is not A. But how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration group, we can have multiple vouchers. So when processing a voucher A, when looking for B in the same group (k = d), we can find the minimal cost in the group that is not A. But how?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive. For example, if the group has m vouchers, then for each voucher A, during case 1 and case 2, we need to find the minimal cost excluding A. But that would require O(m) time per voucher, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: during the initial grouping, for each duration, we can store all vouchers. Then, when processing voucher A, and if k = d, then during case 1 and case 2, we can find the minimal cost in the group, but subtract the possibility that the minimal is A itself. However, how?\n\nBut in practice, when the code finds the minimal cost in the group, it's possible that the minimal is A's cost. In that case, we need to check if there's another voucher in the group that satisfies the condition. But how to know that?\n\nFor example, during case 1, suppose the minimal cost is found in the group, and that minimal is the same as A's cost. Then, perhaps there are other vouchers in the group that also meet the condition (ri < A's li) and have the same cost. Or maybe not. How can we know?\n\nThis seems really complicated. Perhaps there's a better way. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem requires that the two vouchers are different. So, during the entire process, when considering a voucher A and a voucher B, they must be different. So, when k is the same as d, and the group is the same, the code must ensure that the voucher B is not the same as A.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn alternative idea: during the grouping, for each duration, we can have all vouchers. When processing a voucher A, and looking for B in the same group, we can find the minimal cost in the group that satisfies the non-overlapping condition, and also that B is not A.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nFor example, during case 1 processing for the same group, we can find the minimal cost in the group where ri < A's li. Then, if the minimal cost is achieved by a voucher that is not A, then that's acceptable. If the minimal is achieved by A, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the group that meet the condition.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems like a problem that would require checking all vouchers in the subset. Which would be O(m) time, which is not feasible for large m.\n\nAlternative approach: during the initial grouping, for each duration, store the sorted lists and their min arrays, but for each voucher in the group, when looking for B, we can check if the minimal found is from the same voucher. If yes, then we need to find the next minimal.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can allow the code to include the same voucher, and then during the final check, subtract those cases. But that seems messy.\n\nWait, but in the case where k = d, and the code finds a B that is A itself, then the two vouchers would be the same, which is invalid. So during the processing, when we find a min_case1 or min_case2, we need to check if that min comes from a voucher that is different from A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think of a way to handle this.\n\nSuppose that during the case 1 processing for the same group, the code finds that the minimal cost is in the prefix_min array. However, this minimal could be from A itself. How to check that?\n\nFor example, suppose that the sorted_ri list contains voucher A. Then, during the case 1 processing, the code finds that the minimal cost is in the prefix_min array. But if the voucher A is in the subset of vouchers with ri < A's li, then the code would include it. However, since the voucher A's ri is equal to its own ri, which is not less than A's li. Wait, no. Wait, A's ri is the end date of voucher A. For case 1, we are looking for vouchers B with ri < A's li. So, if voucher A is in the group, then for it to be included in the subset, its ri must be < A's li. But since A's ri is the end date of voucher A, and A's li is the start date of voucher A, then ri >= li. So, for voucher A, ri >= li. Thus, for case 1, the condition ri < A's li is equivalent to ri < li. Which can't be true for voucher A itself. Because ri >= li. So, voucher A cannot be in the subset of vouchers for case 1. So, the minimal cost in case 1 for the same group will not include voucher A. Because voucher A's ri is >= A's li, so in the sorted_ri list, the ri_values for voucher A is >= A's li. Thus, during case 1 processing, when we are looking for vouchers with ri < A's li, voucher A's ri is not less than A's li, so it's not included. Hence, the code for case 1 will not consider voucher A.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: looking for vouchers B with li > A's ri. For voucher A, its li is <= ri (since duration is positive). So, voucher A's li is <= ri. So, for case 2, voucher A's li is not > A's ri. Hence, voucher A is not included in the subset for case 2 processing.\n\nTherefore, when k is equal to d, and the group is same as the current voucher's group, the code for case 1 and case 2 will not include voucher A in the subsets. Therefore, even if the group contains only one voucher (which is A), the code will not find any B in the subsets, and hence, no problem.\n\nWait, this is a crucial insight! Because for case 1, we are looking for B's with ri < A's li. But for voucher A's own ri, which is >= A's li, it cannot be in this subset. So, when processing voucher A, the code for case 1 and case 2 will not include voucher A in the subsets. Therefore, even if the group is same as d, the code will not select the same voucher as B. So, the problem of i != j is automatically handled.\n\nWow! That's a relief. So this means that during the processing of voucher A, when looking for B in the same group (k = d), the code will not include voucher A in the subsets. Therefore, the i != j condition is automatically satisfied.\n\nThat's a great simplification. So we don't need to worry about i != j. Because when looking for B in the same group, the code ensures that B is not A. Because B's ri < A's li (case 1) implies that B is not A. Similarly for case 2.\n\nSo the previous approach is correct, and we don't have to worry about overlapping with the same voucher.\n\nThat's a big relief. Now, the code can proceed as outlined earlier.\n\nNow, the next step is to code this in Python.\n\nBut how to represent the vouchers and their data.\n\nLet me think about the data structures.\n\nWe can read all vouchers into a list. Then, for each voucher, compute its duration. Then, group them by duration.\n\nFor each duration in the group, we need to:\n\nSort the vouchers by ri, and create a list of their ri's and a prefix_min array.\n\nSort the vouchers by li, and create a list of their li's and a suffix_min array.\n\nIn Python, for each duration, we can store:\n\n- sorted_ri: list of vouchers sorted by ri.\n\n- ri_values: list of ri's for sorted_ri.\n\n- prefix_min: list of prefix minima.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_li, li_values, and suffix_min.\n\nSo, for each duration, we can precompute these.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read n lines of li, ri, cost. For each, compute duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup the vouchers into a dictionary, say from collections import defaultdict. duration_dict = defaultdict(list). For each voucher, append it to duration_dict[d].\n\nOnce all vouchers are grouped, for each duration in duration_dict, process the sorted_ri and sorted_li lists, and their min arrays.\n\nThen, initialize the answer as infinity.\n\nIterate through all vouchers again. For each voucher A:\n\nd = duration of A.\n\nk = x - d.\n\nif k not in duration_dict: continue.\n\nElse:\n\ngroup = duration_dict[k]\n\nprocess case 1 and case 2.\n\nFor case 1:\n\nsorted_ri = group's sorted_ri list (sorted by ri).\n\nri_values = [v.ri for v in sorted_ri]\n\nprefix_min = group's prefix_min array.\n\npos = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, A.li)\n\nif pos > 0:\n\n    min_case1 = prefix_min[pos - 1]\n\nelse:\n\n    min_case1 = infinity.\n\nFor case 2:\n\nsorted_li = group's sorted_li list (sorted by li).\n\nli_values = [v.li for v in sorted_li]\n\nsuffix_min = group's suffix_min array.\n\npos = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, A.ri)\n\nif pos < len(li_values):\n\n    min_case2 = suffix_min[pos]\n\nelse:\n\n    min_case2 = infinity.\n\ncurrent_min = min(min_case1, min_case2)\n\nif current_min is not infinity:\n\n    total = A.cost + current_min\n\n    if total < answer:\n\n        answer = total.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if answer is still infinity, output -1, else output answer.\n\nBut how to store the sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min, etc. for each duration?\n\nWe can create for each duration, a structure. For example, for each duration, we can precompute:\n\nsorted_ri_list, ri_values, prefix_min.\n\nsorted_li_list, li_values, suffix_min.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration in duration_dict, we process:\n\nvouchers_in_group = duration_dict[d]\n\nsorted_ri = sorted(vouchers_in_group, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nri_values = [v.ri for v in sorted_ri]\n\nprefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_ri)\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_ri[0].cost\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_ri)-1:\n\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_ri[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for sorted_li:\n\nsorted_li = sorted(vouchers_in_group, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\nli_values = [v.li for v in sorted_li]\n\nsuffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_li)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_li[-1].cost\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_li)-2, -1, -1):\n\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_li[i].cost)\n\nThen, we can store these for each duration. For example, for the duration_dict, perhaps we can have a separate structure, like:\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # process sorted_ri and prefix_min\n\n    sorted_ri = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x.ri)\n\n    ri_values = [v.ri for v in sorted_ri]\n\n    prefix_min = ...\n\n    # same for sorted_li and suffix_min\n\n    preprocessed[d] = (sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min)\n\nBut storing all of these for each duration may take some memory, but given n up to 2e5, it's manageable.\n\nBut in Python, for each duration, we need to process these steps.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut first, how to represent the vouchers. Maybe as tuples (li, ri, cost). So during reading, we can store each voucher as a tuple.\n\nBut during grouping, we can process them as such.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    duration = ri - li + 1\n\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost, duration) )\n\nThen, group by duration:\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor li, ri, cost, duration in vouchers:\n\n    duration_dict[duration].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nWait, but for the vouchers, we need to have their li, ri, cost. So during the grouping, we can store tuples of (li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, process the sorted_ri and sorted_li lists, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n\n    group = duration_dict[d]\n\n    # process sorted_ri and prefix_min\n\n    sorted_ri = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])  # x[1] is ri\n\n    ri_values = [x[1] for x in sorted_ri]\n\n    # compute prefix_min\n\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_ri)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = sorted_ri[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_ri)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min( prefix_min[i-1], sorted_ri[i][2] )\n\n    # process sorted_li and suffix_min\n\n    sorted_li = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])  # x[0] is li\n\n    li_values = [x[0] for x in sorted_li]\n\n    # compute suffix_min\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_li)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = sorted_li[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_li)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min( suffix_min[i+1], sorted_li[i][2] )\n\n    # store in preprocessed\n\n    preprocessed[d] = (sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min)\n\nOnce this is done, then for each voucher in the original vouchers list, process as follows:\n\nInitialize answer to infinity.\n\nfor li_A, ri_A, cost_A, duration_A in vouchers:\n\n    k = x - duration_A\n\n    if k not in preprocessed:\n\n        continue\n\n    # get the preprocessed data for k\n\n    sorted_ri_k, ri_values_k, prefix_min_k, sorted_li_k, li_values_k, suffix_min_k = preprocessed[k]\n\n    # case 1: B's ri < li_A\n\n    # find pos in ri_values_k where ri < li_A\n\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values_k, li_A)\n\n    min_case1 = float('inf')\n\n    if pos > 0:\n\n        min_case1 = prefix_min_k[pos-1]\n\n    # case 2: B's li > ri_A\n\n    pos = bisect.bisect_right(li_values_k, ri_A)\n\n    min_case2 = float('inf')\n\n    if pos < len(li_values_k):\n\n        min_case2 = suffix_min_k[pos]\n\n    current_min = min( min_case1, min_case2 )\n\n    if current_min != float('inf'):\n\n        total = cost_A + current_min\n\n        if total < answer:\n\n            answer = total\n\nif answer is still infinity, output -1 else answer.\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the vouchers are stored as tuples (li, ri, cost, duration). So during the initial loop, for each voucher, we have li_A, ri_A, cost_A, duration_A.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3 (3-1+1=3)\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2 (2-1+1=2)\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2 (6-5+1=2)\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nSo the duration_dict would have keys 3, 2.\n\nFor duration 3: group has one voucher (1,3,4). For duration 2: group has three vouchers.\n\nNow, when processing the first voucher (duration 3), k = 5 - 3 = 2. So check preprocessed[2].\n\nFor case 1: B's ri < 1 (li_A is 1). The ri_values_k is the sorted_ri list of vouchers with duration 2. Let's see:\n\nThe vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: (1,2,5) → ri=2\n\nvoucher 3: (5,6,1) → ri=6\n\nvoucher 4: (1,2,4) → ri=2.\n\nSo sorted_ri for duration 2 is sorted by ri. So the ri's are 2, 2, 6. The sorted_ri list would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]? Or [(1,2,4), (1,2,5), (5,6,1)]? Because when sorted by ri (which is same for first two), then perhaps the order depends on the other fields. But in the code, when sorted by x[1], which is ri, and for same ri, the order is arbitrary. However, the prefix_min would take care of that, since it's the minimum of the costs.\n\nIn any case, the ri_values_k is [2, 2, 6]. For case 1, we are looking for B's ri < 1. The bisect_left of 1 in [2, 2, 6] is 0. So pos is 0. pos>0 is false. So min_case1 is inf.\n\nFor case 2: B's li > ri_A (which is 3). The li_values_k is the sorted_li list of vouchers with duration 2. The vouchers are sorted by li. The li for the vouchers are 1, 1, 5. So sorted_li is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]? Or [(1,2,4), (1,2,5), (5,6,1)]? Again, depends on the sort. But the li_values_k would be [1, 1, 5]. We perform bisect_right for 3. The bisect_right of 3 in [1,1,5] is 2. So pos is 2. len(li_values_k) is 3. pos < 3 → yes. So suffix_min_k[2] is the min of the suffix starting at index 2. Which is the cost of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, `x`, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently finding pairs of vouchers that together sum up to the required duration `x`.\n2. **Preprocessing**: For each group of vouchers with the same duration, we sort them by their end date (ri) and start date (li). We also compute prefix minimum arrays for sorted end dates and suffix minimum arrays for sorted start dates. These arrays help quickly determine the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher in the group of complementary duration (i.e., `x - duration`) that does not overlap. Using binary search, we efficiently find the minimum cost of such vouchers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ri = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost, duration))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost, duration in vouchers:\n        duration_dict[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    preprocessed = {}\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        group = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process sorted_ri and prefix_min\n        sorted_ri = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ri_values = [x[1] for x in sorted_ri]\n        prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_ri)\n        prefix_min[0] = sorted_ri[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_ri)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_ri[i][2])\n        # Process sorted_li and suffix_min\n        sorted_li = sorted(group, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        li_values = [x[0] for x in sorted_li]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_li)\n        suffix_min[-1] = sorted_li[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_li)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_li[i][2])\n        preprocessed[d] = (sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for li_A, ri_A, cost_A, duration_A in vouchers:\n        k = x - duration_A\n        if k not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        sorted_ri_k, ri_values_k, prefix_min_k, sorted_li_k, li_values_k, suffix_min_k = preprocessed[k]\n        \n        # Case 1: B's ri < li_A\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values_k, li_A)\n        min_case1 = float('inf')\n        if pos > 0:\n            min_case1 = prefix_min_k[pos - 1]\n        \n        # Case 2: B's li > ri_A\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(li_values_k, ri_A)\n        min_case2 = float('inf')\n        if pos < len(li_values_k):\n            min_case2 = suffix_min_k[pos]\n        \n        current_min = min(min_case1, min_case2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = cost_A + current_min\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each represented by its start date, end date, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each group of vouchers, we sort them by their end date and start date, and compute prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays to facilitate quick minimum cost queries.\n4. **Finding Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists a valid complementary voucher in the preprocessed groups. Using binary search, we efficiently determine the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers and update the minimum total cost accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the optimal pair of vouchers while adhering to the constraints, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n).",
