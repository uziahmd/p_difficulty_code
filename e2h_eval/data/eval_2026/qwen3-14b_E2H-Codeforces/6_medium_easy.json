Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose total duration equals exactly x, and their combined cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, return -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Let's break down the requirements:\n\nEach voucher has a departure day (li), return day (ri), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers, i and j, such that:\n\n1. Their durations add up to x. So, duration_i + duration_j = x.\n2. They don't overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts (ri < lj) or the second ends before the first starts (rj < li).\n3. Find the minimum sum of their costs.\n\nSo the approach would be to check all possible pairs of vouchers that satisfy these conditions. However, with n up to 2e5, checking all O(n²) pairs is impossible. So we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about how to optimize this.\n\nFirst, for each voucher, we can compute its duration. Let's say duration_i = d. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we need another voucher with duration (x - d). So, for each voucher, we can look for vouchers of duration (x - d) that don't overlap with it.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find those?\n\nLet's think about pre-processing. For each possible duration, we can store the vouchers of that duration, sorted by their end time or start time. Then, for each voucher i with duration d, we can look for vouchers with duration (x - d) that end before li, or start after ri.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal cost for vouchers of duration (x - d) that are non-overlapping with voucher i?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a voucher A with duration d. We need to find vouchers B with duration (x - d) where B ends before A starts (B's ri < A's li) or starts after A ends (B's li > A's ri).\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can check two possibilities:\n\n- Find the minimal cost of vouchers B with duration (x - d) that end before A's li.\n- Find the minimal cost of vouchers B with duration (x - d) that start after A's ri.\n\nThen, take the minimum between these two possibilities and add it to A's cost, and track the overall minimum.\n\nBut how to efficiently find those minimal costs?\n\nThis suggests that for each possible duration, we need to have some data structures that allow us to query:\n\n1. The minimum cost of vouchers with that duration that end before a certain day (say, li).\n2. The minimum cost of vouchers with that duration that start after a certain day (say, ri).\n\nSo here's an idea: For each duration value, we can maintain two sorted lists (or arrays) of vouchers. One sorted by end time (ri), and another sorted by start time (li). Also, for each of these sorted lists, we can precompute prefix minimums or suffix minimums so that queries can be done quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration, we can have:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by their end time (ri). For each such list, we can have a prefix min array. Then, given a target day (like li), we can perform a binary search on this list to find all vouchers ending before li, and then get the minimum cost among them.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers sorted by their start time (li), we can have a suffix min array. Then, for a target day (like ri), we can find all vouchers starting after ri, and get the minimum cost among them.\n\nLet me think through this.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers, compute their durations. For each voucher, store li, ri, cost, duration.\n\n2. For each possible duration d, we need to collect all vouchers of that duration. Let's create a dictionary, say duration_dict, where the keys are durations, and the values are lists of vouchers with that duration.\n\n3. For each duration d in duration_dict, we process the vouchers in that duration. For each voucher in duration d, we can look for vouchers of duration (x - d). But only if (x - d) is a valid duration (i.e., exists in duration_dict).\n\nSo, for each voucher i with duration d, we check if (x - d) is present in the duration_dict. If not, skip. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal cost of vouchers in duration (x - d) that don't overlap with voucher i.\n\nNow, for voucher i (with li, ri, duration d), the other voucher must have duration (x - d). Let's call this target duration t = x - d.\n\nWe need to find vouchers of duration t that either end before li (so their ri < li) or start after ri (so their li > ri).\n\nSo for each voucher i, we need to find the minimum cost among:\n\na) Vouchers of duration t with ri < li.\n\nb) Vouchers of duration t with li > ri.\n\nSo for part a, how do we find the minimal cost of vouchers of duration t with ri < li?\n\nIf we have for duration t, a list of vouchers sorted by ri, and for each such list, we have a prefix min array. Then, for a given li, we can binary search the largest ri in the list that is less than li. Then, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for part b, if we have for duration t, a list of vouchers sorted by li, and for each such list, we have a suffix min array. Then, for a given ri, we can binary search the smallest li in the list that is greater than ri. All vouchers from that index onwards have li > ri, and the suffix min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each duration t, we pre-process two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by ri (end time), with a prefix min array of costs.\n\n- Sorted by li (start time), with a suffix min array of costs.\n\nOnce these are preprocessed, for any voucher i with duration d, we can compute t = x - d, and check if t exists. Then, for the current voucher's li and ri, we can query the two possibilities (a and b) as described.\n\nNow, the steps to implement this:\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. For each duration, sort the vouchers by ri and by li. Then, for each sorted list, compute prefix min and suffix min arrays.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFor each duration t:\n\n- sorted_by_ri: list of vouchers sorted by ri. For each element in this list, we have their ri. Then, the prefix_min array is such that prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 elements.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_li: list of vouchers sorted by li. The suffix_min array is such that suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end of the list.\n\nOnce that's done, for a given voucher i with li, ri, and duration d, and target t = x - d:\n\nCheck if t is in duration_dict. If not, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nFor the vouchers in duration t:\n\nCase 1: Find the minimal cost of vouchers with ri < li (so they end before voucher i starts). To do this, in the sorted_by_ri list of duration t, find the largest ri that is less than li. Then, the prefix_min up to that index is the minimal cost for that part.\n\nCase 2: Find the minimal cost of vouchers with li > ri (so they start after voucher i ends). In the sorted_by_li list of duration t, find the first li that is greater than ri. Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost for that part.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can compute both possibilities (if they exist) and take the minimum between them. Then, add to voucher i's cost, and keep track of the global minimum.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. For each duration t, we need:\n\nsorted_by_ri: list of vouchers sorted by ri, and a prefix min array.\n\nsorted_by_li: list of vouchers sorted by li, and a suffix min array.\n\nHow to build these?\n\nFor example, for sorted_by_ri:\n\nSort the vouchers in duration t by ri. Then, create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[0] = cost of first voucher, prefix_min[1] = min(prefix_min[0], cost of second voucher), etc.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_li: sort vouchers by li, then create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] = min(cost of voucher at i, suffix_min[i+1]).\n\nOnce these are built, for each query, we can perform binary search.\n\nNow, for case 1:\n\nIn the sorted_by_ri list of duration t, find the maximum ri that is less than li. How?\n\nWe can perform a binary search on the ri values. Let's say the list is sorted in increasing order. So we can use bisect_left to find the insertion point of li. The index before that insertion point is the largest ri less than li. But if the insertion point is zero, there are none.\n\nFor example, if the list is [1,3,5], and li is 4, the insertion point is 2 (since 4 would be inserted between 3 and 5). So the largest ri less than li is 3, which is at index 1. So the number of elements that satisfy ri < li is insertion_point. So if insertion_point is zero, there are no such elements.\n\nOnce we have the insertion_point, if it's zero, then no elements. Else, the prefix_min[insertion_point - 1] is the minimal cost among those elements.\n\nFor case 2:\n\nIn the sorted_by_li list of duration t, find the first li that is greater than ri. Since the list is sorted by li, we can use bisect_right to find the first element greater than ri. For example, if the list is [1,3,5], and ri is 3, then bisect_right would give index 2 (since elements before are <= 3). So the elements from index 2 onwards are >3. So the minimal cost is the suffix_min at index 2.\n\nIf the insertion point is equal to the length of the list, then there are no such elements.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can check both cases and accumulate possible candidates.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic in Python.\n\nBut first, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if x is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, no, the problem says x can be as low as 2? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input constraints for x are 2 ≤ x ≤ 2e5. Because the first line says \"n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105)\".\n\nWait, no. The first line says n and x are given with 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. So x can be 2, but the duration of each voucher is ri - li + 1. For example, if x is 2, then possible durations could be 1 and 1 (summing to 2). So that's possible.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case has x=5. The durations are 3 (voucher 1), 2 (voucher 2), 2 (voucher 3?), wait:\n\nWait, first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3-1+1 = 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2 (6-5+1=2)\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nSo x is 5. So for voucher 1 (duration 3), the other voucher needs to have duration 2. And indeed, voucher 3 has duration 2, and they don't overlap.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers, compute their durations.\n\nGroup them into duration_dict, which maps duration to a list of vouchers.\n\nFor each duration in duration_dict, pre-process the sorted_by_ri and sorted_by_li lists, along with their prefix and suffix mins.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list, check if (x - duration_i) exists in duration_dict. If yes, then proceed to check for possible matches.\n\nBut for each voucher, we need to check both cases (case a and case b) as explained.\n\nNow, for each voucher, we can process it once, and for each possible matching duration, check the two cases.\n\nBut what about duplicates? For example, if there are multiple vouchers with the same duration. But since we're considering all possible vouchers, even if they are same duration, the code should handle it.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing the preprocessing for each duration:\n\nFor each duration t in duration_dict:\n\n   list_of_vouchers = duration_dict[t]\n\n   sorted_by_ri = sorted(list_of_vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\n   sorted_by_li = sorted(list_of_vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\n   Then, create prefix_min for sorted_by_ri:\n\n   prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_ri)\n\n   prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_ri[0].cost\n\n   for i in 1 to len-1:\n\n       prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_ri[i].cost)\n\n   Similarly for sorted_by_li:\n\n   suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_li)\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_li[-1].cost\n\n   for i in len-2 downto 0:\n\n       suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_li[i].cost)\n\nBut how to store this? Maybe for each duration, we can have two structures:\n\nFor example, for each duration t, we can have:\n\n- a list sorted_ri (sorted by ri) and its prefix_min array.\n\n- a list sorted_li (sorted by li) and its suffix_min array.\n\nSo, in Python, perhaps we can create a dictionary for each duration, storing these four things.\n\nBut how to represent vouchers? Maybe as tuples (li, ri, cost).\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = list()\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    duration = r - l + 1\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n\nThen, group by duration:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor l, r, cost, duration in vouchers:\n\n    duration_dict[duration].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration t in duration_dict, pre-process sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min.\n\nWe can create another dictionary, say preprocessed, which for each duration t contains:\n\npreprocessed[t] = {\n\n    'sorted_ri': list of (ri, cost) sorted by ri,\n\n    'prefix_min': list of prefix minima,\n\n    'sorted_li': list of (li, cost) sorted by li,\n\n    'suffix_min': list of suffix minima,\n\n}\n\nWait, but for sorted_ri, we need to have the list sorted by ri, and for each element, we have the ri and cost. So perhaps:\n\nfor each duration t in duration_dict:\n\n    list_vouchers = duration_dict[t]\n\n    # sorted by ri\n\n    sorted_by_ri = sorted( list_vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1] )\n\n    # create prefix_min for sorted_by_ri\n\n    prefix_min = []\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for v in sorted_by_ri:\n\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, v[2] )\n\n        prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n\n    # similarly for sorted_by_li:\n\n    sorted_by_li = sorted( list_vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0] )\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_li)\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_li)-1, -1, -1):\n\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, sorted_by_li[i][2] )\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n\n    # store these in preprocessed[t]\n\nBut perhaps in code, for each duration, we can precompute these structures.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list, we can check:\n\ncurrent voucher has l, r, cost, duration d.\n\nt = x - d.\n\nif t is not in duration_dict: continue.\n\nelse:\n\n   process for case a and case b.\n\nNow, for case a: find vouchers in duration t with ri < l.\n\nTo find this, we look into the sorted_by_ri list for duration t.\n\nsorted_ri_list = preprocessed[t]['sorted_ri']\n\nthe ri's are sorted, so we can extract the list of ri's, and perform a binary search for l.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nWe can use the bisect module.\n\nFor example, for the sorted_ri_list, which is sorted by ri, we can extract a list of ri values, say ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_ri_list].\n\nThen, using bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, l) gives us the insertion point. The number of elements less than l is insertion_point.\n\nIf insertion_point > 0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min[insertion_point - 1].\n\nSimilarly for case b: find vouchers in duration t with li > r.\n\nFor that, we look into the sorted_by_li list for duration t. The sorted_by_li is sorted by li. So we can extract the li_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li].\n\nWe want to find the first li that is > r. Using bisect.bisect_right(li_values, r) gives us the insertion point. All elements from that insertion point onwards have li > r. So if the insertion point is less than len(li_values), then the minimal cost is suffix_min[insertion_point].\n\nSo, in code, for case a and case b:\n\nFor case a:\n\nsorted_ri_list = preprocessed[t]['sorted_ri']\n\nri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_ri_list]\n\ninsertion_point = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, l)\n\nif insertion_point > 0:\n\n    min_cost_a = preprocessed[t]['prefix_min'][insertion_point - 1]\n\nelse:\n\n    min_cost_a = infinity\n\nFor case b:\n\nsorted_li_list = preprocessed[t]['sorted_li']\n\nli_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_li_list]\n\ninsertion_point = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, r)\n\nif insertion_point < len(li_values):\n\n    min_cost_b = preprocessed[t]['suffix_min'][insertion_point]\n\nelse:\n\n    min_cost_b = infinity\n\nThen, the total possible cost for this voucher is current cost + min( min_cost_a, min_cost_b )\n\nBut we need to check if either min_cost_a or min_cost_b is valid (not infinity). If both are invalid, then this voucher can't be paired with any voucher of duration t.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we check these two possibilities and update the global minimum.\n\nBut wait, what about when t is the same as d? Like, if x is 2*d. Then, we need to find two vouchers of duration d that don't overlap. However, in this case, when processing voucher i, we would check for vouchers of duration t = x -d = d. But we need to ensure that the other voucher is not the same as voucher i. However, in our approach, since we are considering all vouchers of duration t, including voucher i itself. But in this case, when we check for vouchers that don't overlap with voucher i, if there's another voucher j (same duration) that doesn't overlap, then it's allowed. But if voucher i is considered in both parts (as i and j), then when processing voucher i, we might include voucher i itself. But since the problem requires i != j, we need to make sure that when we look for vouchers of duration t, we are not considering the same voucher.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because, suppose voucher i has duration d, and t = x -d = d. Then, when we check for vouchers of duration t, which includes voucher i. However, when we check for case a and case b, if voucher i is in the list, then during the binary search, it's possible that voucher i is considered. But since the voucher i's own ri is compared with l (which is voucher i's own l?), which may not satisfy the condition. Wait, no. Let's think.\n\nSuppose voucher i is being processed. For case a, we are looking for vouchers of duration t (which is same as d) that end before l_i. But voucher i's own ri is >= l_i (since l_i <= r_i). So voucher i's ri is >= l_i, so it's not included in case a. Similarly, for case b, we are looking for vouchers that start after r_i. Voucher i's own li is l_i, which is <= r_i, so it's not included. Therefore, even if the duration t is same as d, voucher i itself is not considered in the case a or case b. Therefore, when we process voucher i, the other voucher j is different from i. So no problem.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as is.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nFor each voucher in vouchers:\n\n    l, r, cost, duration = voucher\n\n    t = x - duration\n\n    if t not in duration_dict: continue\n\n    # process case a and case b\n\n    # case a: find vouchers of duration t with ri < l\n\n    # get the preprocessed data for duration t\n\n    preprocessed_t = preprocessed[t]\n\n    sorted_ri_list = preprocessed_t['sorted_ri']\n\n    ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_ri_list]\n\n    insertion_point = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, l)\n\n    min_cost_a = infinity\n\n    if insertion_point > 0:\n\n        min_cost_a = preprocessed_t['prefix_min'][insertion_point -1]\n\n    # case b: find vouchers of duration t with li > r\n\n    sorted_li_list = preprocessed_t['sorted_li']\n\n    li_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_li_list]\n\n    insertion_point_b = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, r)\n\n    min_cost_b = infinity\n\n    if insertion_point_b < len(li_values):\n\n        min_cost_b = preprocessed_t['suffix_min'][insertion_point_b]\n\n    # now, current possible min is cost + min( min_cost_a, min_cost_b )\n\n    current_min = min( min_cost_a, min_cost_b )\n\n    if current_min != infinity:\n\n        total = cost + current_min\n\n        answer = min( answer, total )\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if answer is still infinity, output -1, else output answer.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple vouchers of the same duration and the same t? For example, two vouchers with duration d, and x = 2d. Then, each voucher can pair with another voucher (if non-overlapping). But the code will process each voucher once, and during that process, check for the existence of other vouchers.\n\nNow, the code needs to precompute the preprocessed data for each duration. So during preprocessing, for each duration t in duration_dict, we need to generate the sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min.\n\nBut how to store these in Python. For example, for each duration t, we can have a dictionary entry that holds these structures.\n\nSo, in code:\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor duration in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[duration]\n\n    # sort by ri\n\n    sorted_by_ri = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    # compute prefix_min for sorted_by_ri\n\n    prefix_min = []\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for v in sorted_by_ri:\n\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, v[2] )\n\n        prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n\n    # sort by li\n\n    sorted_by_li = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # compute suffix_min for sorted_by_li\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_li)\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_li)-1, -1, -1):\n\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, sorted_by_li[i][2] )\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n\n    # store in preprocessed[duration]\n\n    preprocessed[duration] = {\n\n        'sorted_ri': sorted_by_ri,\n\n        'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n\n        'sorted_li': sorted_by_li,\n\n        'suffix_min': suffix_min,\n\n    }\n\nBut in Python, for each duration, we can generate this structure.\n\nNow, during the processing of each voucher, we can access preprocessed[t], and then get the sorted_ri, etc.\n\nBut for the ri_values and li_values, we need to generate them each time. However, generating them each time may be time-consuming. Alternatively, during preprocessing, we can store the ri_values and li_values as well. But for the sake of time, perhaps during processing, we can generate them on the fly.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, and each voucher being processed once, and for each voucher, during processing, generating ri_values and li_values could take O(k) time, where k is the number of vouchers in duration t. However, if we do this for each voucher, it may lead to O(nk) time, which could be O(n²) in worst case. Which is not acceptable.\n\nSo to avoid that, during preprocessing, for each duration t, we can precompute the ri_values and li_values. For example, in the preprocessed structure, for each duration t, we can have:\n\npreprocessed[duration] = {\n\n    'sorted_ri': sorted_by_ri,\n\n    'prefix_min': ...,\n\n    'ri_values': [v[1] for v in sorted_by_ri],\n\n    'sorted_li': sorted_by_li,\n\n    'suffix_min': ...,\n\n    'li_values': [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li],\n\n}\n\nThis way, during voucher processing, we can quickly get the ri_values and li_values from the preprocessed data.\n\nSo modifying the preprocessing code:\n\nfor duration in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers_list = duration_dict[duration]\n\n    # sort by ri\n\n    sorted_by_ri = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    # compute prefix_min for sorted_by_ri\n\n    prefix_min = []\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for v in sorted_by_ri:\n\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, v[2] )\n\n        prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n\n    ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n\n    # sort by li\n\n    sorted_by_li = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    # compute suffix_min for sorted_by_li\n\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_li)\n\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_by_li)-1, -1, -1):\n\n        min_so_far = min( min_so_far, sorted_by_li[i][2] )\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n\n    li_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li]\n\n    # store in preprocessed[duration]\n\n    preprocessed[duration] = {\n\n        'sorted_ri': sorted_by_ri,\n\n        'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n\n        'ri_values': ri_values,\n\n        'sorted_li': sorted_by_li,\n\n        'suffix_min': suffix_min,\n\n        'li_values': li_values,\n\n    }\n\nThis way, during voucher processing, when we need to get the ri_values, we can directly access preprocessed[t]['ri_values'].\n\nThis would save the time of generating the ri_values and li_values each time.\n\nNow, the code steps are clear.\n\nNow, let's think about possible errors.\n\nEdge case 1: when x is not possible. For example, when all vouchers have duration 3 and x is 2. Then, output is -1.\n\nEdge case 2: when two vouchers have durations adding to x and are non-overlapping. But during the processing, the code finds them.\n\nAnother possible error is when t is zero. But since x is at least 2, and durations are at least 1 (since li <= ri, so duration is at least 1). So x -d can be zero only if d = x. But since x is at least 2, and d is at least 1. So if x is 2, and d is 2, then t is zero. But duration t is zero, which is not present in the duration_dict. So the code skips it. Thus, no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: when a voucher's duration is exactly x. Then, t = x -d = 0. So no vouchers of duration zero. So nothing is done.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo duration_dict:\n\n3: [(1,3,4)]\n\n2: [(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4)]\n\npreprocessing for duration 2:\n\nsorted_by_ri: sorted by ri. The vouchers are:\n\n(1,2,5) → ri=2\n\n(1,2,4) → ri=2\n\n(5,6,1) → ri=6\n\nsorted_by_ri would be sorted by ri. So the order is the first two (ri=2), then the third (ri=6). But since the first two have same ri, their order depends on the sort. But since we are taking min cost, the order doesn't matter as long as the prefix_min is correctly computed.\n\nThe prefix_min for sorted_by_ri would be:\n\nfor the first voucher (cost 5): min is 5.\n\nsecond voucher (cost 4): min(5,4) =4.\n\nthird voucher (cost 1): min(4, 1) =1.\n\nSo prefix_min is [5,4,1].\n\nri_values for duration 2 is [2,2,6].\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_li for duration 2 is sorted by li:\n\n(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1). The li's are 1, 1, 5.\n\nsuffix_min for this list:\n\nstarting from the end:\n\nlast element is cost 1 → suffix_min[2] =1.\n\nprevious element (index 1, cost 4): min(4, 1) → 1.\n\nprevious element (index 0, cost 5): min(5, 1) → 1.\n\nso suffix_min is [1, 1, 1].\n\nNow, when processing voucher 1 (duration 3, l=1, r=3, cost=4). t =5-3=2. So check duration 2.\n\nFor case a: find vouchers with ri < l (which is 1). The ri_values are [2,2,6]. bisect_left for 1 is 0. So insertion_point is 0, which is not >0. So min_cost_a is infinity.\n\nFor case b: find vouchers with li > r (which is 3). The li_values are [1,1,5]. bisect_right for 3 is 2 (since 3 is inserted after the 1s and before 5). insertion_point is 2. len(li_values) is 3. So 2 <3 → yes. suffix_min[2] is 1. So min_cost_b is 1. So total cost is 4 +1 =5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother example: voucher 3 (5,6,1, duration 2). t=5-2=3. Check if duration 3 exists (yes). For case a: find vouchers of duration 3 with ri <5. The sorted_ri for duration 3 is [(1,3,4)]. ri_values is [3]. bisect_left(5) returns 1. insertion_point is 1>0 → prefix_min[0] is 4. So min_cost_a is 4. case b: find vouchers with li>6. The sorted_li for duration 3 is [(1,3,4)], li_values [1]. bisect_right(6) returns 1, which is equal to len(1). So no. So min_cost_b is inf. So total is 1 +4=5. Which is same as before. So the code would find this pair as well.\n\nSo the code would capture both possibilities.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut for the preprocessing, how to handle the preprocessed dictionary. Also, note that for each voucher, during the processing, we need to check if t exists in the duration_dict.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        duration = r - l +1\n        vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n    \n    # Build duration_dict\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost, duration in vouchers:\n        duration_dict[duration].append( (l, r, cost) )\n    \n    # Preprocess for each duration\n    preprocessed = dict()\n    for duration in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[duration]\n        # Sort by ri\n        sorted_by_ri = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        # Compute prefix min\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_by_ri:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n        # Sort by li\n        sorted_by_li = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        # Compute suffix min\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_li)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_li)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_li[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        li_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li]\n        # Store in preprocessed\n        preprocessed[duration] = {\n            'sorted_ri': sorted_by_ri,\n            'prefix_min': prefix_min,\n            'ri_values': ri_values,\n            'sorted_li': sorted_by_li,\n            'suffix_min': suffix_min,\n            'li_values': li_values,\n        }\n    \n    # Now, process each voucher\n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for l, r, cost, duration in vouchers:\n        t = x - duration\n        if t not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        # Case a: find vouchers of duration t with ri < l\n        # Get preprocessed data\n        data = preprocessed[t]\n        # Case a\n        ri_values = data['ri_values']\n        prefix_min = data['prefix_min']\n        insertion_point = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, l)\n        min_cost_a = float('inf')\n        if insertion_point > 0:\n            min_cost_a = prefix_min[insertion_point -1]\n        # Case b: find vouchers of duration t with li > r\n        li_values = data['li_values']\n        suffix_min = data['suffix_min']\n        insertion_point_b = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, r)\n        min_cost_b = float('inf')\n        if insertion_point_b < len(li_values):\n            min_cost_b = suffix_min[insertion_point_b]\n        # current_min is min of a and b\n        current_min = min(min_cost_a, min_cost_b)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = cost + current_min\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nBut wait, the code uses preprocessed instead of duration_dict. Because duration_dict contains the list of vouchers for each duration, but preprocessed contains the processed data. So for checking if t exists, we need to check if t is in preprocessed. However, for t to be in preprocessed, it must be in duration_dict. Because during preprocessing, we loop through all durations in duration_dict. So yes, preprocessed contains exactly the same keys as duration_dict. So checking t in preprocessed is equivalent to checking if there are any vouchers of duration t.\n\nBut during preprocessing, the code loops through all durations in duration_dict, and creates entries in preprocessed for each. So that's correct.\n\nTesting this code against the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 →",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized.
