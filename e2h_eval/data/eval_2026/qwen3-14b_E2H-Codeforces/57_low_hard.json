His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on the given points from two tours. The key here is that the teacher knows Vasya's total points are at least x, but we need to consider all possible ways of pairing the first and second tour scores to determine the best and worst possible positions.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but since the a and b arrays are given in arbitrary order, we need to pair them in such a way that when considering Vasya's possible a_i + b_j (which is at least x), we find the best and worst possible ranks.\n\nWait, but how do we model Vasya's possible scores? Because the actual pairing of a's and b's determines the total for each participant. But Vasya's total is at least x. However, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But for the purposes of calculating the best and worst possible ranks, we need to consider all possible pairings of a and b (since the actual assignment of which a_i pairs with which b_j is unknown), and find for each possible scenario where Vasya's total is at least x, what's his best and worst possible rank.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let me think.\n\nThe best possible rank for Vasya would be when his total is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. Conversely, the worst possible rank would be when his total is as low as possible (but still at least x), and others are as high as possible.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nLet me think about the best possible rank. To get the best possible rank, we want Vasya's total to be as high as possible. So, we can choose the maximum possible a_i + b_j that is >=x. Then, arrange the other participants' totals to be as low as possible so that Vasya's rank is as high as possible.\n\nWait, but for the best possible rank, we need to assume that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are arranged in a way that as many as possible have lower totals than him. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya has the maximum possible total (so that he can be first). For example, if there's a pair that gives him a very high total, then others can't have higher than that. But how do we find that?\n\nBut perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor the best possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible value of (a_i + b_j) that is >=x. Then, count how many participants can have a total greater than or equal to this value. Wait, no. Because the best possible rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. But since the problem allows the jury to assign ranks when there are ties, the best possible rank is 1 if there's a way to have Vasya's total be the highest possible.\n\nWait, maybe the way to find the best possible rank is to maximize Vasya's total. Once we have that, the best possible rank is 1 if there's no one else with a higher total. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is determined by the number of participants that can have a total strictly greater than Vasya's total. If we can arrange that no one else has a higher total than Vasya, then his best possible rank is 1. So, to find the best possible rank, we need to choose Vasya's total as high as possible, and arrange other participants' totals as low as possible.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of choosing a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, for that choice, we need to calculate the minimal possible rank (best) and maximal possible rank (worst).\n\nBut the problem is that the other participants' totals are determined by the pairing of the remaining a's and b's. However, the pairing can be done in any way, so for the best case, we can pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that minimizes the number of people with total higher than Vasya's. Similarly, for the worst case, we pair them to maximize the number of people with total higher than or equal to Vasya's.\n\nBut how can we compute that?\n\nLet me think again. For the best possible rank, we need to choose Vasya's a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Then, for the other participants, we need to pair the remaining a's and",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves efficiently calculating these ranks by considering all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank for Vasya, we need to maximize his total score. This is achieved by selecting the highest possible sum of scores from the first and second tours that is at least `x`. Once we have this maximum score, we count how many participants can have a higher score than Vasya under optimal pairing conditions.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: For the worst possible rank, we consider the minimum possible score Vasya can have (which is exactly `x`) and then count how many participants can have a higher or equal score under the worst pairing conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    # Best place: maximize Vasya's total\n    # Find the maximum possible a_i + b_j >= x\n    max_vasya = -1\n    for ai in a:\n        # Find the largest bj such that ai + bj >= x\n        # since b is sorted, we can use binary search\n        target = x - ai\n        j = bisect.bisect_left(b, target)\n        if j < n:\n            current = ai + b[j]\n            if current > max_vasya:\n                max_vasya = current\n        # Also check if there's a larger bj that could be paired with ai\n        # but since we want the maximum, it's sufficient to take the largest possible\n        # because the largest bj is at the end\n        # So also check the last element\n        if ai + b[-1] >= x and ai + b[-1] > max_vasya:\n            max_vasya = ai + b[-1]\n    \n    # Now, calculate how many people can have a total > max_vasya\n    # To minimize the number of people with higher total than Vasya,\n    # we need to pair a and b in a way that as few as possible have higher than max_vasya\n    # But how? We can think of it as for each a_i, find the maximum b_j that can be paired with it\n    # such that a_i + b_j <= max_vasya. Wait, no. Because we want others to have as low as possible.\n    # Actually, for the best case, we want to minimize the number of people with total > max_vasya\n    # So for the best case, we can pair a and b in a way that maximizes the number of people with total <= max_vasya\n    # But how to compute the number of people that can have total > max_vasya?\n    # Actually, the best possible rank is 1 if there is at least one way to pair a and b such that Vasya's total is the maximum.\n    # But how to compute the minimal number of people who can have a higher total than Vasya's max_vasya?\n\n    # For the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya has the maximum possible value.\n    # Then, for others, the maximum number of people with total greater than max_vasya is zero.\n    # So the best possible rank is 1.\n    # Wait, but this is not correct. Because even if Vasya's total is the maximum, others may have the same total.\n    # In that case, the jury can assign him the first place.\n    # So the best possible rank is always 1, because we can arrange the pairings such that no one else has higher than Vasya.\n    # But this is only possible if there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum.\n\n    # However, the problem says that there is at least one i,j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So when we choose max_vasya, which is the maximum possible a_i + b_j >=x, then there exists a pairing where Vasya has that max_vasya, and others can be arranged to have less or equal.\n    # Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\n    # Wait, but the example shows that in the first case, the best is 1. So perhaps the best possible rank is always 1. But that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\n    # Suppose Vasya's total is S. If there are other participants whose maximum possible total is also S, then Vasya can be ranked 1. But if someone else can have a higher total than S, then Vasya's rank would be worse.\n\n    # So the best possible rank is determined by the number of participants that can have a higher total than Vasya's chosen total. But how do we compute that?\n\n    # Let me think again. For the best possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible value of Vasya's total (say, S). Then, the minimal number of participants that can have a total higher than S. The best rank is that number + 1.\n\n    # But how to compute the minimal number of participants that can have a total higher than S?\n\n    # For that, we need to pair the remaining a and b in a way that as few as possible have a total higher than S.\n\n    # To minimize the number of people with total > S, we can pair a_i with the smallest possible b_j such that a_i + b_j > S. Or wait, no. Wait, we want as few as possible people to have total > S. So we need to pair a and b such that the number of pairs with sum > S is minimized.\n\n    # How to compute that?\n\n    # Let's think of it this way: for each a_i, we can pair it with the largest possible b_j such that a_i + b_j <= S. This would minimize the number of pairs exceeding S.\n\n    # So here's the approach:\n\n    # After determining S (the maximum possible total for Vasya), we need to find the minimal number of participants that can have a total > S. This can be done by greedily pairing a_i with the largest possible b_j that is <= (S - a_i). For each a_i, we find the largest b_j that can be paired with it without exceeding S. This way, we minimize the number of pairs that exceed S.\n\n    # So the number of such pairs that exceed S is n minus the number of pairs that can be made with sum <= S.\n\n    # But how to compute this?\n\n    # Here's the algorithm:\n\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order.\n    # For each a_i, find the maximum b_j such that a_i + b_j <= S. We can use binary search for this.\n    # Then, the number of pairs that can be made with sum <= S is the number of such matches. The rest will have sum > S.\n\n    # However, this is the maximum number of pairs that can be made with sum <= S, which implies that the minimal number of pairs with sum > S is n - count.\n\n    # So, for the best possible rank, the number of people with sum > S is n - count, and the best rank is (n - count) + 1.\n\n    # Wait, no. Because if there are k people with sum > S, then Vasya's rank is k + 1. Because those k people are above him, and he is next.\n\n    # So the steps are:\n\n    # For best rank:\n    # 1. Find the maximum possible S (Vasya's total) >=x.\n    # 2. Compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum <= S. Let's call it cnt.\n    # 3. Then, the number of people with sum > S is n - cnt. So the best rank is (n - cnt) + 1.\n\n    # But how to compute cnt?\n\n    # Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n    # Similarly, for the worst possible rank:\n    # We need to find the minimal possible S (exactly x) and compute the maximum number of people that can have sum >= S. The worst rank is that number + 1 (but depends on whether others can be tied).\n\n    # For the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible S (exactly x) and then compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S. The worst rank is that number.\n\n    # Let's implement this step by step.\n\n    # First, best rank:\n    # Find the maximum possible S >=x.\n    # Then, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum <= S. The number of people with sum > S is n - cnt. The best rank is (n - cnt) + 1.\n\n    # But how to find S?\n\n    # As before, iterate over a and for each a_i, find the largest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x, then take the maximum of all such a_i + b_j.\n\n    # Now, for the best rank:\n\n    # Once S is determined, we can compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum <= S.\n\n    # To compute this, we can use a two-pointer approach.\n\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order.\n\n    # Initialize i = 0, j = n-1, count = 0.\n\n    # While i < n and j >=0:\n    #   if a[i] + b[j] <= S:\n    #       count +=1\n    #       i +=1\n    #   else:\n    #       j -=1\n\n    # This gives the maximum number of pairs with sum <= S.\n\n    # So, for the best rank, after finding S, we use this two-pointer approach.\n\n    # Now, for the worst rank:\n\n    # We need to choose Vasya's total to be exactly x (since we want the worst possible rank, we need his total to be as low as possible, but still >=x). So we set S = x.\n\n    # Then, we need to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= x. This is the worst possible rank, as Vasya could be placed after all of them.\n\n    # To compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= x, we can use a similar two-pointer approach, but now we want to maximize the number of pairs with sum >= x.\n\n    # For this, we sort a in ascending order and b in descending order.\n\n    # Initialize i = 0, j = 0, count = 0.\n\n    # While i < n and j < n:\n    #   if a[i] + b[j] >= x:\n    #       count +=1\n    #       i +=1\n    #       j +=1\n    #   else:\n    #       i +=1\n\n    # This gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x.\n\n    # The worst rank is count + 1 (if there are count people with sum >=x, then Vasya can be placed after them, hence rank count+1).\n\n    # However, in the case where there are multiple people with sum equal to x, the jury can assign Vasya the worst possible position among them.\n\n    # So putting it all together:\n\n    # Best rank:\n    # Find S as the maximum possible a_i + b_j >=x.\n    # Then, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum <= S using two pointers.

Using a two-pointer technique, we calculate the maximum number of participants who can have scores less than or equal to `S`, which helps determine the best possible rank.\n4. **Worst Rank Calculation**: The minimum possible score `x` for Vasya is used. Another two-pointer technique is applied to determine the maximum number of participants who can have scores greater than or equal to `x`, which helps determine the worst possible rank.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute both the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya using sorting and two-pointer techniques, resulting in an optimal solution.",

The best rank is that number + 1.\n\n    # But how to compute the minimal number of participants that can have a total higher than S?\n\n    # For that, we need to pair the remaining a and b in a way that as few as possible have a total higher than S.\n\n    # To minimize the number of people with total > S, we can pair a_i with the smallest possible b_j such that a_i + b_j > S. Or wait, no. Wait, we want as few as possible people to have total > S. So we need to pair a and b such that the number of pairs with sum > S is minimized.\n\n    # How to compute that?\n\n    # Let's think of it this way: for each a_i, we can pair it with the largest possible b_j such that a_i + b_j <= S. This would minimize the number of pairs exceeding S.\n\n    # So here's the approach:\n\n    # After determining S (the maximum possible total for Vasya), we need to find the minimal number of participants that can have a total > S. This can be done by greedily pairing a_i with the largest possible b_j that is <= (S - a_i). For each a_i, we find the largest b_j that can be paired with it without exceeding S. This way, we minimize the number of pairs that exceed S.\n\n    # So the number of such pairs that exceed S is n minus the number of pairs that can be made with sum <= S.\n\n    # But how to compute this?\n\n    # Here's the algorithm:\n\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order.\n    # For each a_i, find the maximum b_j such that a_i + b_j <= S. We can use binary search for this.\n    # Then, the number of pairs that can be made with sum <= S is the number of such matches. The rest will have sum > S.\n\n    # However, this is the maximum number of pairs that can be made with sum <= S, which implies that the minimal number of pairs with sum > S is n - count.\n\n    # So, for the best possible rank, the number of people with sum > S is n - count, and the best rank is (n - count) + 1.\n\n    # Wait, no. Because if there are k people with sum > S, then Vasya's rank is k + 1. Because those k people are above him, and he is next.\n\n    # So the steps are:\n\n    # For best rank:\n    # 1. Find the maximum possible S (Vasya's total) >=x.\n    # 2. Compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum <= S. Let's call it cnt.\n    # 3. Then, the number of people with sum > S is n - cnt. So the best rank is (n - cnt) + 1.\n\n    # But how to compute cnt?\n\n    # Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n    # Similarly, for the worst possible rank:\n    # We need to find the minimal possible S (exactly x) and compute the maximum number of people that can have sum >= S. The worst rank is that number + 1 (but depends on whether others can be tied).\n\n    # For the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible S (exactly x) and then compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S. The worst rank is that number.\n\n    # Let's implement this step by step.\n\n    # First, best rank:\n    # Find the maximum possible S >=x.\n    # Then, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum <= S. The number of people with sum > S is n - cnt. The best rank is (n - cnt) + 1.\n\n    # But how to find S?\n\n    # As before, iterate over a and for each a_i, find the largest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x, then take the maximum of all such a_i + b_j.\n\n    # Now, for the best rank:\n\n    # Once S is determined, we can compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum <= S.\n\n    # To compute this, we can use a two-pointer approach.\n\n    # Sort a and b in ascending order.\n\n    # Initialize i = 0, j = n-1, count = 0.\n\n    # While i < n and j >=0:\n    #   if a[i] + b[j] <= S:\n    #       count +=1\n    #       i +=1\n    #   else:\n    #       j -=1\n\n    # This gives the maximum number of pairs with sum <= S.\n\n    # So, for the best rank, after finding S, we use this two-pointer approach.\n\n    # Now, for the worst rank:\n\n    # We need to choose Vasya's total to be exactly x (since we want the worst possible rank, we need his total to be as low as possible, but still >=x). So we set S = x.\n\n    # Then, we need to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= x. This is the worst possible rank, as Vasya could be placed after all of them.\n\n    # To compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= x, we can use a similar two-pointer approach, but now we want to maximize the number of pairs with sum >= x.\n\n    # For this, we sort a in ascending order and b in descending order.\n\n    # Initialize i = 0, j = 0, count = 0.\n\n    # While i < n and j < n:\n    #   if a[i] + b[j] >= x:\n    #       count +=1\n    #       i +=1\n    #       j +=1\n    #   else:\n    #       i +=1\n\n    # This gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x.\n\n    # The worst rank is count + 1 (if there are count people with sum >=x, then Vasya can be placed after them, hence rank count+1).\n\n    # However, in the case where there are multiple people with sum equal to x, the jury can assign Vasya the worst possible position among them.\n\n    # So putting it all together:\n\n    # Best rank:\n    # Find S as the maximum possible a_i + b_j >=x.\n    # Then, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum <= S using two pointers. The best rank is (n - count) + 1.\n\n    # Worst rank:\n    # Set S = x.\n    # Compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x using two pointers.
