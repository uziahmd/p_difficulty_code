    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, for a given k, we can compute x = a +k and y = b +k. But since adding k to both a and b, the difference between them remains the same. Let me see: if a and b are given, then (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So the difference between the two numbers is fixed. Let me denote d = |a - b|. So, without loss of generality, let's assume that a ≤ b. Then, the two numbers after adding k will be (a +k) and (b +k), which is (a +k) and (a +k + d). So their difference is d.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding k such that the LCM of (x) and (x + d) is minimized, where x = a +k. And since k is non-negative, x must be at least a (if a is smaller than b) or at least b (if b is smaller than a). Wait, no. Because if a is larger than b, then we can swap them. So maybe first, I should sort a and b so that a ≤ b. Then, d = b - a. Then, the two numbers are x and x + d, where x is a +k. Since k ≥ 0, x ≥ a. So the problem becomes finding x ≥ a such that LCM(x, x +d) is as small as possible. Then, once x is found, k is x - a. But since we want the smallest k, if there are multiple x's that give the same minimal LCM, we pick the smallest x (since k = x - a, which would be smallest when x is smallest).\n\nWait, but what if a is larger than b? Let me think. Let me just make sure that I set a and b such that a ≤ b. So first, I can swap them if necessary. Let me proceed under the assumption that a ≤ b. Then, d = b - a. So, the problem is to find x ≥ a such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized.\n\nNow, the LCM of x and x +d is (x*(x +d))/gcd(x, x +d). But since x and x +d differ by d, their GCD is the same as GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). So, GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Let me confirm that. Yes, because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, (x +d) -x) = GCD(x, d). So, the LCM is (x*(x +d))/g, where g = GCD(x, d).\n\nBut since d is fixed (as b - a), perhaps we can find x such that this value is minimized. Let's think about how to minimize this expression.\n\nLet me note that x +d = x + (b -a) = (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k. Which makes sense.\n\nSo, the LCM is x*(x +d)/g, where g is GCD(x, d). Let me think of d as fixed. So, how can I find x ≥ a such that this is minimized?\n\nHmm. Let me think of x and x +d. Since d is fixed, perhaps the optimal x is such that x divides d, or something like that. Because if x divides d, then GCD(x, d) is x, and then LCM(x, x +d) is x*(x +d)/x = x +d. But that's only if x divides d. Alternatively, perhaps if x is a divisor of d, then the LCM would be x +d. But how does that compare with other possibilities?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal LCM occurs when x is as small as possible, but that's not necessarily true. For example, in the sample input 6 and 10. Here, a=6, b=10. So d =4. So x is a +k =6 +k. Then, the numbers are x and x +4. Let's see the sample input's solution: k=2, x=8. Then, numbers are 8 and 12. Their GCD is 4, so LCM is 8*12/4=24. Now, if x was 6 (k=0), then numbers are 6 and 10. GCD(6,10)=2. LCM is 6*10/2=30. Which is larger than 24. If x is 7, numbers 7 and 11. GCD 1. LCM 77. Worse. x=8 gives 24, which is better. So the minimal occurs when x is such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. Because the LCM is (x*(x+d))/g. So, for fixed d, if g is larger, the LCM is smaller. So, to minimize the LCM, we want to maximize the GCD of x and d.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding x ≥ a such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. Because for a given x, the LCM is (x(x +d))/g, and since x +d = x +d, but for fixed d, if x is such that g is large, then the LCM would be smaller.\n\nWait, but even if x is larger, maybe the LCM is smaller. For example, if d is 4, and x is 4. Then, the LCM is (4 * 8)/4 = 8. Which is better than x=8's 24. But why isn't that considered in the sample input? Because in the sample input, a is 6. So x must be >=6. So x can be 4? No, because x is a +k. a is 6, so x must be >=6. So in this case, x=4 is not allowed. So, the minimal x is 6. So in that case, the best x is 8, but if x could be 4, then that would be better.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find x ≥ a such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. Then, for that x, compute the LCM, and find the minimal one. But how to find such x?\n\nLet me think. Let me denote d as the difference between b and a. So, first, I need to compute d = |a -b|, and then swap a and b if necessary so that a ≤ b. So, let me proceed with that.\n\nOnce d is known, the problem is to find x ≥ a such that the LCM of x and x +d is minimized. Which depends on the GCD of x and d.\n\nLet me think of possible candidates for x. Since x and d's GCD is maximized when x is a multiple of some divisor of d. So, perhaps the optimal x is the smallest number ≥ a that is a multiple of some divisor of d. But which divisor?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible value of GCD(x, d) is equal to the maximum divisor of d that is less than or equal to x. Wait, but x can be anything ≥a. So, for example, if we can find a divisor g of d such that there exists x ≥a with GCD(x, d) = g. Then, the maximum possible g is the maximum divisor of d that can be achieved with x ≥a.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the maximum possible g that divides d, and for which there exists x ≥a such that GCD(x, d) = g. Once we find that maximum g, then the minimal LCM would be achieved when x is chosen such that x is a multiple of g, and x is as small as possible.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose that g is a divisor of d. Let me write d = g * m. Then, for x to have GCD(x, d) = g, x must be a multiple of g, but not a multiple of any larger divisor of d. But perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, since GCD(x, d) = g, then x must be a multiple of g. So, x = g * k, where k is an integer. Also, since d = g * m, then GCD(k, m) must be 1. Because GCD(g*k, g*m) = g * GCD(k, m). So, to have GCD(x, d) = g, we need that GCD(k, m) = 1, where m = d/g.\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too deep into the math.\n\nThe key point is that for x to maximize GCD(x, d), we need x to be as large as possible. But since x is ≥a, perhaps the maximum possible GCD is the maximum divisor of d that is ≤ (some value). Or perhaps it's the maximum divisor of d that can be achieved with x ≥a.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is the maximum divisor of d that is ≤ (x). But since x can be as large as possible, but the maximum possible GCD is d itself. However, if x is a multiple of d, then GCD(x, d) = d. So, for example, if there exists x ≥a such that x is a multiple of d, then the maximum possible GCD is d. But how?\n\nSo, for example, if d is 4, and a is 6. Then, the minimal x ≥6 that is a multiple of 4 is 8. So, x=8, which gives GCD(8,4)=4. Which is the maximum possible. Then, the LCM would be (8 * (8+4))/4 = (8*12)/4 = 24, which is the sample input's case.\n\nBut what if a is 4? Then x can be 4, which is a multiple of d=4. Then, LCM is 4 * 8 /4 = 8, which is better.\n\nSo, the approach would be: find the maximum possible g that divides d, such that there exists x ≥a where x is a multiple of g. Then, for each such g, find the minimal x (which would be the smallest multiple of g that is ≥a). Then, compute the LCM for that x and x +d, and choose the one with the minimal LCM.\n\nBut how do I find all possible divisors of d, and check which ones can be used to find x ≥a?\n\nBut considering that d can be up to 1e9, but the number of divisors of d is manageable. For example, even for 1e9, the maximum number of divisors is around 100 (for numbers with many factors). So, generating all divisors of d is feasible.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If a == b, then d is zero. Wait, but if a and b are equal, then adding any k will make a +k = b +k. So their LCM is a +k. To minimize that, we need to take k=0, since that gives the minimal possible value. So in this case, the answer is 0. So that's an edge case.\n\nSo, first, check if a == b. If so, return 0.\n\nElse, assume a < b. Let me set a and b such that a is the smaller, and b is the larger. Then, d = b -a.\n\nThen, generate all the divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d, we can try to find the minimal x ≥a such that x is a multiple of g. Then, compute the LCM of x and x +d. Then, among all these possibilities, select the one with the minimal LCM, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest x (so the smallest k).\n\nBut wait, why do we need to consider all divisors of d? Because for each divisor g of d, the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is g. So, for each possible divisor of d, we can find the minimal x (the minimal x ≥a that is a multiple of g), and then compute the LCM for that x. Then, among all those possibilities, we can choose the one with the minimal LCM.\n\nBut why? Because the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is the largest possible divisor of d. So, for example, if we have a divisor g of d, and we find x that is a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) is at least g. But maybe higher. Wait, no. Because if x is a multiple of g, and g is a divisor of d, then GCD(x, d) is at least g. But it could be higher. For example, if d is 4 and x is 8, then GCD(8,4) is 4, which is the same as g=4. But if d is 8, and x is 4, then GCD(4, 8) is 4, which is a divisor of 8. But if x is 8, then GCD is 8. So, perhaps considering all divisors of d is sufficient, but for each divisor, the minimal x that is a multiple of that divisor, and then compute the LCM.\n\nBut how do we ensure that we get the maximum possible GCD(x, d)?\n\nWell, perhaps the optimal x is the one that has the maximum possible GCD(x, d), which is a divisor of d. So, for example, if we can find the maximum possible divisor g of d, such that there exists x ≥a which is a multiple of g, then that would give the maximum possible GCD(x, d), leading to the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\n- Sort them in descending order.\n\n- For each divisor g in that order, check if there exists x ≥a which is a multiple of g. The minimal such x is ceil(a / g) * g. But wait, if a is already a multiple of g, then x is a. Otherwise, x is the next multiple.\n\n- Once x is determined for each g, compute the LCM of x and x +d. Then, among all these possibilities, select the one with the smallest LCM, and in case of tie, the smallest x (so smallest k).\n\nBut why do we need to check all divisors? Because for example, suppose that for a certain divisor g, the minimal x is such that GCD(x, d) is larger than g. But that can't happen. Because x is a multiple of g. So, GCD(x, d) is at least g. However, since d is a multiple of g, and x is a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) = g * GCD(x/g, d/g). So, for example, if x is a multiple of g and also of a larger divisor of d, then the GCD could be higher. However, since we are checking all divisors of d, including those larger than g, perhaps the first step is to find the maximum possible g.\n\nWait, but if I process the divisors in descending order, then for the first divisor g (the largest) for which there exists x ≥a, then that x would have GCD(x, d) ≥g. But perhaps the actual GCD is higher. But since we are processing the divisors in descending order, perhaps the first such x that we find (for the largest possible divisor) would be the best candidate. However, there may be other divisors that are smaller than this, but for which the x is such that the LCM is smaller.\n\nWait, but the LCM is (x*(x +d))/g', where g' is GCD(x, d). So, if g' is larger, then the LCM is smaller. Therefore, the best possible scenario is when g' is as large as possible. Hence, we need to find the maximum possible g' (which is a divisor of d) for which there exists x ≥a, and then compute the LCM for that x. But how?\n\nBut the problem is that the maximum possible g' is not necessarily a divisor of d. Wait, no. Because g' is the GCD(x, d), which must divide d. So, the maximum possible g' is the maximum divisor of d for which there exists x ≥a that is a multiple of g'.\n\nTherefore, the approach of generating all divisors of d, and for each, checking if there's x ≥a which is a multiple of that divisor, then taking the maximum such divisor, and using that x, would give us the optimal x.\n\nBut how to find that maximum divisor?\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\n- Sort them in descending order.\n\n- For each divisor g in this order:\n\n   - compute the minimal x ≥a that is a multiple of g. Let's call this x_candidate.\n\n   - if x_candidate exists (which it will, since g is a divisor of d and x_candidate can be as big as needed), then compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d.\n\n   - since we're processing the divisors in descending order, the first such x_candidate that gives a valid x (i.e., x_candidate ≥a) will be the one with the largest possible g, hence the best possible LCM.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there are multiple divisors. For example, suppose d is 12, and a is 5. Divisors of 12 are [12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Let's process them in descending order.\n\nFor g=12: minimal x is 12 (since 5 is less than 12). So x_candidate is 12. Then, the LCM of 12 and 12 + 12 = 24. LCM is (12 * 24)/12 = 24.\n\nFor g=6: minimal x is 6 (since 5 is less than 6). x_candidate=6. Then, LCM of 6 and 18 is (6*18)/6=18. Which is better than 24.\n\nSo, even though g=6 is smaller than 12, the LCM is better. Therefore, the approach of checking all divisors and comparing their LCMs is needed, not just the first one.\n\nAh, right! Because even though g is smaller, the x_candidate may be smaller, leading to a lower LCM. So, the initial idea of processing in descending order and taking the first one is incorrect. Instead, for all divisors of d, we need to compute the corresponding x_candidate, compute the LCM, and select the one with the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\n   compute x_candidate = the minimal x ≥a such that x is a multiple of g.\n\n   compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d.\n\n   keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k (which is x_candidate -a).\n\nAdditionally, we also need to consider the case where x_candidate is not a multiple of any divisor of d. Wait, no. Because all divisors of d are considered, and x_candidate is a multiple of g, which is a divisor of d. So, for each x_candidate, the GCD(x_candidate, d) is at least g. But it could be higher. However, since we are considering all divisors of d, perhaps the optimal candidate is covered.\n\nBut perhaps there's another possibility. For example, x_candidate is not a multiple of any divisor of d, but that's impossible because d's divisors include 1, and x_candidate is a multiple of 1. So, all x_candidates are considered.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where the optimal x is not a multiple of any of the divisors of d. But that's impossible, because x_candidate is a multiple of some divisor of d (like 1). So, the approach of generating all divisors of d and checking their x_candidates is correct.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute d = |a -b|.\n\nIf d ==0, return 0.\n\nElse, generate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d:\n\n   compute x_candidate = ((a + g -1) // g) * g. That's the minimal multiple of g that is ≥a.\n\n   compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d.\n\n   compare this LCM with the current minimum, and track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k (x_candidate -a).\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, select the k that gives the minimal LCM. If there are multiple k's with the same LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, why do we need to generate all divisors of d? Because for example, if d is 4, and a is 6. The divisors are 1, 2, 4. For each of these:\n\ng=4: x_candidate is 8 → LCM(8, 12) is 24.\n\ng=2: x_candidate is 6 → LCM(6, 10) is 30.\n\ng=1: x_candidate is 6 → LCM(6, 10) is 30.\n\nSo the minimal is 24, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 5 and 10. So a=5, b=10, d=5. Divisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nFor g=5: x_candidate is 5 (since a is 5). Then x_candidate +d is 10. LCM(5,10) is 10. Which is the minimal possible. So k=0, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: input 21 and 31. a=21, b=31. d=10. Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=10: x_candidate is 21 + (10 - (21%10))? Wait, 21 divided by 10 is 2.1, so the ceiling is 3. So x_candidate is 3 * 10 = 30. Then, x_candidate is 30. Then x_candidate +d = 40. LCM(30,40) is 120.\n\ng=5: minimal x_candidate ≥21 that is multiple of 5. 21/5 is 4.2 → 5*5=25. x_candidate=25. x_candidate +d=35. LCM(25,35) is 175.\n\ng=2: minimal multiple of 2 ≥21 is 22. x_candidate=22. x_candidate +d=32. LCM(22,32) is (22*32)/2 = 352.\n\ng=1: x_candidate=21. LCM(21,31) is 651. So the minimal is 120. But the sample output is 9. Wait, this suggests that my approach is wrong. Because according to the sample input, when a=21 and b=31, the correct k is 9. Then, x = 21 +9 = 30. x +d = 30 +10 =40. LCM(30,40) is 120. Which is exactly the case for g=10. So according to this approach, the correct answer would be k=30-21=9, which is correct. So why in the calculation above, the code would select that. So the approach seems correct. So why is the sample output 9?\n\nYes, in that case, the code would generate for g=10, x_candidate=30 (k=9), which is the correct answer. So the approach seems to work.\n\nBut why in the previous calculation for the case of g=5, the x_candidate is 25. Which gives LCM 25 and 35. Which is 175. Which is larger than 120. So the minimal is indeed 120, which is achieved with k=9.\n\nSo the approach seems to work. So, the steps are:\n\nGenerate all divisors of d, for each compute x_candidate, compute the LCM, and choose the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple x_candidate's have the same LCM, choose the one with the smallest x_candidate (so the smallest k).\n\nBut wait, there's another case. What if there's a k that is not generated by any of the divisors of d? For example, let's imagine that d is 6. Suppose a is 4. So, d=6. Divisors are 1,2,3,6.\n\nSuppose x is 5. Then, x is not a multiple of any divisor of d except 1. But then, GCD(5,6)=1. So the LCM would be 5 * 11 /1 = 55. However, for x_candidate=5 (generated from g=1), the LCM is 55. However, there might be other x's that are not multiples of any of the divisors of d except 1, but perhaps they have a better LCM. But according to our approach, we are considering all divisors of d, including 1, and generating x_candidate for that. So in this case, the code would generate x_candidate for g=1, which is 4 (since a is 4, and 4 is a multiple of 1). Then, the LCM is (4 * (4 +6 )) / GCD(4,6) = (4*10)/2 = 20. Which is better than 55. So, the code would find that.\n\nBut in this case, x_candidate for g=2 is 4 (since 4 is a multiple of 2). Which gives LCM(4, 10) = 20. Which is the same as the case for g=1. So, the code would process all possibilities and find the minimal.\n\nThus, the approach seems correct.\n\nSo, the steps to implement:\n\nFirst, handle the case when a == b. Then, the answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute d = b - a (assuming a < b). Then generate all divisors of d.\n\nGenerate all divisors of d. How to generate them?\n\nTo generate all divisors of a number, we can factorize it into primes, then generate all combinations. However, for numbers up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, we can generate all divisors by checking up to sqrt(d). Let me think of a function to generate all divisors of a number.\n\nOnce the divisors are generated, for each of them, compute x_candidate as the minimal multiple of g that is ≥a.\n\nOnce we have all x_candidate, compute the LCM for each, and select the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple x_candidates have the same LCM, choose the smallest k (i.e., the smallest x_candidate, since k = x_candidate -a).\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead a and b. Let me assume that a and b are given. Then:\n\nif a == b:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    if a > b:\n\n        swap a and b\n\n    d = b - a\n\n    generate all divisors of d\n\n    for each divisor g in divisors:\n\n        compute x_candidate = ((a + g -1) // g) * g\n\n        compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d\n\n        track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\n    then, among all candidates, select the one with the minimal LCM, and if tie, the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, the divisors of d can be generated, but what about the divisors of d, including those that are not in the list? For example, if d is 4, then divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\nBut how to generate them?\n\nImplementing a function to generate all divisors of a number:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut for n=0? Well, in our case, when a != b, d is positive. So no problem.\n\nOnce the divisors are generated, we can process them.\n\nNow, for each x_candidate, compute LCM(x_candidate, x_candidate +d). How to compute LCM?\n\nWe can compute LCM(x, y) as x * y // gcd(x, y).\n\nBut since x_candidate and x_candidate +d are x and x +d, and d is fixed. Also, since x_candidate is a multiple of g (a divisor of d), then GCD(x_candidate, d) is g * GCD(x_candidate/g, d/g). But perhaps it's easier to compute GCD(x_candidate, x_candidate +d) which is the same as GCD(x_candidate, d). So, for the LCM, we can compute (x_candidate * (x_candidate +d)) // GCD(x_candidate, d).\n\nBut since x_candidate is a multiple of g, and d is a multiple of g, then GCD(x_candidate, d) is at least g. But for the LCM calculation, we can compute it directly.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(x, y):\n\n    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since x and y are positive, it's okay.\n\nSo, for each x_candidate, compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d.\n\nOnce all candidates are considered, select the one with the minimal LCM. If there are multiple, choose the smallest k.\n\nNow, what about cases where multiple divisors generate the same LCM? For example, if two different divisors generate x_candidate's with the same LCM, but different k's. We need to choose the smallest k.\n\nSo, during the processing of all divisors, we can track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k. For each candidate, if the LCM is smaller than the current minimum, update. If equal, check if the k is smaller than the current one, and update if necessary.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors, including all possible ones.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10 → a=6, b=10. d=4. Divisors are 1, 2,4.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=4: x_candidate is ((6 +4-1)//4)*4 → (9//4)=2 → 2*4=8. x_candidate=8. LCM(8, 12) is 24.\n\ng=2: ((6 +2-1)//2)*2 → (7//2)=3 → 3*2=6. LCM(6, 10) is 30.\n\ng=1: x_candidate is 6. LCM(6, 10) is 30. So the minimal is 24. So k is 8-6=2 → correct.\n\nSample input 2: 21 31 → a=21, b=31. d=10. Divisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=10: x_candidate is ((21 +10 -1)//10)*10 → (30//10)=3 → 3*10=30. LCM(30, 40) is 120. k=9.\n\ng=5: x_candidate is ((21+5-1)/5)*5 → (25//5)=5 → 5*5=25. LCM(25, 35) is 175.\n\ng=2: ((21 +2-1)/2)*2 → (22//2)=11 → 22. LCM(22, 32) is (22*32)/2 = 352.\n\ng=1: x_candidate is 21. LCM(21, 31) is 651. So minimal is 120, k=9. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 5 and 10. a=5, b=10. d=5. Divisors of 5: 1,5.\n\ng=5: x_candidate is 5. LCM(5, 10) is 10. k=0. Correct.\n\nSo, the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM? For example, say d=6, a=3. Divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\ng=6: x_candidate is 6. LCM(6, 12) is 12.\n\ng=3: x_candidate is 3. LCM(3, 9) is 9. Which is better. So, the minimal is 9. So, the code would process all divisors, and find the minimal.\n\nBut what if there are two divisors that lead to same LCM?\n\nFor example, d=6, a=4. Divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\ng=6: x_candidate is 6. LCM(6, 12) is 12.\n\ng=3: x_candidate is 6 (since 4 divided by 3 is 1.333, so next multiple is 3*2=6). LCM(6, 12) is 12. Same as for g=6. So, which one to choose? The k for g=3 is 6 -4 = 2. For g=6, it's 6-4=2. Same k. So no problem.\n\nAnother example: d=6, a=5. Divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\ng=3: x_candidate is 6 (since 5//3 is 1.666 → 2*3=6). LCM(6, 12) is 12.\n\ng=2: x_candidate is 6 (since 5//2 is 2.5 → 3*2=6). LCM(6, 12) is 12. So same LCM. Which k? For both, k is 6-5=1. So same.\n\nBut if for some other case, two different divisors generate different x_candidate with same LCM, but different k. For example, say d=4, a=3. Divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\ng=2: x_candidate is 4. LCM(4, 8) is 8.\n\ng=4: x_candidate is 4. LCM is same. So same k.\n\nBut if a=2, d=4. Divisors 1,2,4.\n\ng=2: x_candidate is 2. LCM(2,6) is 6.\n\ng=4: x_candidate is 4. LCM(4,8) is 8. So here, the minimal is 6. So the code would choose the g=2 case.\n\nThus, the code correctly selects the minimal.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all divisors of d, process them, and select the best candidate.\n\nBut what about the case when d is 0? That's handled by the initial check.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nIf a == b: print 0.\n\nElse, swap to have a <= b.\n\nCompute d = b -a.\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor, compute x_candidate.\n\nCompute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d.\n\nTrack the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, output the minimal k.\n\nBut what about the case when there are multiple divisors leading to same LCM? For example, two different divisors leading to same LCM but different k. Then, the code should select the smallest k.\n\nSo, during processing, for each candidate, we compare:\n\n- if the current LCM is less than the best, then update best.\n\n- if the current LCM is equal to the best, then compare the k. If the current k is smaller, then update.\n\nSo, the code should track the best_lcm and best_k.\n\nInitialize best_lcm as a very large number, best_k as a very large number.\n\nFor each candidate:\n\ncurrent_lcm = ... \n\nif current_lcm < best_lcm:\n\n    update best_lcm and best_k.\n\nelif current_lcm == best_lcm:\n\n    if current_k < best_k:\n\n        update best_k.\n\nSo, in code.\n\nNow, the code for generating the divisors.\n\nBut what about when d is zero? Well, handled earlier.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for the divisors, the code can generate them as follows.\n\nBut for d=0, but that's handled",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. The approach involves leveraging the properties of divisors and the greatest common divisor (GCD) to efficiently determine the optimal $ k $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Edge Case Handling**: If $ a $ and $ b $ are equal, the LCM is simply $ a + k $, which is minimized when $ k = 0 $.\n2. **Difference Calculation**: Compute the absolute difference $ d $ between $ a $ and $ b $. This helps in reducing the problem to finding an optimal value for $ x $ such that $ x $ and $ x + d $ have the smallest LCM.\n3. **Divisors Generation**: Generate all divisors of $ d $. These divisors help in determining potential values of $ x $ that can minimize the LCM.\n4. **Candidate Evaluation**: For each divisor $ g $ of $ d $, compute the smallest multiple of $ g $ that is greater than or equal to $ a $. This gives a candidate value for $ x $, from which we compute the corresponding LCM and track the minimum value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    if a == b:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    if a > b:\n        a, b = b, a\n    d = b - a\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    best_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        # Compute minimal x >= a that is a multiple of g\n        quotient = (a + g - 1) // g\n        x_candidate = quotient * g\n        y_candidate = x_candidate + d\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x_candidate, d)\n        current_lcm = (x_candidate * y_candidate) // current_gcd\n        current_k = x_candidate - a\n        \n        if current_lcm < best_lcm:\n            best_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = current_k\n        elif current_lcm == best_lcm:\n            if current_k < best_k:\n                best_k = current_k\n    \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Edge Case Handling**: Directly check if $ a $ and $ b $ are equal, in which case $ k = 0 $ is the optimal solution.\n2. **Difference Calculation**: Compute $ d $ as the absolute difference between $ a $ and $ b $, ensuring $ a \\leq b $.\n3. **Divisors Generation**: Generate all divisors of $ d $ using trial division up to the square root of $ d $.\n4. **Candidate Evaluation**: For each divisor $ g $, calculate the smallest multiple of $ g $ that is at least $ a $.
