The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every two districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nSo the key here is to maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute way more than lower ones. Therefore, our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring that the remaining districts form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to do that? Because if we just keep the highest n - k districts, they might not be connected. So the challenge is to find a connected subtree of size (n - k) that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nWait, but since the tree is connected, perhaps we can think of this as selecting a subtree of size (n -k) that includes the highest possible nodes. However, how to select which nodes to keep?\n\nAn idea comes to mind: since higher-numbered nodes have higher values, we want to keep them. But we need to make sure that the subtree is connected. So maybe we can perform some kind of greedy approach where we prioritize keeping higher-numbered nodes, and remove lower ones, but ensuring connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as choosing which nodes to remove. But how?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as choosing which nodes to keep. The optimal set of nodes to keep is a connected subtree of size m = n -k, which contains the maximum possible sum. Since the sum is maximized by including as many high-numbered nodes as possible, the optimal strategy is to include all nodes from some subset of high numbers, but connected.\n\nBut how to find that subset?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we start from the highest-numbered node (node n). Then, we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but connected. So perhaps we can perform a priority-based selection, where we choose to keep the nodes with higher numbers first, and then ensure that they are connected.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can model this as a problem where we need to select a subtree of size m = n -k, and the nodes selected should be as large as possible. So perhaps we can use a priority queue approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm or some kind of BFS. Let's think of the problem in terms of building a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes. We can start with the highest node (n) and then greedily add the next highest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree. But how to manage that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as removing the smallest possible nodes. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest nodes, we need to remove the smallest possible ones. However, the catch is that the nodes to be removed must be such that the remaining nodes form a connected component.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to remove? Well, perhaps we can think of the problem as selecting the nodes to keep. The optimal set is a connected subtree that includes the highest possible nodes. So, for example, if we can include all nodes from m to n, but that's only possible if those nodes form a connected subtree. If not, we have to include some lower nodes.\n\nBut how to determine which ones?\n\nAnother thought: the problem is similar to finding a subtree of size m = n -k, which has the maximum sum. Since the sum is the sum of 2^i for each node in the subtree, which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the nodes' values. Since 2^i increases with i, the optimal subtree would contain the largest possible nodes. So, the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree of size m, which contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo the strategy would be to select the largest m nodes, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. If they do, then we can keep them. Otherwise, we need to replace some lower nodes with higher ones that are connected.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAnother approach: since the tree is connected, and we need to select a connected subtree of size m. The best way to maximize the sum is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Therefore, we can model this as starting with the highest nodes and then adding necessary lower nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nWe can think of the problem as trying to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So we can perform a process similar to a priority queue. For example, we can start with the highest node (n), and then for each step, we can add the next highest node that is adjacent to the current subtree. But this might not",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts' contestants should be removed such that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we should prioritize keeping these districts while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there's exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since each district `i` has `2^i` fans, higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more. Thus, we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: After selecting the highest-numbered districts, we need to ensure they form a connected subtree. If they don't, we must include necessary lower-numbered districts to maintain connectivity.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Using a priority queue (max-heap) to always consider the next highest-numbered district.\n2. Performing a BFS or DFS to ensure connectivity while including the highest-numbered districts.\n3. Removing the smallest necessary districts to maintain connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = n - k\n\n    # Build adjacency list\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n\n    # We need to select m nodes with highest numbers, but connected\n    # Start from the highest node and grow the tree by adding the highest possible nodes\n\n    # Use a max heap, but since Python has min-heap, we can insert negative values\n    # We'll use a set to keep track of included nodes\n    included = set()\n    heap = []\n    # Start with node n\n    included.add(n)\n    for neighbor in adj[n]:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n    \n    while len(included) < m:\n        if not heap:\n            break  # should not happen as per problem constraints\n        neg_curr, curr = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if curr in included:\n            continue\n        # Check if curr is connected to the included set\n        # To do that, perform BFS/DFS from curr and see if it can reach any node in included\n        # But since the tree is connected, we can check if any neighbor of curr is in included\n        found = False\n        for neighbor in adj[curr]:\n            if neighbor in included:\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found:\n            included.add(curr)\n            # Push its neighbors into the heap\n            for neighbor in adj[curr]:\n                if neighbor not in included:\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n        else:\n            # This node cannot be added now, but we might need to add it later\n            # So we push it back into the heap\n            heapq.heappush(heap, (neg_curr, curr))\n    \n    # Now, the included set contains the nodes to keep\n    # The ones to remove are all nodes not in included\n    to_remove = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in included:\n            to_remove.append(i)\n    # Sort the result in increasing order\n    to_remove.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, to_remove)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Construction**: The adjacency list is built from the input.\n2. **Max-Heap Utilization**: A max-heap (implemented using negative values in Python's min-heap) is used to prioritize higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: For each potential district to include, we check if it connects to the current set of included districts.
