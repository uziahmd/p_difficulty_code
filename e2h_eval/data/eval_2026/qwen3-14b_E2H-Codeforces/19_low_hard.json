The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that we have a tree structure (since there's exactly one path between every two districts), and we need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to select a subset of n - k districts that form a connected subtree, and maximize the sum of their 2^i values. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, we want to keep as many higher-numbered districts as possible. But since the districts must form a connected component, we can't just take the top n -k districts. For example, if the higher-numbered districts are spread out in the tree, we might have to include some lower ones to connect them.\n\nWait, but the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible numbers. So maybe the optimal strategy is to keep the largest possible districts, but ensuring they form a connected subtree. How to do that?\n\nLet me think: the districts are numbered from 1 to n. The value of 2^i increases with i, so the highest value is for the largest i. Therefore, our goal is to keep the largest possible districts, but they must be connected. So perhaps we can start by considering that we want to include the largest district (district n) and then include as many larger districts as possible, while maintaining connectivity.\n\nBut how to find which districts to remove? Maybe we can model this as selecting a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But since the tree is connected, maybe we can perform some kind of greedy approach.\n\nAnother thought: since the sum is the sum of 2^i for the kept districts, the maximum sum is achieved when we keep the districts with the largest possible i's. However, they need to be connected. So the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree with exactly (n -k) nodes, which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nSo the approach would be to find a connected subtree with (n -k) nodes that contains the largest possible numbers. How to find that?\n\nAn idea: the optimal subtree must include the node with the highest number (n), because otherwise, if we exclude it, we could include it instead of some lower-numbered node, which would increase the sum. So the optimal subtree must contain node n. Then, we need to include as many of the next highest nodes as possible, ensuring connectivity.\n\nSo perhaps we can perform a priority-based selection where we start with node n, and then greedily add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as removing the k smallest nodes, but ensuring that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. But that's not straightforward because removing certain nodes may disconnect others.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that after removing k nodes, the remaining nodes are connected. So the problem is equivalent to choosing a connected subtree of size (n -k), and we need to choose the one with maximum sum of 2^i. Since 2^i is strictly increasing, this is equivalent to choosing the subset of (n -k) nodes with the largest possible numbers, which are connected.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the connected subtree of size (n -k) that has the maximum possible set of high-numbered nodes.\n\nHow to find such a subtree?\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to use a priority queue (like a max-heap) to select the nodes. Starting with the largest node (n), and then adding the next largest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree. However, this might not work directly because the tree's structure may require including some lower-numbered nodes to connect higher ones.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to keep the nodes with the highest possible values. Let's think about the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a problem where we want to select the nodes to keep, starting from the highest-numbered nodes, and ensuring that they form a connected subtree. To do that, we can perform a process similar to Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees, but in reverse.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\nStart with the highest-numbered node (n). Then, for each step, we want to add the next highest-numbered node that is adjacent to the current subtree. However, since the tree is connected, we can model this as building a subtree by adding nodes in order of decreasing value, ensuring that each new node is connected to the existing subtree. This way, we can collect as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nAnother approach is to think of the problem as selecting the nodes to remove. Since we need to remove k nodes, and the remaining nodes must be connected, the nodes to remove are those that are",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts are structured as a tree, and each district's fan count is given by $2^i$, where $i$ is the district number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since $2^i$ increases exponentially with $i$, we should prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity**: The remaining districts must form a connected subtree. This means we need to ensure that the districts we keep are connected through existing paths.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Starting from the highest-numbered district (n), we use a priority queue (max-heap) to always consider the next highest-numbered districts that can be connected to the current subtree.\n2. We use a BFS or DFS traversal to explore the tree and maintain connectivity while selecting the highest possible districts.\n3. We track which nodes are included in the final subtree and mark the others for removal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    tree = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n\n    # We need to select (n - k) nodes, keeping the largest ones possible\n    # Start with the largest node, n\n    # Use a max-heap approach, but since Python has min-heap, we store negative values\n\n    # Keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    # Keep track of which nodes are kept\n    kept = [False] * (n + 1)\n    # Use a priority queue to process nodes in descending order\n    heap = []\n    # Start with node n\n    heapq.heappush(heap, (-n, n))\n    visited[n] = True\n    kept[n] = True\n    count = 1\n\n    # To track the parent for avoiding cycles\n    parent = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    # We need to collect (n - k) nodes\n    while count < (n - k):\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)[0]\n        # Check all neighbors\n        for neighbor in tree[current]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                # We can add this neighbor to the kept set\n                visited[neighbor] = True\n                kept[neighbor] = True\n                count += 1\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n                parent[neighbor] = current\n            else:\n                # If it's already visited, check if it's part of the kept set\n                # But since we are using BFS, we don't need to check again\n                pass\n\n    # Now, find all nodes not in 'kept' and collect them\n    removed = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not kept[i]:\n            removed.append(i)\n\n    # Sort the removed list and print\n    removed.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, removed)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Construction**: The tree is built using an adjacency list from the input edges.\n2. **Priority Queue**: A max-heap (implemented using a min-heap with negative values) is used to always process the highest-numbered nodes first.\n3. **BFS Traversal**: Starting from the highest node (n), we use BFS to traverse the tree, ensuring that we include the highest possible nodes while maintaining connectivity.\n4. **Tracking Kept Nodes**: Nodes that are included in the connected subtree are marked as `kept`, and the rest are marked for removal.\n5. **Output**: The nodes to be removed are collected, sorted, and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by prioritizing higher-numbered districts while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining districts.",
