He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where this count equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but why? Let me check:\n\n5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), etc. So for m=1, the numbers from 5 to 9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero. Wait, but 10! would have 2 zeros. So why does 5-9 work?\n\nYes, because the count increases when you hit multiples of 5. So for each multiple of 5, you add one, but higher multiples add more. So for example, 25 adds two, etc.\n\nSo the key is to find all n where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Now, the challenge is to find these n's efficiently.\n\nBut how do I find them? Let's think about the possible approach.\n\nFirst, for a given m, there could be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 numbers n that satisfy the condition. Wait, why? Because when you have a number that's a multiple of 5, adding 1 to it may not change the count. Like for example, 5: count is 1. 6: same count. 7, 8, 9: same. Then 10: count increases to 2. So between 5 and 9, there's 5 numbers with same count. So maybe the possible number of solutions is 0, 1, 5, etc. Wait, but maybe for some m, there are no solutions. Like if m is 5, maybe there's a range of numbers that produce that count.\n\nBut how to find the possible n's?\n\nThe approach I can think of is:\n\nFirst, find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count.\n\nWait, but how to find the possible n's?\n\nAnother approach is to use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds for n that give exactly m zeros.\n\nBut first, I need to find the minimal n where the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, there's no solution. Otherwise, find the range of numbers where the count is exactly m.\n\nBut how to find the possible numbers?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing. Because as n increases, the count can stay the same or increase. So for example, when you go from 4 to 5, the count increases by 1. From 5 to 6, it stays same. From 9 to 10, it increases by 1 again.\n\nSo for a given m, there can be a range of n's that have exactly m zeros. But how many?\n\nLet me think: For example, if m is 5, what's the n's?\n\nLet me calculate f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. f(25) = 5 + 1 = 6. Wait, so between 25 and ... ?\n\nWait, wait. Let me compute for n=25, the count is 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So for m=5, there is no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Because between 24 (count 4) and 25 (count 6). So there's a jump from 4 to 6. Hence, for m=5, there are no solutions. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo that's an example where the answer is zero.\n\nSo the problem is, for a given m, find all n's such that f(n) = m. But how?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\nFind the minimal n_low where f(n_low)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many positive integers $ n $ exist such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. Additionally, we must output these integers in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the count of factors of 5 in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because every pair of factors 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero, and there are generally more 2s than 5s in factorials. Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis function is **non-decreasing** as $ n $ increases. That means for a given $ m $, there can be multiple values of $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = m $, or no such $ n $ at all.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\nWe use **binary search** to efficiently find the smallest and largest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros equals $ m $.\n\n1. **Binary Search for Lower Bound**: Find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) \\geq m $.\n2. **Binary Search for Upper Bound**: Find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) > m $.\n3. **Check Validity**: If the lower bound gives exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, then all integers between the lower and upper bounds (exclusive) will also have exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n---\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower_bound(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef find_upper_bound(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) <= m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lower = find_lower_bound(m)\n    upper = find_upper_bound(m)\n    \n    if count_trailing_zeros(lower) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        result = list(range(lower, upper))\n        print(len(result))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- `count_trailing_zeros(n)` computes the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ using the formula described above.\n- `find_lower_bound(m)` uses binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros is at least $ m $.\n- `find_upper_bound(m)` finds the first $ n $ where the number of trailing zeros exceeds $ m $.\n- The range `[lower, upper)` gives all $ n $ that have exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n- If the count at `lower` does not equal $ m $, there are no such $ n $, so we print `0`.\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity of $ O(\\log n) $ for each binary search.",
