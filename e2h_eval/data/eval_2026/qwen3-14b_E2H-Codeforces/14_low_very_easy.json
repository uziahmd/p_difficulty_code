He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given m, find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then output how many such n's there are and list them.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. The trailing zeros for 5! is 1, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors of 5? Wait no. Wait 5! has one 5. 6! is 6*5! so same number of 5s. So the count of trailing zeros increases only when you hit multiples of 5. So for numbers between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Then when you reach 10, which is 2*5, the count becomes 2 (since 10/5 = 2, plus 10/25 is 0). So the count increases by 1 at multiples of 5, but sometimes more if it's a multiple of higher powers like 25, 125, etc.\n\nSo the key idea here is that for each m, there might be a range of n's that produce exactly m trailing zeros. But how to find them?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. For example, if m is such that there is no n that gives exactly m trailing zeros, then the answer is zero. For example, if m=5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, let's see. Let's compute for n=24: 24/5 = 4, 24/25=0. Total is 4. For n=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 25 and 24, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Therefore, for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo the problem requires checking for such cases.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Find the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. How?\n\nWe can think of this as a binary search problem. For example, given m, find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros is >=m. Then check if that number is exactly m. But how does that help in finding all possible n's?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros would be in a certain range. Let me think.\n\nThe function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros is non-decreasing. So for each m, there's a range of n's where f(n) = m. However, sometimes there's no n for which f(n) = m. For example, when m is between f(n) and f(n+1) for some n, but there's a jump.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n_low such that f(n_low) = m.\n\n- Find the maximal n_high such that f(n_high) = m.\n\nIf such n_low and n_high exist, then the numbers from n_low to n_high (inclusive) are all valid, and the count is n_high - n_low + 1.\n\nBut how to find these n_low and n_high?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (like in the sample case). Wait, why 5 in the sample? Because the count of trailing zeros for 5 is 1, and for 9 it's 1. Then for 10, it's 2. So the numbers 5-9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that for each m, the numbers that satisfy the condition form a contiguous range. So if there exists any n with f(n) = m, then there's a range of numbers. But how to find that range?\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. Additionally, we must list these integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials.\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: The function `count_zeros(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing the integer divisions of $ n $ by powers of 5 until the quotient is zero.\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Given a target number of trailing zeros $ m $, we use binary search to find the smallest and largest values of $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly $ m $. If no such $ n $ exists, the result is zero.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m  # Upper bound for binary search\n    # Find the lower bound\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    lower = low\n    # Check if count_zeros(lower) != m\n    if count_zeros(lower) != m:\n        return []\n    # Find the upper bound\n    low = lower\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) <= m:\n            low = mid\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    upper = low\n    return list(range(lower, upper + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m_values = input.split()\n    for m_str in m_values:\n        m = int(m_str)\n        res = find_n_values(m)\n        print(len(res))\n        if len(res) > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n        else:\n            print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by increasing powers of 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_n_values(m)**: This function uses binary search to find the range of values $ n $ such that $ n! $ has exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. It first finds the smallest $ n $ (lower bound) where the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m $, then adjusts to find the largest $ n $ (upper bound) where the count remains exactly $ m $.\n3. **main()**: Reads input values, processes each $ m $, and prints the results. If no valid $ n $ is found, it prints 0 followed by an empty line.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $.",
