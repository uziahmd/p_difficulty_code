    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nHmm, let me think about how to model each ring. For the i-th ring (starting from 1), the rectangle it's based on is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but the ring is the border of that rectangle, right? So for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (number of cells in the border) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Like, for a rectangle, the perimeter cells are top row (W cells), bottom row (W cells), left and right columns (H-2 each, since top and bottom are already counted). So total is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2(W + H - 2). Alternatively, maybe I can compute it as 2*(width + height) - 4, since each corner is counted twice. Wait, for example, a 3x3 rectangle: perimeter is 3*4 - 4 = 8? Which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1, output is 8. Yes. So that formula works.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that each ring is possible. For example, if the dimensions are too small, but according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. So the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ), which probably ensures that each ring can be formed. So we don't need to check for that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nAdd this to total.\n\nBut wait, let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. So current_w is 3, current_h is 3. Perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 -2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So current_w is 7, current_h is 9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example input is 7 9 2. So for i=1, current_w is 7, current_h is 9. perimeter 28. For i=2, current_w is 7-4*(1) = 3, current_h is 9-4*(1)=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to loop through each ring, calculate the perimeter for that ring, and add them all.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nRead the input: w, h, k. Then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i.\n\nBut wait, what about when i increases, the current_w and current_h could become smaller. But since k is given correctly, we don't have to worry about negative numbers.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Let's say input is read via input().split().\n\nThen initialize total = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nThen print(total)\n\nWait, but let me test for the third example. For i=1, current_w =7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. For i=2, current_w is 7 -4*(1) = 3, current_h is 9-4*(1) =5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's think of a 5x5 plate with k=2. The first ring is 5x5, perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Second ring: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the input constraints for k are such that it's valid. For example, for min(w, h) =5, then floor( (5+1)/4 ) = floor(6/4) =1. So k can't be 2. So in the input, k is chosen such that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or perhaps the problem allows for when current_w or current_h is less than 3, but the formula still works?\n\nWait, for example, if current_w is 1 and current_h is 1. Then the perimeter would be 2*(1+1-2) = 0. Which would be correct, since there's no border. But according to the problem statement, the input k is such that it's possible. So for example, when w and h are 5, the maximum k is 1. So the code can handle cases where the current_w or current_h are less than 3, but the problem says that the input is valid. So the code is okay.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead w, h, k. Then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is three integers. So the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. For example, input().split() and map to integers.\n\nThen total = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. As computed.\n\nSample input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 =40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which would be correct. If k=2, but according to the input constraints, k is allowed only up to floor( (5+1)/4 ) = 1. So the code would not have to handle that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. So:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nLet me check for another example. Let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Output is 16. Which is correct. If we have w=5, h=5, k=1. So the ring is the perimeter of 5x5. Which is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if w=4, h=4, k=1. Then the perimeter is 2*(4+4-2) = 12. But according to the input constraints, the minimum of w and h is 4, and k is floor( (4+1)/4 ) = 1. So it's allowed. So the code would return 12. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate when adding a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that the first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is formed around an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the dimensions of the rectangle are reduced by 4*(i-1) from both the width and height of the original plate. This is because each subsequent ring is placed 2 cells inward from the previous one on all sides, effectively reducing the dimensions by 4 cells (2 on each side) for each ring.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: The number of cells in the border (perimeter) of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by the formula `2 * (w + h - 2)`. This accounts for the top and bottom rows (each of length `w`) and the left and right columns (each of length `h-2` to avoid double-counting the corners).\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the corresponding inner rectangle and sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, calculate the adjusted width and height of the inner rectangle considering the current ring's position.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: Use the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)` to determine the number of cells in the perimeter of the current inner rectangle.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their individual perimeters, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the problem constraints.",
