    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. But the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the width and height decrease by 4*(i-1) as i increases. Wait, for example, the first ring (i=1) is the border of the original rectangle. Then for the second ring (i=2), it's the border of a rectangle that's 4*(2-1) = 4 units smaller in both dimensions. Wait, but how does that work? Let me think: if the original is w x h, then the first ring is the perimeter. Then the next ring would be the perimeter of a rectangle that's (w-4) x (h-4), but only if that's possible. Because each ring is 1 cell thick. So for each ring i, the rectangle that's being considered is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. But wait, the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2*(width + height) - 4, because the four corners are counted twice otherwise. Wait, no. Let's think: the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H (in terms of cells) would be 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each side has length W or H, but the four corners are counted once each. Wait, for example, a 3x3 rectangle. The perimeter is 3*4 - 4 = 8, which matches the first example input. The first example input is 3 3 1, output is 8. So yes, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. But wait, for a rectangle of size W x H, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*W + 2*H - 4. Because each side has W cells (top and bottom) and H cells (left and right), but subtracting 4 because the four corners are counted twice. So yes.\n\nSo for each ring i, we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i x h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). But this must be valid. For example, when i=1, it's w x h. Then for i=2, it's w-4 and h-4. But for this to be possible, the dimensions must be at least 3 (since the rectangle must have at least 3 cells in each dimension to have a perimeter? Or maybe even less? Wait, for a rectangle of 2x2, the perimeter would be 2*(2+2) -4 = 4. But that's 4 cells, but the perimeter of a 2x2 square is all four cells. But according to the problem statement, the rings are added such that each ring is a border. However, the constraints on k ensure that the input is valid. The problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ), which probably ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions w - 4*(i-1) and h - 4*(i-1) are at least 3? Or maybe not. Let's think for example: if w and h are 3, then for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3. For i=2, 3-4*(2-1) = 3-4= -1? Which is impossible. But the constraints on k would prevent that. The problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). Let's take min(w, h) as 3. Then (3+1)/4 is 1. So k can be 1. Which is correct. So for the first example, 3x3 and k=1, which is allowed. So for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring are valid. So we don't have to worry about negative numbers here.\n\nSo the approach is to compute, for each ring from 1 to k, the perimeter of the rectangle (w_i, h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but let me check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input is 3 3 1. The perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which matches the output.\n\nSecond sample input is 7 9 1. So the perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird sample input is 7 9 2. So for the first ring, perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 28. For the second ring, the dimensions are 7 -4*(2-1) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So the perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Wait, 2*(3+5) is 16, minus 4 gives 12. Then total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the third sample output. So that's correct.\n\nSo the plan is: for each i from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum them all.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read w, h, k.\n\n- Initialize total = 0.\n\n- For each i in 1..k:\n\n   - current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n   - add perimeter to total.\n\n- Output total.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the constraints on k, that's not possible. Because the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's think: for i up to k, the minimum between current_w and current_h is min(w, h) - 4*(i-1). For i= k, the value is min(w, h) - 4*(k-1). Since k is at most floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ), then 4*(k-1) <= (min(w,h)+1) -4. Let me see for example: suppose min(w, h) is m. Then k is at most floor( (m+1)/4 ). So for i=k, 4*(k-1) ≤ (m+1) -4? Let me check for m=3. Then (m+1)/4 is 1. So k can be 1. Then 4*(1-1) =0. So m - 4*(k-1) = 3 -0=3 ≥3. For m=7, say. If k is floor( (7+1)/4 )= 2. So for i=2, 4*(2-1) =4. So m -4*(k-1) =7-4=3. Which is okay. So for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Well, perhaps not. Let me see: suppose m=5. Then (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. So for i=1, current_w and current_h are 5-0=5. So okay. Suppose m=7, and k=2. For i=2, 7-4*(2-1) = 3. So that's okay. So for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Because for the maximum possible k, when i=k, the min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) is >=3?\n\nLet me check for m=7 and k=2. 7-4*(2-1) =3. Which is okay. For m=4, then (4+1)/4 is 1.25, floor is 1. So k=1. So for i=1, current_w and current_h are 4, which is okay. For m=6, (6+1)/4 is 1.75, floor is 1. So k=1. So for i=1, current_w and current_h are 6, which is okay. So the constraints on k ensure that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3. Therefore, the perimeter calculation is valid.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead the input as three integers w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nLoop for i in 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\ntotal += perimeter\n\nThen print total.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w =3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(6) -4= 8. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:7 9 1. perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16-4= 28. Correct.\n\nThird sample input:7 9 2.\n\ni=1: 7,9 → 2*(16) -4= 28.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5. 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Total is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: say, 5 5 2. What's the total?\n\nFor i=1: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5) -4 = 16.\n\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So current_w=1, current_h=1. Wait, but that's 1x1. Then perimeter would be 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. But that's impossible. But according to the constraints, k is floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For w=h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So this case is invalid. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother example: say w=7, h=7, k=2. Then for i=1: 7x7 → perimeter is 2*(14) -4=24. i=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(6) -4=8. Total 24+8=32.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. For example, input could be read via input().split().\n\nBut the input is given as a list of inputs, but for the code, it's just reading from stdin. So the code will read one line, split into three integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 28.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input line as three integers. So:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute total as above.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's all. Seems straightforward.\n\nLet me check another case. For example, if w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5) -4 = 16. Which is correct. Because the perimeter of a 5x5 square is 5*4 -4 = 16? Wait, 5x5 square has 5*5=25 cells. The perimeter is the outermost cells. Which is 5*4 - 4 (because the four corners are counted twice). So 20-4=16. Yes.\n\nAnother example: 5x5, k=1. Output is 16. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 5x5, k=1. So code returns 16.\n\nAnother example: 7x7, k=2. The first ring is 2*(7+7)-4= 24. Second ring is 3x3 → 2*(3+3)-4= 8. Total 32. Which is correct.\n\nYes, this code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it forms a border around an inner rectangle, progressively moving inward with each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle. The first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle, the second ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that is 4 units smaller in both width and height (since each ring reduces the dimensions by 2 units on each side), and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For a rectangle of width `w` and height `h`, the perimeter (number of cells in the border) is calculated as `2 * (w + h) - 4`. This formula accounts for the fact that each corner cell is counted twice if we simply sum the sides.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the corresponding inner rectangle and its perimeter. Sum these perimeters to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`).\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the adjusted width and height of the inner rectangle by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from the original dimensions. This adjustment accounts for the previous rings' widths.\n- **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (width + height) - 4`.\n- **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and calculating the perimeter of the corresponding inner rectangle, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the given constraints.",
