    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and track their occurrences. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, maybe that's manageable.\n\nLet me think: for each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. The maximum possible L is floor(n/2), but maybe even higher? Wait, for example, if the string is 'aaaaa', then the maximum L is 4, since 'aaaa' appears twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So for a string of length n, the maximum possible L is n-1, but only if there's a duplicate. But for the problem, we need to check all possible lengths.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate possible lengths L from the maximum possible (the length of the string minus 1) down to 1.\n- For each L, check all possible substrings of length L. For each substring, check if it appears at least two times in the string.\n- If any such substring is found, return L as the answer.\n- If no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check if a substring appears at least twice?\n\nFor each L, generate all substrings of that length, and count their occurrences. But since the same substring can appear multiple times, we can use a dictionary to track the counts.\n\nWait, but for each L, we can generate all possible substrings of that length, and check if any of them appears more than once. However, for overlapping occurrences, like in 'ababa' with L=3, the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So the first and third occurrence are the same, so it's counted as two times.\n\nSo for each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs at least two times.\n\nBut how do I generate all substrings of length L?\n\nFor a string s of length n, the substrings of length L are s[i:i+L] for i in 0 to n-L inclusive.\n\nSo for each L, iterate through all possible starting indices, collect the substrings, and check if any of them appears more than once.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nLoop L from max_len down to 1:\n\n   max_len = len(s) - 1 (since for L = len(s), there's only one substring, which can't be repeated)\n\n   for each L:\n\n      create a dictionary to count occurrences of substrings of length L\n\n      for i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n          substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n          add to the dictionary, incrementing count\n\n      after collecting all substrings, check if any of them has count >= 2\n\n      if yes, return L as the answer.\n\nOnce we find the maximum L where this is true, return it.\n\nIf none found, return 0.\n\nSo for example, for input 'abcd', the possible Ls are 3, 2, 1.\n\nFor L=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bcd' — both occur once. So no. Then L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — all unique. Then L=1: each character occurs once. So output is 0.\n\nFor 'ababa', let's see. Let's check L=3 first. The substrings are:\n\ni=0: aba\n\ni=1: bab\n\ni=2: aba\n\nso the counts for 'aba' is 2. So return 3.\n\nFor 'zzz', the possible L is 2. The substrings of length 2 are 'zz' (i=0 and i=1). So count is 2. So return 2.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the input. Wait, the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as a string. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: the first input line contains the string. So the input is a single string. But the sample input shows something like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but that's probably the input for multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe input is the first line containing the string. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one string per input.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: the first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nBut the sample input shows ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nAh, perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases. So the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says \"You're given a string...\" implying that the input is a single string. But the sample input shows multiple strings. Wait, maybe the sample input is not in the standard input format. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: the first input line contains the string. So the code should read one string from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of three strings. That's probably a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the actual code needs to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input is a single string. But the sample input shows a list of three strings. So perhaps that's a formatting mistake, and the actual input is a single string. For example, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nBut the sample output is 0, 3, 2. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case. So for example, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the original problem says:\n\nInput: the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted. Or perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. But the problem statement isn't clear. However, the sample input and output show that for the three inputs, the outputs are given. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first line. So perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement. For example, perhaps the sample input shows that the input is a list of strings, but in reality, the code should process one string per input line. For example, in the sample input, the user enters three lines, each being a test case. The code should process each line and output the result for each.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake. However, the user provided the sample input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and output as ['0', '3', '2']. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each being a string, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem says: the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual input. But this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases, but the problem description is not accurate. For example, the original problem may have been presented with multiple test cases, but the problem statement says that the input is a single string.\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\nWhich suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the actual input is multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut the user says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo, perhaps the input is a single string, but the sample input shows multiple strings. Maybe the sample input is not properly formatted. For example, perhaps the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nSo the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first line. Which is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one string and output one number.\n\nIn that case, the sample input is perhaps a mistake, and the code should read one string and output one number.\n\nBut the sample input and output shows that for three different strings, the outputs are given. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a single string, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual input. For example, the sample input may be a list of test cases, but the code is supposed to process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is the first line. So perhaps the problem is a bit ambiguous. However, given that the sample input shows three test cases, and the output has three answers, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each being a separate test case.\n\nBut how to resolve this? Well, given that the sample input is given as a list, but the output is a list, perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case. So the code would read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the problem is a mistake, but given the sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to proceed? Well, perhaps the original problem's input is a single string, and the sample input shows three examples. For example, perhaps the sample input is three different test cases, and the code should process each line as a test case.\n\nSo, the code would read all lines from stdin, for each line, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nBut how to confirm? Well, the user's note says that the sample input is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nSo, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nSo, the code will read all lines from stdin, for each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as the first line. So perhaps that's a mistake, and the actual code should read multiple lines.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows three test cases, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code should read multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, for each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nBut in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin. However, for multiple lines, perhaps using sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nBut for the code to work, perhaps the code is supposed to read one line, but the sample shows multiple. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code should process a single string.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. So, perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. For example, the code could be written to read all lines from input, and for each line, output the answer.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a single string, perhaps the sample input is a mistake. For example, the sample input may have been intended to show that for the input 'ababa', the output is 3. But the way it's presented is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the input is a list of strings, but that's not the case.\n\nWell, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Let's look again at the problem statement's input and output:\n\nInput: the first input line contains the string. So the input is one line, which is the string. The output is one number.\n\nBut the sample input shows three strings, and the sample output shows three numbers. So this suggests that the problem is expecting multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is conflicting. However, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that is not correct. For example, perhaps the sample input is not in the correct format, but the actual problem is that the code must process one string per input line.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a single string, perhaps the sample input is a mistake and the code should process one string.\n\nBut the sample input shows three strings, which would imply that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a bit of a problem. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nBut perhaps the actual input is a list of strings, but the problem's description is incorrect. However, given that the user provided this sample, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the code will read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nSo, the code will be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    # process s and compute the answer\n\n    print(answer)\n\nBut now, the code needs to process each string s.\n\nSo, the core function is, given s, compute the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice.\n\nNow, implementing that function.\n\nLet me think about the steps again.\n\nFor a given s, the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1. For example, for s of length 5, the maximum L is 4. For L=4, there are two substrings: positions 0-3 and 1-4. If they are the same, then return 4.\n\nSo, the code for a given s:\n\ndef longest_substring(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    max_len = 0\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = {}\n\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                # already seen, so this L is possible\n\n                return L\n\n            else:\n\n                seen[substr] = True\n\n        # after checking all substrings for this L, if none found, continue\n\n    return 0\n\nWait, but this code returns as soon as it finds a substring that appears at least twice. But in the loop for L, for each L, we check all substrings. If any of them appears more than once, then return L.\n\nBut the code above checks for each substring, and if it's seen before, returns L. But that would miss cases where a substring appears more than once, but not in the first occurrence.\n\nWait, for example, for 'ababa' and L=3:\n\nThe first substr is 'aba' (i=0). Then, when i=2, substr is 'aba' again. So when processing i=2, the code checks if substr is in seen. Since it's already in seen (from i=0), returns L=3.\n\nYes. So this code would work.\n\nBut wait, the code returns as soon as it finds a duplicate substring. So for a given L, once a substring is found that occurs at least twice, the code returns L. So for the first L (starting from largest possible), the code returns the maximum possible.\n\nBut what if there are multiple substrings of the same L, but some have duplicates and others not. For example, for L=3, suppose there are two substrings, 'abc' and 'def', but 'abc' appears twice. So the code returns L=3.\n\nBut the code checks for each substring in order, and returns once a duplicate is found. So it's correct.\n\nBut in the code above, for each L, the code checks all substrings. But once any of them is found to have a duplicate, returns L. So this is correct.\n\nBut the code for the function is not exactly correct. Because, for example, the first occurrence of a substring is stored in 'seen', and then when the same substring appears again, the code returns. However, for a substring that appears more than once, but not in the first occurrence, the code will catch it.\n\nBut what if the same substring appears multiple times, but the first occurrence is not the same as the second? For example, in the case of 'aaaaa' with L=2. The substrings are 'aa' (i=0), 'aa' (i=1), 'aa' (i=2), 'aa' (i=3). So when i=1, the code checks if 'aa' is in seen (it was added at i=0), so returns 2.\n\nYes. So the code returns correctly.\n\nBut the code as written would return L as soon as any substring of length L occurs at least twice. So that's correct.\n\nBut the code above is not correct. Because the code for a given L, the 'seen' is a dictionary. For each substring, we check if it's already in 'seen'. If yes, return L. But in this case, the code returns L even if the same substring appears again. But the first time it is added to the 'seen' dictionary, and the next time it is found, it returns. So it's correct.\n\nBut this approach will miss cases where a substring appears more than once but the first occurrence is not the same as the second. Wait, no. For example, if the same substring appears in two different positions, then during the iteration, when the second occurrence is processed, it will be found in 'seen' and return.\n\nBut what if the same substring appears in three positions? For example, 'aaaaa' with L=2. The first occurrence is at i=0, then i=1, then i=2, etc. When i=1, the code checks if 'aa' is in 'seen' (it is, from i=0), returns L=2. So correct.\n\nThus, the code for the function is correct.\n\nBut wait, the code returns L as soon as any substring of that length appears twice. So, for the first L (the maximum possible), if there is any such substring, returns it. Otherwise, check L-1, etc.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test for the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd'\n\nn = 4. So L starts at 3.\n\nFor L=3, substrings are 'abc' and 'bcd'. Both are unique. So loop continues.\n\nThen L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique. Then L=1: substrings are 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'. All unique. So returns 0. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' (n=5). L starts at 4. For L=4, substrings are 'abab' (i=0), 'baba' (i=1). Both unique. Then L=3. Check substrings:\n\ni=0: 'aba' → add to seen.\n\ni=1: 'bab' → add.\n\ni=2: 'aba' → already in seen. Return 3. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' (n=3). L starts at 2. Substrings are 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). So for i=1, 'zz' is in seen (added at i=0). Return 2. Correct.\n\nSo this code works for the samples.\n\nBut what about cases where the same substring appears multiple times but not overlapping?\n\nLike 'aaaaa' (n=5). For L=4, substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0) and 'aaaa' (i=1). So returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' (n=6). For L=3, substrings are 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa'. No duplicates. For L=2: substrings are 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. The 'aa' appears at i=0 and i=4. So returns 2. But there's also 'aa' at i=0 and i=4. So yes.\n\nBut what about for L=3, the substring 'aab' appears once, 'abb' once, 'bba' once, 'baa' once. So no. But for L=2, the code returns 2. But the maximum possible is 3? No, because there is no substring of length 3 that appears twice.\n\nBut for the string 'abab', the maximum L is 2. The substrings of length 2 are 'ab', 'ba', 'ab'. So 'ab' appears twice. So returns 2.\n\nSo the code would process L=3 first. For L=3, substrings are 'aba' and 'bab'. No duplicates. Then L=2, and returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the function is as follows.\n\nBut in the code, for each L, the code loops through all possible substrings. For each substring, if it's in 'seen', return L. Else, add to 'seen'.\n\nBut the code for the function is:\n\ndef get_max_length(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return L\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\nWait, but here, the 'seen' is a set. For each substring, we check if it's already in the set. If yes, return L. Otherwise, add to the set.\n\nBut this approach would work. Because, for example, if a substring appears more than once, then during the loop, the second occurrence will be found in the set, and return L.\n\nBut in this code, the 'seen' is a set, not a dictionary. So for each substring, we check if it's already in the set. If yes, return L. Otherwise, add it.\n\nYes, this is correct.\n\nBut why not use a set? Because we just need to know whether the substring has been seen before. So using a set is sufficient.\n\nSo this code is correct.\n\nBut for the code, the 'seen' is initialized for each L. So for each L, we check all substrings of that length. If any of them appears more than once, return L.\n\nSo this is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the entire problem.\n\nBut in Python, the code needs to read the input. Assuming that the input is multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nSo, for example, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        max_len = 0\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            else:\n\n                # no break, continue to next L\n\n                continue\n\n            # break out of the for L loop\n\n            break\n\n        else:\n\n            # no L found\n\n            print(0)\n\nBut wait, the code for each line would process the string and print the answer.\n\nBut how to handle the loops?\n\nLet me think: for each line, process the string s.\n\nInitialize max_len as 0.\n\nLoop L from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   create a new set.\n\n   for each i in 0 to n-L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr in seen:\n\n           print(L)\n\n           break out of the L loop.\n\n       else add to seen.\n\n   if the inner loop breaks, then break the L loop.\n\nElse, after checking all L, print 0.\n\nSo the code uses nested loops, and breaks when a L is found.\n\nIn Python, the code can be structured with flags.\n\nBut in code:\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    found = False\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                print(L)\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(0)\n\nBut this code would work. However, for the case where the string is of length 1. For example, input is 'a'. Then n=1. The for L loop is range(0, 0, -1), which is empty. So the code proceeds to print 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: string of length 2, e.g., 'aa'. Then L starts at 1. For L=1, substrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). When i=1, substr is 'a' which is in seen (added at i=0). So returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: 'aaab', the longest substring is 'aa' (appears twice). So for L=2, substrings are 'aa', 'aa', 'ab'. So when i=1, substr is 'aa' which is already in the set (from i=0). So returns 2.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, the for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):. For example, when n=2, n-1 is 1. So the range is from 1 down to 1 (since the stop is 0, but the range is exclusive). So the loop runs once for L=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → output 0.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → output 3.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → output 2.\n\nSo the code would process each line and output accordingly.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So in Python, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut note that for the case when the input is read via sys.stdin, each line is read, including possible empty lines. However, the problem states that the input string is non-empty. So, assuming that each line is a valid test case.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the line.strip() is necessary to remove any leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        if not s:\n\n            continue  # skip empty lines, though the problem says input is non-empty\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        if not found:\n\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut this code would process each line as a separate test case. For example, if the input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThen the code would output:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is a single string. But according to the sample, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. But the sample shows three test cases. Therefore, the code may be correct as written.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's sample input is written as a list, but the actual input is one string. However, given the sample input and output, the code as written would be correct.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is the first line. So perhaps the code should read only one line. For example, if the input is a single line, then the code would process it. But the sample input shows three lines, but the code would process all of them.\n\nBut the problem's sample input and output suggest that the code should process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code is correct as written.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect, and the code should read a single line. However, the sample input shows three strings. Therefore, I'm confused.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line. Therefore, the code is written as such.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The solution should efficiently check for overlapping occurrences of substrings and handle multiple test cases.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read multiple lines of input, each representing a separate test case.\n2. **Substring Search**: For each string, iterate over possible substring lengths starting from the maximum possible length down to 1.\n3. **Tracking Occurrences**: Use a set to track substrings of the current length. If a substring is found more than once, return its length as the result for that test case.\n4. **Early Termination**: As soon as a valid substring is found for a given length, terminate further checks for that length and move to the next test case.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        if not s:\n            continue\n        n = len(s)\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        if not found:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads input lines from standard input using `sys.stdin`. Each line is stripped of any extraneous whitespace.\n2. **Iterating Over Lengths**: For each string, the algorithm checks possible substring lengths starting from the maximum possible (length of the string minus one) down to 1.\n3. **Checking Substrings**: For each length, all possible substrings are generated. A set is used to track these substrings. If a substring is encountered again, it means it has appeared at least twice, and the length of this substring is printed immediately.\n4. **Efficiency**: By checking from the longest possible substring downwards, the solution ensures the first valid length found is the maximum, allowing early termination and efficient processing.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring while handling multiple test cases as specified in the problem's sample input.",
