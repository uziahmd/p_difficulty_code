The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all tasks before it), we need to process them in sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3,2,3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Time taken is 2.\n- Then, the second task is at 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2 clockwise, she has to go all the way around. From 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4 to 1 (another), then 1 to 2 (another). Total 3 steps. So time adds 3, total now 5.\n- Third task is at 3 again. She's at 2. Moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Time adds 1. Total 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is to track Xenia's current position and for each task, compute the time needed to move from her current position to the next task's house, then update her position.\n\nBut how do we compute the time between two positions?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the time between current position (curr) and next position (next) is (next - curr) mod n? Wait, no. Because if curr is 3 and next is 2 in a 4-house setup, then moving clockwise would require 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4 = ( -1 +4 ) = 3 mod 4. So yes, the formula would be (next - curr) if next >= curr, else (next - curr + n). Which can be written as (next - curr) % n if the mod is handled correctly. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, (2-3) is -1. mod 4 would be 3. So (next - curr) % n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nWait, let's test:\n\ncurr = 3, next = 2. (2-3) = -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\ncurr = 1, next = 3. (3-1) = 2 mod 4 is 2. Correct.\n\ncurr = 2, next = 3: 1 step. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the formula for the time between curr and next is (next - curr) % n. But wait, what if the next is same as curr? Then it's zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1 (since she starts there).\n\nTotal time is 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   compute the time needed to move from current position to a_i, which is (a_i - current) % n. Add that to total time.\n\n   set current to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the tasks have to be done in order. So for example, if the tasks are [3,2,3], then the first task is 3, then 2, then 3. So the steps are as explained.\n\nBut why does the first example's total time sum to 6?\n\nLet's compute:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. (3-1) mod 4 is 2. Total is 2. Current becomes 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3. Total is 2+3=5. Current becomes 2.\n\nThird task is 3. (3-2) mod 4 is 1. Total is 5+1=6. Correct.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks in the order they are given.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 as Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the task's house position.\n3. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Use modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. The time to move from the current position to the next task's position is calculated using the formula `(next_position - current_position) % n`, which accounts for both clockwise and counter-clockwise movements efficiently.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the time taken for each movement between consecutive tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    diff = (target - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = target\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time needed to move from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Modulo Arithmetic**: The expression `(target - current) % n` ensures that moving clockwise around the ringroad is correctly accounted for, even when the target house is before the current house in the clockwise direction.\n- **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(m) time complexity, where m is the number of tasks, making it efficient for large inputs up to the given constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement, thus avoiding unnecessary complexity in handling wrap-around cases manually.",
