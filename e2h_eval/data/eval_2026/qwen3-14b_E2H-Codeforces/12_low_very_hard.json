The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task to the next, considering the order of tasks and the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The explanation is that she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). But wait, how do we compute the time between two positions?\n\nWait, the movement is along the ringroad, which is clockwise. So moving from house x to house y clockwise takes (y - x) mod n steps if y >=x? Or maybe (y - x + n) % n? Wait, no. For example, if x is 3 and y is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - x + y) steps. Because moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would go through 4, 1, 2. So for n=4, that's 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) mod 4 = 3 mod4 = 3. So the formula for the time between x and y is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + n). But that's equivalent to (y -x + n) % n. But since we are dealing with moving clockwise, the time between current position and next position is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). But since the movement is always clockwise, the time is (next - current) mod n. Wait, no. Because if next is less than current, then mod n would give the correct steps. For example, current is 3, next is 2. (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the time between current and next is (next - current) % n. But since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values if not handled properly, perhaps we should compute it as (next - current + n) % n. But in any case, the formula for the time between current position and next position is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which is equivalent to (next - current + n) % n. But since we have to move clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\nBut the problem is that the tasks must be done in order. So for each task i, we have to process them in order. So Xenia starts at 1. Then for each task in order, she must move from her current position to the position of the current task, but considering that each task must be done after the previous ones.\n\nSo the approach is to track her current position, and for each task in order, compute the time needed to get from her current position to the next task's position, add that to the total time, and then update her current position.\n\nBut how do we compute the time between current position and the next task's position?\n\nLet me take the first example:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3. Since 3 >=1, it's 3-1 = 2 steps. Total time is 2.\n\nNow current position is 3. Next task is at 2. So moving from 3 to 2. Since 2 <3, the steps are (2 -3 +4) = 3 steps. So total time is 2+3=5. Now current position is 2. Next task is at 3. Moving from 2 to 3: 1 step. Total time is 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the total is 2+3+1=6.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, tasks are 2,3,3. Output is 2. Let's see:\n\nStart at 1. First task is 2. Time is 2-1=1. Now current position is 2. Next task is 3. Time is 3-2=1. Now",
