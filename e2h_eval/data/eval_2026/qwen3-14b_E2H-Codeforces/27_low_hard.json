On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have a sequence of 1s and 2s. We can choose any interval [l, r], reverse that part of the sequence, and then find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the new sequence.\n\nThe goal is to compute this maximum possible LNDS length after performing exactly one reversal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how reversing a segment affects the sequence. Since the original sequence has only 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be up to n if the entire sequence is non-decreasing. But since we can reverse any segment, maybe we can find a way to maximize the number of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how to approach this problem efficiently? The brute force approach would be to try every possible [l, r], reverse it, compute the LNDS for each, and take the maximum. However, n is up to 2000, so the number of possible intervals is O(n^2) which is around 4 million. For each of these, computing the LNDS would be O(n^2), leading to 4 million * 4 million operations which is way too slow. That's not feasible.\n\nSo, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about what the optimal reversal would do. Since the original sequence is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be calculated by counting the number of 1s and 2s in certain positions.\n\nWait, the longest non-decreasing subsequence for a sequence of 1s and 2s is just the count of 1s plus the count of 2s in the sequence, but only if they are arranged such that all 1s come before 2s. Wait no, that's not true. The LNDS can be the maximum between the number of 1s, the number of 2s, or the count of 1s plus the count of 2s if they are ordered properly. But for a sequence with 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s, the count of 2s, or the count of 1s plus the count of 2s if the sequence is non-decreasing. Wait, no. For example, the sequence [1,2,1,2] has LNDS of 3 (like 1,2,2). But if you reverse [2,3], you get [1,1,2,2], which gives LNDS 4.\n\nSo, the maximum possible LNDS after reversal would be when we have as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible. So perhaps the optimal reversal is one that allows us to merge some 1s and 2s into a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nLet me think: the original sequence has some 1s and 2s. Let's say that the original LNDS is some value. But by reversing a segment, we can possibly fix some transitions between 2 and 1. For example, if there's a 2 followed by a 1, reversing that part would make it 1 followed by 2, which is better.\n\nSo, the key idea is that the best possible scenario after reversal is to have the entire sequence be non-decreasing. But that's not always possible. However, perhaps the best we can do is to find the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s, possibly with some transitions.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the original array. Let's say that the original array has some number of 1s and 2s. Let's denote the total number of 1s as cnt_1 and 2s as cnt_2. The maximum possible LNDS is cnt_1 + cnt_2 = n if the array is non-decreasing. But if the original array isn't, then perhaps by reversing a segment, we can increase the LNDS.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: for any reversal [l, r], the reversed segment will be the same as the original but reversed. Let's think about how this affects the overall sequence. The LNDS of the entire sequence after reversal can be determined by considering the original sequence, and the reversed segment. However, it's tricky to model this directly.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think about the optimal reversal. The best possible reversal is one that increases the number of 1s followed by 2s. For example, if there is a part of the array where there's a 2 followed by a 1, reversing that part would turn it into 1 followed by 2, which is better.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal reversal is to find a segment that contains a transition from 2 to 1, and reverse it. But how to find",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a segment can help merge sequences of 1s and 2s into a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The sequence consists of only 1s and 2s. Reversing a subarray can potentially turn a decreasing segment (like 2 followed by 1) into an increasing one (1 followed by 2), which improves the LNDS.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We can use dynamic programming to efficiently compute the maximum LNDS after considering all possible reversals. The main idea is to track the number of 1s and 2s before and after each possible reversal.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By precomputing the number of 1s and 2s up to each index, we can quickly determine how many 1s and 2s are in any subarray. This helps in evaluating the effect of reversing any subarray on the overall LNDS.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s\n    prefix_1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    prefix_2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_1[i+1] = prefix_1[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        prefix_2[i+1] = prefix_2[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    max_len = 0\n    \n    # For each possible reversal [l, r], compute the best possible LNDS\n    # We need to find the optimal l and r such that after reversing [l, r], the LNDS is maximized\n    # The optimal scenario is to have as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible\n    # Let's consider all possible positions where a 2 is followed by a 1 and reverse that segment\n    \n    # However, brute force is not feasible.

However, the way they are ordered can affect the LNDS.\n    # The best case scenario is that after reversing, the segment is all 1s followed by all 2s. So the contribution from that segment is the number of 1s + number of 2s in the segment.\n    # Thus, the total LNDS would be:\n    # (number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in [l, r]) + (number of 2s in [l, r]) + (number of 2s after r)\n    # Which is (number of 1s before l) + (number of 2s after r) + (length of segment [l, r])\n    # But since the total number of 1s in the entire array is prefix_1[n], and the number of 2s is prefix_2[n], the above expression can be rewritten as:\n    # (prefix_1[l] + (prefix_2[n] - prefix_2[r])) + (r - l + 1)\n    # Wait, not sure. Let me re-calculate:\n    # The number of 1s before l is prefix_1[l].\n    # The number of 2s after r is suffix_2[r+1].\n    # The length of the segment [l, r] is r - l + 1.\n    # So total is prefix_1[l] + suffix_2[r+1] + (r - l + 1)\n    # But how does this relate to the previous max_candidate?\n    \n    # So, to find the maximum possible value, we can iterate over all possible l and r, and compute this value.\n    \n    # However, for n=2000, iterating over all l and r (O(n^2)) would be 4 million iterations, which is acceptable.\n    \n    # So, the plan is:\n    # 1. Compute the original max_candidate (prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i] for all i)\n    # 2. Iterate over all possible l and r, and compute for each the value prefix_1[l] + suffix_2[r+1] + (r - l + 1)\n    # 3. Take the maximum between the original max_candidate and the maximum found in step 2\n    \n    # Let's implement this.\n    \n    max_candidate = 0\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        current = prefix_1[i] + suffix_2[i]\n        if current > max_candidate:\n            max_candidate = current\n    \n    # Now check all possible l and r\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Compute the value: prefix_1[l] (number of 1s before l) + suffix_2[r+1] (number of 2s after r) + (r - l + 1)\n            val = prefix_1[l] + suffix_2[r + 1] + (r - l + 1)\n            if val > max_candidate:\n                max_candidate = val\n    \n    print(max_candidate)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
