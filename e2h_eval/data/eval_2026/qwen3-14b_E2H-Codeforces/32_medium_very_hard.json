    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what instability is. It's the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array. So, when we remove one element, we want this difference to be as small as possible.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to check for each element, remove it, compute the max and min of the remaining elements, and then find the minimum instability. However, if n is up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. For example, for n=1e5, that would be 1e10 operations. Definitely not feasible.\n\nSo, we need a more efficient approach. Let's think about the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). When we remove an element, the new max and min could be either the same as before (if the removed element was not the max or min) or they could change.\n\nBut how can we find which element to remove to minimize the instability?\n\nLet me think: the optimal choice is to remove either the maximum element or the minimum element, or maybe some other element that's close to the extremes. Wait, but if there are multiple maxima or minima, removing one of them might not affect the overall max or min. For example, if there are two max elements, removing one of them would leave the other as the max.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to consider the cases where we remove the first occurrence of the max, the last occurrence of the max, the first occurrence of the min, the last occurrence of the min, etc. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the sorted array. Suppose we sort the array. Then, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If we remove one element, the new instability will be the max of the remaining elements minus the min of the remaining elements. \n\nIf the array is sorted, then removing an element from the middle won't affect the max or min. For example, if the array is sorted as [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}], then if I remove any element except the first or last, the new max is a[-1], new min is a[0], so instability is the same as before. But if I remove the first element, then the new min is a_1, and the max remains a[-1]. Similarly, if I remove the last element, the new max is a[-2], and the min is a_0. So, the instability would be a[-1] - a[1] or a[-2] - a[0], respectively. \n\nWait, but that's only if the array is sorted. So, if we sort the array first, then the minimal instability after removing one element can be found by checking the cases where we remove the first element, the last element, or maybe some other elements? But how?\n\nWait, the original idea is that when you remove an element, the new instability depends on whether the element you remove is the current max or min. So, if the array is sorted, then the only possibilities for the new instability after removing one element are:\n\n- Remove the first element (the min): the new min is a[1], max is a[-1], instability is a[-1] - a[1]\n- Remove the last element (the max): the new instability is a[-2] - a[0]\n- Remove some other element (not the first or last): the instability remains a[-1] - a[0], which is the original instability.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal instability would be the minimum between the original instability (if we remove an element that's not the first or last), or the two possibilities when we remove the first or last element. But wait, that's only if the array is sorted. So, the minimal instability would be min( (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) )\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements with the same value as the min or max? For example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 3]. The original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 1s, the instability becomes 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 3s, the instability becomes 3-1=2. But if we remove the first element (a[0] = 1), then the new array is [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the last element (a[3]=3), the new array is [1,1,3], instability is 3-1=2. But the original instability is also 2. So, in this case, the minimal instability is 2. But according to the previous idea, the min between a[-1] - a[1] (which is 3-1=2) and a[-2]-a[0] (3-1=2) would be 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: original array [1,3,3,7]. Sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 7-3=4. If we remove the last element (7), instability is 3-1=2. Which is the correct answer. So in this case, the minimal is min(4, 2) = 2.\n\nSo, according to this reasoning, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]). But wait, what if the array has more than one element that is the max or min?\n\nBut in that case, perhaps the same logic applies. For example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5]. The original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove the first element (1), the new min is 1, max is 5, instability is 4. If we remove the last element (5), the new max is 5, min is 1, instability is 4. But if we remove one of the 5s, then the new max is 5 (since there are others), and min is 1. But if we remove one of the 1s, the new min is 1 (since others remain), and max is 5. So, the instability is still 4. But in this case, the minimal instability is 4. However, according to the approach of looking at the sorted array, the possible options would be (a[-1] - a[1]) = 5 - 1 =4, and a[-2] - a[0] = 5 -1=4. So the minimum is 4, which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Then, the original instability is 4. If we remove the first element, the instability is 5-2=3. If we remove the last element, the instability is 4-1=3. So the minimal is 3. Which is better than the original 4. So the answer would be 3.\n\nBut according to the approach of considering the sorted array, the answer is min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] ), which is min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo this suggests that the correct approach is to sort the array, and then check the minimum between the instability when removing the first element (so the new min is a[1], max is a[-1]) and when removing the last element (new max is a[-2], min is a[0]). Then, the minimal between those two is the answer.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because when the array is sorted, the only way to reduce the instability is to remove either the first element (so that the min increases) or the last element (so that the max decreases). Removing any other element doesn't change the max or min. So the instability remains the same as before. Therefore, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between the instability after removing the first element or the last element.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements that are min or max. For example, array [1, 1, 5, 5]. The original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove one of the 1s, the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove one of the 5s, the instability is 5-1=4. But if we remove the first element (a[0] =1), the instability is 5-1=4. If we remove the last element (a[3]=5), the instability is 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. But according to the approach of checking the two options (a[-1] - a[1] and a[-2] -a[0]), which would be 5-1=4 and 5-1=4. So the answer is 4, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 3, 4, 5]. Original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 5, the instability is 4-1=3. If we remove 1, it's 5-3=2. So the answer is 2. According to the approach, the min between a[-1] -a[1] (5-3=2) and a[-2] -a[0] (4-1=3) is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to hold. So the approach is:\n\nSort the array. Then, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but what about if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. If I remove 6, the instability is 5-1=4. If I remove 1, the instability is 6-2=4. But what if I remove 2? Then the array is [1,3,4,5,6], instability is 6-1=5. Which is worse. So the minimal is indeed 4, which is the min between the two options.\n\nSo the conclusion is that, after sorting the array, the minimal instability is the minimum between the instability when removing the first element (a[-1] - a[1]) and when removing the last element (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array has n=2 elements? Like the second example in the problem statement: input is 2 elements [1, 100000]. After sorting, the array is [1, 100000]. Then, removing the first element gives instability 0 (since the array is [100000], max and min are same). Removing the last element gives instability 0. So the answer is min(100000-1[when removing first element? No, wait: when the array is sorted, the a[-1] is 100000, a[1] is out of bounds. Wait, for n=2, the sorted array is [a0, a1]. So when you remove the first element, the array is [a1], instability is 0. When you remove the last element, the array is [a0], instability is 0. So for n=2, the answer is 0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo, for n=2, the code would compute a[-1] - a[1], but a[1] is the second element. Wait, for n=2, the sorted array is [a0, a1]. So when you remove the first element, the new array is [a1], so the instability is 0. But according to the formula a[-1] - a[1], which would be a1 - a[1] = 0. Similarly, a[-2] - a[0] is a0 - a0 = 0. So the code would compute min(0, 0) = 0, which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for all cases.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n- Compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n- That's the answer.\n\nWait, but what if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], as in the first example. After sorting, it's [1,3,3,7]. Then:\n\na[-1] - a[1] = 7 -3 =4. a[-2] -a[0] is 3 -1=2. So the answer is 2, which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code should be:\n\nSort the array, then compute min( (a[-1] - a[1]), (a[-2] - a[0]) )\n\nBut wait, what about when n is larger than 2? For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Then the answer is min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 4, 5]. The sorted array is [1,2,4,5]. The options are 5-2=3 (remove first element) or 4-1=3 (remove last element). So the answer is 3. But what if we remove the 4? Then the array is [1,2,5], instability 5-1=4. Which is worse. Or remove 2, array is [1,4,5], instability 4. So yes, the minimal is indeed 3.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array.\n- Compute the two possibilities: when removing the first element (so the new min is a[1], max is a[-1]) and when removing the last element (new max is a[-2], min is a[0]).\n- The answer is the minimum of these two values.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it, then compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nWait, but what about when n is 3? Let's take an example. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 5]. After sorting, [1,2,5]. The options are removing first element (instability 5-2=3) or removing last (instability 2-1=1). So the answer is 1. Which is correct. Because removing 5 gives [1,2], instability 1.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 5]. Removing 5 gives instability 3-1=2. Removing 1 gives 5-3=2. The answer is 2. But according to the formula, a[-1] - a[1] is 5-3=2, a[-2] - a[0] is 3-1=2. So the minimum is 2, correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what if there are multiple elements that are the same as the min or max? For example, [1, 1, 5, 5]. Then the answer is min(5-1=4, 5-1=4) → 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead n, then the list. Sort it. Then compute the two values and take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the sorted array is [a, b]. Then a[-1] - a[1] is b - a[1], but a[1] is the second element (since n=2, indexes are 0 and 1). So a[-1] is a[1], and a[1] is the same. So a[-1] - a[1] is zero. Similarly for a[-2] - a[0], which is a[0] - a[0] = 0. So the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code is handled by the else part. Because if n=2, then the code would compute option1 as a[-1] - a[1], which is a[1] - a[1] = 0, and option2 is a[-2] -a[0] which is a[0] - a[0] = 0. So min(0,0) is 0. So the code can be written without the if condition.\n\nBut for n=2, the code would compute option1 = a[-1] - a[1], which is a[1] - a[1] = 0. And option2 is a[-2] -a[0] which is a[0] - a[0] = 0. So the code can be written as:\n\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n\nBut for n=2, a[-1] is a[1], and a[1] is the same as a[-1]. So yes.\n\nBut wait, in the case of n=2, a[-2] is a[0], so a[-2] - a[0] is 0. So the code works for all n >= 2.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n\nWait, but what about when n is 3?\n\nFor example, n=3, array [1,2,3]. The options are a[-1] - a[1] = 3 - 2 = 1, and a[-2] -a[0] = 2 - 1 = 1. So the answer is 1. Which is correct. Because removing 3 gives [1,2], instability 1. Removing 1 gives [2,3], instability 1. So correct.\n\nAnother example, n=3, array [1, 3, 5]. The code returns min(5-3=2, 3-1=2) → 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. Then the code returns min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFirst example input:\n\n4\n1 3 3 7\n\nAfter sorting: [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1 = 7 - a[1] = 7-3=4\n\noption2 = a[-2] - a[0] = 3-1=2 → min(4,2)=2 → correct.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2\n1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]\n\noption1 = 100000 - a[1] → 100000 - 100000 = 0\n\noption2 = a[-2] - a[0] → 1 - 1 = 0. So min is 0 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 1]. After sorting, [1,1,1]. option1 is 1 - a[1] = 1-1=0. option2 is a[-2] - a[0] = 1-1=0. So answer is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 2, 5]. option1 is 5-2=3, option2 is 2-1=1 → answer is 1. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo the code is simple and efficient. Sorting takes O(n log n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1e5.\n\nThus, the Python code can be written as:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it, compute the two options and print the minimum.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code is correct. Let me check for n=2.\n\nFor example, input 2 1 100000 → sorted [1, 100000]. a[-1] - a[1] is 100000 - 100000 = 0. a[-2] - a[0] is 1 -1 = 0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case for n=2: input 2 5 5 → output 0. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly. So this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum possible instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability of an array is defined as the difference between its maximum and minimum elements. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values. When we remove one element, the goal is to minimize this difference.\n2. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the potential new minimum and maximum values after removing an element.\n3. **Key Insight**: After sorting, the optimal elements to remove to minimize instability are either the first element (which affects the minimum) or the last element (which affects the maximum). This is because removing any other element would not change the overall maximum or minimum values of the array.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: By sorting the array, we can compute the instability after removing the first element (resulting in a new minimum at index 1) and after removing the last element (resulting in a new maximum at index -2). The minimum of these two values gives the desired result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nprint(min(a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0]))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.\n2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to facilitate efficient calculation of potential new minima and maxima.\n3. **Instability Calculation**: \n   - Removing the first element results in a new minimum at index 1 and the maximum remains at the end of the array (index -1).\n   - Removing the last element results in a new maximum at index -2 and the minimum remains at the start of the array (index 0).\n4. **Result**: The minimum instability is determined by comparing the instability values from both scenarios (removing the first or last element).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum possible instability with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is $O(n \\log n)$, making it suitable for large input sizes up to $10^5$.",
