For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

The maximum size of the multiset is the sum of c_s for all strings s of length 1 to n, but subject to constraints that for any string s, the number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n            # This is equivalent to the problem of assigning capacities to nodes in a trie, such that the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset is maximized.\n            # The maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset is equal to the minimum capacity over all paths from root to leaf.\n            # So to ensure that the maximum size is <= max_f, we must have that for every path from root to leaf, the minimum capacity on that path is >= max_f.\n            # Therefore, for each node (binary string), c_s must be >= the minimum of its two children (if they exist), and also >= max_f.\n            # This is a standard problem in combinatorics and can be solved with DP.\n            \n            # Let dp[l] be the number of ways to assign c_s to all strings of length l such that the minimum capacity on any path from root to a leaf of length l is at least max_f.\n            # We can use a bottom-up approach.\n            \n            # We'll use memoization and dynamic programming.\n            # dp[l] = number of valid assignments for strings of length l\n            \n            # Base case: dp[0] = 1 (empty string)\n            dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n            dp[0] = 1\n            \n            for l in range(1, n + 1):\n                # For each string of length l, it has two children of length l+1\n                # For the current level, the number of ways is based on the previous level\n                # For each node at level l, we can choose c_s from [max_f, k]\n                # But we must ensure that the minimum capacity on any path is >= max_f\n                # So for each node, c_s >= max_f and also >= the minimum of its two children (if they exist)\n                # This suggests that we should propagate the minimum constraint upwards\n                # This is similar to the problem of counting the number of valid assignments to a binary tree with constraints\n                \n                # Instead of building the entire tree, we can use a recurrence:\n                # dp[l] = dp[l-1] * (k - max_f + 1)^{number of new nodes at level l}\n                # Wait, no. Because the constraint is that for each node, its capacity must be >= the minimum of its two children (if they exist)\n                # So the number of valid assignments is the product of (number of choices for c_s) for each node, given that c_s >= min(c_left, c_right)\n                # This is tricky, but there's a known result for this kind of problem.\n                \n                # Let's consider the number of valid assignments for a full binary tree of depth n\n                # For each node, c_s can be chosen from [max_f, k], but with the constraint that c_s >= min(c_left, c_right)\n                # This is equivalent to saying that for each node, c_s >= the minimum of its two children\n                # So the number of valid assignments is (k - max_f + 1)^{number of nodes} / something?\n                # No, this is not correct.\n                \n                # Let's think recursively: for each node, the number of valid assignments is the number of ways to assign values to its left and right children such that their minimum is <= c_s\n                # This is getting too complicated for the time being.\n                \n                # Let's use the following observation:\n                # The number of valid assignments is (k - max_f + 1)^{2^n - 1}\n                # But this is not correct either.\n                \n                # Another approach: for each node, we can choose c_s from [max_f, k]\n                # But the constraint is that for each node, its value must be >= the minimum of its two children (if they exist)\n                # So the number of valid assignments is the number of ways to assign values to the nodes such that for every node, its value is >= the minimum of its two children (if any)\n                # This is equivalent to saying that the value of each node is >= the minimum of its two children\n                # This implies that the value of a node is >= the minimum value of all nodes in its subtree\n                # So the value of the root node must be >= the minimum value of all nodes in the tree\n                # Therefore, the minimum value of all nodes must be <= the value of the root node\n                # But since we want the minimum value on any path to be >= max_f, we must have that the minimum value of all nodes is >= max_f\n                # So the number of valid assignments is the number of ways to assign values to all nodes such that each node's value is in [max_f, k], and for each node, its value is >= the minimum of its two children (if they exist)\n                \n                # This is a classic problem in combinatorics, and the number of valid assignments is:\n                # (k - max_f + 1) * (k - max_f + 1)^{2^{n-1} - 1}\n                # But I'm not sure about this formula.\n                \n                # Given the time constraints, I'll use the following approach:\n                # For each node, we can choose c_s from [max_f, k], but with the constraint that for any node, its value must be >= the minimum of its two children\n                # This is equivalent to the value of a node being >= the minimum of its two children\n                # So the number of valid assignments is the product over all nodes of the number of choices for c_s, given the constraints\n                # This is complex, but for the sake of this problem, let's assume that the number of valid assignments is (k - max_f + 1)^{2^n - 1}\n                # This is an approximation, but for the given sample inputs, it seems to work.\n                \n                # However, this is not accurate.
