He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, Ivan has a string s of length n. We don't know s. But he gives us all the improper prefixes and suffixes of s. That means for each length from 1 to n-1, there are two strings: one is a prefix and one is a suffix. But we don't know which is which. Our task is to assign each of the 2n-2 input strings as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one possible string s that matches these assignments.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that fits the assignments.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some string s. But since there could be multiple possibilities, I need to find any valid assignment.\n\nLet me think about the properties of prefixes and suffixes. For example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be the original string s with the last character removed. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is the original string with the first character removed.\n\nWait, but in the input, for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So for example, when n is 5, there are 2*5-2 = 8 strings. For lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, each has two entries.\n\nBut how can I figure out which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nAn idea: The correct string s must have all the prefixes and suffixes provided. So, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be a prefix of s, and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be a suffix of s. But since there are two strings of length n-1, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nWait, but the actual s has exactly one prefix of each length (from 1 to n-1), and similarly for suffixes. So for the input, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings. One is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l.\n\nSo, for example, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1].\n\nSo, if I can find the correct s, then I can check for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of s. But how do I find s?\n\nBut since the input is given as all the prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the correct s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap in such a way that their combination gives s.\n\nWait, suppose the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S. Then, the original string s must be P + last character. But also, the last character must be the first character of the suffix S. Or maybe not? Let me think:\n\nIf the longest prefix is of length n-1, then s is that prefix plus one character. Similarly, the longest suffix is of length n-1, so s is that suffix plus one character at the beginning. So the original s must be equal to the longest prefix (of length n-1) plus a character, and also equal to a character plus the longest suffix (of length n-1). Therefore, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must overlap in some way.\n\nFor example, suppose the longest prefix is \"abab\" (length 4) and the longest suffix is \"baba\" (length 4). Then the original string s must be \"ababa\" (since the prefix is \"abab\" and adding 'a' gives the full string, and the suffix is \"baba\", which is the last four characters of \"ababa\").\n\nSo, the way to find s would be to take the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1), and find their overlap. But since there are two strings of length n-1, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So, perhaps we can try all possible combinations of the two strings of length n-1, and check if they can form a valid s.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think. For each pair of strings of length n-1, one is the prefix (let's call it p) and the other is the suffix (call it s). Then, the original string would be p + c, where c is the last character. But also, the original string must end with s, so the first character of s must be the same as the last character of p. Because the original string is p + c, and the suffix s is the last n-1 characters, which would be p[1:] + c. So, s should be equal to p[1:] + c. But since p is the prefix of length n-1, the original string is p + c. Therefore, the suffix of length n-1 is p[1:] + c. Which must equal the given s (the suffix string).\n\nBut since s is the suffix of length n-1, which is the original string's last n-1 characters. So, the original string is p + c, and the suffix is (p + c)[1:] = p[1:] + c. So the suffix string (given) must be equal to p[1:] + c. However, since the suffix string is of length n-1, and p is of length n-1, then p[1:] is length n-2, and adding c makes it n-1. So that's correct.\n\nBut how do I find c? Well, c is the last character of the original string. Also, the suffix string (s) is p[1:] + c. Therefore, the last character of the suffix string is c. So c is the last character of the suffix string. But also, the original string is p + c, which implies that the last character is c. So, the suffix string's last character is c, and the original string ends with that.\n\nBut also, the original string's suffix of length n-1 is s, which is the given suffix string. So, the original string is p + c, and the suffix is p[1:] + c. Therefore, the suffix string must be equal to p[1:] + c. But since the suffix string is given, we can check if that holds.\n\nSo, here's the idea: For each possible pair of the two strings of length n-1 (since there are exactly two such strings), we can assume one is the prefix (p) and the other is the suffix (s). Then, compute the original string as p + (last character of s). Then, check if the suffix of length n-1 of this candidate string is equal to s. If so, then this candidate string is a possible s.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate s, we can then check all the input strings to see which are prefixes and which are suffixes of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to find which pair of the two length n-1 strings is the correct prefix and suffix?\n\nLet me take the example given in the problem. For the first example, input is:\n\nn=5\n\nThe input strings include:\n\nba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba.\n\nThe two strings of length 4 (n-1=4) are abab and baba. Let's try assuming that one is the prefix and the other is the suffix.\n\nCase 1: p = abab (prefix of length 4), s = baba (suffix of length 4). Then, the original string would be abab + last character of s (which is a). So the candidate s is ababa. Now, check if the suffix of length 4 of this string is baba. The string is ababa. The suffix of length 4 is 'baba', which matches. So this is valid. Thus, the original string is ababa.\n\nCase 2: p = baba, s = abab. Then the original string would be baba + last character of s (abab ends with b). So the candidate is baba + b = babab. Check if the suffix of length 4 is abab. The suffix of length 4 is abab. Yes. So that's also valid. Wait, but then there are two possible candidates? But according to the note, the only string possible is ababa. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, let me check the example. The note says that the only string possible is ababa. So why does this case give another candidate?\n\nWait, in the first case, the candidate is ababa. In the second case, the candidate is babab. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, meaning that there exists at least one s. However, perhaps for the input given, there are multiple possible s's. But the problem says that Ivan will accept any answer that is consistent with at least one possible s.\n\nSo in this case, if there are two possible s's (ababa and babab), then for each of them, we can generate the correct assignments.\n\nBut why does the note say that the only possible string is ababa? Maybe because the input is such that only one of the possibilities is valid.\n\nWait, perhaps the input includes other prefixes and suffixes that would not match the other candidate. For example, in the first example input, the input includes the string 'a' (length 1). For the candidate s being babab, the prefixes of length 1 is 'b', and the suffixes of length 1 is 'b'. But the input includes two 'a's of length 1. So that would not be possible. Hence, the candidate s must be ababa, not babab.\n\nAh! So my initial approach is incomplete. Because even though the two length n-1 strings may form a possible candidate, other strings in the input must be prefixes and suffixes of the candidate s.\n\nSo the process is:\n\n1. Find all possible candidate strings s that can be formed by considering the two length n-1 strings as prefix and suffix, and then checking if all other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut how do I do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For each possible candidate s generated from the two length n-1 strings, check if all the input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s. If so, then this candidate is valid.\n\nOnce I find such a candidate, I can assign each input string as P or S based on whether it is a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut how do I generate the candidate s?\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n- Collect all the input strings. Let's call them list_str.\n\n- Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates_p and candidates_s. For example, in the first example, they are abab and baba.\n\n- For each possible combination (assuming one is prefix, the other is suffix):\n\n   - Take the first string as the prefix (p) of length n-1. The candidate s would be p + (last character of the suffix string). Wait, no. Wait, when we assume that the suffix string is s (the suffix of length n-1), then the original string is p + c, where c is the last character of s. Because the suffix of length n-1 is s, which is the last n-1 characters of the original string. So the original string is (p) + (c), and the suffix is (p[1:] + c) which must equal the suffix string. But the suffix string is of length n-1, and the suffix is p[1:] + c, which is length (n-1 -1) +1 = n-1. So yes. But how do we get c? Because the suffix string is s_suffix, which is p[1:] + c. Therefore, c is the last character of s_suffix. So the original string is p + last_char_of_s_suffix.\n\nSo for the first case, when p is abab (length 4) and s_suffix is baba (length 4), then the original string is abab + a (since the last character of baba is a) → ababa. Then, we check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of this s.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case, when p is baba and s_suffix is abab. Then the original string would be baba + b (the last character of abab is b) → babab. Then check if all input strings are prefixes or suffixes of this string.\n\nIn the first example, the input includes two 'a's of length 1. Let's see for the candidate s = ababa:\n\nprefixes of length 1: 'a'.\n\nsuffixes of length 1: 'a'.\n\nSo the input has two 'a's, which are both prefixes and suffixes. That's okay.\n\nBut for the candidate s = babab:\n\nprefixes of length 1: 'b'.\n\nsuffixes of length 1: 'b'.\n\nBut the input includes two 'a's of length 1. So that's impossible. Hence, this candidate is invalid. Therefore, the only valid candidate is ababa.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nFor each possible combination of the two length n-1 strings (as prefix and suffix), generate a candidate s. Then check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. If yes, then proceed to assign P/S accordingly.\n\nOnce a valid candidate is found, we can generate the answer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find all the input strings.\n\n- For each pair of the two length n-1 strings (since there are exactly two of them), consider one as prefix and the other as suffix, generate the candidate s as per the above logic.\n\n- For each candidate s, check if all input strings are either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nOnce a valid candidate is found, then proceed to assign P/S.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of s?\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with the string) or a suffix of s (s ends with the string). But since the input strings are all the prefixes and suffixes of s, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. So for each input string, it must be one of the two.\n\nSo once a candidate s is generated, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. If all are, then this is a valid candidate.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate, we can proceed to assign the P/S.\n\nNow, the problem is that there may be multiple candidates. But since the problem allows any valid answer, we can pick the first valid candidate we find.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called inputs.\n\nThen, collect all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them. Let's call them len_n_minus_1 = [s1, s2].\n\nFor each possible combination (s1 as prefix, s2 as suffix) and (s2 as prefix, s1 as suffix):\n\n   generate candidate s_candidate.\n\n   For example:\n\n   case 1: prefix is s1 (length n-1), suffix is s2 (length n-1). Then, the candidate s_candidate is s1 + (last character of s2).\n\n   case 2: prefix is s2, suffix is s1. Then s_candidate is s2 + (last character of s1).\n\n   Then, check if this s_candidate is valid. How?\n\n   For each input string in inputs:\n\n      check if it is a prefix of s_candidate or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\n   If all are, then this s_candidate is valid.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, then we can proceed to assign P/S.\n\nOnce we have the s_candidate, for each input string, we check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, then it can be marked as P. But wait, there could be multiple possibilities. For example, a string could be both a prefix and a suffix. However, the problem says that the input contains exactly two strings of each length. For example, for length l, there's one prefix and one suffix. So for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. But how to decide which is which?\n\nBut the problem allows any assignment as long as there exists at least one s that is consistent with the assignment. So for example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix of s_candidate, we can assign it as P or S, as long as the counts are correct.\n\nBut how to assign the P/S for each input string?\n\nThe problem requires that the number of P's equals the number of S's, which is exactly n-1 each (since there are 2n-2 strings total, half P and half S). So for each input string, we need to assign P or S such that for each length l (from 1 to n-1), exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nOnce we have the correct s_candidate, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, then it can be assigned as P. However, for each length l, there are exactly two strings. One is the prefix of length l, the other is the suffix of length l.\n\nSo for each input string, if it is a prefix of s_candidate, then it must be assigned as P, and the other string of the same length must be assigned as S. But how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix?\n\nFor example, in the second sample input, n=3, the input is a, aa, aa, a. The correct s is aaa. Then for length 1, the two strings are a and a. Both are prefixes and suffixes. So for each of them, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nAn approach:\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, then it's a possible P. But for each length l, there are exactly two strings. So for each l, we need to select one of them as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nMaybe for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, mark it as P. Otherwise, mark as S. However, this may not work if a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of the string \"aaa\", the string \"a\" is both a prefix and a suffix. So for the two \"a\" strings, one must be P and the other S.\n\nBut how to ensure that for each length l, exactly one is P and one is S?\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, then assign it as P. Else, assign as S. However, this may not work if there are multiple strings that are prefixes or suffixes.\n\nBut since the input is guaranteed to be valid, for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Wait, no. Because for example, in the case where the string is \"aaa\", for length 2, the two strings are \"aa\" and \"aa\". Both are prefixes and suffixes. So for each of them, they are both prefixes and suffixes. So for each of them, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code? Because for each length l, there are two strings, and exactly one of them must be P and the other S. But how to choose which is which?\n\nBut the problem allows any assignment that is valid. So for each length l, we can choose any of the two strings to be P and the other S, as long as the overall counts are correct.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nPerhaps, for each input string, if it is a prefix, we can assign it as P. But for those that are both prefix and suffix, we need to make sure that exactly one is chosen as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to track this?\n\nAlternatively, for each length l, we can collect the two strings. For each pair, we can check which one is the actual prefix (of length l) and which is the suffix. Then assign accordingly.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, for the correct s_candidate, for each length l, there is exactly one prefix (the first l characters) and exactly one suffix (the last l characters). So for each l, among the two strings of that length, exactly one is the prefix (so must be assigned as P) and the other is the suffix (assigned as S).\n\nSo for each l, the two strings in the input are:\n\none is the prefix of length l (s_candidate[0:l]), and the other is the suffix of length l (s_candidate[-l:]).\n\nTherefore, for each input string, if it equals the prefix of length l, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nThis seems like a solid approach.\n\nSo, for each input string, we can determine its length l. Then, check if it equals the prefix of length l of s_candidate. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nThis will ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is assigned as P (the actual prefix) and the other as S (the actual suffix).\n\nYes! Because for each l, the two input strings are the prefix and the suffix of s_candidate. So for each input string, if it's the prefix, then it's assigned as P. Otherwise, as S.\n\nThis approach will work regardless of whether the string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of s_candidate = 'aaa', for l=1, the prefix and suffix are both 'a'. So the two input strings are both 'a'. For each of them, when we check if it equals the prefix of length l (which is 'a'), it will be true. However, since there are two strings, how do we decide which one is P and which is S?\n\nBut in this case, the code would assign both as P, which would be incorrect. But this is a problem.\n\nWait, no. Because in the input, for each length l, there are exactly two strings. However, in the case where both are the same as the prefix and suffix, how can we distinguish?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid. So for each l, the two strings are the prefix and suffix. So for example, in the case of 'aaa', the two strings of length 1 are both 'a', which is the prefix and suffix. So the code would have to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how can we do that? Because when checking for each input string, if it's the prefix, assign P. But since both are the same as the prefix, they will both be considered as P. Which would lead to two P's for that length, which is invalid.\n\nSo this approach would not work in this case.\n\nHmm. So what's the problem here?\n\nThe problem is that when the two input strings for a certain length l are the same (like 'a' and 'a'), and they are both the prefix and suffix of s_candidate. So, for each of them, checking if they are equal to the prefix of length l (which they are) would lead to both being marked as P, but we need exactly one P and one S.\n\nSo how to resolve this?\n\nIn this case, we need to assign one of them as P and the other as S. But how?\n\nThe solution is that for each pair of strings of the same length, we need to assign exactly one as P and the other as S. So for each length l, we can collect the two strings, and for each, check if it's the prefix. If one of them is the prefix, assign that as P, and the other as S. But if both are the same as the prefix (and thus also the suffix), then we can assign one as P and the other as S arbitrarily.\n\nSo, for each length l, we can do the following:\n\nCollect the two strings of length l. Let's call them s1 and s2.\n\nCheck if s1 is equal to the prefix of length l. If yes, assign it as P, and the other as S.\n\nIf s1 is not equal to the prefix, then assign s2 as P and s1 as S.\n\nBut if both are equal to the prefix (and hence also to the suffix), then we can choose either one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, in code, for each input string, we can group them by their length. For each group of two strings of the same length l, we check which one is the prefix. Then assign accordingly.\n\nSo, the code steps after finding s_candidate:\n\n- For each input string, group them by their length. For example, create a dictionary where keys are lengths, and values are lists of the two strings of that length.\n\n- For each length l in 1..n-1:\n\n   - get the two strings, s_a and s_b.\n\n   - the correct prefix is s_candidate[0:l], and the correct suffix is s_candidate[-l:].\n\n   - check if s_a is equal to the prefix. If yes, then assign P to s_a and S to s_b.\n\n   - else, assign P to s_b and S to s_a.\n\nBut how to map this back to the original input order?\n\nBecause the original input is given in some order, and we need to output a string where the i-th character corresponds to the i-th input string.\n\nSo, for example, for each input string, we need to determine if it is the prefix of length l (for its length) or not. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThe approach is:\n\nOnce s_candidate is determined, for each input string, determine its length l. Then compare it to the prefix of length l. If it matches, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut in cases where both input strings of a certain length are the same as the prefix (and hence also the suffix), this approach would assign both as P, which is invalid.\n\nSo, how to avoid that?\n\nWe need to make sure that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, perhaps, for each length l, we can check which of the two input strings is the prefix. But how?\n\nBecause for the correct s_candidate, exactly one of the two input strings is the prefix of length l. However, in the case where the two input strings are the same as the prefix and suffix (which are the same), then both are the prefix and suffix. But how can that happen?\n\nBecause for s_candidate, the prefix of length l is the same as the suffix of length l. For example, in the case of s_candidate = 'aaa', for l=1, the prefix is 'a' and the suffix is 'a'. So the two input strings are both 'a', and thus both are the prefix and suffix. But since the input has exactly two strings of each length, which are the prefix and the suffix, but in this case, they are the same. So for this case, the code must assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to detect that in code?\n\nThe problem is that for the two input strings of length l, both are equal to the prefix (and suffix) of length l. Therefore, when checking each string against the prefix, they both match. So the code would assign both as P, which is wrong.\n\nTo handle this, perhaps for each length l, we can check which of the two input strings is the prefix. But how?\n\nWell, the prefix of length l is s_candidate[0:l]. The suffix is s_candidate[-l:]. For the case where the two input strings are the same, we can choose one to be P and the other to be S. For example, the first occurrence in the input is assigned as P, the other as S. But how to do that in code?\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFor each length l, collect the two input strings. Let's say they are s1 and s2.\n\nIf s1 == prefix of l and s2 == prefix of l:\n\n   assign s1 as P and s2 as S (or vice versa)\n\nElse:\n\n   if s1 == prefix of l: assign P to s1, else assign P to s2.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nSo, for each input string, we need to know, for its length l, whether it is the prefix or not. However, when both are the same as the prefix, we need to choose one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, for each length l, we can check the two input strings. If they are both equal to the prefix, then we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to track which one is which in the original input list.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose for a certain l, the two input strings are s1 and s2, both equal to the prefix. How do I know which one to assign as P and which as S?\n\nIn this case, the code can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S. Or vice versa. Since the problem allows any valid assignment, it doesn't matter as long as one is P and the other is S.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nOnce we have the s_candidate, for each input string, we can:\n\n- group the input strings by their length.\n\n- for each group (for a particular l), check which of the two strings is the prefix (if any). If both are the prefix, then assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do this for the input list?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, then assign P. However, for each length l, we need to make sure that exactly one of the two strings is assigned as P.\n\nSo, during this process, for each length l, we can count how many of the two strings are assigned as P. If both are assigned as P, then we need to change one to S.\n\nBut how to track this?\n\nThis seems complex. Perhaps, instead of trying to assign based on whether it is a prefix, we can for each length l, find which of the two input strings is the prefix, and which is the suffix.\n\nFor example, for each l:\n\nprefix_l = s_candidate[0:l]\n\nsuffix_l = s_candidate[-l:]\n\nNow, among the two input strings of length l, one must be prefix_l and the other must be suffix_l.\n\nSo, for the two input strings, check which one is equal to prefix_l. That is the prefix, and the other is the suffix.\n\nBut if both are equal to prefix_l (and thus also to suffix_l), then we can assign one as prefix and the other as suffix.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nFor each length l:\n\n   get the two strings s_a and s_b.\n\n   if s_a == prefix_l:\n\n       assign s_a as P, s_b as S.\n\n   elif s_b == prefix_l:\n\n       assign s_b as P, s_a as S.\n\n   else:\n\n       # this can't happen because the input is guaranteed to be valid.\n\nSo, this approach would work. Because in the case where both s_a and s_b are equal to prefix_l (which is same as suffix_l), then the first condition (s_a == prefix_l) is true, and we assign s_a as P and s_b as S.\n\nBut how to find s_a and s_b for each input string?\n\nThe problem is that the input strings are given in arbitrary order. So, for each input string, we need to know which other string of the same length is paired with it.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can process the input strings by grouping them by length. For example, create a dictionary where for each length l, we have a list of the two strings of that length.\n\nOnce we have that, for each l, we can process the two strings and assign their P/S.\n\nBut then, how to map this back to the original input order?\n\nBecause the output needs to be in the order of the input strings.\n\nSo, for example, the original input list is [s_0, s_1, ..., s_{2n-3}].\n\nWe need to create a list of 'P' or 'S' for each of these, in order.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nOnce s_candidate is determined, for each input string in the original order, determine whether it is the prefix of its length or not. However, this requires knowing, for each string, whether it is the prefix of its length.\n\nBut how to do that, given that for some lengths, the two input strings are the same as the prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, for each input string, we can:\n\nCheck its length l.\n\nCheck if it is equal to the prefix of l (s_candidate[0:l]).\n\nIf yes, then assign P.\n\nElse, assign S.\n\nBut in the case where both input strings of length l are equal to the prefix, this would assign both as P, which is invalid.\n\nSo, the problem is that this approach may assign both as P, but we need exactly one P and one S.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: For each length l, collect the two input strings, and for each of them, determine if they are the prefix or the suffix. Then, assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, for a given l, the two input strings are s1 and s2. We can check if s1 is the prefix (s_candidate[0:l]). If yes, then s1 is P, s2 is S. Else, check if s1 is the suffix (s_candidate[-l:]). If yes, then s1 is S, s2 is P. But this may not work if both are the same as prefix and suffix.\n\nBut in that case, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, the code can be:\n\nfor each l in 1..n-1:\n\n   prefix_l = s_candidate[0:l]\n\n   suffix_l = s_candidate[-l:]\n\n   for the two input strings of length l, say s_a and s_b:\n\n       if s_a == prefix_l:\n\n           assign s_a as P, s_b as S\n\n       elif s_a == suffix_l:\n\n           assign s_a as S, s_b as P\n\n       else:\n\n           # this can't happen, since the input is valid\n\nBut again, if s_a is both prefix and suffix (i.e., prefix_l == suffix_l), and s_a == prefix_l, then assign s_a as P and s_b as S.\n\nBut this would work even if s_b is also the same as prefix_l and suffix_l. Because in this case, s_a is assigned as P, and s_b as S.\n\nBut how to find s_a and s_b for each input string?\n\nThe problem is that for each input string, we need to know which other string of the same length it is paired with.\n\nSo, the code needs to group the input strings by their length, and for each group, process the two strings.\n\nOnce this is done, for each input string, we can determine whether it is the prefix or suffix for its length, and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to map this back to the original input order?\n\nFor example, suppose the input strings are:\n\ninput_order = [s0, s1, s2, s3, ...]\n\nFor each s_i, we need to know its length l, and which of the two strings in that group it is (s_a or s_b).\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nAfter determining s_candidate, for each length l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   collect the two strings of length l from the input list.\n\n   for example, group = [s_a, s_b]\n\n   then, for each of these two strings, determine whether it is the prefix or suffix.\n\nOnce this is done, for each string in the group, we can assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to track which strings in the input_order belong to which group?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose the input_order is [a, a, aa, aa, ...] for n=3. The group for length 1 is [a, a], and for length 2 is [aa, aa].\n\nOnce we process the groups, for each string in the group, we can assign P/S.\n\nBut how to map this back to the original input_order?\n\nThe code can create a list of assignments, initially empty. Then, for each group, process the two strings, and for each string, find its index in the input_order, and assign the corresponding 'P' or 'S' to that index.\n\nBut this requires for each string in the group, to know its position in the input_order.\n\nSo, perhaps during processing, for each group of strings of length l, we can iterate through the input_order and for each string, check if it belongs to the group. But this could be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial processing, we can create a dictionary that maps each string to a list of indices where it appears. But this may not be feasible due to possible duplicates.\n\nAnother approach: during the initial processing, group the input strings by their length. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the length, and the value is a list of the indices in the input_order where strings of that length appear.\n\nFor example:\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor idx, s in enumerate(input_order):\n\n    groups[len(s)].append(idx)\n\nThen, for each length l in groups:\n\n   indices = groups[l]\n\n   strings = [input_order[i] for i in indices]\n\n   process these two strings",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`.

For each pair of these longest strings, we generate potential candidates for `s` and check their validity.\n2. **Validation of Candidate String**: Once a candidate string `s` is generated, we validate it by ensuring all given input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n3. **Determine Prefix/Suffix Assignments**: After validating the candidate string `s`, we determine for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix of `s` and assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    inputs = []\n    for _ in range(2 * n - 2):\n        inputs.append(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = []\n    for s in inputs:\n        if len(s) == n - 1:\n            len_n_minus_1.append(s)\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for the two length n-1 strings\n    for i in range(2):\n        # First candidate: len_n_minus_1[0] is prefix, len_n_minus_1[1] is suffix\n        # Or vice versa\n        if i == 0:\n            prefix_candidate = len_n_minus_1[0]\n            suffix_candidate = len_n_minus_1[1]\n        else:\n            prefix_candidate = len_n_minus_1[1]\n            suffix_candidate = len_n_minus_1[0]\n        \n        # Generate the possible s_candidate\n        last_char = suffix_candidate[-1]\n        s_candidate = prefix_candidate + last_char\n        \n        # Check if this s_candidate is valid\n        valid = True\n        for s in inputs:\n            l = len(s)\n            if s != s_candidate[:l] and s != s_candidate[-l:]:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            continue\n        \n        # Now, process the inputs to assign P/S\n        result = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n        # Group inputs by length\n        groups = defaultdict(list)\n        for idx, s in enumerate(inputs):\n            groups[len(s)].append(idx)\n        \n        # For each length l from 1 to n-1\n        for l in range(1, n):\n            indices = groups[l]\n            # Get the two strings of this length\n            s1 = inputs[indices[0]]\n            s2 = inputs[indices[1]]\n            prefix_l = s_candidate[:l]\n            suffix_l = s_candidate[-l:]\n            \n            # Determine which one is the prefix\n            if s1 == prefix_l:\n                result[indices[0]] = 'P'\n                result[indices[1]] = 'S'\n            elif s2 == prefix_l:\n                result[indices[1]] = 'P'\n                result[indices[0]] = 'S'\n            else:\n                # Both are suffix?
