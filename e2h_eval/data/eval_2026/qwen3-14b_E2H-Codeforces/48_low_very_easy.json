He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a, b (or R), and a number c in base a. My task is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals when needed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps.\n\nStep 1: Parse the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. The second line is the number c in base a.\n\nSo for each test case, I need to:\n\n- Convert c from base a to decimal (base 10).\n- Then convert that decimal number to base b, which could be a normal base (like 2, 16) or Roman numerals.\n\nBut how do I handle the conversion from base a to decimal? Well, the input c is a string. For example, if a is 10, then c is a normal decimal string. But if a is 16, then c could have letters like A-F (but according to the note, in bases greater than 10, letters are used, like A for 10, B for 11, etc.)\n\nWait, the problem says: \"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15.\" So when converting from base a to decimal, the input c can be up to 10^15 in decimal. But since the input length is up to 10^3, we need to process it correctly.\n\nSo first, I need to convert the input string c (in base a) to a decimal integer.\n\nBut how to handle letters in c? For example, if a is 12, then the digits can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). So the input c may contain letters, but the problem says that for cases involving Roman numerals, the number is not zero and less than or equal to 3000 in decimal. But for other cases, the number can be up to 1e15.\n\nSo, the first step is to parse c as a number in base a. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nFor example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, then that's 10 in decimal. So, for each character in c, I need to convert it to its corresponding value. For digits, they are 0-9. For letters, they are A, B, etc., representing 10, 11, etc. But the input c can have uppercase letters? Well, the problem says that the input is given as a string. Let me check the sample inputs.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nIn the example, one of the inputs is '16 R\\n5'. So the input c is '5', which is in base 16. That would be 5 in decimal. Then converted to Roman numerals, which is V. Which matches the output.\n\nAnother sample input is '5 R\\n4'. So the input c is 4 in base 5. Which is 4 in decimal. Then converted to Roman numerals is IV.\n\nAnother sample input is '2 2\\n1111001'. So the input c is 1111001 in base 2. Let's compute that: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converting to base 2 again would be 1111001, which is the output. So the code needs to handle leading zeros correctly, but output must omit them.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Convert the input c (base a) to a decimal integer.\n\n2. Then, depending on whether the target base is 'R' or a number, convert that decimal to the target base.\n\nNow, let's think about how to convert from base a to decimal.\n\nImplementing a function that takes a string s and a base a, and returns the decimal value. But since the input can be up to 10^3 digits long, and a can be up to 25, we need to handle large numbers. However, Python's integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's manageable.\n\nFor example, for each character in s:\n\n- If it's a digit, its value is int(c).\n\n- Else, it's a letter, which is ord(c) - ord('A') + 10. But wait, the problem says that in bases greater than",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, where `b` could be a Roman numeral system. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from base `a` to decimal (base 10), and then converting that decimal number to the target base `b`, which might be a Roman numeral.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a`. We need to convert this number to a decimal (base 10) integer. This involves parsing each digit of the input string and computing its value in base 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: After converting the input number to decimal, we handle two cases:\n   - If the target base `b` is a numerical base (2-25), convert the decimal number to that base using standard base conversion techniques.\n   - If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a specific mapping and rules for Roman numeral formation.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            digit = int(c)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef from_decimal(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while num >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            num -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(inputs), 2):\n        line1 = inputs[i]\n        line2 = inputs[i+1]\n        a_str, b_str = line1.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        c = line2\n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n        # Now convert to base b or roman\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            b = int(b_str)\n            result = from_decimal(decimal_value, b)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **to_decimal Function**: Converts a string representation of a number in base `a` to a decimal integer. Each character in the string is processed to determine its value in base 10.\n2. **from_decimal Function**: Converts a decimal number to a specified base `b`, handling bases greater than 10 by using letters A-Z for values 10 and above.\n3. **decimal_to_roman Function**: Converts a decimal number to a Roman numeral using a list of value-symbol pairs, applying subtractive notation where necessary.\n4. **main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case by converting the input number to decimal and then to the target base or Roman numeral, ensuring correct formatting and handling of edge cases like leading zeros and Roman numeral rules.",
