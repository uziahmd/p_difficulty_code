    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo for a given m, we need to find all n's where this count equals m. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5!, the count is 1 (5/5=1). For 6!, same as 5! multiplied by 6, which adds no 5s. So the count remains 1. Similarly up to 9. But when you get to 10, you add another 5 (from 10), so the count becomes 2.\n\nSo the key is to find the range of n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how do we find those n's?\n\nThe problem is that for some m, there might be no n's. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, let's see. Let's compute for n=24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0. Total 4. For 25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 25 and 24, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So m=5 would have no solution. Hence, the output would be 0.\n\nSo the approach is: for a given m, find all n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nFirst, we need to find the possible n's that could lead to exactly m zeros. Let's think about how the count increases. The count increases as n increases, but sometimes multiple n's can have the same count. For example, when n increases from 5 to 9, the count remains 1. So for each m, there's a range of n's that produce it.\n\nBut how to find that range?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros. For a given m, we need to find all n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut since f(n) is non-decreasing, once it passes m, it can't come back. So for each m, there can be either 0, 1, or 5 numbers (like in the sample) that satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but why 5? Because when you hit a multiple of 5, you add one, but when you hit a multiple of 25, you add two, etc. So for example, when you have a number like 25, the count jumps by two. So for m values between the previous count and the new count, there might be gaps.\n\nSo the approach is to find the lower and upper bounds of n where f(n) equals m. But how?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if that n's count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the maximum n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers between min_n and max_n (inclusive) are the solutions.\n\nWait, but how to find the min and max n for a given m?\n\nLet me think. Let's first find the smallest n such that f(n) = m. Then find the largest n such that f(n) = m. The numbers between them would be the possible answers.\n\nBut how to find these numbers?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's must lie between certain ranges. Let's think of the following:\n\nWe can find the lower bound of n where f(n) = m. Let's say that the lower bound is the first n where f(n) = m, and the upper bound is the last n where f(n) = m. The count of numbers between them is upper - lower + 1.\n\nBut how to find these bounds?\n\nLet me think of using binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) equals m. If not, then there is no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) equals m. Similarly, find the maximum n where f(n) equals m.\n\nWait, perhaps the following approach:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n such that f(n) = m. Then the answer is all numbers between min_n and max_n inclusive. The count would be max_n - min_n + 1.\n\nBut how to find those min and max?\n\nAlternatively, for the minimal n where f(n) = m, we can use binary search. Let me think. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, for each m, the minimal n such that f(n) >= m can be found via binary search. Then, if f(n) is greater than m, then there is no solution. Otherwise, we need to find the first occurrence of m.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose I want to find the first n where f(n) equals m. Let me think of the following steps:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Let's call this low. Then check if f(low) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. If yes, then find the minimal n where f(n) equals m. Then find the maximal n where f(n) equals m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother way: For example, the number of trailing zeros for n is m. So, the minimal n for which this is true is the first occurrence, and the maximal is the last occurrence. For example, in the sample, m=1, the first occurrence is 5, the last is 9. So the numbers are 5-9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is to find the first and last occurrence of m in the f(n) sequence.\n\nSo how to find the first occurrence?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, to find the first occurrence of m, we can perform a binary search on the possible n's. Let me think of the possible range of n. For m, the maximum possible n is 5*m. Because, for example, for m=1, the maximum n is 9, which is less than 5*1=5? No. Wait that's not correct. Wait, for m=1, 5*1=5. But 5 is the first occurrence. But 9 is larger than 5. So perhaps the upper bound for binary search needs to be higher.\n\nWait, the number of trailing zeros for n is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + ... which is less than n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... which is a geometric series with ratio 1/5. Sum is n/5 * 1/(1-1/5) ) = n/4. So the number of trailing zeros is less than n/4. Therefore, for a given m, the n must be at least 4*m. But wait, that's an upper bound for n. Wait, if the number of trailing zeros is m, then n must be at least 5*m? Or maybe not. Let's see. For example, m=1, the n is 5. Which is 5*1. For m=2, n=10. But 10/5 is 2, so that's 2. But 10 is 5*2. So maybe the minimal n is around 5*m. But for cases where there's a multiple of 25, like m=5. Let's see. For n=24, the count is 4+0=4. For n=25, it's 5+1=6. So for m=5, there is no n. So the binary search would have to find that.\n\nSo for the binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. Because for m, the number of trailing zeros for 5*m is at least m. Because 5*m divided by 5 is m, and higher terms contribute more. So 5*m is a safe upper bound for the binary search. But perhaps even 5*m is not enough. Wait, for example, if m is 1, then 5*1=5, which is the minimal n. For m=2, 5*2=10, which is the minimal n. For m=6, 5*6=30. Let's check: 30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7. Oh, so that's higher than m=6. So perhaps the upper bound should be higher. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the upper bound can be 5*(m+1). Because for m, the minimal n can be up to 5*(m+1). But I'm not sure. Maybe we can use a higher upper bound. Let's think of the maximum possible n that can have m trailing zeros. For example, the maximum n would be 5*m + 4. Because, for example, m=1, 5*1 +4=9, which is the maximum n for that m. So perhaps the upper bound can be set as 5*m + 5, or something like that.\n\nBut regardless, for binary search, we can set the upper bound as 5*m. However, in cases where the actual n is larger than that, the binary search may not find it. So perhaps a better upper bound is needed. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a loop to find an upper bound. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of trailing zeros for n is m, then n must be between 5*m and 5*m + 4. Wait, but earlier example shows that for m=6, the n could be 25. Let's check:\n\nn=25: trailing zeros is 6. So m=6. Then 5*m=30. So 25 is less than 30. So that's not correct. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the upper bound for binary search should be something like 5*m. But in that case, for m=6, 5*6=30. The trailing zeros for 30 is 7 (30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). So that's higher than m=6. So the upper bound for binary search needs to be higher than 5*m. So perhaps the upper bound can be 5*m + 5, or some other value. Alternatively, we can use a dynamic upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the upper bound by starting from 1 and doubling until we find a number where the trailing zeros count is >= m. That way, we can find a suitable upper bound for binary search.\n\nBut perhaps for the purposes of code, it's easier to use a high upper bound. Let's think: the maximum possible m is 1e5. Let's see, for m=1e5, the minimal n is around 5*1e5=500000. But for that n, the count is floor(500000/5) + ... which is 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + ... which is definitely more than m. So perhaps the upper bound can be 5*m. But then again, for m=6, 5*m=30. The count for 25 is 6. So 25 is less than 30. So perhaps the upper bound can be 5*m. But how to find the correct n?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the binary search can be done between 0 and 5*m. Let's see. For m=6, the correct n is 25. So 5*m is 30. So 25 is within that range. So in that case, the binary search can find it. Let's think of how the binary search works.\n\nSo for example, to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. How can we find that?\n\nAlternatively, we can find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is the first occurrence.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Let me think. Suppose that we find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call that value low. Then, if f(low) is equal to m, then low is the minimal n. Otherwise, there's no solution.\n\nSimilarly, to find the maximum n where f(n) = m, we can find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Then subtract 1. Because the maximum n where f(n) = m is the number before the first occurrence of m+1.\n\nSo for example, for m=1:\n\nfind the first n where f(n) >=1. That is 5. Check if f(5)=1. Yes. Then find the first n where f(n)>=2. That is 10. So the maximum n is 10-1=9. So the range is 5 to 9, which includes 5 numbers.\n\nThis seems like a solid approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_low such that f(n_low) >= m. If f(n_low) != m, then there are no solutions. Return 0.\n\n2. Else, find the minimal n_high such that f(n_high) >= m+1. The maximum n is n_high - 1.\n\nThen the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the solutions. The count is (n_high -1 - n_low +1) = n_high - n_low.\n\nSo the number of solutions is (n_high - n_low).\n\nBut how to compute n_low and n_high?\n\nTo compute n_low, we can perform a binary search for the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nSimilarly for n_high, binary search for minimal n where f(n) >= m+1.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to implementing the binary search and the function f(n).\n\nNow, the next step is to implement the function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nImplementing f(n) is straightforward: sum n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the division is zero.\n\nNow, the binary search part. Let's think about how to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search can be done between low=0 and high=5*m (as discussed earlier). But for some m, 5*m may not be sufficient. Wait, but for example, when m=6, 5*m=30. The first n where f(n) >=6 is 25. Because f(25)=6. So the binary search between 0 and 5*m would find that.\n\nBut what if m is very large? Let's say m=1e5. Then 5*m is 5e5. What is the trailing zeros count for 5e5? Let's calculate:\n\n5e5 /5 = 1e5\n\n5e5/25 = 2e4\n\n5e5/125= 4e3\n\n5e5/625= 800\n\n5e5/3125= 160\n\n5e5/15625= 32\n\n5e5/78125= 6.4 → 6\n\n5e5/390625= 1.28 → 1\n\nTotal is 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124,999. So for m=1e5, the 5*m is 500000, which has a trailing zeros count of 124,999, which is larger than m. So the binary search between 0 and 5*m would work. But for m=1e5, the actual n_low is somewhere between 400000 and 500000. So the binary search would find it.\n\nSo setting the upper bound as 5*m is acceptable.\n\nBut what if m is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nIf m is zero, output 0 (but according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5).\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the minimal n_low where f(n_low) >= m.\n\nCheck if f(n_low) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal n_high where f(n_high) >= m+1.\n\nThe answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high -1, inclusive.\n\nThe count is (n_high -1 -n_low +1) = n_high -n_low.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nImplement a helper function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nImplement a binary search function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nOnce we have that, proceed as above.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, handle the case when m is zero. But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1.\n\nBut in the sample input, there is a case where m=5, and the output is 0. So for example, when m=5, there is no n such that count_zeros(n) =5.\n\nSo the code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, the binary search function:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high =5*target\n\n    ans = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cz >= target:\n\n            ans = mid\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return ans\n\nWait, but for the find_min_n function, the target is the desired count. So for example, to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we get that, we can check if count_zeros(ans) == m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nSo for example, if m=5:\n\nfind_min_n(5) would return the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5. Let's see:\n\nLet's compute for n=24: count_zeros(24) is 4+0=4. For n=25: 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. Hence, there's no solution. So the output is 0.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe numbers are from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nso the list is [n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1]\n\nthe count is n_high -n_low.\n\nBut wait, what if m+1 is such that there is no n for it? For example, if m is very large. But the find_min_n function will return the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Even if that's a very large number.\n\nSo for example, if m is 1, then find_min_n(2) returns 10. So the numbers are 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut what about the edge cases?\n\nLet's test for m=5.\n\nn_low is find_min_n(5) =25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So not equal to 5. So output is 0.\n\nAnother example, m=6. find_min_n(6) is 25, because count_zeros(25)=6. Then find_min_n(7) is 25? No. Let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(26) is 6. ... up to 29. For 30: count_zeros(30) is 7. So find_min_n(7) is 30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5, and the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nSo the code structure:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) !=m: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthen the numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\nso the list is [n_low, n_low+1,...,n_high-1].\n\nthe length is (n_high -1 -n_low +1) = n_high -n_low.\n\nSo the code would output that.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for the binary search function, what if the target is zero? Well, since m starts from 1, the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the find_min_n function.\n\nBut in Python, for m=1e5, the 5*m is 5e5. The binary search would take log2(5e5) steps, which is around 20 steps. Each step involves a count_zeros which is O(log n). So overall, it's efficient.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut first, the code needs to read input. The input is a single integer m.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the sample input, the first case is ['1', '5']? Or perhaps the input is given as a single line. Wait, the original problem says that the input is an integer m. But the sample input shows something like:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for two different test cases. Like, the first input is 1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the code is supposed to read input from stdin and output to stdout. So the code must read a single integer m from input.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is a list of strings, but perhaps that's a mistake. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is ['1', '5'], which is confusing. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the problem says that the code must process a single m. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake. For example, the first sample input is m=1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second sample input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So the code should read a single integer m.\n\nSo the code should read m as input().strip().\n\nBut in the sample input, perhaps the input is given as two separate test cases. However, the problem says that the code should process one m per run.\n\nSo the code will read m from input.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen compute the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz >= target:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return ans\n\nThen:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but the output requires that the first line is k, then the second line is the numbers. For example, in the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut in the code, when we do range(n_low, n_high), that's from n_low to n_high-1, inclusive. So for example, n_low=5, n_high=10. range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, range(n_low, n_high) is [n_low, n_high-1]. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the code, when we print ' '.join(...), for the case where k is zero, but that's already handled in the else clause.\n\nWait, the code first checks if count_zeros(n_low) != m, then outputs 0. Else, proceeds.\n\nBut for example, if m=5, then find_min_n(5) returns 25, and count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5, so output is 0.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(1). Let's see:\n\ntarget is 1. The binary search between 0 and 5*1=5.\n\nLet me simulate the binary search for target=1.\n\nInitially low=0, high=5.\n\nmid=(0+5)//2=2. count_zeros(2) is 0 <1. So low=3.\n\nmid=(3+5)//2=4. count_zeros(4)=0 <1. low=5.\n\nmid=5. count_zeros(5)=1 >=1. ans=5. high=4. Loop ends. So returns 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1, so proceed.\n\nfind_min_n(2). target=2.\n\nhigh=5*2=10.\n\nbinary search for minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nlow=0, high=10.\n\nmid=5. count_zeros(5)=1 <2. low=6.\n\nmid= (6+10)/2=8. count_zeros(8)=1 <2. low=9.\n\nmid= (9+10)/2=9.5 → 9. count_zeros(9)=1 <2. low=10.\n\nmid=10. count_zeros(10)=2 >=2. ans=10. high=9. loop ends. returns 10.\n\nSo n_high=10. So the numbers are from 5 to 9. So k=10-5=5. Output is 5 followed by the numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=5. n_low is find_min_n(5) which returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. n_low is find_min_n(6) → returns 25. count_zeros(25)=6. Then find_min_n(7) returns 30. So the numbers are 25 to 29. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about m=0? According to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when the code prints the numbers, for the case where k is zero, but that is already handled. So the code is okay.\n\nBut in the code, the print statements need to be handled correctly. For example, when k is zero, print 0. Else, print k, then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, the else clause is executed when there are solutions.\n\nBut in the code, for the case when k is zero, the code prints 0. But for the case when there are solutions, the code prints k followed by the numbers.\n\nBut in Python, when you print the numbers, for example, when k is 5, the code would print '5' followed by the numbers. But the code uses print(k) and then print('...').\n\nBut for the first sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code would print:\n\nprint(k) → 5.\n\nThen print(' '.join(...)) → '5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is written as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'] which probably represents two test cases. But the code is supposed to handle one m per run.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So no need to handle.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nBut in the code, for m=1, the code works.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, for the case where n_high is 0? No, because m is at least 1, and find_min_n(m) returns some value.\n\nBut let's think about when m is 1, and find_min_n(1) returns 5. find_min_n(2) returns 10. So n_high is 10. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code for the case when there are solutions is:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for the first case is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the first line is k, the second line is the numbers. But in Python, the print statements will automatically add newlines. So for example, print(k) will print the number followed by a newline, and then print('...') will print the numbers followed by a newline. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is written as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which implies that the first line is 5, then the second line is the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nBut in Python, the code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz >= target:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return ans\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nBut wait, what if the range is empty? For example, if n_high is equal to n_low. Then k is zero. But in that case, how?\n\nBut in that case, the code would have count_zeros(n_low) == m, and n_high is find_min_n(m+1). For example, suppose m=6, and find_min_n(6) returns 25. find_min_n(7) returns 30. So k is 30-25=5. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there is only one n? For example, if m is such that there is exactly one n. For example, m=24. Let's see:\n\nLet me think of n=99. count_zeros(99) is 99//5=19 + 99//25=3 + 99//125=0 → 22. Not 24. Let me think of a case where there is exactly one n. For example, when m=24. Let's find n where count_zeros(n)=24.\n\nLet me think of n=100: count_zeros(100) is 20 + 4 =24. Then n=100, 101, 102, 103, 104. Because for 105, count_zeros(105) is 21 + 4 (105//25=4) + ... ?\n\nWait, 100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0. Total 24.\n\nn=100: 24.\n\nn=101: same as 100. So count_zeros(101)=24.\n\nn=104: same.\n\nn=105: 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25. So for m=24, the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would return 5 numbers. So the code works.\n\nAnother case: when m is 5, the code returns 0.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But the code does not handle that.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, what about m=2?\n\nLet me compute.\n\nn_low is find_min_n(2). The minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=2 is 10. count_zeros(10)=2. So yes.\n\nfind_min_n(3) is 15. So numbers from 10 to 14. Which is 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input. For m=1, the code outputs 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. The code outputs 0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple numbers. For example, m=24, the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If there are such integers, we must also list them in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are generally more factors of 2 than 5 in factorials, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: We use a helper function `count_zeros(n)` to compute the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing up the integer divisions of $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: To efficiently find the smallest $ n $ such that $ n! $ has at least $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps us quickly narrow down the range of possible values for $ n $.\n\n4. **Determine Valid Range**: Once we find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it `n_low`) where the count of trailing zeros is exactly $ m $, we then find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it `n_high`) where the count of trailing zeros is $ m+1 $. The valid values of $ n $ lie between `n_low` and `n_high - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    ans = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz >= target:\n            ans = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return ans\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the results.\n\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least `target`. The search range is from 0 to $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, which is a safe upper bound based on the properties of trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: After reading the input $ m $, we determine the smallest $ n $ (`n_low`) where the trailing zeros count is at least $ m $. If this count is not exactly $ m $, we print 0. Otherwise, we find the smallest $ n $ (`n_high`) where the count is $ m+1 $, and the valid range of $ n $ values is from `n_low` to `n_high - 1`. These values are then printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation using binary search and handles edge cases where no valid $ n $ exists for a given $ m $.",
