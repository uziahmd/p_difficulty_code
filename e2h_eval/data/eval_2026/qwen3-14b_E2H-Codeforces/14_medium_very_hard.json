He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where this count equals m. But how?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there could be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nWait, the key is that the count of trailing zeros increases as n increases. However, when you pass a multiple of 5, the count increases by more than one. For example, when you go from 4! to 5!, the count goes from 0 to 1. Then 25! adds two zeros (since 25 contributes two 5s). So for numbers between certain ranges, the count increases by 1 each step. But when you hit a multiple of higher powers of 5, it jumps more.\n\nBut for a given m, the possible n's that result in exactly m zeros would be consecutive numbers. But how many?\n\nWait, for example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check:\n\nFor 5! = 120 → 1 zero. 6! = 720 → 1. 7! is 5040 → 1. 8! is 40320 → 1. 9! is 362880 → 1. Then 10! is 3628800 → 2 zeros. So for m=1, the numbers are 5-9. So five numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that for some m, there might be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, no. Wait, maybe for some m, there are multiple n's that give exactly m zeros. But how?\n\nThe problem is that when you have a number n where the count of trailing zeros is m, but then adding 1 to n may not increase the count. For example, when n is 5, the count is 1. Then n=6, the count is still 1. So for m=1, there are multiple n's.\n\nBut how do I find the range of n's that give exactly m zeros?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check how many consecutive numbers after that also have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower and upper bounds of n's that would produce exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find if there exists any n for a given m. Because sometimes, there might be no n. For example, if m=5, let's see:\n\nLet me think. Let's compute trailing zeros for some numbers.\n\nFor example, 25! has 6 zeros (25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Because the count jumps from 4 (for 20!) to 6 (for 25!). So for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the problem requires that for some m, there are no n's. So the first thing is to determine whether there exists any n that gives exactly m zeros. If not, output 0. Otherwise, find all such n's.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is >= m. Then check if that number is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of n's where the count is exactly m.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think. For example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5. Then the count is 1. The next numbers (up to 9) will have the same count. Then at 10, the count increases to 2. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are the ones with exactly 1 zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find the range of n's where the count is exactly m. How can we find that?\n\nThe idea is that for a given m, there's a range of n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think about how the count function behaves. The count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function as n increases. For each n, the count is the sum of floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + ... So for example, when n increases by 1, the count can stay the same or increase by 1 or more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, it increases by 1 (if not a multiple of 25), or more.\n\nSo for each m, the possible n's that give exactly m trailing zeros must form a contiguous range. Because once the count increases beyond m, it can't come back down. So the possible n's are in a range [a, b], where for all n in this range, the count is m, and for n < a, the count is less than m, and for n > b, the count is more than m.\n\nBut how to find a and b?\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor a given m, find the smallest n where the count is m. Let's call this low. Then find the largest n where the count is m. Let's call this high. Then the numbers between low and high inclusive are the solutions. But how?\n\nBut how to find these numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros is either 0, 1, or 5. Wait, in the sample input, m=1, the answer is 5 numbers. But why 5?\n\nBecause when you have a number that's not a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1. But when you reach a multiple of 5, the count increases by more than 1. So for example, for m=5, there's no solution because the count jumps from 4 (for 20!) to 6 (for 25!). So between 20 and 25, the count increases by 2. So for m=5, there's no n.\n\nSo the way to find the possible n's is:\n\nFind the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then check if the count_zeros(n+1) is m. If not, then there's only one n. But if the count_zeros(n+1) is also m, then there's a range of numbers.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n for which count_zeros(n) = m?\n\nThis seems like a binary search problem. Because for a given m, we can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, and then check if that n has exactly m zeros. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is found.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) is exactly m?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the lower bound and upper bound of n's that have exactly m zeros.\n\nLet me think about the steps again.\n\nFirst, for a given m, find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Let's say that n_low is this value. Then find the maximal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Let's say n_high. Then the answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high inclusive. The count is n_high - n_low + 1.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nBut how do I find n_low and n_high?\n\nWell, the count_zeros function is non-decreasing. So for a given m, there's a range of n's where count_zeros(n) = m. So the first occurrence of m is the first n where count_zeros(n) = m. The last occurrence is the last n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nSo to find the first occurrence, perhaps we can perform a binary search on n to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, and then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then no solution. Otherwise, that's the first occurrence.\n\nSimilarly, to find the last occurrence, perhaps find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1, subtract 1. Because the last occurrence of m is the n before the first occurrence of m+1.\n\nYes! That's a clever approach.\n\nFor example, for m=1, the first occurrence is 5. The first occurrence of m+1 (which is 2) is 10. So the last occurrence of m=1 is 10-1=9. So the range is 5-9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n1. Find the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this low_n.\n\n   If count_zeros(low_n) != m, then there's no solution. So return 0.\n\n2. Find the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call this high_n.\n\n   Then the last n with exactly m zeros is high_n - 1.\n\n   So the range is from low_n to high_n - 1.\n\n   The count of numbers is (high_n - 1) - low_n + 1 = high_n - low_n.\n\n   So if this count is positive, then output those numbers.\n\nBut how to find low_n and high_n?\n\nWe can use binary search for both steps.\n\nNow, the question is: How to implement the count_zeros function.\n\nThe count_zeros function for a given n is:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n // 5\n\n        count += n\n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way to calculate the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n).\n\nThen, for a given m, perform binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this lower_n.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(lower_n) == m. If not, then there's no solution. Else, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call it upper_n. Then the numbers from lower_n to upper_n -1 are the valid numbers.\n\nSo the number of solutions is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input m=1:\n\nFind lower_n: the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 1. Which is 5. count_zeros(5)=1, which is equal to m. So proceed.\n\nThen find upper_n: minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2. That is 10. So upper_n is 10. Then the numbers are from 5 to 10-1=9. So 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=5.\n\nWhat is lower_n? Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute for n=20: count_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). So 4. For 25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1, total 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25? Wait no, because between 20 and 25, let's see:\n\nn=24: count_zeros(24) is 24//5=4, 24//25=0 → total 4. So for m=5, the lower_n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is larger than 5. So in this case, the check count_zeros(lower_n) == m is false. Hence, no solution. Hence output 0. Which matches the note in the problem statement.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, m starts from 1.\n\nBut the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo for the given m, proceed as follows.\n\nImplement binary search for the lower_n.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search can be done between low=0 and high=5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m (since 5*m /5 =m, and higher terms add more). So that's an upper bound.\n\nWait, for example, for m=1, 5*1=5. Which is the correct n.\n\nBut for m=5, the correct n is 25. 5*5=25. So yes.\n\nSo the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps even a better upper bound is needed. For example, for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, but the actual n could be higher. Wait, no. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is floor(5m/5) + floor(5m/25) + ... which is m + floor(m/5) + ... which is definitely larger than m. So 5*m is a safe upper bound for binary search.\n\nSo the binary search for lower_n:\n\nInitialize left=0, right=5*m.\n\nWhile left < right:\n\n   mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n       right = mid\n\n   else:\n\n       left = mid +1\n\nAt the end, left is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we have that, check if count_zeros(left) == m. If not, output 0. Else, proceed to find upper_n.\n\nSimilarly, for upper_n, we need to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the upper_n is that value.\n\nThen the numbers are from left to upper_n-1.\n\nSo the count is upper_n - left.\n\nBut how to handle cases where upper_n is not found? Well, since m can be up to 1e5, but for m+1, the upper_n would be found in the same way.\n\nSo the code steps in Python:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nImplement count_zeros(n).\n\nThen perform binary search to find lower_n.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(lower_n) is m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, perform binary search to find upper_n for m+1.\n\nThen the answer is the numbers from lower_n to upper_n -1, inclusive.\n\nSo the number of elements is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut wait, for example, when m=1:\n\nlower_n is 5, upper_n is 10. So upper_n - lower_n is 5, which is the correct count.\n\nAnother example: m=6. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So lower_n is 25. Now find upper_n for m+1=7.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7?\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=25: count is 6.\n\nn=26: same as 25 → 6.\n\nn=29: same.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → total 7. So upper_n is 30. So the range is 25 to 29. So 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the code should generate the list of numbers from lower_n to upper_n-1.\n\nNow, the problem is to generate these numbers and output their count followed by the numbers in order.\n\nBut what about when upper_n is not found? For example, when m is very large. But since m is up to 1e5, the upper_n will be found.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen find lower_n via binary search.\n\nBut for m=0, but the input constraints say m >=1.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef find_lower(m):\n\n    left = 0\n\n    right = 5*m\n\n    while left < right:\n\n        mid = (left + right) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n            right = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            left = mid +1\n\n    return left\n\nSimilarly for upper_n, find_lower(m+1).\n\nOnce we have lower_n and upper_n, check if count_zeros(lower_n) == m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, the numbers are from lower_n to upper_n-1.\n\nSo the count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut for example, if upper_n is the first n where count_zeros is m+1, then upper_n-1 is the last n with count m.\n\nSo the list is [lower_n, lower_n+1,..., upper_n-1].\n\nNow, the code needs to generate this list.\n\nBut for m=1, upper_n is 10. So upper_n - lower_n is 10-5=5. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if upper_n is 5*m?\n\nBut in code, the upper_n is found as find_lower(m+1).\n\nSo the code for the problem:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute lower_n = find_lower(m).\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper_n = find_lower(m+1)\n\n    numbers = list(range(lower_n, upper_n))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but range(lower_n, upper_n) is from lower_n to upper_n-1, inclusive. So yes.\n\nBut in Python, range(a, b) includes a, a+1, ..., b-1.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut let's test for m=1, lower_n=5, upper_n=10. So range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9 → correct.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, what about when m is such that there's no solution. For example, m=5.\n\nlower_n = find_lower(5). Let's compute:\n\nfind_lower(5) is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute for n=20: count_zeros(20) is 4. For n=25, count_zeros(25) is 6. So during binary search, the code would find left=25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle this.\n\nNow, what about when m is 6? For example, lower_n is 25, upper_n is 30. So the numbers are 25-29. So len is 5.\n\nBut what if m is 6, and upper_n is 30, then the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut for m=0, but the input constraints say m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut what if m is 100000? Then 5*m is 500000. But for binary search, that's manageable.\n\nBut for Python, even for m=1e5, the binary search is O(log(5e5)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut let's write the code.\n\nRead m from input. But the input is given as a single integer. For example, in the sample input, the first case is m=1, output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. The second input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower(m):\n\n    left = 0\n\n    right = 5 * m\n\n    while left < right:\n\n        mid = (left + right) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n            right = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            left = mid +1\n\n    return left\n\ndef main():\n\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    lower_n = find_lower(m)\n\n    if count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        upper_n = find_lower(m+1)\n\n        numbers = list(range(lower_n, upper_n))\n\n        print(len(numbers))\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. But the code for that case would generate numbers as list(range(5,10)), which is [5,6,7,8,9]. So len is 5. Correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is ['1', '5']? Wait, no. The sample input says:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer m. But in the sample input, it's given as ['1', '5'], which perhaps represents two test cases. But the original problem's sample input may have been presented as two separate cases. But according to the problem statement, the code should read a single integer m from input. So perhaps the sample input is two test cases. But the code is supposed to process one m per run.\n\nWait, the original problem's sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut perhaps that's a way to show two test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the code should read one m from input, and output the answer. But the sample input seems to have two lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. For example, the first input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So the code must read one line of input. But perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is m=1, and the second line is m=5. But the code is supposed to process one m per run. So perhaps the code should read one line, but in the sample, they have two test cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer. So the code should read one line. So perhaps in the sample input, the first case is m=1, and the second case is m=5. But the code is supposed to handle one case per run.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code must read from stdin and output to stdout. So for the code, the input is one integer m. So the code is written to process that.\n\nThus, the code as written is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is '1' and the output is the first part. The second input is '5', output is 0. So the code would process that.\n\nNow, testing for m=5:\n\nlower_n = find_lower(5). Let's compute find_lower(5):\n\nThe binary search is between 0 and 5*5=25.\n\nInitially, left=0, right=25.\n\nmid = 12. count_zeros(12) is 2 (12//5=2, 12//25=0). Which is less than 5. So left becomes 13.\n\nmid=(13+25)//2= 19. count_zeros(19) is 3. Still less than 5. left=20.\n\nmid=(20+25)/2=22. count_zeros(22) is 4. Still less than 5. left=23.\n\nmid= (23+25)/2=24. count_zeros(24) is 4. left=25.\n\nNow left=25, right=25. Exit loop. lower_n is 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to m=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. lower_n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed. upper_n is find_lower(7). Let's compute that.\n\nfind_lower(7):\n\nbinary search between 0 and 5*7=35.\n\nLooking for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7 (30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7). So the lower_n for m=7 is 25? No. Let me think:\n\nWait for m=7, the code will find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nLet me compute for n=25: count is 6. So need higher.\n\nn=25: 6.\n\nn=26: same as 25. 6.\n\nn=29: same. 6.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → total 7. So the minimal n is 25?\n\nNo, the minimal n is 25? No. Because 25 gives 6, which is less than 7. So the binary search would find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nLet me simulate the binary search for m=7.\n\nleft=0, right=35.\n\nmid=17. count_zeros(17) is 3 → less than 7. left=18.\n\nmid= (18+35)/2=26.5 → 26. count_zeros(26) is 5 (26//5=5, 26//25=1 → total 6? Wait 5+1=6? Yes. So count_zeros(26) is 6 <7. left=27.\n\nmid=(27+35)/2=31. count_zeros(31) is 31//5=6, 31//25=1 → 7. So >=7. So right=31.\n\nNow left=27, right=31. mid= (27+31)/2=29. count_zeros(29) is 29//5=5, 29//25=1 → 6 <7. So left=30.\n\nNow left=30, right=31. mid=30.5 → 30. count_zeros(30) is 6+1=7. So right=30. Now left=30, right=30. Exit. So lower_n is 30.\n\nSo upper_n for m=6 is 30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But according to problem statement, m starts from 1. So no need to handle.\n\nAnother edge case: m=2.\n\nWhat is the lower_n? For m=2, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2.\n\nn=10: count_zeros(10) is 2. So lower_n=10. Check if count_zeros(10) is 2 → yes. upper_n is find_lower(3). Let's compute that.\n\nfind_lower(3) is the minimal n with count_zeros >=3.\n\nn=15: count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So lower_n for m=3 is 15. So upper_n is 15. So the numbers are from 10 to 14. So 5 numbers. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2, 11→2, 12→2, 13→2, 14→2. 15→3. So yes. So output 5 numbers: 10-14.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, when m is 1, the upper_n is find_lower(2). Let's compute that.\n\nfind_lower(2) is the minimal n with count_zeros >=2. Which is 10. So numbers from 5 to 9. Correct.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input m=1 would output 5 followed by the list. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=2, output is 5 numbers 10-14.\n\nNow, what about m=3? The numbers would be 15-19. Let's check count_zeros(15) is 3. count_zeros(19) is 3. count_zeros(20) is 4. So yes.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there's only one n? For example, m=6. Wait, no. For m=6, the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers. What about m=24?\n\nLet me think. Let's find for m=24.\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24 (100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0 → 24). Then count_zeros(101) is same as 100. So the upper_n for m=24 is find_lower(25). What's the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=25?\n\nLet me compute for n=100: count_zeros is 24. For n=105: 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0 → 25. So the upper_n is 105. So the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. 5 numbers. So the code outputs 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is 25?\n\nlower_n is find_lower(25). Let's see:\n\nthe minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=25.\n\nn=105 gives 25. So lower_n=105. count_zeros(105) is 25. So upper_n is find_lower(26). Let's compute count_zeros(109) is 25. count_zeros(110) is 110//5=22, 110//25=4, 110//125=0 → 26. So upper_n is 110. So the numbers are 105 to 109. 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nBut what if m=25? Then the answer is 5 numbers. So the code works.\n\nAnother case: m=24, the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut in the code, the function find_lower is called twice. But for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The binary search for each is O(log(5e5)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code needs to read input from stdin, and output the answer. Also, note that in the sample output, for m=1, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\". So the first line is the count, then the second line is the numbers separated by space. However, in the code, the code prints len(numbers) followed by the numbers. So for the sample input, the code would print:\n\nprint(len(numbers)) → 5\n\nprint(' '.join(...)) → 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the sample output, the first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' — which implies that the first line is the count, and the second line is the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first case's output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is two lines. So the code's print(len(...)) and then print('...') will produce two lines, which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, when you print(len(...)), it adds a newline. Then the next print adds another newline. So for example, the first line would be '5\\n', and the second line would be '5 6 7 8 9\\n'.\n\nBut the sample output shows that the first line is '5\\n' and the second line is the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for m=5 is '0', which is one line. So the code for that case would print 0, which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, when the count is zero, it prints 0. So for example, when m=5, the code outputs 0. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin and write to stdout. So the code is as follows.\n\nBut note that for the case when the numbers list is empty (but that's handled by the code, since if count_zeros(lower_n) !=m, then output 0. Else, the numbers list is generated.)\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    return left\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lower_n = find_lower(m)\n    if count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper_n = find_lower(m + 1)\n        numbers = list(range(lower_n, upper_n))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, for the case when upper_n is 0? Well, no. Because m is at least 1, and lower_n is found to have count_zeros equal to m. upper_n is find_lower(m+1). Which for m=1, upper_n is 10. So numbers is range(5,10) → correct.\n\nNow, testing for m=5, the code outputs 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=2, the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=6, returns 5 numbers.\n\nBut what about m=0? Well, the code doesn't handle it, but according to the problem statement, m is >=1.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the code would read m=0. Then lower_n is find_lower(0). But the code's find_lower function for m=0 would have right=0, since 5*0=0. So left=0, right=0. So returns 0. Then check count_zeros(0) is 0, which equals m=0. Then upper_n is find_lower(1). Which would be 5. So numbers is range(0,5) → 0,1,2,3,4. But the problem says that n must be positive integers. Oh! Wait, the problem says n is a positive integer. So in the code, the numbers list could include 0, but that's invalid.\n\nWait, what's the problem statement?\n\nThe problem says, the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes.\n\nSo n must be positive. So in the code, when m=0, the code would generate numbers including 0, but that's not allowed. However, the problem says m starts from 1, so this case is not considered.\n\nBut in our code, when m is 1, lower_n is 5. Which is correct. So for the code, the numbers generated are from lower_n to upper_n-1. But lower_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) is m. So for m=1, lower_n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   \n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To efficiently find the range of $ n $ values that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search:\n   - **Lower Bound**: Find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros is at least $ m $.\n   - **Upper Bound**: Find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros is at least $ m + 1 $. The valid $ n $ values will be between the lower bound and one less than the upper bound.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: If the lower bound does not result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, there are no valid $ n $ values for the given $ m $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_lower(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m\n    while left < right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            right = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    return left\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lower_n = find_lower(m)\n    if count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper_n = find_lower(m + 1)\n        numbers = list(range(lower_n, upper_n))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_lower Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - Reads the input value $ m $.\n   - Determines the lower bound $ lower_n $ where the trailing zeros first reach or exceed $ m $.\n   - Checks if $ lower_n $ indeed results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, it prints 0.\n   - If valid, finds the upper bound $ upper_n $ for $ m + 1 $ and generates the range of valid $ n $ values from $ lower_n $ to $ upper_n - 1 $.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $.",
