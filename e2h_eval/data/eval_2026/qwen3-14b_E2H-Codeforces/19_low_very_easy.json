The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nHmm. Let me think. The key here is that the districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So when we remove some districts, the remaining ones must form a connected subtree. But how do we choose which ones to remove to maximize the sum?\n\nThe sum of 2^i for the remaining districts. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, we want to keep as many higher-numbered districts as possible. Because higher numbers contribute more. So the optimal strategy is to keep the largest possible districts, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nWait, but how to ensure connectivity? Because if we just take the top (n -k) districts, they might not be connected. So maybe we need to find a way to select the highest possible districts while maintaining connectivity.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to select the districts with the highest numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. But how?\n\nAnother thought: since the tree is connected, and we need to remove k districts. The maximum sum would be achieved by keeping the districts with the largest possible numbers, but we have to make sure that they form a connected component.\n\nBut how to select those districts? Let's think about the process. Let's imagine that we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. So the idea is to select the largest (n -k) districts, but then check if they are connected. If they are not, then we need to remove some lower-numbered districts and include higher ones.\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal solution is to keep all the districts except the k smallest ones. But that's only possible if those districts are connected. However, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as choosing a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Since the tree is connected, maybe we can perform a greedy approach where we prioritize keeping higher-numbered nodes.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the problem is similar to finding a subtree with (n -k) nodes that has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since the sum is maximized by including as many high-numbered nodes as possible, we can model this as selecting the nodes with the highest possible numbers, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n- Start with all the nodes. We need to remove k nodes. But we want to keep the ones with the highest values. However, we can't just remove the k smallest nodes because that might disconnect the tree.\n\nWait, but maybe the way to do this is to select the nodes that are not removed, and ensure that they are connected. So perhaps we can model this as a problem where we want to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, and then check if they form a connected component. If they do, then we can remove the others. If not, then we need to find which nodes to remove so that the remaining ones are connected and as high as possible.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAnother angle: the sum of 2^i is maximized when we have the largest possible numbers. So the optimal set of districts to keep is the (n -k) districts with the largest numbers, but connected. However, if they are not connected, we need to remove some of the smaller ones and include higher ones. But how?\n\nWait, but the districts with the largest numbers are the ones from n down to (n -k +1). Let's say that we want to keep these districts. But if they form a connected component, then that's the best. Otherwise, we need to find which ones to remove from the lower end to connect them.\n\nBut how can we check if the largest (n -k) districts form a connected component? Well, perhaps we can model this as a tree and check if those nodes are connected. But checking that for large n (up to 1e6) could be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to find the minimal set of nodes that needs to be kept, which includes the highest nodes and connects them.\n\nWait, here's another thought: since the tree is connected, and each node has a value of 2^i, which increases with i, the optimal solution is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes. However, to do that, we need to ensure that those nodes form a connected subtree. If they don't, we need to remove some of the smaller nodes (from the ones not in the top (n -k)) and include some of the higher ones.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to remove?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of selecting a subtree of size (n -",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts are represented as nodes in a tree, and each node's value is $2^i$, where $i$ is the district number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since $2^i$ grows exponentially with $i$, we should aim to keep the districts with the highest numbers as much as possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected component.

We will perform a BFS/DFS starting from the largest node (n), and include all nodes that are part of the subtree that connects the largest nodes.\n    # 3. If the number of nodes in this subtree is less than (n -k), we need to add more nodes (which would be lower-numbered ones).\n    # 4. However, this is complex.\n    \n    # Instead, let's think of it as a problem where we need to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, and we can only remove the smallest k nodes that are not in the connected component of the largest nodes.\n    \n    # Let's proceed with the following steps:\n    # - Perform a BFS/DFS from the largest node (n) and collect all nodes that are reachable without going through nodes with smaller numbers than the ones we want to keep.\n    # - This is not clear, but let's try to implement the following:\n    #   a. Start with the largest node.\n    #   b. Use a priority queue to explore neighbors in order of their node number.\n    #   c. Collect nodes until we have (n -k) nodes.\n    \n    # Alternatively, here's a correct solution:\n    # The optimal set of districts to keep is the largest (n -k) districts, and the ones that are connected to them. To achieve this, we can perform a BFS starting from the largest node (n) and include all nodes in the subtree that are part of the largest (n -k) nodes.\n    \n    # However, since we cannot know in advance which nodes to include, another approach is to find the minimal number of nodes to remove such that the remaining nodes are connected and include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, here's a correct and efficient approach based on the observation that we need to keep the largest (n -k) nodes and ensure they are connected. To do this, we can perform a BFS starting from the largest node (n) and include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Any nodes not included in this traversal are candidates for removal.\n    \n    # Here's the code:\n\n    # Mark all nodes to be kept initially as the largest (n -k) nodes\n    to_keep = set(range(n - k + 1, n + 1))\n    # Now perform BFS from node n to find all nodes in the connected component of the largest nodes\n    visited = set()\n    stack = [n]\n    visited.add(n)\n    while stack:\n        u = stack.pop()\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if v in to_keep and v not in visited:\n                visited.add(v)\n                stack.append(v)\n    # Now, the visited set contains the nodes that are in the connected component of the largest nodes\n    # If the size of visited is less than (n -k), we need to add more nodes\n    # However, since we need to keep exactly (n -k) nodes, and the initial set is the largest (n -k) nodes, but they may not be connected, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n    \n    # But how to decide which nodes to include?\n    \n    # This is getting too complicated. Let's look for a pattern in the sample input.\n    # In the first sample, the largest 3 nodes are 4,5,6. But they are not connected. The connected component of 6 is 6,5,2, etc.\n    # So the solution is to keep 2,5,6. But 2 is not in the top 3. So the initial assumption is incorrect.\n    \n    # Therefore, the correct approach is to find a connected subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. This can be done using a priority-based BFS, always expanding the subtree by including the highest-numbered nodes first.\n    \n    # Here's the correct algorithm:\n    # 1. Start with node n.\n    # 2. Use a priority queue (max-heap) to explore neighbors, always choosing the highest-numbered node first.\n    # 3. Continue until we have collected (n -k) nodes.\n    # 4. The nodes not in this collection are the ones to remove.\n    \n    # This ensures that we include the highest possible nodes while maintaining connectivity.\n    \n    # Let's implement this approach.\n    \n    from heapq import heappush, heappop\n    \n    # We need a max-heap, so we'll use negative numbers\n    visited = set()\n    heap = []\n    heappush(heap, -n)\n    visited.add(n)\n    count = 1\n    while count < (n - k):\n        current = -heappop(heap)\n        for neighbor in edges[current]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n                count += 1\n                if count == (n - k):\n                    break\n        if count == (n - k):\n            break\n    \n    # The nodes to keep are those in 'visited'\n    # The nodes to remove are those not in 'visited'\n    to_remove = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in visited:\n            to_remove.append(i)\n    to_remove.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, to_remove)))\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()",
