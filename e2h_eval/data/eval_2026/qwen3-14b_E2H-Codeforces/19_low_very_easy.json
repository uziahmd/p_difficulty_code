The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So when we remove some districts, the remaining ones must form a connected subtree. But how do we choose which ones to remove to maximize the sum?\n\nThe sum of 2^i is maximized by keeping the districts with the highest possible i values. Because 2^i grows exponentially. So ideally, we want to keep the largest possible numbers. However, we have to ensure that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but how can we ensure that? For example, if we want to keep the largest districts, maybe they are all connected through some path. But perhaps not. So maybe we need to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nBut how to approach this? Let's think about the structure of the tree. Since the districts are numbered from 1 to n, and the value 2^i increases with i, we want to keep the highest possible numbers. So the optimal strategy would be to keep the largest (n - k) districts, but only if they form a connected subtree. If they don't, then we need to find the largest subset of districts that are connected and have as many high numbers as possible.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nWait, perhaps the solution is to find the subtree that includes the largest possible districts. Let me think: since the tree is connected, and we need to select a connected subtree with (n - k) nodes. To maximize the sum, we need to select the nodes with the highest possible numbers, but ensuring they are connected.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a subtree of size (n - k) that has the maximum possible sum of 2^i, which is equivalent to selecting the nodes with the largest possible numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected component.\n\nSo how do we find such a subtree?\n\nLet me think of it this way: the best possible scenario is that the nodes {n - (n -k) + 1, ..., n} (i.e., the top (n -k) nodes) form a connected subtree. If they are connected, then we can just remove the others. But if not, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find which ones to include?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of it as starting with all the nodes, and then removing the smallest possible nodes (in terms of their number) that are not part of the connected subtree. Wait, but the problem requires us to remove exactly k nodes, so the remaining is n -k.\n\nBut perhaps the way to approach this is to select the nodes with the largest numbers possible, and then check if they form a connected component. If not, we need to add some lower-numbered nodes to connect them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but make sure that they are connected. To do this, we can think of the tree as rooted at node n (the largest), and then perform some traversal to see which nodes are included. Wait, but that might not work directly.\n\nAnother approach: since the value of each node is 2^i, which is exponentially increasing, the optimal selection is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Therefore, the problem becomes similar to choosing a subtree of size (n -k) that includes the highest possible nodes.\n\nSo here's an idea: we can start by considering all nodes except the first k ones. But that's not necessarily connected. So perhaps we need to perform a greedy approach where we keep the largest nodes and ensure connectivity.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal set of nodes to remove. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a problem where we need to choose a subtree of size m = n -k, which is connected, and has the maximum sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes, which are 2^i, the maximum sum is achieved by including as many large i as possible.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to selecting the largest m nodes that form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the question is: how to select the largest m nodes (i.e., the nodes numbered from m+1 to n?), but only if they form a connected subtree. If not, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to do this is to start from the largest node (node n) and perform a BFS or DFS to collect as many large nodes as possible, ensuring that the subtree is connected. Then, if the total number of nodes collected is",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is that the value of each district's fans (2^i) grows exponentially with the district number, so we should prioritize keeping the districts with the highest numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree structure, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since the value of fans increases exponentially with the district number, we aim to keep the highest-numbered districts possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure the remaining districts form a connected subtree.

So the tree looks like:\n    # Node 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. Node 6 is connected to 5. So 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So nodes 4, 5, 6 are connected through 2. But why was 4 removed in the sample?\n    # Oh, because the sample says to keep 2,5,6. But the largest three nodes are 4,5,6. Why not keep them? Because they are connected through 2. But 2 is not in the top three. So perhaps the approach is not correct.\n    \n    # Wait, the sum of 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 16 + 32 + 64 = 112. But the sample says the maximum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. That's less than 112. So why is that the case?\n    # This suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. There must be something wrong here.\n    \n    # Wait, the sample input's explanation says that the maximum is achieved by keeping districts 2,5,6. But according to the values, keeping 4,5,6 would give a higher sum. What's the issue here?\n    \n    # Ah! Maybe I misread the sample. Let me check again.\n    \n    # The first sample input is:\n    # 6 3\n    # 2 1\n    # 2 6\n    # 4 2\n    # 5 6\n    # 2 3\n    \n    # So the tree is:\n    # Node 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3.\n    # Node 6 is connected to 5.\n    \n    # So the districts 4,5,6 are connected through 2 and 6. But to include 4,5,6, we need to also include 2 and 6. Wait, 4 is connected to 2, and 6 is connected to 2 and 5. So if we keep 4,5,6, we also need to keep 2 and 6. But then the total number of nodes is 4 (2,4,5,6), but m=3. So we cannot keep all four. Hence, the sample solution removes 1,3,4, keeping 2,5,6. Which are three nodes. So the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100.\n    \n    # But what if we try to keep 2,4,5,6? That's 4 nodes, which is more than m=3. So we need to remove 3 nodes. But the problem says to remove exactly k=3 nodes. So keeping 4 nodes is not allowed. Hence, the correct approach is to choose the best subset of m=3 nodes.\n    \n    # This suggests that the optimal strategy is to keep the largest m nodes, but ensure that they are connected.

But this is vague.\n    \n    # Let me look at the sample input:\n    # In the first sample, n=6, k=3, m=3. The output is to remove 1,3,4. The kept nodes are 2,5,6. These form a connected component.\n    # The largest three nodes are 4,5,6. But 4 is not connected to 5 and 6 in the original tree? Wait, the tree is:\n    # Edges are 2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3. So the tree looks like:\n    # Node 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. Node 6 is connected to 5. So 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So nodes 4, 5, 6 are connected through 2. But why was 4 removed in the sample?\n    # Oh, because the sample says to keep 2,5,6. But the largest three nodes are 4,5,6. Why not keep them? Because they are connected through 2. But 2 is not in the top three. So perhaps the approach is not correct.\n    \n    # Wait, the sum of 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 16 + 32 + 64 = 112. But the sample says the maximum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. That's less than 112. So why is that the case?\n    # This suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. There must be something wrong here.\n    \n    # Wait, the sample input's explanation says that the maximum is achieved by keeping districts 2,5,6. But according to the values, keeping 4,5,6 would give a higher sum. What's the issue here?\n    \n    # Ah! Maybe I misread the sample. Let me check again.\n    \n    # The first sample input is:\n    # 6 3\n    # 2 1\n    # 2 6\n    # 4 2\n    # 5 6\n    # 2 3\n    \n    # So the tree is:\n    # Node 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3.\n    # Node 6 is connected to 5.\n    \n    # So the districts 4,5,6 are connected through 2 and 6. But to include 4,5,6, we need to also include 2 and 6. Wait, 4 is connected to 2, and 6 is connected to 2 and 5. So if we keep 4,5,6, we also need to keep 2 and 6. But then the total number of nodes is 4 (2,4,5,6), but m=3. So we cannot keep all four. Hence, the sample solution removes 1,3,4, keeping 2,5,6. Which are three nodes. So the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100.\n    \n    # But what if we try to keep 2,4,5,6? That's 4 nodes, which is more than m=3. So we need to remove 3 nodes. But the problem says to remove exactly k=3 nodes. So keeping 4 nodes is not allowed. Hence, the correct approach is to choose the best subset of m=3 nodes.\n    \n    # This suggests that the optimal strategy is to keep the largest m nodes, but ensure that they are connected. If they are not, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n    \n    # To achieve this, we can use a priority-based approach where we start from the largest node and greedily add the highest possible nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n    \n    # Here's a revised approach:\n    # 1. Start with the largest node (n).\n    # 2. Use a priority queue (max-heap) to always visit the next highest node that is connected to the current subtree.\n    # 3. Continue until we have selected m nodes.\n    \n    # However, implementing this efficiently for large n (up to 1e6) can be challenging.\n    \n    # An alternative approach is to realize that the optimal set of nodes to keep is the largest m nodes that form a connected subtree. To find this, we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the largest node, and collect nodes in descending order of their number. This ensures that we prioritize higher-numbered nodes.\n    \n    # Let's try implementing this:\n    \n    # We'll use a BFS starting from the largest node, and for each node, we visit its neighbors in descending order of their number. This way, we prioritize visiting higher-numbered nodes first.\n    \n    # Let's proceed with this plan.\n    \n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    keep = [False] * (n + 1)\n    count = 0\n    \n    def bfs(start):\n        nonlocal count\n        q = deque()\n        q.append(start)\n        visited[start] = True\n        keep[start] = True\n        count += 1\n        while q and count < m:\n            u = q.popleft()\n            # Sort neighbors in descending order\n            for v in sorted(edges[u], reverse=True):\n                if not visited[v]:\n                    visited[v] = True\n                    keep[v] = True\n                    count += 1\n                    q.append(v)\n    \n    bfs(n)\n    \n    # Now, collect the nodes to remove: those not in 'keep'\n    remove = []\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if not keep[i]:\n            remove.append(i)\n    # However, this may not collect exactly k nodes. Because if the count is less than m, it means the entire tree is not enough, which is impossible.\n    # Since the tree is connected, the BFS will collect at least one node (n), but for m <= n, it will collect exactly m nodes.\n    # Wait, no. The BFS will continue until the count reaches m. So it may stop before visiting all nodes.\n    \n    # However, this approach may not work correctly. For example, if the largest node is isolated, but that's not possible since the tree is connected.\n    \n    # Let's test this approach on the first sample:\n    # n=6, m=3.\n    # Start BFS from 6.\n    # Initially, add 6 to the queue. count=1.\n    # Process 6: neighbors are 2 and 5. Sorted descending is 5, 2.\n    # Visit 5: count=2, add to queue.\n    # Visit 2: count=3, add to queue. Now, count reaches m=3.\n    # The keep array has 6,5,2.\n    # So remove nodes are 1,3,4. Which matches the sample.\n    \n    # So this approach works for the first sample.\n    \n    # Let's see another example.\n    # Suppose n=5, k=2, m=3.\n    # Tree is a chain: 1-2-3-4-5.\n    # BFS starts at 5. Neighbors are 4. Add 4. Then process 4, add 3. Now count is 3. Keep 5,4,3. Remove 1,2.\n    # Sum is 8 + 4 + 2 = 14. But if we kept 3,4,5, it's better than keeping 2,3,4,5 (but m=3). So this seems correct.\n    \n    # So this approach seems to work.\n    \n    # Now, the code needs to implement this BFS, and collect the nodes to remove.\n    \n    # However, there's a problem: the BFS may not collect exactly m nodes if the tree is such that the highest nodes are not connected. But since the tree is connected, the BFS will collect at least one node (the starting node), and the traversal will continue until we collect m nodes.\n    \n    # Therefore, this approach should work.\n    \n    # Finally, sort the remove list and print it.\n    \n    remove.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, remove)))\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()",
