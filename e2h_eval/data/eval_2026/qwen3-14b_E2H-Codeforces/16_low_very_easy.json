Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how? Since each road divides the plane into regions, the blocks are determined by the arrangement of these lines. But directly representing all blocks isn't feasible, especially with up to 300 roads. That would be way too many regions.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the problem in terms of BFS. The key is to model the blocks as nodes in a graph, where edges exist between adjacent blocks. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks uniquely? Well, each block can be represented by a set of signs for each line. For example, for each road, the block lies on one side of the line. So, for each line equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0, a point (x,y) not on the line will satisfy either a_i x + b_i y + c_i > 0 or < 0. So the sign of each line's equation for a point determines which side of the line the point is on. Therefore, each block can be uniquely identified by the tuple of signs for each line.\n\nBut wait, that's only true if the arrangement of lines is such that each region is uniquely determined by the signs. Which it is. Because each line splits the plane into two regions, and the combination of all these signs defines a unique region. However, since the lines can be arranged in any way, but the problem says that the home and university are not on any line, so they are in some block.\n\nSo, the idea is: for each of the home and university points, compute their sign vector (for each line, whether the point is on the positive or negative side). Then, the problem becomes finding the minimal steps between these two sign vectors, where each step corresponds to changing the sign of exactly one line (since moving across a road changes the sign of exactly one line's equation). Wait, no. Because moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, which implies that the two blocks differ in exactly one line's sign. Because if you cross a road, you are moving from one side of that road to the other, but all other roads' signs remain the same. Therefore, two blocks are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position. Because that would mean they are separated by exactly one road.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Suppose two blocks are separated by two roads. Then, their sign vectors would differ in two positions. But are they adjacent? No. Because to move from one to the other, you'd have to cross both roads. But perhaps the adjacency is only when they differ in exactly one line's sign. Because each step crosses exactly one road. Therefore, the adjacency in the graph is when two sign vectors differ in exactly one line's sign. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of steps to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step flips exactly one bit (the sign of one line).\n\nWait, but flipping a single bit in the sign vector would correspond to crossing that road. So, the minimal steps between the two vectors would be the Hamming distance between them, right? Because each differing bit requires a flip. But wait, no. Because if two sign vectors differ in k positions, then the minimal steps would be k. Because each step can flip one bit. But that's only if the Hamming distance is the correct measure here. However, this seems too simple. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the home's sign vector is (1, 1) and the university's is (-1, -1). The Hamming distance is 2. So according to this, the minimal steps would be 2. But is that possible? Because each step can cross one road. So, first step: cross the first road, changing the first sign. Then cross the second road. So two steps. That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: if the sign vectors differ in one position, then the minimal steps is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the answer is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. But wait, why can't there be a shorter path? Because each step can only change one bit. So, the minimal steps is exactly the Hamming distance.\n\nBut wait, this seems to suggest that the problem is trivial. Because once you compute the sign vectors for home and university, count the number of differing positions, and that's the answer.\n\nBut why does the sample input give output 2 for the first case?\n\nLet's check the first sample",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to an adjacent block through a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The city is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each block can be uniquely identified by the sign of the result when a point's coordinates are substituted into each road's equation. Moving from one block to another adjacent block involves crossing exactly one road, which changes the sign for that road's equation.\n\n2. **Sign Vectors**: For each point (home and university), compute a sign vector where each element represents the sign of the result of substituting the point into the corresponding road's equation. This sign vector uniquely identifies the block containing the point.\n\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between their sign vectors. The Hamming distance is the number of positions at which the corresponding elements of the two vectors differ.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    def get_signs(x, y):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n        return tuple(signs)\n    \n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1)\n    univ_signs = get_signs(x2, y2)\n    \n    diff = sum(1 for i in range(n) if home_signs[i] != univ_signs[i])\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home and university, and the equations of the roads.\n2. **Sign Vector Calculation**: For each point (home and university), a sign vector is computed. Each element of this vector indicates whether the point lies on the positive or negative side of the corresponding road.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university points is calculated. This distance directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each differing sign indicates crossing a road.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution using the properties of sign vectors and Hamming distance, ensuring optimal performance even with the maximum constraints.",
