Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the blocks are structured. Each road divides the plane into regions. The key here is that two blocks are adjacent if they share a common segment of a road. So, moving from one block to another requires crossing a road, but only if the shared boundary is a line segment (not just a point). \n\nBut how do I model this? Well, perhaps each block can be represented as a node in a graph, and edges exist between nodes if they are adjacent. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home's block to the university's block. However, since there can be an infinite number of blocks, we can't model them all directly. So there must be a smarter way.\n\nWait, but maybe the key is that each block can be represented by the set of roads that separate it from the home. Or perhaps, for each road, we can determine on which side of the road the home and university are. Then, the problem becomes similar to a BFS where each state is determined by the sign of each road's equation. But with n roads, that would be 2^n possible states, which is not feasible for n up to 300. Oh, that's impossible. So that approach isn't going to work.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Since each step involves crossing a road, perhaps the minimal number of steps is determined by how many roads separate the home and university. Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if there are two roads that cross each other, then the home and university might be in regions separated by both roads, but you can cross each road once, so the minimal steps would be 2. But maybe there's a way to cross through different roads?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node represents a region (block), and edges represent adjacency. But again, how to represent the regions?\n\nAnother idea: For each road, the home and university are on opposite sides of some roads. The minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate them, but that's not necessarily correct. Because if two roads are parallel, then crossing one might not help. Wait, but maybe the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Let me think.\n\nLet me take the example given. In the first sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: y=0 and x=0. The home is in the first quadrant (x>0, y>0) and the university is in the third (x<0, y<0). The two roads divide the plane into four quadrants. The home is in one block, the university in another. To get from home to university, you need to cross both roads. So the minimal steps is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: the second input has three roads. The home is (1,1), university (-1,-1). The roads are x=0, y=0, and x+y=3. The home is in the first quadrant, and the university is in third. The third road x+y=3 is such that the home is on the side where x + y -3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0, and the university is x + y -3 = -1 -1 -3 = -5 <0. So both are on the same side of that road. So the roads separating them are x=0 and y=0. So the minimal steps is 2 again.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step. But how to confirm this?\n\nWait, suppose there are two roads that cross each other. Suppose the home and university are separated by both roads. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. Because you need to cross each road once. But what if there's a way to cross through another road that is not separating them? No, because if a road doesn't separate them, then they are on the same side of that road. So crossing that road would not help in getting closer. So perhaps the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nIf that's the case, then the problem reduces to counting how many roads have the home and university on opposite sides. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step. \n\nBut why is that the case? Let's think of the regions as being connected by crossing roads. Each time you cross a road, you change the region. So,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move between these regions. The minimum number of steps required is thus determined by the number of roads that separate the home and the university. This is because each such road must be crossed exactly once to move from the home block to the university block.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    count = 0\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into lines for processing.\n2. **Home and University Coordinates**: The coordinates of the home and university are read and stored.\n3. **Roads Processing**: Each road is defined by coefficients (a, b, c) of the line equation `ax + by + c = 0`.\n4. **Separation Check**: For each road, we check if the home and university lie on opposite sides of the road. This is determined by evaluating the sign of the line equation at both points. If the signs differ, the road separates them.\n5. **Count Separating Roads**: The number of roads that separate the home and university is counted, which gives the minimum number of steps required to move between the blocks.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines and their separation of points, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
