    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to consider each element, remove it, compute the new max and min, and then find the minimum instability. But if we do this naively, it would be O(n²) time, which isn't feasible for n up to 1e5. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, the original array's max and min are important here. But when we remove an element, the new max and min could be different. For example, if the original array has a max that's unique, removing it would make the new max the next highest element. Similarly for the min.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to look at the original sorted array. Because once sorted, the min and max are the first and last elements. If we remove one element, the new min and max would depend on which element we remove.\n\nLet me think. Suppose the array is sorted. Let's say the original array is sorted as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. The initial instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Now, when we remove an element, the new instability would be the max of the remaining elements minus the min of the remaining elements.\n\nIf we remove the first element (a[0]), then the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1]. The instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\nIf we remove the last element (a[-1]), the new instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n\nIf we remove an element in the middle, say a[i], then the new max and min would be the same as before unless that element was the max or min. Wait, no. If the array is sorted, then removing any element except the first or last would leave the min as a[0] and max as a[-1]. So the instability would be the same as the original. Unless the element removed is the only one that's contributing to the max or min.\n\nWait, no. If the array is sorted, then the min is a[0], max is a[-1]. If you remove any element that's not the first or last, the min and max remain the same. So the instability remains the same. Therefore, the only candidates for removal that can affect the instability are the first and last elements. Wait, but that's not entirely correct. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. When we remove 7, the new max is 3, and min is 1. So instability is 2. But if we remove the first element (1), the new min is 3, max is 7, instability is 4. So in this case, the best is to remove the last element.\n\nBut what if there are multiple elements with the same value as the min or max? For example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 7, 7]. Then removing one of the 1s would leave the min as 1 (since there's another 1), and the max as 7. So the instability is 6. But if we remove the 7, the max becomes 3, and the min is 1, so instability is 2. So again, the optimal is to remove the max or min.\n\nBut in this case, the original array's min is 1, and max is 7. So the instability is 6. If you remove one of the 1s, the instability is 7 - 1 = 6. If you remove one of the 7s, the instability is 3 - 1 = 2. So the best option is to remove a max or a min.\n\nSo the key idea is that when the array is sorted, the minimal instability after removing one element can be achieved by either:\n\n- Removing the first element (so the new min is a[1], max is a[-1])\n\n- Removing the last element (new max is a[-2], min is a[0])\n\nOr, if there are multiple elements equal to the min or max, maybe removing one of them would not change the min or max. For example, if the array is [1, 1, 3, 7, 7], removing one of the 1s would leave the min as 1. So the instability is a[-1] - a[0] = 7 - 1 = 6. But if you remove a 7, the max becomes 3, so the instability is 3 - 1 = 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal instability would be",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps us easily identify the minimum and maximum values and their positions.\n2. **Evaluate Removing First or Last Element**: After sorting, the instability can be minimized by considering two scenarios:\n   - Removing the first element (which might reduce the minimum value).\n   - Removing the last element (which might reduce the maximum value).\n3. **Calculate Minimum Instability**: By comparing the instability after removing the first element and after removing the last element, we can determine the optimal choice.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    a.sort()\n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    # Check removing first element\n    if n > 2:\n        instability = a[-1] - a[1]\n        if instability < min_instability:\n            min_instability = instability\n    # Check removing last element\n    if n > 2:\n        instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n        if instability < min_instability:\n            min_instability = instability\n    # If n == 2, removing either gives 0 instability\n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are at the beginning and end of the sorted array, respectively.\n2. **Instability Calculation**:\n   - When we remove the first element, the new minimum is the second element in the sorted array, while the maximum remains the last element.\n   - When we remove the last element, the new maximum is the second-to-last element in the sorted array, while the minimum remains the first element.\n3. **Edge Cases**: If the array has only two elements, removing either element results in an array with zero instability.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum possible instability in O(n log n) time due to sorting, which is optimal for large input sizes up to 100,000 elements.",
