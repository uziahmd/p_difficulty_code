The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. Let me think. The key here is that the districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So when we remove some districts, the remaining ones must form a connected subtree. But how do we choose which ones to remove to maximize the sum?\n\nThe sum of 2^i is maximized by keeping the districts with the largest possible i values. However, since the districts must be connected, we can't just remove the smallest k districts. Because if those districts are in different parts of the tree, removing them might disconnect the tree.\n\nWait, but the districts with higher numbers have larger 2^i values. So our goal is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. So perhaps we need to find a subtree that includes the largest possible districts, and then remove the others.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems like a problem where we need to select a subtree with (n - k) nodes, and the sum of 2^i for those nodes is maximum. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, the optimal strategy would be to include the largest possible districts, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nSo maybe we can approach this by considering that the optimal subtree will contain the highest possible nodes. Let's think about it as a priority: we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. So perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we start with the highest-numbered node and then add the necessary nodes to connect it, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the districts are numbered from 1 to n, and the value is 2^i, the largest value is 2^n. So the optimal solution would definitely include district n. Then, the next largest is district n-1, but only if it's connected to the rest. But how to ensure that?\n\nThis feels similar to finding a tree with certain nodes, and choosing which nodes to keep. Maybe we can model this as a problem where we need to select (n - k) nodes that form a connected subtree, and maximize the sum of their 2^i values. Since 2^i is strictly increasing, the optimal selection is to include the largest possible nodes, but ensuring connectivity.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the subtree that includes the largest (n - k) districts, but how?\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal way is to include all districts except the k smallest ones, but only if those k can be removed without disconnecting the tree. However, this isn't always possible. For example, if the tree is a chain, and you have to remove some nodes in the middle, which would split the tree into parts. So the problem becomes more complex.\n\nAnother thought: the problem is equivalent to choosing a subtree with exactly (n -k) nodes, and the sum of 2^i is maximum. Since the sum is maximized by including the largest possible nodes, the optimal subtree must include as many of the largest nodes as possible. Therefore, perhaps we can model this as a priority-based selection, starting from the largest node and adding nodes that connect to the existing subtree.\n\nThis sounds similar to the problem of finding a tree with certain nodes, and using a priority queue to select the nodes with the highest values. However, how to manage the connectivity?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of this as a problem where we need to remove k nodes such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. To maximize the sum, we need to remove the nodes with the smallest possible values, but ensuring that their removal doesn't disconnect the tree. However, this seems challenging because removing a node may split the tree into multiple parts.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that after removal, the remaining districts form a connected component. So the remaining districts must be connected. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting a subtree of size (n -k) that has the maximum possible sum of 2^i. How can we find such a subtree?\n\nLet me think of this as a variation of the maximum spanning tree problem. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the value of each node is 2^i, which is very large for higher i, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all the nodes with the highest i's, possibly excluding some lower ones. However, the challenge is ensuring that these nodes are connected.\n\nSo here's an idea: the optimal subtree must include the node with the highest number, n. Then, we need to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible that are connected to it. So perhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from node n, and greedily include the nodes with the highest values first, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts are connected in a tree structure, and each district has a number of fans equal to $2^i$, where $i$ is the district number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since $2^i$ increases exponentially with $i$, we should prioritize keeping districts with higher numbers.\n3. **Connectivity**: The remaining districts must form a single connected component. Therefore, we need to ensure that the districts we keep are connected.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. **Greedy Selection**: Start from the highest-numbered district (n) and work downwards, ensuring that the selected districts form a connected subtree.\n2. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue (max-heap) to always consider the next highest-numbered district that can be connected to the current subtree.\n3. **DFS Traversal**: Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the tree and maintain connectivity while selecting the highest-value districts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    tree = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n\n    # We want to keep (n - k) nodes, starting from the largest possible\n    # We need to find a connected subtree with (n -k) nodes that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible\n\n    # The idea is to start from node n, and perform a BFS/DFS to collect nodes, but prioritize high-numbered ones\n    # We use a max heap to select the next node to include, but we have to make sure that the nodes are connected\n\n    # However, since the tree is connected, and we want to keep the largest nodes, we can use a greedy approach:\n    # We will remove the smallest nodes first, but only if they are not necessary for connectivity.\n\n    # Another approach: We can think of it as building a subtree with (n - k) nodes, starting from the largest node\n    # and adding nodes in a way that maintains connectivity.\n\n    # Let's use a priority queue (max heap) to store nodes that can be added to the subtree.\n    # Initially, we start with the largest node (n), then add its neighbors, but prioritize the larger ones.\n\n    # However, we need to track which nodes are included and ensure that the subtree remains connected.\n\n    # Instead, we can use a reverse approach: remove the smallest possible nodes that are not part of the required subtree.\n    # But how?\n\n    # Let's consider the following approach:\n    # We will select the nodes to keep as follows:\n    # - Start with the largest node (n).\n    # - Use a priority queue to process nodes in descending order.\n    # - Keep track of visited nodes.\n    # - For each node, if it's not visited, check its neighbors and add them to the priority queue if they haven't been processed yet.\n\n    # However, this approach may not work directly because we need to select exactly (n - k) nodes.\n\n    # Alternative idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm:\n    # We want to keep as many large nodes as possible.

Then, we select the top (n - k) nodes, and remove the rest.\n\n    # Wait, but that might not work because the subtree may not be connected.
