The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where the president wants to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the removed districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So the key is to select n - k districts that are connected, and maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, we want to keep as many higher-numbered districts as possible. But they have to be connected.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if we just take the highest possible numbers, maybe they aren't connected. So how do we find the optimal set?\n\nLet me think. The maximum sum would be achieved by keeping the districts with the largest possible numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. So maybe we can approach this by starting with the largest districts and then checking if they are connected. However, since the tree is connected, perhaps there's a way to greedily choose the districts.\n\nBut how to model this? Because when you remove some districts, the remaining ones must form a connected subtree. So the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree of size (n - k) that has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since 2^i increases with i, the optimal solution would be to include as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nSo perhaps the strategy is to include all districts from some number m upwards, but ensuring that they form a connected component. Wait, but that might not be possible. For example, if the tree is structured such that the highest-numbered districts are not connected without including lower ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of it as a problem where we need to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Since the sum is maximized by keeping higher-numbered nodes, perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we start by keeping all nodes except the first k, but then check if they are connected. If not, we need to adjust.\n\nBut that's not straightforward. Another approach: think of the problem as selecting which nodes to remove. We need to remove exactly k nodes, and the remaining must be connected. The sum is maximized when the remaining nodes have the highest possible values. So the idea is to keep the nodes with the largest possible numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected component.\n\nSo perhaps we can model this as follows: the optimal set of nodes to keep is the largest possible subset of nodes with the highest numbers, but connected. How to find that subset?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree. Since the tree is connected, and we need a connected subset. Let's imagine that we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So for example, the highest node (n) must be in the subset. Then, we need to include as many of the next highest nodes as possible, but connected to n.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes to include?\n\nAnother idea: The problem is similar to finding a subtree with exactly (n - k) nodes, which has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since 2^i is strictly increasing, the optimal subtree will contain the largest possible numbers. Therefore, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the nodes from some m up to n, but connected. But how to find m?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as choosing which nodes to exclude. The nodes to exclude are those with the smallest numbers, but in such a way that the remaining nodes form a connected component.\n\nWait, but maybe not. For example, if excluding some small nodes would allow us to include more large nodes. But given that the sum is 2^i, the larger the i, the better. So the best strategy is to include as many of the largest nodes as possible, even if that requires including some smaller ones.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the nodes must be connected. So suppose we have a tree where node n is connected only through node 1. Then, if we want to include node n, we must also include node 1. So if we have to remove k nodes, but including node 1 would require us to keep it, but maybe that's not optimal.\n\nBut in this case, the sum would be 2^1 + 2^n, which is worse than 2^n plus other nodes. So maybe in such a scenario, it's better to include node 1 and n, but that depends on how many nodes we can keep.\n\nThis suggests that the problem is more complex than just taking the top (n -k) nodes. Because even if you take the top (n -k) nodes, they may not be connected. So we need to find a subset of (n -k) nodes that are connected, and which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a problem where we need to find a subtree that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts are numbered from 1 to n, and each district i has 2^i fans. The key insight is to retain as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring the remaining districts form a connected subtree.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, which means there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: Since the value of each district increases exponentially with its number, we aim to retain the highest-numbered districts possible.\n3. **Subtree Selection**: We start from the highest-numbered node and perform a depth-first search (DFS) to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible while maintaining connectivity.\n4. **Exclusion of Nodes**: After determining the nodes to retain, the excluded nodes are those not included in this subtree.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n\n    # We need to select (n - k) nodes with maximum sum, which are connected\n    # The optimal strategy is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible\n    # Start from the highest node and do a DFS, keeping track of how many nodes we can take\n\n    keep = n - k\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    selected = set()\n\n    def dfs(u, parent):\n        # We want to prioritize higher-numbered nodes, so we should try to include them first\n        # However, since we are starting from the highest node, we can greedily include as many as possible\n        # But we need to make sure that we collect exactly 'keep' nodes\n        nonlocal keep\n        if keep <= 0:\n            return\n        visited[u] = True\n        selected.add(u)\n        keep -= 1\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if v != parent:\n                dfs(v, u)\n                if keep <= 0:\n                    return\n\n    # Start from the highest node\n    dfs(n, -1)\n\n    # Now, the selected set contains the nodes to keep\n    # The ones to remove are those not in selected\n    remove = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in selected:\n            remove.append(i)\n    remove.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, remove)))\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Traversal**: The solution starts from the highest-numbered node (n) and performs a DFS to traverse the tree. This ensures that we prioritize including higher-numbered nodes.\n2. **Selection of Nodes**: During the DFS traversal, we keep track of how many nodes we need to include (n - k). Once we have included enough nodes, we stop further traversal.\n3. **Excluded Nodes**: After determining the nodes to retain, the excluded nodes are those not included in the traversal. These are collected and sorted before being printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the highest-value nodes are retained while maintaining connectivity, leading to the optimal solution.",
