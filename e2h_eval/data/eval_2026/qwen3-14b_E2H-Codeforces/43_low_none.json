He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let's break down the steps:\n\nThe original string starts with some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, ensuring there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's, and the number of 'c's must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the order of characters must be correct: all a's first, then b's, then c's. Because each step appends to the end.\n\nSo the string must have a sequence of a's followed by b's followed by c's. And the counts must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nFirst, I need to check the structure of the string. Let's think about the structure:\n\nThe string should be composed of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So any valid string must have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, \"aabbc\" is okay, but \"ababc\" is not because the order is wrong.\n\nSo first step: check if the string is in the form a*b*c*. If not, return NO.\n\nThen, after confirming the structure, we need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts:\n\nLet's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of b's.\n\ncount_c = number of c's.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\nAfter A and B's steps, the string has some a's (at least 1) followed by some b's (at least 1). Then C adds c's. The number of c's added must be equal to either count_a (original a's) or count_b (original b's) at that time. But wait, when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's are the same as before adding the c's. Because the c's are added after. So the count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original).\n\nBut wait, the original count_a and count_b are the ones before adding the c's. So, when C appends the c's, the count of c's is equal to either count_a (original) or count_b (original). So in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). But the original count_a is the number of a's in the string, since the a's are only added in the first step. Similarly for the b's.\n\nWait, the original count_a is the number of a's in the string. Because after A and B's steps, the string is a's followed by b's. Then C adds c's. So in the final string, the count of a's is the same as the original count_a, and same for b's. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when C appends the c's, the number of c's is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the string. But at that moment, the string is the a's and b's. So the number of a's and b's is fixed. So the count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). Therefore, in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, the conditions are:\n\n1. The string must consist of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So the order is important.\n\n2. The count of c's must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nAdditionally, the original steps require that after B's step, there is at least one a and one b. So the original count_a and count_b must be at least 1. But since the string is formed by appending, the original count_a is the number of a's in the string, and original count_b is the number of b's. So in the final string, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1. Also, count_c must be >=1? Wait, no. Because C appends some number of c's. The problem says that C appends some number of c's. But the problem says that C is a good friend, so the number of c's he appends is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. So the count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. But since count_a and count_b are at least 1, then count_c is at least 1. So in the final string, there must be at least one c. So the string must have at least one c. Wait, but what if the count",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by appending 'b's to a string of 'a's and then appending 'c's such that the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Structure**: The string must consist of only 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validation Conditions**:\n   - There must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' (since both A and B ensure this).\n   - The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check if the string is in the form a*b*c*\n    i = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    # Check for 'a's first\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n    # Check for 'b's next\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n    # Check for 'c's next\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n    \n    if i != n:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if there is at least one 'a' and 'b'\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    result = is_valid_string(input_str)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Structure Check**: The string is checked to ensure it follows the order of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. This is done using a series of loops to check each segment of the string.\n2. **Count Validation**: After confirming the structure, the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are determined. The presence of at least one 'a' and 'b' is verified, ensuring the initial conditions set by A and B are met.\n3. **Final Check**: The count of 'c's is compared against the counts of 'a's and 'b's to determine if it matches either, which is required by the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that all conditions are checked efficiently, adhering to the problem constraints and providing the correct result.",
