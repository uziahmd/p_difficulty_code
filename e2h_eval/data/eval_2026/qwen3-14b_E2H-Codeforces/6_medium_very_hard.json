Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, return -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Let's rephrase the requirements. Each voucher has a duration of ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j such that:\n\n1. The sum of their durations is exactly x.\n2. They don't overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts (ri < lj) or the second ends before the first starts (rj < li).\n3. Find the minimum sum of their costs.\n\nSo, how do I approach this efficiently? Considering n can be up to 2e5, an O(n^2) approach would be way too slow. So we need something smarter.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. For each voucher, maybe we can find another voucher that fits the required duration and doesn't overlap. But how?\n\nLet me think about the durations. Suppose for a voucher with duration d, we need another voucher with duration x - d. So for each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with duration (x - d), and that they don't overlap.\n\nBut even that approach could be O(n^2) in the worst case if there are many vouchers with the same duration. However, perhaps we can pre-process vouchers by their duration and for each duration, keep track of the minimum cost for vouchers that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: for each voucher, we can look for vouchers that have duration (x - d) and are completely before it (i.e., their end day is less than the start day of the current voucher) or completely after it (their start day is greater than the end day of the current voucher).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers grouped by their duration. For example, a dictionary where key is duration, and value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher, check if there's a duration (x - d) in the dictionary.\n\nBut then, for each voucher with duration d, we need to find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration (x - d) that are non-overlapping with it.\n\nBut how to find those efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the two cases:\n\nCase 1: The other voucher ends before the current voucher starts. So for voucher i, which starts at li and ends at ri, we need a voucher j with duration (x - d_i) such that r_j < l_i. So for all such vouchers j, their end time is less than l_i.\n\nCase 2: The other voucher starts after the current voucher ends. So for voucher i, we need a voucher j with duration (x - d_i) such that l_j > r_i.\n\nSo for each voucher, we need to find the minimum cost in these two scenarios.\n\nNow, how can we quickly find the minimum cost for vouchers of a certain duration that end before a certain day (for case 1) or start after a certain day (for case 2)?\n\nLet's consider for each duration, we can have two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of end times, along with the minimum cost up to that end time. So for case 1, when looking for vouchers of duration (target) that end before l_i, we can binary search in the sorted end times to find the maximum end time that is less than l_i, and then get the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, for vouchers of duration (target) that start after r_i, we can have a sorted list of start times, and find the earliest start time that is greater than r_i, and then find the minimum cost from that point onwards.\n\nWait, but how do we pre-process this?\n\nLet me think. For each duration d, we can have:\n\n- A sorted list of end times (sorted in increasing order), and for each position in this list, we can keep track of the minimum cost up to that position. This way, when we want to find all vouchers with duration d that end before a certain value (say, L), we can binary search for the largest end time <= L, and then the min cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for start times, we can have a sorted list of start times, and for each position, the minimum cost from that position onwards. Wait, but for the start times, if we need vouchers that start after R (the end of current voucher), then we can find the first start time that is greater than R, and then take the minimum cost from that point onwards.\n\nBut how to pre-process these structures?\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. So create a dictionary, say, duration_map, where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\nFor each duration d in duration_map, we need to process two things:\n\na) For all vouchers with duration d, collect their end times, sort them, and compute a prefix min array. So for any query of \"find the minimum cost among vouchers with duration d that end before L\", we can binary search the end times for the largest end time <= L, and then look up the prefix min up to that index.\n\nb) Similarly, collect the start times of vouchers with duration d, sort them, and compute a suffix min array. For a query \"find the minimum cost among vouchers with duration d that start after R\", we can binary search the start times for the smallest start time >= R+1, and then look up the suffix min from that index.\n\nWait, but the suffix min array would need to track the minimum cost from a certain index to the end. So for example, if the start times are sorted, and for each index i in the sorted list, the suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to the end of the list.\n\nThis way, when we find the first start time >= R+1 (since if a voucher starts at R+1, then it's after the current voucher ends at R), then the suffix_min from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nSo for each duration d, we need to have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted end times (with prefix min)\n- Sorted start times (with suffix min)\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher, we can check if x - d exists in the duration_map. If it does, then we check both cases (case 1 and case 2) and find the minimal cost.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\nCompute its duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\nCheck if x - d is present in the duration_map. If not, skip.\n\nElse, for target_duration = x - d:\n\nCase 1: Find all vouchers with target_duration that end before li. The minimal cost among them.\n\nCase 2: Find all vouchers with target_duration that start after ri. The minimal cost among them.\n\nTake the minimum between case1 and case2, and add to the current voucher's cost. Keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i. Because the problem says i != j. However, since the duration_map includes all vouchers, including the current one, we need to ensure that in case the target_duration is equal to d (i.e., when x is even and d is x/2), we have to make sure that there's another voucher with that duration and non-overlapping.\n\nBut how to handle that? Well, during the processing, when we check for the case where the target_duration is the same as d, we need to make sure that there are at least two vouchers with that duration, and that the current voucher is not the same as the one being considered. However, that might complicate things. Alternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have multiple entries, and when we check, the code will automatically include other vouchers. But in the case where the current voucher is part of the target_duration group, we need to ensure that there's at least one other voucher in that group that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut perhaps the way the code is structured, even if the current voucher is part of the target_duration group, the code will find other vouchers. For example, if the current voucher's duration is d, and target_duration is also d. Then, for case 1, we look for vouchers in target_duration that end before li. But if the current voucher is in that group, but its end time is ri, which is >= li (since li is the start of the current voucher). So in that case, the current voucher won't be included in case 1. Similarly for case 2, the current voucher's start time is li, which is <= ri, so if we're looking for start times after ri, then the current voucher's start time is li, which is not after ri. Hence, even if the current voucher is in the target_duration group, it's not considered in either case. Therefore, the code will automatically avoid selecting the same voucher twice. Because for case 1 and case 2, the current voucher's own data won't be included.\n\nSo that's safe. So the code can proceed without worrying about the same voucher.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nFirst, preprocess all vouchers into duration_map. For each duration, collect all vouchers, then for each, sort the end times and compute prefix min, and sort the start times and compute suffix min.\n\nThen, for each voucher, check if x - d exists in the duration_map. If yes, then:\n\nCheck case1: find the minimum cost in target_duration's vouchers that end before li.\n\nCheck case2: find the minimum cost in target_duration's vouchers that start after ri.\n\nIf either case is possible, take the minimal between them, add to current voucher's cost, and update the global minimum.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about the data structures for each duration.\n\nFor example, for a duration d, let's have:\n\n- A list of end times, sorted in ascending order. And for each index, a prefix min array. So, for the sorted end times, prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers (indices 0..i). So, when we find the largest end time <= L, the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimum cost for vouchers ending before or equal to L.\n\nSimilarly, for the start times, sorted in ascending order, and a suffix_min array. For each index i, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to the end of the list. So, when we find the first start time >= R+1, then the suffix_min from that index gives the minimum cost for vouchers starting after R.\n\nNow, how to build these structures.\n\nFor each duration in duration_map:\n\nCollect all vouchers with that duration. For each voucher, store their li, ri, cost.\n\nThen, for the end times:\n\nSort the list of end times (ri) in ascending order. But also, we need to track the corresponding cost. Wait, but to compute the prefix min, we need to have the costs in the same order as the sorted end times.\n\nSo, for example, for a duration d, we can collect all vouchers, then sort them based on their end time (ri), and then create a list of their end times, and a list of their costs. Then, compute the prefix min array.\n\nSimilarly for start times: collect all vouchers, sort them based on their start time (li), and create a list of start times and their costs, then compute the suffix min array.\n\nSo for each duration, we need to have:\n\nsorted_ends = sorted list of (end_time, cost) sorted by end_time.\n\nsorted_starts = sorted list of (start_time, cost) sorted by start_time.\n\nBut actually, we can separate the end times and the costs. For example, sorted_end_times is a list of end times sorted in ascending order. And prefix_min_costs is a list where prefix_min_costs[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers in the sorted_end_times list.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_start_times and suffix_min_costs.\n\nSo, for each duration d:\n\nsorted_ends = sorted([voucher.ri for voucher in vouchers_with_d])\nBut no, we need to sort the vouchers based on their end time, and then collect the end times and the costs.\n\nWait, perhaps better to collect for each duration:\n\nsorted_end_list = sorted(vouchers_with_d, key=lambda v: v.ri)\nThen, end_times = [v.ri for v in sorted_end_list]\ncosts = [v.cost for v in sorted_end_list]\nprefix_min = [0]*len(costs)\nprefix_min[0] = costs[0]\nfor i in 1 to len(costs)-1:\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], costs[i])\n\nSimilarly for sorted_start_list = sorted(vouchers_with_d, key=lambda v: v.li)\nstart_times = [v.li for v in sorted_start_list]\ncosts = [v.cost for v in sorted_start_list]\nsuffix_min = [0]*len(costs)\nsuffix_min[-1] = costs[-1]\nfor i in len(costs)-2 downto 0:\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], costs[i])\n\nOnce these are built, then for a given L (like li of current voucher), we can perform a binary search on the end_times list to find the largest end_time <= L. Then, if such an index exists, the prefix_min at that index is the minimum cost for vouchers ending before L.\n\nSimilarly, for a given R (like ri of current voucher), we can perform a binary search on the start_times list to find the first start_time >= R+1. Then, if such an index exists, the suffix_min at that index is the minimum cost for vouchers starting after R.\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers. For each voucher, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nWe need to group vouchers by their duration. So create a dictionary, say, from duration to list of vouchers.\n\nOnce that's done, for each duration d in the dictionary, process the sorted_end_list and sorted_start_list, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through each voucher in the original list.\n\nFor each voucher:\n\nd = ri - li + 1\n\ntarget = x - d\n\nif target not in duration_map, continue.\n\nelse:\n\nCheck for case1 and case2.\n\nFor case1:\n\nWe need vouchers with duration target, which end before li.\n\nSo, for the target duration, get the sorted_end_list and the prefix_min array.\n\nWe need to find the largest end_time <= li - 1 (since ri < lj, but for the voucher j, ri_j must be < l_i. Wait, the voucher j's end time is rj. So for case1, rj < l_i. So the maximum allowed end time is l_i - 1.\n\nSo, for the target duration, we look into the sorted_end_list. So, we can perform a binary search for l_i - 1.\n\nIf found, then get the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for case2: we need vouchers with duration target, which start after ri. So l_j > ri. So the minimum start time is ri + 1.\n\nSo for the target duration, look into the sorted_start_list. Find the first start time >= ri + 1. Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nSo, for each of these cases, if there is a valid entry, take the minimum cost and add to current voucher's cost. Keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the binary searches correctly.\n\nFor case1:\n\nIn the sorted_end_list of target duration, we can perform a binary search to find the rightmost end time <= l_i - 1.\n\nFor example, using bisect_right. Let me think. Suppose we have a list of end times sorted in ascending order. We want to find the maximum end time that is <= L (where L is l_i - 1). The bisect_right function returns the insertion point for L in the list. So, if we take the index as bisect_right(end_times, L) - 1. If that index is >=0, then there are elements <= L. The prefix_min at that index is the minimum cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case2: in the sorted_start_list of target duration, find the first start time >= R + 1 (where R is ri). Using bisect_left to find the insertion point. If the insertion point is within the list length, then the suffix_min at that insertion point is the minimum cost.\n\nSo, for example, sorted_start_times is a list sorted in ascending order. We want the first element >= R + 1. Using bisect_left, which returns the first index where the element is >= R + 1. If that index is less than len(sorted_start_times), then the suffix_min from that index is the minimum cost.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle these steps.\n\nNow, the problem is how to structure this in Python.\n\nBut first, what about the edge cases?\n\nFor example, if x is 0? But according to input constraints, x >= 2? No, the input says x can be as low as 2? Wait, the input says x is between 2 and 2e5. Wait, the first line says n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5). So x is at least 2. So the sum of two durations is x. Each duration is at least 1 (since li ≤ ri, so duration is ri - li + 1 ≥ 1). So, for example, if x is 2, then each voucher must have duration 1 and 1. So the code needs to check for that.\n\nAnother edge case: when a voucher's duration is exactly x. Then, we need another voucher with duration 0, which is impossible. So that case is skipped.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nImplementing the duration_map:\n\nIn Python, for each duration, we can have a list of vouchers. Then, for each duration, we can precompute sorted_end_list, sorted_start_list, prefix_min, suffix_min.\n\nBut for large n, this can be done efficiently.\n\nNow, for each voucher in the original list, we process it as follows:\n\ncurrent voucher has li, ri, cost.\n\nd = ri - li + 1\n\ntarget = x - d\n\nif target not in duration_map: continue\n\nelse:\n\nprocess case1 and case2.\n\nSo, for case1:\n\nwe need to find vouchers with target duration that end before li.\n\nSo, for the target duration, get the sorted_end_list and the prefix_min array.\n\nThe end_times list is the list of ri for vouchers with target duration, sorted in ascending order.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor the target duration, we can get the list of end_times and prefix_min.\n\nL = li - 1\n\nusing bisect.bisect_right(end_times, L) gives the insertion point. idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, L) - 1.\n\nif idx >= 0, then min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[idx]\n\nelse, no such voucher.\n\nSimilarly, for case2:\n\nR = ri\n\nwe need start times >= R + 1.\n\nsorted_start_times is the list of li for vouchers with target duration, sorted in ascending order.\n\nusing bisect.bisect_left(start_times, R + 1) gives the insertion point. idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, R + 1)\n\nif idx < len(start_times), then min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[idx]\n\nelse, no such voucher.\n\nSo, for each case, if possible, take the min between case1 and case2, add to current voucher's cost, and track the overall minimum.\n\nBut how to store the sorted_end_list and prefix_min for each duration.\n\nLet me think about how to structure the duration_map.\n\nPerhaps, for each duration d, we can precompute:\n\n- sorted_ends: list of end times (sorted)\n- prefix_mins: list of min costs up to each index\n- sorted_starts: list of start times (sorted)\n- suffix_mins: list of min costs from each index onwards\n\nSo, for example, in Python, the duration_map can be a dictionary mapping d to a tuple (sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins).\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nfor each d in duration_map:\n\nvouchers = list of vouchers with duration d.\n\nsorted_ends_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nsorted_ends = [v.ri for v in sorted_ends_vouchers]\n\nprefix_mins = [ ... ]\n\nSimilarly for sorted_starts_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\nsorted_starts = [v.li for v in sorted_starts_vouchers]\n\nsuffix_mins = [ ... ]\n\nBut how to compute prefix_mins and suffix_mins.\n\nFor prefix_mins:\n\nprefix_mins = [0] * len(sorted_ends)\n\nprefix_mins[0] = sorted_ends_vouchers[0].cost\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_ends)-1:\n\nprefix_mins[i] = min(prefix_mins[i-1], sorted_ends_vouchers[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for suffix_mins:\n\nsuffix_mins = [0] * len(sorted_starts)\n\nsuffix_mins[-1] = sorted_starts_vouchers[-1].cost\n\nfor i in range(len(sorted_starts)-2, -1, -1):\n\nsuffix_mins[i] = min(suffix_mins[i+1], sorted_starts_vouchers[i].cost)\n\nSo, in code, during preprocessing.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher, we can check the target duration.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nBut how to handle the vouchers? Let's represent each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost).\n\nSo, during input processing:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost) )\n\nThen, create the duration_map:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor l, r, cost in vouchers:\n\n    duration = r - l + 1\n\n    duration_map[duration].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_map, process the sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins.\n\nBut in Python, for each duration, we can precompute these structures and store them in the duration_map. So perhaps:\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor d in duration_map:\n\n    # process sorted_ends and prefix_mins\n\n    vouchers_d = duration_map[d]\n\n    # sort by ri\n\n    sorted_ends_vouchers = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    sorted_ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_ends_vouchers]\n\n    # compute prefix_mins\n\n    prefix_mins = [0]*len(sorted_ends)\n\n    prefix_mins[0] = sorted_ends_vouchers[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_ends)):\n\n        prefix_mins[i] = min(prefix_mins[i-1], sorted_ends_vouchers[i][2])\n\n    # sort by li\n\n    sorted_starts_vouchers = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    sorted_starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_starts_vouchers]\n\n    # compute suffix_mins\n\n    suffix_mins = [0]*len(sorted_starts)\n\n    suffix_mins[-1] = sorted_starts_vouchers[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_starts)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_mins[i] = min(suffix_mins[i+1], sorted_starts_vouchers[i][2])\n\n    # store in preprocessed as (sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins)\n\n    preprocessed[d] = (sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins)\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher in the original list, we can process.\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nfor l, r, cost in vouchers:\n\n    d = r - l + 1\n\n    target = x - d\n\n    if target not in preprocessed:\n\n        continue\n\n    # process case1 and case2\n\n    # case1: find vouchers with target duration that end before l (rj < l)\n\n    # for case1, L = l - 1\n\n    # get the sorted_ends, prefix_mins for target duration\n\n    sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins = preprocessed[target]\n\n    # case1:\n\n    L = l - 1\n\n    # find the largest end <= L\n\n    # use bisect_right on sorted_ends\n\n    import bisect\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends, L) - 1\n\n    case1_min = float('inf')\n\n    if idx >= 0:\n\n        case1_min = prefix_mins[idx]\n\n    # case2: find vouchers with target duration that start after r (lj > r)\n\n    R = r\n\n    # find first start >= R + 1\n\n    idx_start = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_starts, R + 1)\n\n    case2_min = float('inf')\n\n    if idx_start < len(sorted_starts):\n\n        case2_min = suffix_mins[idx_start]\n\n    # current_min is min(case1_min, case2_min)\n\n    current_min = min(case1_min, case2_min)\n\n    if current_min != float('inf'):\n\n        total = current_min + cost\n\n        if total < answer:\n\n            answer = total\n\nAt the end, if answer is still infinity, output -1 else answer.\n\nWait, but what if the target duration is same as d? For example, if x is 4 and d is 2. Then, target is 2. So, the code checks for vouchers with duration 2, which may include the current voucher. But in case1, the code looks for end times <= l-1. Since the current voucher's end time is r, which is >= l (since l <= r). So, if the current voucher is in the target duration group, then when checking for case1, the current voucher's end time (r) is not <= l-1 (since l <= r). So, it's not included. Similarly for case2, the current voucher's start time is l, which is <= r. So when R is r, R+1 is r+1. So the current voucher's start time is l, which is <= r, so not >= r+1. Hence, it's not included. Therefore, the code will not select the same voucher again.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and overlapping? For example, if there are two vouchers with duration 2 and non-overlapping. The code would find them.\n\nNow, what about the example given?\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo x is 5. So for each voucher, we check for target = 5 - duration.\n\nFor the first voucher (duration 3), target is 2. So looking for vouchers with duration 2.\n\nCase1: l of current voucher is 1. So L = 1-1 = 0. Looking for end times <= 0. The vouchers with duration 2 are the second, third, fourth. Their end times are 2, 6, 2. So sorted_ends would be [2, 2, 6]. So bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) is 0, idx = -1. So case1 is invalid.\n\nCase2: R is 3. Looking for start times >= 3+1=4. The sorted_starts for duration 2 are the start times of vouchers 2, 4, 3. Wait, the vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: l=1, r=2, cost 5.\n\nvoucher 4: l=1, r=2, cost 4.\n\nvoucher 3: l=5, r=6, cost 1.\n\nSo when sorted by start time, the sorted_starts would be [1,1,5]. So bisect_left([1,1,5], 4) → returns 2. So suffix_mins[2] is 1. So case2_min is 1. So current_min is 1. Adding to current voucher's cost (4) gives 5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the code would capture this.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input:\n\n3 2\n\nVouchers:\n\n4 6 3 → duration 3\n\n2 4 1 → duration 3\n\n3 5 4 → duration 3.\n\nEach has duration 3. x is 2. So for each voucher, target is 2 - 3 = -1. Which is not present in duration_map. So no possible pairs. Hence output is -1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and possible overlaps?\n\nNow, considering the code's efficiency.\n\nThe preprocessing step for each duration is O(m log m), where m is the number of vouchers with that duration. For all durations, the total is O(n log n) time.\n\nFor each voucher, during the main loop, the processing is O(log m) time for the binary searches. So overall O(n log n) time.\n\nWhich should be acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the preprocessed data correctly. For example, when a duration is not present in the preprocessed map (but that's checked during the main loop).\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, using the bisect module.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImport bisect.\n\nBut in the code, during preprocessing, for each duration, we have to store the sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        vouchers.append( (l, r, cost) )\n    \n    # Preprocess\n    duration_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        duration_map[duration].append( (l, r, cost) )\n    \n    preprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins)\n    \n    for d in duration_map:\n        vouchers_d = duration_map[d]\n        # process sorted_ends and prefix_mins\n        sorted_ends_vouchers = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_ends_vouchers]\n        prefix_mins = []\n        if len(sorted_ends) == 0:\n            pass\n        else:\n            prefix_mins = [0]*len(sorted_ends)\n            prefix_mins[0] = sorted_ends_vouchers[0][2]\n            for i in range(1, len(sorted_ends)):\n                prefix_mins[i] = min(prefix_mins[i-1], sorted_ends_vouchers[i][2])\n        # process sorted_starts and suffix_mins\n        sorted_starts_vouchers = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_starts_vouchers]\n        suffix_mins = [0]*len(sorted_starts)\n        if len(sorted_starts) == 0:\n            pass\n        else:\n            suffix_mins[-1] = sorted_starts_vouchers[-1][2]\n            for i in range(len(sorted_starts)-2, -1, -1):\n                suffix_mins[i] = min(suffix_mins[i+1], sorted_starts_vouchers[i][2])\n        # store in preprocessed\n        preprocessed[d] = (sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        target = x - d\n        if target not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        # Get the preprocessed data for target\n        sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins = preprocessed[target]\n        # Case1: find vouchers with target duration ending before l (rj < l)\n        L = l - 1\n        # find idx in sorted_ends\n        if len(sorted_ends) == 0:\n            case1_min = float('inf')\n        else:\n            idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends, L) - 1\n            if idx < 0:\n                case1_min = float('inf')\n            else:\n                case1_min = prefix_mins[idx]\n        # Case2: find vouchers with target duration starting after r (lj > r)\n        R = r\n        if len(sorted_starts) == 0:\n            case2_min = float('inf')\n        else:\n            idx_start = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_starts, R + 1)\n            if idx_start >= len(sorted_starts):\n                case2_min = float('inf')\n            else:\n                case2_min = suffix_mins[idx_start]\n        current_min = min(case1_min, case2_min)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = current_min + cost\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nBut wait, in the preprocessing code, for the case when the duration has zero vouchers (but that's impossible since duration_map is built from the vouchers, so each duration in duration_map has at least one voucher).\n\nBut during the code, for the target duration, when we check preprocessed[target], which is built only if there are vouchers. So during the main loop, when target is in preprocessed, the sorted_ends and sorted_starts are non-empty.\n\nBut during the code, when target is in preprocessed, then the sorted_ends and sorted_starts are non-empty. So in the main loop, when we check for case1 and case2, we can safely assume that the sorted_ends and sorted_starts are non-empty. However, in code, during the case when target is present, but the sorted_ends is empty? No, because the target is present in preprocessed only if there are vouchers for that duration. Hence, the sorted_ends and sorted_starts are non-empty. So the code can skip checking len(sorted_ends) == 0.\n\nWait, no. Because during preprocessing, for each duration in duration_map (which has at least one voucher), the code processes sorted_ends and sorted_starts. So for target in preprocessed, the sorted_ends and sorted_starts are non-empty.\n\nSo the code can remove the len checks in the main loop.\n\nSo the code for case1 and case2 in the main loop can be simplified.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\n        # Case1: find vouchers with target duration ending before l (rj < l)\n        L = l - 1\n        # find idx in sorted_ends\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends, L) - 1\n        if idx < 0:\n            case1_min = float('inf')\n        else:\n            case1_min = prefix_mins[idx]\n        # Case2: find vouchers with target duration starting after r (lj > r)\n        R = r\n        idx_start = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_starts, R + 1)\n        if idx_start >= len(sorted_starts):\n            case2_min = float('inf')\n        else:\n            case2_min = suffix_mins[idx_start]\n\nBut what about when the target duration is the same as the current voucher's duration? Well, the code handles it correctly.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nBut in the first sample input:\n\nThe first voucher is (1,3,4). Its duration is 3. target is 5-3=2. preprocessed has target=2. For that, sorted_ends is [2,2,6], prefix_mins is [5,4,1] ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: (1,2,5)\n\nvoucher 4: (1,2,4)\n\nvoucher 3: (5,6,1)\n\nsorted_ends_vouchers is sorted by ri. The ri's are 2, 2, 6. So sorted_ends_vouchers is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)] ?\n\nNo, the sorted_ends_vouchers is sorted by x[1], which is ri. So for vouchers (1,2,5) (ri=2), (1,2,4) (ri=2), (5,6,1) (ri=6). So sorted_ends_vouchers would be ordered as [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]? Or does the sort compare the ri and if equal, the order is arbitrary? Well, the sorted function in Python is stable, but when two elements have the same key, their relative order is preserved. However, in this case, the code sorts the vouchers by ri, so for the two vouchers with ri=2, their order may vary, but the prefix_mins would take the minimum of the costs.\n\nIn this case, the first voucher in sorted_ends_vouchers would be (1,2,5) and (1,2,4), then (5,6,1). The prefix_mins would be:\n\nprefix_mins[0] = 5\n\nprefix_mins[1] = min(5,4) =4\n\nprefix_mins[2] = min(4, 1) = 1.\n\nSo sorted_ends is [2,2,6], prefix_m",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers whose combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, `x`, while minimizing the total cost. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing Vouchers by Duration**: Group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently looking up vouchers with specific durations during the main processing phase.\n2. **Sorting and Prefix/Suffix Minimum Arrays**: For each duration, sort vouchers by their end times and start times. Additionally, compute prefix minimum arrays for end-sorted vouchers and suffix minimum arrays for start-sorted vouchers. These arrays help quickly determine the minimum cost of vouchers that end before a certain day or start after a certain day.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration (i.e., `x - duration`). Use binary search on the preprocessed sorted arrays to find valid non-overlapping vouchers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess duration_map\n    duration_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        duration_map[duration].append((l, r, cost))\n    \n    preprocessed = dict()\n    \n    for d in duration_map:\n        vouchers_d = duration_map[d]\n        # Process sorted_ends and prefix_mins\n        sorted_ends_vouchers = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_ends = [v[1] for v in sorted_ends_vouchers]\n        prefix_mins = [0] * len(sorted_ends)\n        prefix_mins[0] = sorted_ends_vouchers[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_ends)):\n            prefix_mins[i] = min(prefix_mins[i-1], sorted_ends_vouchers[i][2])\n        # Process sorted_starts and suffix_mins\n        sorted_starts_vouchers = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_starts = [v[0] for v in sorted_starts_vouchers]\n        suffix_mins = [0] * len(sorted_starts)\n        suffix_mins[-1] = sorted_starts_vouchers[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_starts) - 2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_mins[i] = min(suffix_mins[i+1], sorted_starts_vouchers[i][2])\n        # Store in preprocessed\n        preprocessed[d] = (sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        current_duration = r - l + 1\n        target = x - current_duration\n        if target not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        sorted_ends, prefix_mins, sorted_starts, suffix_mins = preprocessed[target]\n        # Case 1: find vouchers ending before l\n        L = l - 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends, L) - 1\n        case1_min = float('inf')\n        if idx >= 0:\n            case1_min = prefix_mins[idx]\n        # Case 2: find vouchers starting after r\n        R = r\n        idx_start = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_starts, R + 1)\n        case2_min = float('inf')\n        if idx_start < len(sorted_starts):\n            case2_min = suffix_mins[idx_start]\n        current_min = min(case1_min, case2_min)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = current_min + cost\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end times and start times.
