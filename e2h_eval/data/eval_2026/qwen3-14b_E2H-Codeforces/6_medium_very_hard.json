Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, Leha wants to choose two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x, and they don't overlap. And we need to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, the duration of a voucher is ri - li + 1. So for each voucher, I can calculate that. Then, the sum of two durations must be exactly x. Also, the two vouchers must not overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to find all pairs of vouchers that satisfy these conditions and find the minimum cost.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, checking all possible pairs (O(n²)) would be way too slow. So I need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each voucher, perhaps I can find another voucher that has a duration of (x - duration_i), and that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut how to efficiently find those?\n\nLet's think about the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For example, for each possible duration d, keep track of the minimum cost of vouchers with that duration. But maybe even more than that: for each duration d, have a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their start and end times, so that we can query for non-overlapping ones.\n\nWait, but for each voucher i with duration d, we need to find vouchers j with duration (x - d) that do not overlap with i. And then find the minimum cost among those j's.\n\nSo, perhaps for each voucher, we can check if there exists a voucher of duration (x - d_i) that starts after the end of voucher i, or ends before the start of voucher i. And for those vouchers, find the minimum cost.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\n- Precompute for each possible duration d, the list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher i with duration d, we look for vouchers of duration (x - d). Let's call that target duration t = x - d_i.\n\nIf t is not present in our duration map, then we can't use this voucher i. Otherwise, for each voucher j with duration t, we check if they don't overlap with i.\n\nBut again, checking all vouchers j for each i would be O(n²) in worst case. So that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For each duration t, we can pre-process the vouchers with that duration, sorted by their start time and end time. Then, for a given voucher i with duration d, and target duration t, we can find the minimum cost of vouchers j with duration t that end before the start of i (so that they are non-overlapping), or start after the end of i.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can split the problem into two parts:\n\na) Find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration t that end before the start of i (i.e., rj < li). Because then, voucher j ends before voucher i starts.\n\nb) Find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration t that start after the end of i (i.e., lj > ri). Because then, voucher j starts after voucher i ends.\n\nFor each of these two cases, if there are any such vouchers, we can take the minimum cost and combine with the cost of voucher i, and keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut how to efficiently compute a) and b) for each voucher i?\n\nFor part a: For vouchers with duration t, we need to find those that end before li. Since the vouchers are sorted by their end time, we can perform a binary search to find the earliest end time that is less than li. Wait, but we want all vouchers that end before li. So if we have a list of vouchers with duration t sorted by their end time, then we can find the maximum end time that is less than li, and among those, find the minimum cost.\n\nWait, but how to get the minimum cost? Maybe for each duration t, we can sort the vouchers by their end time, and also maintain a prefix minimum cost array. Similarly, for the start time.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration t, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time, and for each position in the list, we have the minimum cost up to that point. So when we find the latest voucher j that ends before li, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers sorted by start time, we can have a suffix min array. For example, for vouchers with duration t sorted by start time, we can find the earliest voucher that starts after ri, and then take the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers, group them by their duration. For each duration d, store two sorted lists:\n\n   a) A list sorted by end time (ri), along with their costs. Also, for this list, create a prefix minimum array. So for each index i in the list, the prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 elements.\n\n   b) A list sorted by start time (li), along with their costs. Also, create a suffix minimum array. So for each index i in the list, the suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among elements from i to the end.\n\nWait, but for part a (vouchers ending before li), we can take the sorted list of end times for duration t. We can binary search for the largest end time that is less than li. Then, the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimum cost among all such vouchers.\n\nFor part b (vouchers starting after ri), we take the list of vouchers with duration t sorted by their start time. We can binary search for the first start time that is greater than ri. Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimum cost among all such vouchers.\n\nThis way, for each voucher i, when looking for vouchers of duration t=x - d_i, we can check both possibilities (before and after) and find the minimal cost in O(log m) time where m is the number of vouchers with duration t.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor all vouchers, compute their durations. Then, group them by duration. For each duration d, pre-process the sorted lists and prefix/suffix mins.\n\nThen, for each voucher i:\n\n- Compute d_i = ri - li + 1.\n\n- Compute t = x - d_i. If t is not present in the duration groups, skip.\n\n- Else, for the group of vouchers with duration t:\n\n   a) Check for vouchers that end before li. So find the max end time <= li-1. The minimal cost for these is the prefix_min up to that index.\n\n   b) Check for vouchers that start after ri. So find the min start time >= ri+1. The minimal cost for these is the suffix_min from that index.\n\n   For each of a and b, if found, add the cost of voucher i plus the found min cost, and keep track of the global minimum.\n\nSo the key is to pre-process for each duration d, the sorted lists and prefix/suffix mins.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each duration d, we can have:\n\n- A list of vouchers with that duration. For each such voucher, we can collect their (li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, for the sorted lists:\n\nFor the end time sorted list:\n\nSort the vouchers by their ri. Then, create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], cost_i).\n\nSimilarly, for the start time sorted list:\n\nSort the vouchers by their li. Then, create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], cost_i).\n\nWait, but for the suffix min, perhaps it's better to build it from the end. Like:\n\nOnce the list is sorted by li, for each index i in the list, the suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end of the list.\n\nSo, for example, for the list [v1, v2, v3], sorted by li:\n\nsuffix_min[0] = min(v1.cost, suffix_min[1])\n\nsuffix_min[1] = min(v2.cost, suffix_min[2])\n\nsuffix_min[2] = v3.cost\n\nSo building that array would allow us to find the minimum cost in the suffix starting at a certain index.\n\nNow, for each voucher i, and target duration t, we can process as follows:\n\nCase 1: Find vouchers with duration t that end before li. So for the end-sorted list of duration t:\n\nWe can binary search for the largest ri_j that is <= li - 1. If such an element exists, then the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost for this case.\n\nCase 2: Find vouchers with duration t that start after ri. So for the start-sorted list of duration t:\n\nWe can binary search for the smallest li_j that is >= ri + 1. If such an element exists, then the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost for this case.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we check both cases, and take the minimum between the two possibilities (if any) and add to the current voucher's cost.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement the binary searches.\n\nFor case 1: the end_sorted list is sorted by ri. So for a given value of li-1, we can find the rightmost element in the list with ri <= li-1. For example, using bisect_right.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module has bisect_right, which returns the insertion point. So for example, if we have a list of end times, sorted, and we want to find the largest end time <= target, then bisect_right gives us the index where the insertion would happen. So the index is bisect_right(end_list, target) - 1. But we need to check if that index is valid (i.e., >=0).\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: the start_sorted list is sorted by li. For a given target of ri+1, we can find the first li_j >= target. This can be done with bisect_left. The index would be the insertion point. If that index is within the list, then all elements from that index onwards have li_j >= target. The suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nFor each duration d, we need to have:\n\n- end_sorted: list of (ri) sorted, along with their costs. Also, a prefix_min array.\n\nWait, but how to get the prefix_min. For example, for the end_sorted list, which is sorted by ri, we can have a list of the ri's, and a list of the prefix minima. So for the end_sorted list, we can have a list of the ri's, and a list of the prefix_min_costs, where prefix_min_costs[i] is the minimum cost from the first voucher up to the i-th voucher in the end_sorted list.\n\nSimilarly for the start_sorted list, sorted by li, and a suffix_min_costs array.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nFor each duration d in the grouped vouchers:\n\n   end_sorted = sorted list of vouchers by ri. For each voucher in this list, we can collect the ri and cost.\n\n   Then, create a list of end_times = [voucher.ri for voucher in end_sorted]\n\n   Also, create a prefix_min array of the same length. prefix_min[0] = end_sorted[0].cost. Then, for i>0, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, for the start_sorted list:\n\n   start_sorted = sorted list of vouchers by li.\n\n   start_times = [voucher.li for voucher in start_sorted]\n\n   suffix_min array: start from the end. suffix_min[-1] = start_sorted[-1].cost. For i in range(len(start_sorted)-2, -1, -1): suffix_min[i] = min(start_sorted[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1])\n\nOnce this is preprocessed, for any voucher i, when checking for duration t, we can:\n\nCheck if t exists in the grouped data.\n\nIf yes:\n\n   For case 1 (end before li):\n\n      target_end = li - 1\n\n      using the end_times list of duration t, perform bisect_right to find the insertion index. Then, if index > 0, then the prefix_min up to index-1 is the min cost for vouchers that end before li.\n\n   For case 2 (start after ri):\n\n      target_start = ri + 1\n\n      using the start_times list of duration t, perform bisect_left to find the insertion index. If the index is <= len(start_times) -1, then the suffix_min from index is the min cost for vouchers that start after ri.\n\nSo, for each of these two cases, if there are valid vouchers, we can get the minimal cost and add it to voucher i's cost.\n\nNow, the overall steps for the code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers, each with li, ri, cost. For each, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup all vouchers by their duration. For example, a dictionary where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers. Then, for each duration, preprocess the end_sorted and start_sorted lists, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through each voucher in the original list. For each voucher i:\n\n   d_i = duration of voucher i.\n\n   t = x - d_i.\n\n   if t is not in the grouped durations, skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      check for vouchers of duration t that can be paired with voucher i.\n\n      for case 1:\n\n         get the end_sorted list and prefix_min array for duration t.\n\n         target_end = li - 1\n\n         find the index in end_times (sorted) where end_time <= target_end.\n\n         if such index exists (i.e., index >=0), then the min cost is prefix_min[index].\n\n         add this to voucher i's cost and consider as a candidate.\n\n      for case 2:\n\n         get the start_sorted list and suffix_min array for duration t.\n\n         target_start = ri + 1\n\n         find the index in start_times (sorted) where start_time >= target_start.\n\n         if such index exists (i.e., index < len(start_times)), then the min cost is suffix_min[index].\n\n         add this to voucher i's cost and consider as a candidate.\n\n      take the minimum between the two cases (if any) and update the global answer.\n\nFinally, after checking all vouchers, if the global answer was found, output it. Else, output -1.\n\nBut wait, there's a problem here. What if the same voucher is considered twice? For example, voucher j is in the group of duration t, and voucher i is in the group of duration d_i. But when processing voucher j, we might check for vouchers of duration t' = x - d_j. Suppose that t' is d_i, and then voucher i could be considered again. However, since the problem requires that the two vouchers are different (i != j), how do we avoid considering the same voucher twice?\n\nWait, but when we process voucher i, and look for vouchers of duration t, which may include voucher j. However, if voucher j is in the same group as t (i.e., duration t), then when we process voucher i, we look for vouchers j that are not overlapping with i. But voucher j could be the same as voucher i? No, because the problem says i != j. So, in the case where t is equal to d_i (i.e., x = 2*d_i), then when processing voucher i, we would look for vouchers of duration t = d_i. However, in that case, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i. However, in the case where the group of duration t has multiple vouchers, including voucher i itself, the code as written would include voucher i in the possible candidates. So, when we process voucher i, the code would check for vouchers j in the same group, but we need to ensure that j is not i.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because in the preprocessing, the group for duration t includes all vouchers with that duration, including voucher i if t is d_i. So, for example, if t = d_i, and voucher i is in the group for duration t. When processing voucher i, and looking for vouchers j in the group t, the code would check if there are any j in the group that are non-overlapping with i. But if the group contains voucher i itself, then during the check, it's possible that voucher j is i. But since the problem requires two different vouchers, we need to make sure that j is not i.\n\nSo, this introduces a problem. How can we handle that?\n\nFor example, suppose that voucher i has duration d_i, and t = x - d_i is also d_i. Then, during the processing of voucher i, we look for other vouchers in the same group (duration d_i) that are non-overlapping. However, if the voucher i is the only one in the group, then we can't pair with it. But if there are multiple vouchers in the group, then during the processing, we need to make sure that the j is not i.\n\nBut how to handle that in the code?\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we ensure that the voucher j is not the same as voucher i?\n\nOne approach is, when processing voucher i, and when checking for vouchers in the same duration group (t = d_i), we need to make sure that the j is not i. However, how can we do that?\n\nBut perhaps during the preprocessing, for the group of duration t, when we are looking for vouchers j that are non-overlapping with i, we can exclude voucher i from consideration. However, how?\n\nBut that seems difficult. Because when we process voucher i, the group t may contain voucher i. So during the binary search steps, when we find the min cost for vouchers j in the group, how do we know that voucher j is not the same as voucher i?\n\nAn alternative idea: when the group t is the same as d_i, then during the processing of voucher i, the code may find that the min cost is from voucher i itself. But in that case, we need to check whether there's another voucher in the group that meets the condition. For example, if the min cost comes from voucher i, but there's another voucher in the group that also meets the non-overlapping condition, then we can use that. Otherwise, we cannot use voucher i itself.\n\nBut how to handle this in code?\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's think of an example. Suppose there are two vouchers, A and B, both with duration d. Suppose x = 2d. When processing voucher A, we look for vouchers in the group of duration d. So, the code would check for vouchers that end before A's start or start after A's end. Now, if voucher B is non-overlapping with A, then it's okay. But if voucher B is overlapping with A, then the code would not consider it. However, if voucher A is the only one in the group, then the code would try to pair A with itself, which is invalid.\n\nSo, in this case, during the processing of voucher i, when the group t is d_i, we need to check whether there are other vouchers in the group that are non-overlapping with i. But how?\n\nOne approach is to, during the binary search steps, check whether the voucher found is the same as voucher i. But how to track that? Because the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays just store the minimum cost, not the actual vouchers. So, for example, if the minimum cost comes from voucher i itself, then we need to check if there is another voucher in the group that also satisfies the non-overlapping condition and has the same or lower cost.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: during the preprocessing for each duration, for the end_sorted and start_sorted lists, we can have multiple entries. For example, if a voucher is in the group, and during the processing of voucher i, we need to check if there's at least one voucher in the group (other than i) that meets the condition. But how to do that?\n\nAnother approach is to allow the code to find the minimal cost, but then check if that minimal cost is achieved by a different voucher. However, this seems computationally expensive.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, when the code finds the minimal cost for case 1 or case 2, it's possible that the minimal cost is from the voucher i itself. In that case, we need to check if there's another voucher in the group that also meets the non-overlapping condition.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing steps, for each duration, we can have multiple vouchers. So when voucher i is processed, and the group is t = d_i, then during the binary search, the code will find the minimal cost in the group. However, if that minimal cost is from voucher i itself, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the group that meet the non-overlapping condition.\n\nBut this seems very complicated. How can we handle this?\n\nPerhaps, during the processing of voucher i, when we are considering vouchers of duration t, and if t is equal to d_i, then during the case 1 and case 2 checks, we need to exclude voucher i itself from consideration.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, for example, in case 1: we are looking for vouchers in the group t that end before li. Suppose that voucher i is in the group t. So, during the binary search, the code finds the minimal cost for vouchers in the group that end before li. However, if voucher i itself ends before li (but that's impossible, since voucher i's end time is ri. And li is the start time of voucher i. So ri >= li. So the target for case 1 is li-1, which is less than ri. So voucher i's end time is ri, which is larger than li-1. So voucher i would not be included in the case 1. So, when processing voucher i, case 1 is looking for vouchers that end before li, which is before voucher i's start time. So voucher i can't be part of that case. Therefore, in case 1, the voucher i is not included.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: looking for vouchers that start after ri. Voucher i's start time is li. So for case 2, the target is ri + 1. Voucher i's start time is li, which is <= ri. So voucher i's start time is not >= ri +1. Therefore, voucher i is not part of case 2.\n\nTherefore, during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers in the same group (t = d_i), the code for case 1 and case 2 would not include voucher i itself. Therefore, the minimal cost found in case 1 and case 2 would come from other vouchers in the group.\n\nWait, this is a key insight! Because when we are processing voucher i, and looking for vouchers j in the group t (which could be d_i), the case 1 and case 2 are looking for vouchers j that end before li (case 1) or start after ri (case 2). Since voucher i's end time is ri, which is >= li. So for case 1, the target is li-1. Since voucher i's end time is ri >= li, which is larger than li-1, so voucher i is not included in case 1. Similarly, for case 2, the target is ri+1. The voucher i's start time is li <= ri < ri+1. So voucher i's start time is not >= ri+1. Therefore, voucher i is not part of case 2. Thus, when processing voucher i, the case 1 and case 2 for the group t (even if t is d_i) would not include voucher i itself. Therefore, the code is safe. So we don't have to worry about pairing a voucher with itself.\n\nThat's a relief! So the code can proceed as described earlier, without worrying about overlapping with itself.\n\nSo the initial plan is correct. Now, let's think about implementing this.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, let's think about the data structures. For grouping vouchers by duration, we can use a defaultdict, where each key is a duration, and the value is a structure containing the end_sorted list, start_sorted list, prefix_min array, and suffix_min array.\n\nBut how to represent these? For each duration d, we can have:\n\n- end_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by ri.\n\n- start_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by li.\n\nBut for the prefix_min and suffix_min, we need to compute them once per duration.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nfor each duration d in the grouped vouchers:\n\n   collect all vouchers with duration d.\n\n   sort them by ri to create end_sorted list.\n\n   create end_times list (their ri's).\n\n   compute prefix_min array.\n\n   sort them by li to create start_sorted list.\n\n   create start_times list (their li's).\n\n   compute suffix_min array.\n\nSo, during the code:\n\nWe can have a dictionary, say, duration_data, which maps duration d to a tuple of (end_sorted, end_prefix_min, start_sorted, start_suffix_min).\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can structure it as:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_data = defaultdict( ... )\n\nBut for each duration, we can store:\n\nend_sorted: list of (ri, cost) sorted by ri.\n\nWait, no. For the end_sorted list, we need the vouchers sorted by their ri, but we need to know their ri and their cost. So for each voucher in the group, we can store (ri, cost), sorted by ri. Similarly for the start_sorted list, (li, cost) sorted by li.\n\nBut during the processing of case 1, for the end_sorted list, we need to find the maximum ri that is <= target_end. So the end_times can be a list of the ri's in the end_sorted list. Then, the bisect can be done on this list.\n\nSimilarly for start_times.\n\nSo, during preprocessing for each duration d:\n\nvouchers_with_d = list of all vouchers with duration d.\n\nend_sorted = sorted(vouchers_with_d, key=lambda x: x.ri)\n\nend_times = [v.ri for v in end_sorted]\n\nprefix_min = [ ... ] as discussed.\n\nSimilarly for start_sorted:\n\nstart_sorted = sorted(vouchers_with_d, key=lambda x: x.li)\n\nstart_times = [v.li for v in start_sorted]\n\nsuffix_min = [ ... ]\n\nBut how to represent the vouchers? Well, perhaps during the initial reading, each voucher can be stored as a tuple (li, ri, cost), and during grouping, we can collect these tuples.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines of li, ri, cost.\n\nFor each voucher, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup vouchers into a dictionary, say, grouped, where grouped[d] is a list of vouchers (each being a tuple (li, ri, cost)) with duration d.\n\nThen, for each duration d in grouped:\n\n   process the list of vouchers into end_sorted, start_sorted, etc.\n\nSo, for each d in grouped:\n\n   vouchers = grouped[d]\n\n   # process end_sorted:\n\n   end_sorted = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[1])  # v[1] is ri\n\n   end_times = [v[1] for v in end_sorted]\n\n   # compute prefix_min:\n\n   prefix_min = []\n   min_cost = float('inf')\n   for v in end_sorted:\n       min_cost = min(min_cost, v[2])\n       prefix_min.append(min_cost)\n\n   # process start_sorted:\n\n   start_sorted = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[0])  # v[0] is li\n\n   start_times = [v[0] for v in start_sorted]\n\n   # compute suffix_min:\n\n   suffix_min = [0]*len(start_sorted)\n   min_cost = float('inf')\n   for i in range(len(start_sorted)-1, -1, -1):\n       min_cost = min(min_cost, start_sorted[i][2])\n       suffix_min[i] = min_cost\n\n   # store these in duration_data\n\n   duration_data[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nOnce this is done, then for each voucher in the original list, process it as follows:\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nFor each voucher in original list:\n\n   li, ri, cost_i = voucher's data\n\n   duration_i = ri - li + 1\n\n   t = x - duration_i\n\n   if t not in duration_data: continue\n\n   # process case 1: find vouchers with duration t that end before li.\n\n   # get the end_times, prefix_min for duration t.\n\n   end_times_t, prefix_min_t, start_times_t, suffix_min_t = duration_data[t]\n\n   # target_end is li - 1\n\n   target_end = li - 1\n\n   # find the rightmost index in end_times_t where value <= target_end.\n\n   # using bisect_right.\n\n   import bisect\n\n   idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times_t, target_end) - 1\n\n   if idx >= 0:\n\n       min_case1 = prefix_min_t[idx]\n\n       total = cost_i + min_case1\n\n       if total < answer:\n\n           answer = total\n\n   # process case 2: find vouchers with duration t that start after ri.\n\n   target_start = ri + 1\n\n   # find the leftmost index in start_times_t where value >= target_start.\n\n   idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times_t, target_start)\n\n   if idx < len(start_times_t):\n\n       min_case2 = suffix_min_t[idx]\n\n       total = cost_i + min_case2\n\n       if total < answer:\n\n           answer = total\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if answer is still infinity, output -1, else output answer.\n\nBut wait, what about when t is zero? Well, since x is at least 2 (since n >= 2 and x >= 2?), no. Wait, the input constraints say x can be as low as 2? Let me check the problem statement:\n\nInput constraints: n and x are between 2 and 2e5. So x can be 2, but for a voucher's duration to be t, which is x - duration_i. So if x is 2, and duration_i is 1, then t is 1. But if duration_i is 2, then t is 0. But duration is ri - li + 1 >= 1. So for t to be valid, x - duration_i must be >= 1. Because the vouchers have duration >=1. So when x is 2, and duration_i is 2, then t is 0. So in this case, the group for duration t=0 is not present, so the code skips.\n\nBut in the code, when we compute t = x - duration_i, and check if it's in the grouped data. So for t=0, which is not present, it's skipped.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, what about when t is negative? Well, since duration_i is at least 1, and x is at least 2. So for example, if x=2 and duration_i=3, then t = -1. So it's not in the grouped data, so skipped.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, test the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration is 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo grouped:\n\nduration 3: [(1,3,4)]\n\nduration 2: [(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4)]\n\nProcessing each voucher:\n\nFirst voucher (1,3,4) duration 3. t = 5-3=2. Check if 2 is in grouped data. Yes.\n\nCase 1: find vouchers with duration 2 that end before 1 (li is 1, target_end is 0). end_times_t is the end times of vouchers with duration 2. Let's see:\n\nThe vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\n(1,2,5) ends at 2.\n\n(5,6,1) ends at 6.\n\n(1,2,4) ends at 2.\n\nWhen sorted by end time, end_sorted would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]? Or wait, the end_sorted is sorted by ri (the end time). So the end times for these three vouchers are 2, 6, 2. So sorted by end time would be 2, 2, 6. So the end_times_t would be [2, 2, 6]. The prefix_min would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1].\n\nSo for target_end = 0, bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0, minus 1 is -1. So no case 1.\n\nCase 2: target_start = ri +1 = 3 +1 =4. start_times_t is the start times of the vouchers with duration 2, sorted by li. The vouchers are:\n\n(1,2,5) has li=1.\n\n(1,2,4) has li=1.\n\n(5,6,1) has li=5.\n\nsorted by li, start_sorted would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. start_times_t is [1,1,5].\n\ntarget_start is 4. bisect_left([1,1,5], 4) returns 2 (since 4 is between 1 and 5). idx is 2, which is <3. suffix_min_t at index 2 is 1. So case 2 gives 4 + 1 =5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo for this voucher, the code would find 5 as a candidate.\n\nOther vouchers may contribute. For example, the third voucher (5,6,1) has duration 2. t = 5-2=3. Check if 3 is in grouped data. Yes, it has one voucher (1,3,4). So for case 1: target_end is li-1=5-1=4. For duration 3's end_times_t is [3]. bisect_right([3],4) is 1, minus 1 is 0. So prefix_min_t[0] is 4. So case1: cost is 1 +4=5. Case 2: target_start is 6+1=7. For duration 3's start_sorted is [(1,3,4)], start_times_t is [1]. bisect_left([1],7) returns 1, which is >= len(start_times_t) (1). So no case 2. So this voucher contributes 5 as well.\n\nSo the overall answer is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: input 3 2, vouchers with durations 3 each. So x=2. For each voucher, duration is 3, so t=2-3=-1. So no possible pairs, so output -1.\n\nThus, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, x=2. Each voucher has duration 1. So t=1. For each voucher, check for others. For voucher 1, check if there's a voucher with duration 1 that ends before li or starts after ri.\n\nSuppose voucher1 is (1,1, c1), voucher2 is (2,2, c2). Then, for voucher1, t=1. Check for vouchers with duration 1. For case 1: target_end =1-1=0. So no. For case 2: target_start is 1+1=2. So look for vouchers with start >=2. voucher2's start is 2, so included. suffix_min is c2. So total is c1 + c2. Similarly for voucher2, case1: target_end is 2-1=1. So vouchers with end <=1. voucher1 ends at 1. So case1 would find it. So total is c2 + c1. So the code would find the correct answer.\n\nAnother edge case: two vouchers with same duration and overlapping. Like voucher1 (1,2, 1), voucher2 (1,2, 2). x=2. So each has duration 2. So t= x - duration_i = 2-2=0. Not present, so no solution. Output -1.\n\nAnother case: two vouchers with durations 1 and 1, x=2. They are non-overlapping. For example, voucher1 (1,1, 1), voucher2 (2,2, 2). Then, for voucher1, t=1. Check for vouchers with duration 1. case1: target_end is 1-1=0. no. case2: target_start is 1+1=2. vouchers with start >=2. voucher2's start is 2. So case2 gives 1 + 2 =3. Similarly for voucher2, case1: target_end is 2-1=1. voucher1 ends at 1. So case1 gives 2 + 1=3. So the answer is 3.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code should handle all of these.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nWe need to read n and x. Then read n vouchers. Then group them by duration.\n\nBut in Python, for large n (up to 2e5), using defaultdict and lists is manageable.\n\nBut for the grouped data, for each duration, we need to process the vouchers into end_sorted, start_sorted, etc.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\ngrouped = defaultdict(list)\nfor",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers that can potentially sum up to the required duration.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, we sort vouchers by their end times and start times. We also compute prefix minimum costs for end-sorted lists and suffix minimum costs for start-sorted lists. This preprocessing allows us to quickly find the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers using binary search.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with a duration that, when combined with the current voucher's duration, equals the required duration. We use binary search to efficiently find valid non-overlapping vouchers and compute the minimum cost.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    grouped = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost, duration))\n        grouped[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess the grouped data\n    duration_data = dict()\n    \n    for d in grouped:\n        vouchers_d = grouped[d]\n        # Process end_sorted and prefix_min\n        end_sorted = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda v: v[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in end_sorted]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for v in end_sorted:\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_cost)\n        # Process start_sorted and suffix_min\n        start_sorted = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda v: v[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in start_sorted]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(start_sorted)\n        min_cost = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(start_sorted)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_cost = min(min_cost, start_sorted[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_cost\n        # Store in duration_data\n        duration_data[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for (li, ri, cost_i, duration_i) in vouchers:\n        t = x - duration_i\n        if t not in duration_data:\n            continue\n        # Case 1: vouchers with duration t that end before li\n        end_times_t, prefix_min_t, start_times_t, suffix_min_t = duration_data[t]\n        target_end = li - 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_times_t, target_end) - 1\n        if idx >= 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min_t[idx]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost_i + current_min)\n        # Case 2: vouchers with duration t that start after ri\n        target_start = ri + 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_times_t, target_start)\n        if idx < len(start_times_t):\n            current_min = suffix_min_t[idx]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost_i + current_min)\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each with their start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate efficient lookup during the pairing process.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end times and start times.
