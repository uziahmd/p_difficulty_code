The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), I need to determine what move each player makes. Then, determine who wins, if anyone. Then, count the losses for each.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. That would take way too long. So I need to find a pattern or cycle that can be calculated efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the sequences. Nikephoros's sequence A has length m, and Polycarpus's B has length k. So their moves repeat every m and k rounds respectively. The combined pattern of their moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after that many rounds, both sequences will be back to their starting points.\n\nSo the idea is to find the number of rounds in the LCM period, compute how many times each player loses in that period, then multiply by the number of full periods in n rounds, and then add the remaining rounds.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it T. Let's say T = LCM(m, k). So each T rounds, the pattern repeats.\n\n2. For each of the T rounds, compute the number of times Nikephoros loses (countA) and Polycarpus loses (countB) in that period.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods is q = n // T. The remainder is r = n % T.\n\n4. So totalA = q * countA + number of losses in first r rounds of the period.\n\nSame for totalB.\n\nBut how do I compute countA and countB for the T rounds?\n\nWell, for each round in 0..T-1, I need to find what A's move and B's move are. Then determine who wins.\n\nBut how to find the moves for each round?\n\nFor round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nYes. So for each i in 0 to T-1, compute the moves, check who wins, and accumulate counts.\n\nBut T can be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1e6. Because m and k are up to 1000 each. So LCM(m, k) could be as big as 1e6 (if m and k are coprime, like 1000 and 999, then LCM is 999000). So for T up to 1e6, even for n up to 2e9, the calculation of the counts for T rounds is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCalculate T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the T rounds, the moves and count the number of losses for each player.\n\nThen, compute how many full cycles there are (q = n // T) and the remaining rounds (r = n % T).\n\nMultiply the counts by q, then add the counts from the first r rounds.\n\nNow, the problem becomes how to compute LCM.\n\nTo compute LCM(a, b), we can use the formula LCM(a, b) = a * b / GCD(a, b).\n\nSo I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but that returns the absolute value. But since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nWait, but in Python 3, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers, but for positive integers. So yes.\n\nSo for example, m=3, k=5: LCM is 15.\n\nOnce I have T, then for each of the T rounds, simulate the moves and count.\n\nBut how to handle the simulation for T rounds? Let's see:\n\nFor each i in 0 to T-1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine who wins.\n\nSo for each such pair, check if a beats b, or b beats a, or draw.\n\nSo for each pair, we can have:\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a beats b): then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so countB += 1)\n\nelse: Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot (countA += 1)\n\nSo for each of the T rounds, we can compute the counts.\n\nOnce that is done, then the total is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // T\n\nremainder = n % T\n\ntotalA = full_cycles * countA_in_cycle + countA_in_remainder\n\nSimilarly for totalB.\n\nSo the problem is manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read the inputs:\n\nn is given as the first input line. Then A and B as the next two lines.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input given, the input is something like:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as a list of strings. But in actual code, the input is read from stdin. So the code should read:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead A as the next line.\n\nRead B as the next line.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. So in Python, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nB = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut need to make sure that leading/trailing whitespaces are handled. But the problem says that the input lines are the sequences, so probably, the input is correctly formatted.\n\nOnce that's done, compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nThen compute for each of the T rounds, the number of times A and B lose.\n\nBut how to compute LCM?\n\nImplementing LCM:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to compute gcd. So in Python, math.gcd, but note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nBut for Python versions, need to import math.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nThen, T = compute_lcm(len(A), len(B)).\n\nOnce T is known, then for each i in 0 to T-1:\n\nget a_char = A[i % m]\n\nget b_char = B[i % k]\n\nthen determine who wins.\n\nNow, how to determine the winner.\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes two characters and returns which one wins.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a is 'R' and b is 'S') or (a is 'S' and b is 'P') or (a is 'P' and b is 'R'):\n\nthen a wins. So Nikephoros wins, so B loses. So countB += 1.\n\nelse:\n\nb wins. So Nikephoros loses. countA += 1.\n\nSo for each pair, check these conditions.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to T-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nif a == b: continue.\n\nelse:\n\ncheck if a beats b. If yes, then B loses (so countB += 1). Else, A loses (countA += 1).\n\nSo during the processing of the T rounds, we can compute the countA_cycle and countB_cycle.\n\nOnce that's done, then for the full_cycles = n // T, multiply countA_cycle and countB_cycle by full_cycles.\n\nThen, process the remaining r = n % T rounds. For those, we need to process the first r rounds (i from 0 to r-1) and add their counts.\n\nSo, for the remainder part, we can loop from 0 to r-1, and do the same checks.\n\nBut for T up to 1e6, and n up to 2e9, the total processing is O(T) for the cycle, and O(r) for the remainder. Which is acceptable, since T is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute countA_cycle and countB_cycle for T rounds.\n\nThen:\n\nfull_cycles = n // T\n\nremainder = n % T\n\ntotalA = full_cycles * countA_cycle\n\ntotalB = full_cycles * countB_cycle\n\nThen, for the remainder rounds, compute how many more A and B lose in the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nAdd that to totalA and totalB.\n\nSo, the code needs to process the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut how to process them?\n\nWell, for i in 0 to remainder-1:\n\nsame as before.\n\nBut for that, perhaps we can have a helper function that, given a number of rounds, returns the countA and countB for those rounds.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial processing of the T rounds, we can precompute a list of counts for each possible i. But for T up to 1e6, that's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps, during the initial processing of the T rounds, we can accumulate the counts for each i. For example, we can create two arrays, prefixA and prefixB, where prefixA[i] is the number of times A lost in the first i rounds (from 0 to i-1). Similarly for prefixB.\n\nBut for that, during the initial loop over T rounds, we can keep track of cumulative counts. Then, for the remainder, we can take the first r rounds' counts.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's easier to compute for the entire T rounds, the countA_cycle and countB_cycle, and then for the remainder, compute the same for the first r rounds.\n\nSo, the code can have two functions: one that computes the counts for a given number of rounds (like, for x rounds, how many times A and B lose).\n\nBut for the initial T rounds, it's easy to compute.\n\nSo, let's code:\n\ndef get_counts(num_rounds, A, B, m, k):\n\n    countA = 0\n\n    countB = 0\n\n    for i in range(num_rounds):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        # determine winner\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # a wins, so B loses\n\n            countB += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # b wins, so A loses\n\n            countA += 1\n\n    return countA, countB\n\nBut then, for the initial T rounds, we can call get_counts(T, A, B, m, k) to get countA_cycle and countB_cycle.\n\nThen, for the remainder, call get_counts(remainder, A, B, m, k) and add to the totals.\n\nBut for very large T (like 1e6), this function may take some time, but given that 1e6 is manageable in Python for a problem with tight time constraints.\n\nBut considering that for each test case, the code will run in O(T) time, which is acceptable for T up to 1e6.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4).\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12. So T=12.\n\nThen, for each of the 12 rounds, compute the counts.\n\nLet me simulate this.\n\nRound 0:\n\ni=0: A[0%3]=R, B[0%4]=R → draw. No counts.\n\nRound 1: i=1 → A[1%3]=P, B[1%4]=S → P vs S. S beats P? Wait, no. Wait, the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock.\n\nSo for a = P (paper), b = S (scissors): scissors beat paper. So B's move (S) beats A's (P). So A loses. So countA +=1.\n\nWait, the code checks if a beats b. For a = P and b = S: (a is P, b is S). The condition (a is R and b is S) → no. (a is S and b is P) → no. (a is P and b is R) → no. So the condition is false. So else clause: B wins. So A loses. So countA increases by 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for this round, countA +=1.\n\nRound 2: i=2. A[2%3] is S. B[2%4] is P. S vs P: S beats P. So A wins. So B loses. countB +=1.\n\nRound 3: i=3. A[3%3=0] → R. B[3%4=3 → P. R vs P: P beats R. So B wins. A loses. countA +=1.\n\nRound 4: i=4. A[4%3=1 → P. B[4%4=0 → R. P vs R: P beats R. So A wins. B loses. countB +=1.\n\nRound 5: i=5. A[5%3=2 → S. B[5%4=1 → S. Draw. No change.\n\nRound 6: i=6. A[6%3=0 → R. B[6%4=2 → P. R vs P: B wins. A loses. countA +=1.\n\nRound 7: i=7. A[7%3=1 → P. B[7%4=3 → P. Draw.\n\nRound 8: i=8. A[8%3=2 → S. B[8%4=0 → R. S vs R: R beats S. B wins. A loses. countA +=1.\n\nRound 9: i=9. A[9%3=0 → R. B[9%4=1 → S. R vs S: A wins. B loses. countB +=1.\n\nRound 10: i=10. A[10%3=1 → P. B[10%4=2 → P. Draw.\n\nRound 11: i=11. A[11%3=2 → S. B[11%4=3 → P. S vs P: A wins. B loses. countB +=1.\n\nSo for the 12 rounds, let's count how many times A and B lost.\n\nLet me track countA and countB for the T=12 rounds:\n\ncountA starts at 0, countB at 0.\n\nRound 0: no change.\n\nRound 1: countA +=1 → countA=1.\n\nRound 2: countB +=1 → countB=1.\n\nRound3: countA +=1 → countA=2.\n\nRound4: countB +=1 → countB=2.\n\nRound5: no change.\n\nRound6: countA +=1 → countA=3.\n\nRound7: no change.\n\nRound8: countA +=1 → countA=4.\n\nRound9: countB +=1 → countB=3.\n\nRound10: no change.\n\nRound11: countB +=1 → countB=4.\n\nSo for the 12 rounds, countA_cycle is 4, countB_cycle is 4.\n\nBut in the sample input, n=7. So T=12. So full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0. remainder is 7.\n\nSo for the remainder of 7 rounds, we need to compute the counts for first 7 rounds.\n\nLooking at the rounds 0 to 6:\n\ncountA in first 7 rounds: rounds 0-6:\n\nrounds 0: 0\n\nround1: +1 → 1\n\nround2: +0 → 1\n\nround3: +1 → 2\n\nround4: +0 → 2\n\nround5: +0 → 2\n\nround6: +1 → 3\n\nSo countA_remainder is 3, countB_remainder is 2 (from rounds 0-6):\n\ncountB:\n\nround0: 0\n\nround1: 0\n\nround2: +1 → 1\n\nround3: 0\n\nround4: +1 → 2\n\nround5: 0\n\nround6: 0 → total 2.\n\nSo totalA = 0 * 4 + 3 = 3. totalB = 0 *4 + 2 = 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes! So the code works for this sample.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nSo T=8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds, check the moves.\n\nA's move is R every time. B's move is R every time. So all rounds are draws. So countA_cycle = 0, countB_cycle=0. So for any n, the total is 0 and 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the case when n is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 1. So no.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut in Python, for very large T (up to 1e6), the code may take O(1e6) time. But for Python, even 1e6 iterations are manageable.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute countA_cycle and countB_cycle for T rounds.\n\nCompute full_cycles = n // T.\n\nremainder = n % T.\n\nCompute countA_remainder and countB_remainder for remainder rounds.\n\ntotalA = full_cycles * countA_cycle + countA_remainder.\n\ntotalB = full_cycles * countB_cycle + countB_remainder.\n\nPrint totalA and totalB.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the helper function get_counts.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can write a function, but for efficiency, perhaps inline.\n\nBut in code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    T = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n    # compute countA_cycle and countB_cycle\n\n    def get_counts(num_rounds):\n\n        countA = 0\n\n        countB = 0\n\n        for i in range(num_rounds):\n\n            a = A[i % m]\n\n            b = B[i % k]\n\n            if a == b:\n\n                continue\n\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n                # A wins, B loses\n\n                countB += 1\n\n            else:\n\n                # B wins, A loses\n\n                countA += 1\n\n        return countA, countB\n\n    countA_cycle, countB_cycle = get_counts(T)\n\n    full_cycles = n // T\n\n    remainder = n % T\n\n    countA_remainder, countB_remainder = get_counts(remainder)\n\n    totalA = full_cycles * countA_cycle + countA_remainder\n\n    totalB = full_cycles * countB_cycle + countB_remainder\n\n    print(totalA, totalB)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first case, when T=12, and remainder is 7, the get_counts(7) returns (3, 2) which is correct.\n\nBut let's test the code.\n\nBut for the first sample input, the code would compute T=12, and get_counts(12) returns (4,4). Then full_cycles is 7//12=0, remainder is 7. get_counts(7) returns (3, 2). So totalA is 0*4 +3=3, totalB is 0*4 +2=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n=12, then remainder is 0. So the code would compute full_cycles=1, remainder=0. get_counts(0) returns (0,0). So totalA = 1*4 + 0 =4, totalB= 1*4 +0=4.\n\nBut in the 12 rounds, each player lost 4 times. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when T is larger than n? Like n=5, T=12. Then full_cycles is 0, remainder is 5. So get_counts(5) is called.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the remainder is zero? Like n= T. Then remainder is zero, and get_counts(0) returns (0,0). So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code for get_counts(0) would loop for 0 rounds, so returns 0,0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code in Python. But note that for very large T (like 1e6), the code may take some time. However, since m and k are up to 1000, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6, and 1e6 iterations are acceptable in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, the code is O(T) which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input where the second example is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is length 8, B is length 1. LCM(8,1)=8. For each of 8 rounds, all moves are R vs R. So countA_cycle and countB_cycle are 0. Then for n=5, remainder is 5, which is processed as 5 rounds, all draws. So totalA and totalB are 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut note that in Python, reading the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, but the problem says that the input is given correctly. So using strip() is safe.\n\nBut for the code, the lines after reading n are read as:\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nB = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut sometimes, after reading n, there might be a newline. For example, if the input is given as:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen the second line is 'RPS' and third is 'RSPP'.\n\nBut in code, the first readline() reads the '7\\n', then the next readline() reads 'RPS\\n', and then the third readline() reads 'RSPP\\n'.\n\nBut using strip() removes leading/trailing whitespace, including newlines. So that's correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, the function get_counts is defined inside main, which is okay.\n\nBut for Python, the code would be:\n\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    def get_counts(num_rounds):\n        countA = 0\n        countB = 0\n        for i in range(num_rounds):\n            a = A[i % m]\n            b = B[i % k]\n            if a == b:\n                continue\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n                countB += 1\n            else:\n                countA += 1\n        return countA, countB\n    \n    countA_cycle, countB_cycle = get_counts(T)\n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    countA_remainder, countB_remainder = get_counts(remainder)\n    \n    totalA = full_cycles * countA_cycle + countA_remainder\n    totalB = full_cycles * countB_cycle + countB_remainder\n    \n    print(f\"{totalA} {totalB}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the sample input has the first input as 7, then the second line is 'RPS' and third is 'RSPP'. So the code would read that correctly.\n\nTesting the code with the first sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich gives output 3 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput is 0 0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the sequences are longer than n?\n\nFor example, n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then T=1. For 1 round, A is R, B is S. A wins. So countB_cycle is 1. full_cycles = 1//1 =1. remainder 0. So totalA is 0, totalB is 1. So output is 0 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, A is 'R', B is 'S'. T=1. So full_cycles=2, remainder 0. So countA_cycle is 0, countB_cycle is 1. So totalA is 0*2 +0=0, totalB is 2*1 +0=2. So output is 0 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases. So this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when the number of rounds is very large (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds. The combined pattern of their moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds, where LCM is the least common multiple of `m` and `k`.\n\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of both sequences to determine the length of the repeating cycle. This allows us to simulate only one cycle and then extrapolate the results for the entire number of rounds.\n\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: For each round in the cycle, determine the moves of both players and count the number of losses for each player.\n\n4. **Extrapolate Results**: Using the results from one cycle, calculate the number of full cycles within the given number of rounds and the remaining rounds. Use these to compute the total number of losses for each player.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    def get_counts(num_rounds):\n        countA = 0\n        countB = 0\n        for i in range(num_rounds):\n            a = A[i % m]\n            b = B[i % k]\n            if a == b:\n                continue\n            if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n                countB += 1\n            else:\n                countA += 1\n        return countA, countB\n    \n    countA_cycle, countB_cycle = get_counts(T)\n    full_cycles = n // T\n    remainder = n % T\n    countA_remainder, countB_remainder = get_counts(remainder)\n    \n    totalA = full_cycles * countA_cycle + countA_remainder\n    totalB = full_cycles * countB_cycle + countB_remainder\n    \n    print(f\"{totalA} {totalB}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the cycle length after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: The `get_counts` function simulates one full cycle of moves, counting the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of rounds is divided into full cycles and a remainder. The results from one cycle are multiplied by the number of full cycles, and the remainder is processed separately to get the final counts of losses.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large numbers of rounds by leveraging the repeating nature of the move sequences, thus avoiding the need to simulate each round individually.",
