The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of times each player loses in n rounds of rock-paper-scissors, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their own sequences. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the sequences work. For example, Nikephoros's sequence A is repeated cyclically. So for each round i (starting from 0?), he uses A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus's sequence B.\n\nThe main challenge here is handling the large value of n, which can be up to 2e9. So iterating through each round one by one is impossible. We need an efficient way to compute the number of losses without simulating all rounds.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The idea is to find out for each possible pair of moves (from A and B's sequences) how many times they occur in the rounds, and then calculate the number of wins for each player based on those counts.\n\nBut since the sequences are cyclic, the pattern of moves repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after that many rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So, the total number of rounds can be divided into two parts: the full cycles of LCM(m, k) and the remaining rounds.\n\nSo first, compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length. Then, the number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length, and the remainder is rem = n % cycle_length. \n\nFor each full cycle, we can precompute the number of times Nikephoros wins and Polycarpus wins. Then multiply those counts by total_cycles. Then, process the remaining rem rounds separately.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of wins per full cycle?\n\nTo compute that, we need to simulate each round in the cycle (from 0 to cycle_length -1). For each round in that cycle, determine the move of A and B. Then check who wins, and increment the counts accordingly.\n\nBut since cycle_length could be up to m*k, and m and k are up to 1000, m*k could be up to 1e6. So for each cycle, processing 1e6 rounds is manageable. Because even if n is 2e9, the cycle_length is 1e6, then total_cycles would be 2e9 / 1e6 = 2e3, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n\n2. Precompute for each round in the cycle (from 0 to cycle_length-1):\n\n   a. Get A's move: A[i % m]\n\n   b. Get B's move: B[i % k]\n\n   c. Determine who wins (if any) in this round.\n\n   d. Keep counts for the total number of wins for Nikephoros and Polycarpus in one cycle.\n\n3. Multiply these counts by the number of full cycles (total_cycles = n // cycle_length).\n\n4. Then, process the remaining rem = n % cycle_length rounds, again using the same method as step 2, but only for rem rounds.\n\n5. Sum all the counts from full cycles and the remaining rounds to get the final answer.\n\nNow, the key is to compute the LCM. To compute LCM(a, b), we can use the formula LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but that returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay. However, note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the correct GCD for positive integers.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n, then read A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute cycle_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nThen, for the full cycles and the remainder.\n\nBut how to process the rounds for the cycle?\n\nLet me think: for each round in 0 to cycle_length -1:\n\nFor that round, the index for A is (i % m), and for B is (i % k). Then compare the two moves.\n\nSo, for each such i, we can compute the outcome.\n\nBut how to compute the outcome between two moves?\n\nLet's create a helper function that takes a and b (each being 'R', 'P', 'S') and returns who wins. For example:\n\nif a == b: no one wins.\n\nElse:\n\nif a beats b: Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus gets a spot)\n\nelse: Polycarpus wins (Nikephoros gets a spot).\n\nSo, for example, if a is 'R' and b is 'S', Nikephoros wins. If a is 'S' and b is 'R', then Polycarpus wins.\n\nSo, how to code this? Let's think of the possible cases.\n\nWe can have a helper function:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # Polycarpus wins\n\nSo, for each pair (a, b), this returns 1, -1, or 0.\n\nSo, for each round, we can compute this and accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, multiply by total_cycles, then add the counts from the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for the full cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me outline the code steps.\n\nFirst, compute the number of full cycles and remainder.\n\ntotal_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nremainder_rounds = n % cycle_length\n\nThen, for the full cycles, compute the number of wins in one cycle (say, win_a_cycle and win_b_cycle), then multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remainder_rounds, compute the number of wins in the first remainder_rounds rounds of the cycle, and add them.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nCompute cycle_length.\n\nCompute the number of wins in one cycle (for a and b).\n\nfull_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nremainder = n % cycle_length\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * wins_a_in_cycle\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * wins_b_in_cycle\n\nThen, compute the wins in the first 'remainder' rounds of the cycle, and add to total_a and total_b.\n\nBut how to compute the wins in the first 'remainder' rounds?\n\nWe can loop from i=0 to remainder-1, compute the moves, and count.\n\nBut for that, we can have a helper function that, given a number of rounds, computes the number of wins for a and b.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial processing of the cycle, we can precompute for each possible i in 0..cycle_length-1, the contribution to a and b. Then, for the remainder, sum the first 'remainder' entries.\n\nBut for that, we can precompute an array of (a_wins, b_wins) for each round in the cycle. Then, for the full cycles, multiply by the total_cycles, and for the remainder, sum the first 'remainder' elements.\n\nBut how to compute that array?\n\nLet me think. For each i in 0 to cycle_length-1:\n\nget a_move = A[i % m]\n\nget b_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen compute the outcome. For each such round, we can add 1 to a_wins if Nikephoros wins, 1 to b_wins if Polycarpus wins. So for each i, we can have a tuple (a_win, b_win) which is (1,0), (0,1), or (0,0).\n\nSo, for the entire cycle, we can compute the total a_win_cycle and b_win_cycle.\n\nBut for the remainder, we need to process the first 'remainder' rounds, which is up to cycle_length steps. Since cycle_length is up to 1e6, and for each test case, this is manageable.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string, read B string.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B)\n\nCompute GCD(m, k). Then LCM(m, k) = m * k // gcd.\n\nBut wait, what if m or k is zero? But according to input constraints, m and k are at least 1. So no problem.\n\nOnce we have cycle_length, then:\n\nCompute for each i in 0 to cycle_length -1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine the outcome.\n\nsum up for the entire cycle.\n\nThen, for the remainder rounds, do the same for the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut for the remainder, perhaps we can compute it by looping from 0 to remainder-1, and for each, compute the same as above.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's better to process the entire cycle once, and then for the remainder, just take the first 'remainder' entries.\n\nBut for that, perhaps we can precompute a list of (a_win, b_win) for each round in the cycle. Then, the total for the full cycles is full_cycles * (sum of all a_win in the cycle, sum of all b_win in the cycle). Then, for the remainder, sum the first 'remainder' elements in the list.\n\nSo, let's proceed:\n\nprecompute a list called cycle_wins, where each element is (a_win, b_win) for that round in the cycle.\n\nThen, sum_cycle_a = sum( x[0] for x in cycle_wins )\n\nsum_cycle_b = sum( x[1] for x in cycle_wins )\n\nThen, total_a = full_cycles * sum_cycle_a + sum( x[0] for x in cycle_wins[:remainder] )\n\nSimilarly for total_b.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nCompute cycle_length.\n\nCompute cycle_wins as a list of tuples.\n\nsum_cycle_a = sum of all x[0] in cycle_wins.\n\nsum_cycle_b = sum of all x[1] in cycle_wins.\n\nThen, total_a = full_cycles * sum_cycle_a + sum of x[0] in first rem rounds.\n\nSame for total_b.\n\nSo, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut for very large cycle_length (up to 1e6), generating this list is acceptable.\n\nNow, for the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 rounds.\n\nA is RPS (length 3), B is RSPP (length 4). So m=3, k=4.\n\nLCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo, cycle_length is 12.\n\nThen, for each of 12 rounds, compute the moves.\n\nBut for n=7, total_cycles = 7//12 = 0, remainder=7.\n\nSo, process the first 7 rounds of the cycle.\n\nLet me check the sample explanation. The first sample's rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P vs S (Nikephoros loses? Wait, let me check the example.\n\nWait in the sample explanation:\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros's move is P, B's move is S. Wait, according to the sample explanation, the second round is P vs S. But according to the sequences:\n\nA is RPS, so for round 1 (i=0?), the first round is i=0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R. So round 1 is R vs R.\n\nThen round 2 is i=1: A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S. So P vs S. According to the rules, S beats P. So Nikephoros's move is P, B's is S. So B wins. So Nikephoros gets a spot. So in the sample explanation, Nikephoros has 3 losses, Polycarpus 2. Let me check that.\n\nIn the sample explanation, the first round is draw. Then in round 2, Nikephoros loses. So that's a spot for him. Then round 3, S vs P. So Nikephoros's move is S, B's is P. S beats P, so Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. Then round 4: R vs P. B's move is P. R loses to P. So Nikephoros loses again. Round 5: P vs R. Nikephoros's move is P, B's is R. P beats R. So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. Round 6: S vs S. Draw. Round 7: R vs P. Nikephoros loses again.\n\nSo total for Nikephoros: 3 losses (rounds 2, 4, 7). Polycarpus has 2 (rounds 3 and 5).\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nSo the code should generate that.\n\nNow, in the code, when processing the first 7 rounds, the code would calculate the correct counts.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the simulation correctly.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nImplementing the helper function for determining the winner.\n\nBut perhaps, instead of a helper function, we can use some conditionals.\n\nFor each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: no points.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a, b) is one of the winning combinations for Nikephoros:\n\nthen Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus gets a spot, so add 1 to Nikephoros's loss count? Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, and Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1? No, no. Wait:\n\nThe problem says: the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so his count increases by 1. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros's count increases by 1. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo for each round, the number of spots for Nikephoros is the number of times he lost, and same for Polycarpus.\n\nSo, in the code, for each round, if Nikephoros wins, then add 0 to Nikephoros's count, and 1 to Polycarpus's count. If Polycarpus wins, add 1 to Nikephoros's count, 0 to Polycarpus's. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo, the helper function returns 1 if Nikephoros wins, -1 if Polycarpus wins, 0 otherwise. Then, for each round:\n\nif result is 1: add 0 to a_spots, 1 to b_spots.\n\nif result is -1: add 1 to a_spots, 0 to b_spots.\n\nif 0: nothing.\n\nSo, for the code, in the cycle_wins list, each element is (a_spots_contribution, b_spots_contribution).\n\nSo for each round, compute the (a, b) moves, then determine the outcome.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 'R' and b is 'S', Nikephoros wins. So a_spots_contribution is 0 (because Nikephoros didn't lose), and b_spots_contribution is 1 (Polycarpus lost once). Wait no. Wait, the a_spots is the number of red spots Nikephoros has, which is the number of times he lost. So when Nikephoros wins, he didn't lose, so a_spots_contribution is 0. When he loses, a_spots_contribution is 1. So for the helper function, if Nikephoros wins, then the a_spots_contribution is 0, and b_spots_contribution is 1. If Polycarpus wins, then a_spots_contribution is 1, and b_spots_contribution is 0. If draw, both are 0.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor a_move and b_move:\n\nif a == b:\n\n   a_spot += 0\n\n   b_spot += 0\n\nelse:\n\n   if (a beats b):\n\n       a_spot += 0\n\n       b_spot += 1\n\n   else:\n\n       a_spot += 1\n\n       b_spot += 0\n\nSo, how to code that.\n\nSo, the code for each a and b:\n\nif a == b:\n\n   continue\n\nelse:\n\n   if (a, b) in [('R', 'S'), ('S', 'P'), ('P', 'R')]:\n\n       # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n       b_spots += 1\n\n   else:\n\n       # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n\n       a_spots += 1\n\nSo, for each round, we can compute this.\n\nSo, the code for generating the cycle_wins list:\n\ncycle_wins = []\n\nfor i in range(cycle_length):\n\n    a_idx = i % m\n\n    b_idx = i % k\n\n    a_move = A[a_idx]\n\n    b_move = B[b_idx]\n\n    if a_move == b_move:\n\n        cycle_wins.append( (0, 0) )\n\n    else:\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. So add (0, 1)\n\n            cycle_wins.append( (0, 1) )\n\n        else:\n\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot. So add (1, 0)\n\n            cycle_wins.append( (1, 0) )\n\nOnce that's done, sum_cycle_a is the sum of all x[0] in cycle_wins, sum_cycle_b is sum of x[1].\n\nThen, for the full_cycles, multiply sum_cycle_a and sum_cycle_b by full_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remainder, take the first 'remainder' elements of cycle_wins and sum their x[0] and x[1].\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nsum_cycle_a = sum(x[0] for x in cycle_wins)\n\nsum_cycle_b = sum(x[1] for x in cycle_wins)\n\nfull_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nremainder = n % cycle_length\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * sum_cycle_a + sum(x[0] for x in cycle_wins[:remainder])\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * sum_cycle_b + sum(x[1] for x in cycle_wins[:remainder])\n\nThen, print total_a and total_b.\n\nBut for the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn =7\n\nA is \"RPS\" (m=3)\n\nB is \"RSPP\" (k=4)\n\ncycle_length = LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo, for the first 7 rounds, let's compute the cycle_wins for i from 0 to 6 (since remainder is 7, the first 7 elements).\n\nLet me compute each i from 0 to 6:\n\ni=0:\n\na_idx = 0%3=0 → 'R'\n\nb_idx =0%4=0 → 'R' → same → (0,0)\n\ni=1:\n\na_idx=1%3=1 → 'P'\n\nb_idx=1%4=1 → 'S'\n\nP vs S. S beats P? Wait, the rules: scissors beats paper. So if a_move is P (paper), and b_move is S (scissors), then S beats P. So Nikephoros's move is P, which loses. So Polycarpus wins. So the entry is (1,0). Because Nikephoros loses, so his spot count increases by 1.\n\nWait, the code for this case would check if a_move is P and b_move is S. Then, (a_move, b_move) is (P, S). Which is not in the list [('R','S'), ('S','P'), ('P','R')]. So the code would append (1,0). So that's correct.\n\nSo for i=1, (1,0) added.\n\ni=2:\n\na_idx=2%3=2 → 'S'\n\nb_idx=2%4=2 → 'P'\n\nS vs P. S beats P. So Nikephoros wins. So (0,1) added.\n\ni=3:\n\na_idx=3%3=0 → R\n\nb_idx=3%4=3 → P.\n\nR vs P. P beats R. So Nikephoros loses. (1,0) added.\n\ni=4:\n\na_idx=4%3=1 → P\n\nb_idx=4%4=0 → R.\n\nP vs R. P beats R. Nikephoros wins. So (0,1) added.\n\ni=5:\n\na_idx=5%3=2 → S\n\nb_idx=5%4=1 → S.\n\nS vs S → draw. (0,0).\n\ni=6:\n\na_idx=6%3=0 → R\n\nb_idx=6%4=2 → P.\n\nR vs P → P beats R. Nikephoros loses. (1,0) added.\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds, the cycle_wins[:7] would be:\n\n[ (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,0), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0) ]\n\nsumming x[0] for these is 1+1+1+1 = 4? Wait let's compute each x[0]:\n\ni=0: 0 → 0\n\ni=1: 1 → 1\n\ni=2: 0 → 0\n\ni=3: 1 → 1\n\ni=4: 0 → 0\n\ni=5: 0 → 0\n\ni=6: 1 → 1\n\nTotal sum of x[0] is 1+1+1 = 3? Wait:\n\nelements are:\n\n(0,0) → 0\n\n(1,0) → 1\n\n(0,1) → 0\n\n(1,0) → 1\n\n(0,1) → 0\n\n(0,0) → 0\n\n(1,0) → 1\n\nAdding them: 1+1+1 = 3. So total_a is 3. And sum of x[1] is 0 (from first) + 0 (second) +1 (third) + 0 (fourth) +1 (fifth) +0 (sixth) +0 (seventh) → total 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input would return 3 and 2, which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo n=5, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). So m=8, k=1. LCM(8,1)=8. cycle_length=8.\n\nfull_cycles =5//8=0, remainder=5.\n\nSo for the first 5 rounds:\n\neach round, A's move is R (since i%8 is 0,1,2,3,4 → all R), B's move is R (since i%1 is 0 for all i). So all rounds are draws. So total_a and total_b are 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python.\n\nBut for very large n, like 2e9, but with cycle_length up to 1e6, the code will run in O(1e6) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n. But the input is given as a list? Wait, looking back at the example input:\n\nThe first line is given as ['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR'] ?\n\nWait, the user says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A.\n\nThird line contains sequence B.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as a list of two elements? Or perhaps that's a mistake in the example?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the example:\n\nInput:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nOutput:\n\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in formatting. Probably, the actual input is:\n\nFirst line is 7, then RPS, then RSPP. Then another test case with 5, RRRRRRRR, R.\n\nBut the problem says that the code must read input from stdin. So perhaps the original example is for multiple test cases, but the problem says that the code must process a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nSecond line is sequence A.\n\nThird line is sequence B.\n\nSo the code must read three lines: first n, then A, then B.\n\nBut the example shows that the input is given as a list of two elements, perhaps as a way to represent two separate test cases. But the problem says that the code must process a single test case.\n\nSo, the code should read from standard input, which for the first sample would be:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThen for the second sample:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. So the code will read n from input(), then A from input().strip(), then B from input().strip().\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n\n        while b:\n\n            a, b = b, a % b\n\n        return a\n\n    g = gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // g\n\n    # Now compute cycle_wins for lcm rounds\n\n    cycle_wins = []\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a_idx = i % m\n\n        b_idx = i % k\n\n        a_move = A[a_idx]\n\n        b_move = B[b_idx]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            cycle_wins.append( (0, 0) )\n\n        else:\n\n            # check if Nikephoros wins\n\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n                cycle_wins.append( (0, 1) )\n\n            else:\n\n                cycle_wins.append( (1, 0) )\n\n    sum_cycle_a = sum( x[0] for x in cycle_wins )\n\n    sum_cycle_b = sum( x[1] for x in cycle_wins )\n\n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n\n    remainder = n % lcm\n\n    # compute total_a and total_b\n\n    total_a = full_cycles * sum_cycle_a\n\n    total_b = full_cycles * sum_cycle_b\n\n    # add the remainder part\n\n    for i in range(remainder):\n\n        total_a += cycle_wins[i][0]\n\n        total_b += cycle_wins[i][1]\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the for loop for the remainder runs from 0 to remainder-1. Because range(remainder) gives 0..remainder-1. So that's correct.\n\nBut for the case when remainder is 0, the loop doesn't run, which is correct.\n\nBut what if the lcm is 0? Well, m and k are at least 1, so lcm is at least 1.\n\nBut for the code, the for loop for the cycle_wins is for i in range(lcm), which is okay.\n\nBut when n is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nlcm(3,4)=12. cycle_wins is computed for 12 rounds.\n\nfull_cycles = 7//12 = 0, remainder=7.\n\nThen, the code loops for i in 0..6, adding the values. Which gives total_a = 3, total_b = 2. Which is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=5, A is RRRRRRRR (length 8), B is R (length 1). lcm(8,1)=8. full_cycles =5//8=0, remainder=5. For each of the first 5 rounds, the moves are R vs R. So all (0,0). So total_a and total_b are 0, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when n is equal to lcm. For example, n=12. Then full_cycles is 1, remainder 0. So total_a is sum_cycle_a * 1 + 0. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code may have some optimizations. For example, precomputing the sum for the remainder part. But for the given constraints, even with 1e6 elements, the code will run quickly.\n\nBut in Python, for n up to 2e9, and lcm up to 1e6, the code is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code uses a gcd function. However, Python's math module has a gcd function. However, note that in Python versions prior to 3.5, math.gcd may not exist. But assuming that the code is running in a Python environment that supports math.gcd, perhaps it's better to use math.gcd.\n\nBut the code currently defines its own gcd function. However, for code efficiency, perhaps using math.gcd is better. Let's adjust that.\n\nSo, replacing the gcd function with math.gcd. However, note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nimport math\n\n...\n\ng = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n...\n\nBut need to import math.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n\n    lcm = m * k // g\n\n    # rest of the code as before.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A='R', B='S'. So Nikephoros's move is R, B's move is S. R beats S. So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So output is 0 1.\n\nAnother case: n=1, A='S', B='R'. Then B wins. Output is 1 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, A='R', B='S'. Then for two rounds, the moves are R vs S (Nikephoros wins) and R vs S again. So total is 0 2.\n\nThus, the code should handle these.\n\nNow, code looks correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their own sequences. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when the number of rounds is very large.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Each player uses a sequence of moves that repeats cyclically. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is \"RPS\", his moves will be R, P, S, R, P, S, etc.\n2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The key insight is that the pattern of moves for both players repeats every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to break down the problem into manageable cycles.\n3. **Simulating One Cycle**: By simulating one full cycle of moves (determined by the LCM of the sequence lengths), we can count the number of losses for each player within that cycle.\n4. **Handling Large Inputs Efficiently**: Using the results from one cycle, we can compute the total number of losses for the entire number of rounds by considering how many full cycles fit into the total rounds and then handling any remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    g = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // g\n    \n    cycle_wins = []\n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_move = A[a_idx]\n        b_move = B[b_idx]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            cycle_wins.append((0, 0))\n        else:\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n                cycle_wins.append((0, 1))\n            else:\n                cycle_wins.append((1, 0))\n    \n    sum_cycle_a = sum(x[0] for x in cycle_wins)\n    sum_cycle_b = sum(x[1] for x in cycle_wins)\n    \n    full_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * sum_cycle_a\n    total_b = full_cycles * sum_cycle_b\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        total_a += cycle_wins[i][0]\n        total_b += cycle_wins[i][1]\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences of moves for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the length of one complete cycle of moves.\n3. **Simulating One Cycle**: For each round within the cycle length, we determine the moves of both players and record the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles is calculated, and the results from one cycle are multiplied by the number of full cycles. The remaining rounds after the full cycles are processed separately to account for any leftover rounds.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses for each player is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large values of `n` by leveraging the cyclic nature of the sequences and precomputing results for one cycle.",
