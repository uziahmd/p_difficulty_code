Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to assign directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The main points are:\n\n- The flow must be a maximum flow, so the sum of outgoing flows from the source (vertex 1) equals the total flow, and similarly for the sink (vertex n).\n- For all other vertices (not source or sink), the incoming flow equals outgoing flow.\n- The directed graph must not have cycles.\n- Also, the source has no incoming edges.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, thinking about the flow conservation. For each vertex except 1 and n, the sum of flows into it must equal the sum out. But since the edges are directed, how can I model this?\n\nWait, the problem says that the flow values are already given for each edge. So the direction is to be determined. So the problem is not about finding the max flow, but assigning directions to edges so that the flow conservation holds and the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to ensure that the directed graph is acyclic? That's tricky. Oh, right, maybe we can model this as a DAG with a topological order. So if we can assign directions such that the edges go from earlier to later in a topological order, then there are no cycles.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order that also satisfies the flow conservation constraints?\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen so that the flow conservation holds. But how to model that.\n\nAnother thought: Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps we can model this as building a directed tree structure. Wait, but the graph might not be a tree.\n\nWait, the problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles. So it must be a DAG. But how to arrange the directions.\n\nAn idea comes to mind: maybe construct a directed acyclic graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG, and the flow conservation holds. One possible way is to arrange the nodes in a topological order, and direct the edges from lower to higher in the order. But how to choose this order such that the flow conservation holds.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where for each node (except source and sink), the total flow in equals the total flow out. So for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\nLet me consider the flow conservation. For each node v (excluding source and sink), the net flow (outgoing minus incoming) must be zero. But since the edges are directed, for each edge, it contributes either +ci or -ci to the net flow of the node.\n\nWait, but the net flow for the node must be zero. So for each node v, the sum of ci for edges directed away from v minus the sum of ci for edges directed towards v equals zero. Which implies that the sum of all flows on edges incident to v is even? No, because for each edge, it's either contributing to outgoing or incoming. So the sum of all flows on edges incident to v must be twice the outgoing (since incoming equals outgoing). So for each node v (not source or sink), the total sum of flows on its edges must be even? Or maybe not, because the sum of all flows (outgoing plus incoming) is twice the outgoing (since incoming equals outgoing). So the sum of flows for all edges adjacent to v is equal to 2*sum_outgoing. Which means that the sum of all flows on edges adjacent to v must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so that's guaranteed.\n\nBut how does that help me here?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the flow is a valid flow. So the problem reduces to directing edges such that the flow is valid and the graph is a DAG.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAnother thought: Since the graph is connected, and the solution exists, perhaps the flow is such that the directed graph is a DAG with the source as the only node with outgoing edges (but no, the source can have outgoing edges, but no incoming). Wait, the source has no incoming edges. The sink has no outgoing edges? Not necessarily. But the sink can have outgoing edges, but the flow conservation doesn't apply to it.\n\nSo, the idea is that the directed graph must be acyclic, and the flow must be valid.\n\nNow, considering that the graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can perform a topological sort and assign directions based on that. But how to ensure that the flow conservation holds.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Suppose we arrange the nodes in a topological order where the source (node 1) is first, the sink (node n) is last, and other nodes are ordered in between. Then, for each edge",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to assign directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph is a valid maximum flow with no cycles. The key constraints are flow conservation at all vertices except the source and sink, and ensuring the graph remains acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Topological Sorting**: Since the graph must be acyclic, we can use a topological sort to determine the order of vertices. This ensures that edges are directed from earlier vertices to later ones in the topological order.\n2. **Flow Conservation**: For each vertex (except the source and sink), the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows. This is achieved by directing edges such that the flow conservation is maintained.\n3. **BFS for Topological Order**: We use BFS to determine the topological order starting from the source node (vertex 1). This ensures that the source is first and the sink is last, which helps in maintaining the acyclic property.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        graph[a].append((b, i))\n        graph[b].append((a, i))\n\n    # Compute topological order using BFS (Kahn's algorithm)\n    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for a, b, _ in edges:\n        in_degree[b] += 1\n        in_degree[a] += 1  # since it's undirected, but we need to process as directed later\n\n    # Wait, Kahn's algorithm requires the initial in-degrees based on directed edges.\n    # But initially, we don't have any direction.
