The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to calculate the number of times each loses over n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, we can't simulate each round directly. That's way too big for a brute force approach. So we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nLet me think. The key here is that both players' moves repeat cyclically. So Nikephoros's sequence A has length m, and Polycarpus's sequence B has length k. For each round i (starting from 0?), the move of Nikephoros is A[i % m], and similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k]. \n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can compute the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, then add the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the idea is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. Let's call this LCM value as lcm_val. Then, the total number of rounds can be divided into full cycles of lcm_val and a remainder.\n\nSo first, compute the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds. Then, for each full cycle, we can compute how many times each player loses, and multiply by the number of full cycles. Then process the remaining rounds separately.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of losses in one full cycle of lcm_val rounds?\n\nWell, for each round in the lcm_val rounds, we can determine the moves of both players and check who wins. But since lcm_val could be up to m*k, which for m and k up to 1000 would be 1e6, that's manageable. Because 1e6 is acceptable for processing once.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n\n2. For each of the cycle_length rounds, compute the moves of A and B, and count how many times each player loses in this cycle.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % cycle_length.\n\n5. The total losses for each player would be total_cycles * (losses in one cycle) plus the losses in the first 'rem' rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the losses in the first 'rem' rounds? For that, we can precompute for each possible position in the cycle (up to cycle_length) the cumulative losses. Then, for the rem rounds, we can look up the cumulative counts.\n\nAlternatively, for the full cycle, we can precompute for each round in the cycle, the outcome, and then sum the losses for the entire cycle. Then, for the remaining rounds, we can loop through the first rem rounds of the cycle and add their outcomes.\n\nBut for the full cycle, we can compute the number of times each player loses in that cycle. Let's say in each cycle, Nikephoros loses a times, and Polycarpus loses b times. Then, for total_cycles cycles, it's total_cycles * a and total_cycles * b.\n\nThen, for the remaining rem rounds, we can compute the number of losses in those rem rounds, and add them to the totals.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each round in the cycle (from 0 to cycle_length - 1), what the outcome is.\n\nBut how to compute the outcome for a given round index i (0-based)?\n\nFor each i, the move of A is A[i % m], and B's move is B[i % k]. Then, compare these two moves and determine if A wins, B wins, or draw.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to cycle_length - 1, we can compute the outcome.\n\nOnce we have this, for the full cycles, we can compute the total losses in a cycle, multiply by total_cycles, and then process the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute the LCM of m and k. Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's fine.\n\nBut wait, for the LCM calculation, we need to compute LCM(m, k). Let's code that.\n\nSo, first, compute m and k. Then compute GCD(m, k), then LCM is m * k // GCD.\n\nNow, for the cycle_length. Let's say m=3, k=4. LCM is 12. So for each of 12 rounds, the moves of A and B are in their respective cycles.\n\nOnce we have that, for each i in 0 to cycle_length-1, we can compute the moves, and for each such round, determine who loses.\n\nSo for each of these rounds, we can calculate the outcome and accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce we have the counts for the full cycle, then the rest is straightforward.\n\nBut what if the cycle_length is larger than n? Like, when n is smaller than cycle_length. Then, there are no full cycles, and we just process the first n rounds.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute cycle_length = LCM(m, k)\n\nfull_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nremaining_rounds = n % cycle_length\n\nThen, for the full_cycles, multiply the per-cycle counts by full_cycles.\n\nThen, for the remaining_rounds, process the first remaining_rounds rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how do we compute the per-cycle counts?\n\nWe can precompute for each round in 0..cycle_length-1, the outcome, and then sum all the counts for the entire cycle.\n\nBut for that, we need to loop through each of the cycle_length rounds and check the outcome.\n\nBut with m and k up to 1000, cycle_length can be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000 is 1e6). And for each of those, checking the outcome is O(1), so overall O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, for example, for the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3. B is \"RSPP\", k=4. LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo cycle_length is 12. Let's compute for each of 12 rounds:\n\nRound 0: A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. No loss.\n\nRound 1: A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S → S beats P? Wait, no. Wait, the rules are:\n\nRock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock.\n\nSo, for each pair:\n\nIf A's move is R and B's is S → A wins (R beats S), so B loses → Nikephoros (A) wins, so Polycarpus (B) gets a red spot.\n\nWait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if A wins, then B gets a red spot (so Nikephoros's count of red spots is incremented by 0, and Polycarpus's count is incremented by 1. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe loser gets pinched. So for each round, if A wins, then B is the loser, so B gets a red spot. So Nikephoros's red spots count is the number of times he lost, which is the number of rounds where B won.\n\nSimilarly, Polycarpus's red spots count is the number of times he lost, which is the number of rounds where A won.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check if A wins, B wins, or draw.\n\nSo for each round, the outcome can be:\n\nif A_win: then Nikephoros (A) wins, so B (Polycarpus) gets a red spot. So Nikephoros's loss count is not increased. But Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1.\n\nif B_win: then Nikephoros's loss count increases by 1, and Polycarpus's loss count doesn't.\n\nif draw: nothing.\n\nSo for each round, we need to determine whether A wins, B wins, or draw.\n\nSo how to compute that.\n\nLet me write a helper function:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 'draw'\n\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 'a_wins'\n\n    else:\n\n        return 'b_wins'\n\nYes. So for example, if a is R and b is S, a wins. If a is S and b is R, then b wins.\n\nSo for each round, we can compute this.\n\nSo, for the first sample input:\n\nIn the first round (round 0), A's move is R, B's is R. Draw. No loss.\n\nIn round 1: A's move is P, B's is S. So B's move is S. So S beats P? Wait, according to the rules, scissors (S) beats paper (P). So if B's move is S, and A's is P, then B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nIn the first sample, the example says:\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are as follows:\n\nRound 1 (probably 0-based or 1-based?), but the example explanation seems to be 1-based. Let me check:\n\nThe example input is 7 rounds. The example explanation shows:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (since S beats P? Or wait, in the example explanation, the second round is P vs S. The note says that Nikephoros loses. Wait, let me check the note:\n\n\"In the first sample the game went like this: R - R. Draw. P - S. Nikephoros loses. S - P. Polycarpus loses. R - P. Nikephoros loses. P - R. Polycarpus loses. S - S. Draw. R - P. Nikephoros loses.\"\n\nSo in the second round (the first round after the initial draw?), the moves are P (Nikephoros) and S (Polycarpus). According to the rules, S beats P. So Polycarpus's move (S) beats Nikephoros's move (P). Therefore, Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1. So in that case, the function returns 'b_wins' (since B is Polycarpus). So Nikephoros's loss count is increased by 1.\n\nSo in the helper function, when a is P and b is S, then the result is 'b_wins', because B's move (S) beats A's move (P).\n\nSo the helper function is correct.\n\nSo, for each round, we can compute whether A wins, B wins, or draw.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nFirst, read the input:\n\nn is the number of rounds.\n\nThen, read A and B as strings.\n\nThen, compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM(m, k) as cycle_length.\n\nThen, compute the number of full cycles and remaining rounds.\n\nBut for the code, we need to handle the case where n is zero? Well, the constraints say n is at least 1.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nOnce we have cycle_length, we can precompute for each of the cycle_length rounds, the outcome.\n\nBut for that, we can loop from 0 to cycle_length - 1, and for each i, compute a_move = A[i % m], b_move = B[i % k], then determine the outcome.\n\nThen, for each of these, we can accumulate the number of times Nikephoros loses (count_a) and Polycarpus loses (count_b) in one cycle.\n\nOnce we have that, then:\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * count_a + (number of times A loses in the first rem rounds)\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * count_b + (number of times B loses in the first rem rounds)\n\nBut how to compute the number of times A loses in the first rem rounds?\n\nWell, for that, we can precompute a list for each i in 0 to cycle_length-1, the number of A losses up to that round. But maybe it's easier to compute for the first rem rounds, loop through each of the first rem rounds and count the losses.\n\nBut for rem up to cycle_length (which is up to 1e6), this is acceptable.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nCompute the per_cycle_a (number of times A loses in one cycle) and per_cycle_b (number of times B loses in one cycle).\n\nThen, compute full_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\nrem = n % cycle_length.\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, we need to process the first rem rounds of the cycle.\n\nSo, for the rem rounds, loop from i=0 to rem-1, compute the outcome, and accumulate the a_loss and b_loss.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\ndef compute_losses_in_cycle(m, k, A, B):\n\n    cycle_length = lcm(m, k)\n\n    a_loss = 0\n\n    b_loss = 0\n\n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        # determine outcome\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            b_loss += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            a_loss += 1\n\n    return a_loss, b_loss\n\nWait, but in this function, for each round in the cycle, we check if A wins or B wins. Then, for each case, increment the corresponding loss count.\n\nOnce we have this, then the total for full cycles is full_cycles * a_loss and full_cycles * b_loss.\n\nBut then, for the remaining rounds, we need to compute how many a_loss and b_loss occur in the first rem rounds.\n\nSo, for that, we can have a helper function that, given a number of rounds (say, rem), computes the a_loss and b_loss in those rounds.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, for the rem rounds, we can loop from 0 to rem-1, and for each i, compute the same as above.\n\nBut for rem up to 1e6, that's acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute cycle_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute per_cycle_a, per_cycle_b = compute_losses_in_cycle(...)\n\nfull_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nrem = n % cycle_length\n\nThen, compute the a_loss_rem and b_loss_rem for the first rem rounds.\n\ntotal_a = full_cycles * per_cycle_a + a_loss_rem\n\ntotal_b = full_cycles * per_cycle_b + b_loss_rem\n\nThen, output total_a and total_b.\n\nBut how to compute a_loss_rem and b_loss_rem?\n\nWe can write a helper function that, given a number of rounds (say, r), returns the a and b losses in the first r rounds.\n\nBut perhaps, in code, we can loop from 0 to r-1, and for each i, compute the same as before.\n\nSo, for the rem rounds:\n\na_loss_rem = 0\n\nb_loss_rem = 0\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    ... same as before ...\n\nBut for rem up to 1e6, this is acceptable.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, and m and k up to 1e3, the maximum cycle_length is 1e6. So for each test case, the code runs O(1e6) steps for the cycle, and O(1e6) steps for the rem. So total O(2e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, if rem is up to cycle_length, which is 1e6, then yes.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the LCM.\n\nIn Python, math.gcd is available, but for LCM, we can compute it as (m * k) // gcd(m, k).\n\nBut need to handle cases where m or k is zero? Well, the problem says m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo code for LCM:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since a and b are positive, no problem.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn = 7\n\nA = \"RPS\" (m=3)\n\nB = \"RSPP\" (k=4)\n\ncycle_length = LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nNow, for each of the 12 rounds, compute the a_loss and b_loss.\n\nLet's compute that manually.\n\nFor i from 0 to 11:\n\ni=0: A[0%3]=R, B[0%4]=R → draw. No loss.\n\ni=1: A[1%3]=P, B[1%4]=S → B's move is S. S beats P → B wins. So A loses. a_loss +=1.\n\ni=2: A[2%3]=S, B[2%4]=P → S beats P → A wins. B loses → b_loss +=1.\n\ni=3: A[0%3]=R, B[3%4]=P → P beats R → B wins. A loses → a_loss +=1.\n\ni=4: A[1%3]=P, B[0%4]=R → P beats R → A wins → B loses → b_loss +=1.\n\ni=5: A[2%3]=S, B[1%4]=S → draw. No loss.\n\ni=6: A[0%3]=R, B[2%4]=P → P beats R → B wins → a_loss +=1.\n\ni=7: A[1%3]=P, B[3%4]=P → draw. No loss.\n\ni=8: A[2%3]=S, B[0%4]=R → R beats S → B wins → a_loss +=1.\n\ni=9: A[0%3]=R, B[1%4]=S → R beats S → A wins → B loses → b_loss +=1.\n\ni=10: A[1%3]=P, B[2%4]=P → draw.\n\ni=11: A[2%3]=S, B[3%4]=P → S beats P → A wins → B loses → b_loss +=1.\n\nNow, let's count the per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b.\n\na_loss is the number of times A loses in the cycle. Looking at the steps:\n\ni=1 → a_loss +=1 (1)\n\ni=3 → a_loss +=1 (2)\n\ni=6 → a_loss +=1 (3)\n\ni=8 → a_loss +=1 (4)\n\nTotal a_loss in cycle is 4?\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nLooking at each step:\n\ni=0: no loss.\n\ni=1: a_loss +=1 → total a_loss is 1.\n\ni=2: B loses → b_loss +=1.\n\ni=3: a_loss +=1 → total 2.\n\ni=4: b_loss +=1 → total b_loss is 2.\n\ni=5: no.\n\ni=6: a_loss +=1 → 3.\n\ni=7: no.\n\ni=8: a_loss +=1 → 4.\n\ni=9: b_loss +=1 → 3.\n\ni=10: no.\n\ni=11: b_loss +=1 → 4.\n\nSo per_cycle_a is 4, per_cycle_b is 4?\n\nWait, for the cycle, the total a_loss is 4, and b_loss is 4?\n\nBut in the sample input, n=7. Let's see:\n\nfull_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0. rem =7.\n\nSo the total a and b are computed from the first 7 rounds.\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds:\n\ni from 0 to 6.\n\nLet's check:\n\ni=0: no loss.\n\ni=1: a_loss +=1 (a=1)\n\ni=2: b_loss +=1 (b=1)\n\ni=3: a_loss +=1 (a=2)\n\ni=4: b_loss +=1 (b=2)\n\ni=5: no.\n\ni=6: a_loss +=1 (a=3)\n\nSo for rem=7, a_loss_rem is 3, b_loss_rem is 2.\n\nSo total_a = 0*4 +3 =3, total_b =0*4 +2=2. Which matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nYes! So the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is given:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nLet's see.\n\nA is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds:\n\nEach round, A's move is R, B's move is R. All draws. So per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b are 0.\n\nn=5. So full_cycles = 5//8=0, rem=5. For the first 5 rounds, all draws. So total_a and total_b are 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut for very large n (up to 2e9), but the code is O(m*k) time, which is acceptable for m and k up to 1e3, so 1e6 steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input. But the input is given as a list? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A.\n\nThird line contains sequence B.\n\nBut in the example input given in the problem, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. But in reality, the input is three lines: first line is n, second line is A, third line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich would be the first example. The output is 3 2.\n\nSo in code, we need to read the input as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the example given in the problem, the input is written as a list of two elements. But perhaps that's a formatting mistake. So assuming that the actual input is three lines.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    cycle_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n    # Now compute per_cycle_a and per_cycle_b\n\n    per_cycle_a = 0\n\n    per_cycle_b = 0\n\n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            per_cycle_b += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            per_cycle_a += 1\n\n    full_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\n    rem = n % cycle_length\n\n    # Now compute the rem rounds\n\n    rem_a = 0\n\n    rem_b = 0\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            rem_b +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            rem_a +=1\n\n    total_a = full_cycles * per_cycle_a + rem_a\n\n    total_b = full_cycles * per_cycle_b + rem_b\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first sample's per_cycle_a is 4 and per_cycle_b is 4. For n=7, full_cycles is 0. rem is 7. The rem_a is 3, rem_b is 2. So total_a is 3, total_b is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut let me check the code for that case.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the cycle_length is larger than n? For example, n=5, and cycle_length=12. Then rem is 5, and the code loops 5 times.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when n is exactly a multiple of cycle_length? Then rem is zero, and the code loops zero times, adding nothing.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the second sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo m=8, k=1. LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nper_cycle_a and per_cycle_b are zero, since all rounds are draws.\n\nfull_cycles = 5 // 8 = 0. rem=5. rem_a and rem_b are zero. So output 0 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=12, then full_cycles is 1. rem is 0. So total_a is per_cycle_a * 1 + 0. Which is 4 * 1 =4, and total_b is 4*1=4.\n\nBut in that case, for 12 rounds, each player loses 4 times. So output is 4 4.\n\nBut what if n=12?\n\nBut let's check the code.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where m=1, k=1. For example, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then cycle_length is 1. For each round, A's move is R, B's move is S. So A wins. So per_cycle_b is 1, per_cycle_a is 0. For n=2e9, the code computes full_cycles = 2e9 // 1 = 2e9. rem is 0. So total_a is 0, total_b is 2e9.\n\nAnother case: when A and B have sequences that have some overlapping cycles.\n\nAnother edge case: when n is zero. But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nNow, what about when the cycle_length is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when m or k is zero? According to the problem statement, m and k are at least 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that for very large cycle_length (like 1e6), the code may take some time, but for Python, it's acceptable for the constraints given (m and k up to 1e3, so 1e6 steps is manageable).\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, but with the code's approach, it's okay.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThe code would compute cycle_length = LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nThen, per_cycle_a is 4, per_cycle_b is 4.\n\nfull_cycles = 7//12 = 0. rem=7.\n\nThen, rem_a is 3, rem_b is 2. So output is 3 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput is 0 0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. So code returns 0 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is 'S', B is 'R'. Then B wins, so A loses. So output is 1 0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences of moves.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds. The key insight is that after the least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k` rounds, both sequences will realign, forming a repeating cycle.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Compute the LCM of the lengths of both sequences to determine the length of one full cycle of combined moves.\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: For each round within the cycle, determine the outcome (win, loss, or draw) for both players and count the losses for each player within one full cycle.\n4. **Calculate Full Cycles and Remainder**: Determine how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds and the remaining rounds after these full cycles.\n5. **Compute Total Losses**: Use the results from the full cycles and the remaining rounds to compute the total number of losses for each player.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    cycle_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_cycle_a = 0\n    per_cycle_b = 0\n    \n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            per_cycle_b += 1\n        else:\n            per_cycle_a += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // cycle_length\n    rem = n % cycle_length\n    \n    rem_a = 0\n    rem_b = 0\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            rem_b += 1\n        else:\n            rem_a += 1\n    \n    total_a = full_cycles * per_cycle_a + rem_a\n    total_b = full_cycles * per_cycle_b + rem_b\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the length of one full cycle of combined moves.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within the cycle, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome is evaluated to count losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles and remaining rounds after these cycles are calculated.\n5. **Loss Calculation**: The total losses for each player are computed by combining the results from full cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating nature of the sequences, ensuring the solution is both optimal and scalable.",
