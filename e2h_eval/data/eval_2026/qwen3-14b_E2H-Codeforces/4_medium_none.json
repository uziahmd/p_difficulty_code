The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine the number of red spots each player gets after n rounds of rock-paper-scissors. The players use cyclic sequences for their moves. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how their moves are determined. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of his sequence. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], with k being the length of his sequence. Then, for each round, we check who wins and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. That would take way too long. So we need a smarter approach here.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the cycles. Since both sequences repeat, the pattern of moves between the two players will eventually form a cycle. The total number of possible combinations of their moves is m * k. So, after m*k rounds, the pattern of moves will start repeating. Therefore, the number of rounds can be divided into two parts: the initial non-repeating part (if any) and then multiple full cycles of length L = lcm(m, k), or something like that?\n\nWait, maybe we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So, the entire sequence of move pairs will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. \n\nSo the idea is to compute how many full cycles there are in n rounds, and then compute the number of losses in one cycle, multiply by the number of full cycles, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, let's compute the number of rounds in one full cycle. Let's say L = LCM(m, k). For each of these L rounds, we can precompute the number of times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // L, and the remaining rounds are rem = n % L. \n\nThen, the total losses would be total_cycles * (losses_in_one_cycle) + losses_in_rem_rounds.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the losses in one cycle? Well, for each round in the L rounds, we can compute the outcome once and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut what if L is large? For example, m and k are up to 1000, so LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6. Because 1000 and 1000 have LCM 1e6. So for each test case, we can precompute for LCM(m, k) rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, but LCM(m, k) is up to 1e6, then even for 2e9, the calculation is manageable. Because 1e6 is manageable in terms of processing time.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute LCM of m and k. Let's call it L.\n\n2. For each of the L rounds, compute the moves of A and B, and determine the outcome. Accumulate the total number of losses for each player in one full cycle.\n\n3. Compute how many full cycles there are in n rounds (full_cycles = n // L), and the remainder (rem = n % L).\n\n4. Multiply the per-cycle losses by full_cycles.\n\n5. Then, compute the losses for the first rem rounds (using the same method as step 2, but only for rem rounds).\n\n6. Sum everything to get the total losses for each player.\n\nBut how to compute LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need to compute GCD first. Python has math.gcd, but it returns the absolute value. However, since m and k are positive integers, that's fine.\n\nWait, in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists, but it returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers. So, for m and k, compute GCD, then LCM is m*k // GCD(m, k). \n\nSo, first, I need to compute L.\n\nOnce I have L, then for the full cycles, I can calculate the number of times each player loses in one cycle. Then multiply by full_cycles.\n\nBut then, for the remainder, rem rounds, I need to simulate those rounds again.\n\nSo, the key is to simulate for L rounds once, and for rem rounds once. But since L can be up to 1e6, and for each of those rounds, we need to check the move pair, this is feasible.\n\nBut how to simulate the moves for a given round i (0-based or 1-based? Well, the problem says that the first round is round 1? Or zero-based? Let's check the example.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=7\n\nA is RPS (length 3), B is RSPP (length 4). So LCM(3,4)=12. So for the first 7 rounds, how does it go?\n\nThe example's note shows the rounds as:\n\nRound 1: R vs R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P vs S (Nikephoros loses?)\n\nWait, the example's explanation says:\n\nRound 1: R-R (draw). Then round 2: P vs S. Wait, but the sample input says A is \"RPS\", which is R, P, S. So for the first round (i=0?), Nikephoros uses A[0] = R. For the second round (i=1?), A[1] = P. B is RSPP, so B's sequence is R, S, P, P. So for the second round, B's move is B[1] = S. So the round 2 is P vs S. According to the rules, scissors (S) beats paper (P). So Nikephoros's move is P, which is paper. Polycarpus's move is S, scissors. So S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So he gets a red spot. So in the example, Nikephoros has 3 losses, Polycarpus 2.\n\nSo the code needs to process each round, for each i from 0 to n-1 (assuming rounds are 0-based?), and for each, compute the moves.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor a given number of rounds (say, x rounds), compute the number of times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses.\n\nTo compute that, for each round from 0 to x-1:\n\na_i = A[round % m]\n\nb_i = B[round % k]\n\nthen compare a_i and b_i.\n\nSo for each round, we can compute the outcome.\n\nNow, the problem is that for n up to 2e9, we can't simulate all rounds. Hence, the approach of finding the cycle length LCM(m, k) and then compute the number of full cycles and remainder.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute for each of the L rounds, the number of losses for each player. Let's call these cycle_nik and cycle_poly.\n\nThen, the total number of full cycles is full_cycles = n // L\n\nThe remaining rounds are rem = n % L.\n\nSo, total_nik = full_cycles * cycle_nik + count_losses_in_rem_rounds(rem)\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute count_losses_in_rem_rounds(rem). For that, we can simulate the first 'rem' rounds (from 0 to rem-1) and compute the number of losses.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B)\n\nCompute L = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute for the first L rounds, the number of losses for each player (cycle_nik, cycle_poly).\n\nfull_cycles = n // L\n\nrem = n % L\n\nCompute the number of losses in rem rounds (rem_nik, rem_poly)\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * cycle_nik + rem_nik\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * cycle_poly + rem_poly\n\nOutput total_nik and total_poly.\n\nBut how to compute the cycle_nik and cycle_poly?\n\nWe can loop for each i in 0 to L-1:\n\nget a = A[i % m], b = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine the outcome between a and b.\n\nincrement cycle_nik and cycle_poly accordingly.\n\nSimilarly for the rem rounds.\n\nNow, for L up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000, their LCM is up to 1e6), this is acceptable. Because 1e6 iterations are manageable in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, even with L=1e6, the full_cycles can be up to 2e9 / 1e6 = 2e3, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code can proceed this way.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement the function to compute the outcome between two moves.\n\nLet me think about that. For each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a red spot (so poly's count increases by 1).\n\nElse: Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\nSo how to check if a beats b.\n\nWe can have a helper function, or a lookup table.\n\nFor example:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nSo, for a and b:\n\nif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\nthen a wins, so Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nElse, if a and b are different, then Nikephoros loses, so he gets a spot.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Nikephoros loses, so he gets a spot.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nWait, the first element is the number of red spots Nikephoros gets (so when he loses, add 1), and the second is the number for Polycarpus (when he wins, add 1). So yes.\n\nSo for each pair, we can calculate the increments.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string, read B string.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute for L rounds, the total losses for each player.\n\nThen compute full_cycles and rem.\n\nCompute for rem rounds, the losses.\n\nNow, the code for LCM:\n\nImplementing LCM:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut in Python, the math.gcd function returns the greatest common divisor. However, note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since a and b are positive, that's fine.\n\nSo, for m and k, compute their GCD, then LCM.\n\nBut need to import math.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut for the case where L is 0? No, m and k are at least 1, so LCM is at least 1.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM.\n\nThen, for the LCM rounds, simulate each round and compute the total for cycle_nik and cycle_poly.\n\nThen, compute full_cycles = n // L, rem = n % L.\n\nThen, simulate rem rounds, compute rem_nik and rem_poly.\n\nTotal is full_cycles * (cycle_nik, cycle_poly) + (rem_nik, rem_poly).\n\nNow, the code for simulating the rounds.\n\nBut for simulating the rounds, we need to loop for x rounds, where x is either L or rem.\n\nSo, for example, for the L rounds:\n\ncycle_nik = 0\n\ncycle_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(L):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    nik, poly = get_result(a, b)\n\n    cycle_nik += nik\n\n    cycle_poly += poly\n\nSimilarly for rem rounds.\n\nBut for rem rounds, we can loop from 0 to rem-1:\n\nrem_nik = 0\n\nrem_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    nik, poly = get_result(a, b)\n\n    rem_nik += nik\n\n    rem_poly += poly\n\nBut for rem = 0, that loop doesn't run.\n\nSo, this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4). LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo, for L=12 rounds, we need to compute cycle_nik and cycle_poly.\n\nLet's compute for each of the 12 rounds.\n\nRound 0: i=0: A[0%3]=R, B[0%4]=R → draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 1: i=1: A[1%3]=P, B[1%4]=S. P vs S: S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So (1, 0) → Nik gets 1, Poly 0? Wait no, the function returns (nik, poly). Let me check:\n\nIn the get_result function, when a is P, b is S. So a is P, b is S. Which is P vs S. S beats P, so Nikephoros (a) loses. So Nikephoros's count increases by 1. So return (1, 0). So in this case, Nik gets 1, Poly 0. So for this round, Nik's count increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in round 2 (which is i=1?), the sample says that Nikephoros loses. So in the first sample, the first round (i=0) is a draw. Then round 1 (i=1) is P vs S. So Nikephoros loses. So in the sample explanation, the first sample's output is 3 and 2. Let's see how the code would compute it.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nLet me compute for all 12 rounds.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to see what the code would do for the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut let's proceed with the code approach.\n\nIn the sample input, n=7. So L=12. full_cycles = 7//12 = 0. rem=7. So the code would compute the first 7 rounds.\n\nSo, for rem=7, simulate 7 rounds.\n\nLet me list the rounds 0-6 (since rem is 7, i runs from 0 to 6):\n\ni=0:\n\nA[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. (0,0)\n\ni=1: A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S → P vs S. S beats P. Nikephoros loses. (1, 0)\n\ni=2: A[2%3] = S, B[2%4] = P → S vs P. S beats P. Nikephoros wins. So (0,1). So Poly gets 1.\n\ni=3: A[3%3=0] = R, B[3%4=3] = P → R vs P. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. (1, 0).\n\ni=4: A[4%3=1] = P, B[4%4=0] = R → P vs R. P beats R. Nikephoros wins. (0,1).\n\ni=5: A[5%3=2] = S, B[5%4=1] = S → S vs S. Draw. (0,0).\n\ni=6: A[6%3=0] = R, B[6%4=2] = P → R vs P. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. (1,0).\n\nSo adding up:\n\nFor the 7 rounds:\n\nNik's losses: 1 (i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) → total 3.\n\nPoly's losses: 1 (i=2) + 1 (i=4) → total 2. Which matches the sample output. So the code would compute that correctly.\n\nThus, the code approach seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich is n=5, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). So LCM(8,1)=8. For each of the 8 rounds, the moves are:\n\nA[i%8] is R for all i. B[i%1] is R for all i. So all rounds are draws. So for the 5 rounds, no losses. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about when the LCM is larger than n? Like in the second sample, where n=5 and LCM is 8. So full_cycles is 0, rem=5. So simulate 5 rounds, all draws. Correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the inputs. But the input format is:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nSecond line is sequence A.\n\nThird line is sequence B.\n\nBut in the example given in the problem statement, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent the input as a list of strings. However, in actual code, the input is read from stdin. So the code should read n from the first line, then read the next line as A, then the next line as B.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys, math\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nB = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read properly. For example, sometimes, after reading n, there might be a newline, but the next line is read as A. So using strip() is important.\n\nNow, code for LCM:\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd returns the GCD of the absolute values. So for positive a and b, it's okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut let's code the helper function for getting the results.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can inline it.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    L = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # compute cycle_nik and cycle_poly for L rounds\n\n    cycle_nik = 0\n\n    cycle_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(L):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        # determine who wins\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n            cycle_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # Nikephoros loses, so he gets a spot\n\n            cycle_nik += 1\n\n    # compute full_cycles and rem\n\n    full_cycles = n // L\n\n    rem = n % L\n\n    # compute rem_nik and rem_poly\n\n    rem_nik = 0\n\n    rem_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            rem_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            rem_nik += 1\n\n    total_nik = full_cycles * cycle_nik + rem_nik\n\n    total_poly = full_cycles * cycle_poly + rem_poly\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, in the code above, for the cycle_nik and cycle_poly, the code loops over L rounds. For each round, if a != b, then check who wins and increment accordingly.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the first sample:\n\nIn the first sample, L=12. For the 12 rounds, the code computes cycle_nik and cycle_poly. Then, full_cycles is 7//12=0, rem=7. So the code computes the rem_nik and rem_poly as 3 and 2, which gives the correct output.\n\nAnother test case: when n is equal to L, then rem is zero. So the code will have total_nik = cycle_nik * 1 + 0, etc.\n\nNow, what if n is larger than L? For example, n = L * 2 + 3. Then full_cycles is 2, rem is 3. So the code would compute 2 * cycle_nik + rem_nik.\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nBut what about the case where m and k are 1? Like, A is 'R' and B is 'S'. Then LCM(1,1)=1. For each round, the code will check for each i in 0..0 (L=1). So for n=2e9, full_cycles is 2e9, and rem is 0. So the code would compute cycle_nik and cycle_poly for 1 round. For that round, a=R, b=S. So Nikephoros wins, so cycle_poly +=1. So total_poly is 2e9 * 1, and total_nik is 0. So output is 0 2e9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the sequences are longer than n?\n\nLike n=2, m=3, k=3. Then L=3. So rem is 2. So code would simulate 2 rounds.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where rem is zero? For example, n = L. Then rem is zero, and the rem loops don't run. So total_nik is full_cycles * cycle_nik + 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the time constraints?\n\nFor m and k up to 1000, LCM can be up to 1e6. So for each test case, the code runs O(1e6) steps. For each step, it's O(1). So for 1e6 steps, in Python, that's acceptable. Even for 2e9, the code will run quickly.\n\nBut in Python, for 1e6 steps, it's manageable. For example, 1e6 iterations in a loop take about a second or less. So with 2e6 steps (for L and rem), it's acceptable.\n\nSo this code should pass all test cases.\n\nNow, let's test the code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich would be read as:\n\nn=7, A is 'RPS', B is 'RSPP'.\n\nSo m=3, k=4. LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nThen, for L=12 rounds:\n\nWe need to compute cycle_nik and cycle_poly.\n\nLet me compute that manually for some rounds.\n\nBut perhaps it's tedious, but let's try for the first few rounds.\n\nFor i in 0 to 11:\n\ni=0:\n\nA[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw.\n\ni=1: A[1%3=1] = P, B[1%4=1] = S → P vs S. S beats P. Nikephoros loses. So cycle_nik +=1.\n\ni=2: A[2%3=2] = S, B[2%4=2] = P → S vs P. S beats P. Nikephoros wins. So cycle_poly +=1.\n\ni=3: A[0], B[3%4=3] = P. R vs P. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. cycle_nik +=1.\n\ni=4: A[1], B[0%4=0] = R. P vs R. P beats R. Nikephoros wins. cycle_poly +=1.\n\ni=5: A[2], B[1%4=1] = S. S vs S. Draw.\n\ni=6: A[0], B[2%4=2] = P. R vs P. Nikephoros loses. cycle_nik +=1.\n\ni=7: A[1], B[3%4=3] = P. P vs P. Draw.\n\ni=8: A[2], B[0%4=0] = R. S vs R. R beats S. Nikephoros loses. So cycle_nik +=1.\n\ni=9: A[0], B[1%4=1] = S. R vs S. R beats S. Nikephoros wins. cycle_poly +=1.\n\ni=10: A[1], B[2%4=2] = P. P vs P. Draw.\n\ni=11: A[2], B[3%4=3] = P. S vs P. S beats P. Nikephoros wins. cycle_poly +=1.\n\nSo let's count the cycle_nik and cycle_poly:\n\nLooking at each i from 0 to 11:\n\ncycle_nik is incremented at i=1, 3, 6, 8 → total of 4 times.\n\ncycle_poly is incremented at i=2,4,9,11 → total of 4 times.\n\nSo for the 12 rounds, cycle_nik=4, cycle_poly=4.\n\nThen, for n=7, full_cycles = 0, rem=7. So the code computes the rem_nik and rem_poly as 3 and 2. Which gives total_nik=3, total_poly=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for this case.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nn=5, A=RRRRRRRR (m=8), B=R (k=1). LCM(8,1)=8. For each of the 8 rounds, all moves are R vs R. So cycle_nik and cycle_poly are 0. rem is 5. So rem_nik and rem_poly are 0. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python. Also, note that in the code, the input is read via input(). But sometimes, when reading from stdin, there might be issues with leading/trailing spaces. However, using .strip() on the A and B strings should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: n=0? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when m=1 and k=1, and the moves are same. Then all rounds are draws. So output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: when A is R and B is S. Then for each round, Nikephoros wins. So for n=1, output is 0 1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when n is very large (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences for their moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every m moves, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every k moves.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The pattern of moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds, where LCM is the least common multiple of m and k. This allows us to break down the problem into computing results for one full cycle and then using this to compute results for the remaining rounds.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By precomputing the number of losses in one full cycle (LCM(m, k) rounds), we can quickly compute the total losses for all full cycles and then handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    L = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    cycle_nik = 0\n    cycle_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(L):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            cycle_poly += 1\n        else:\n            cycle_nik += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // L\n    rem = n % L\n    \n    rem_nik = 0\n    rem_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            rem_poly += 1\n        else:\n            rem_nik += 1\n    \n    total_nik = full_cycles * cycle_nik + rem_nik\n    total_poly = full_cycles * cycle_poly + rem_poly\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read from standard input, including the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the cycle length after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within one full cycle (LCM length), we determine the outcome of each round and count the losses for both players.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The total number of full cycles and the remaining rounds after these cycles are calculated. The results from the full cycles are multiplied by the number of full cycles, and the remaining rounds are processed separately.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The total number of losses for each player is computed by combining the results from the full cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large values of `n` by leveraging the repeating cycle of moves, thus avoiding the need to simulate each round individually.",
