    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. So, I need to figure out which element to remove so that when I take the max and min of the remaining elements, their difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to check for each element, remove it, compute max and min of the rest, then find the minimum instability. But with n up to 1e5, that approach would be O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible. Because for each element, you'd have to scan the array again to find max and min, which would be O(n) per element, leading to O(n²) time. That's going to be too slow for n=1e5.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). If we can remove one element that's either the max or the min, maybe that would help. But sometimes, there are multiple maxima or minima, so removing one might not affect the overall max or min.\n\nWait, for example, if the array has multiple max elements. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. The original instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 7, the new instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 7-1=6. So in this case, removing the max element gives us a better result.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The original instability is 4. If we remove 5, the instability becomes 4-1=3. If we remove 1, the instability is 5-2=3. So the best is to remove either end. But how do we know which element to remove?\n\nAnother example: [1, 1, 1, 1]. Removing any element leaves all 1s. So instability is 0.\n\nSo the key idea is that the optimal element to remove is either the first occurrence of the max, the last occurrence of the max, the first occurrence of the min, or the last occurrence of the min. Or perhaps, when considering the sorted array.\n\nWait, maybe if we sort the array first. Let's think: the instability of the original array is max - min. If we remove an element, the new instability depends on the new max and min. But if we sort the array, then the min is the first element and max is the last. So, when we remove an element, the new min and max would be the first and last elements of the array except that one element.\n\nBut how can we find which element to remove? Let's think about the sorted array. Suppose the array is sorted as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. Then, when you remove an element, the new min and max could be:\n\nIf you remove the first element (a[0]), the new min is a[1], and max is a[n-1]. So instability is a[n-1] - a[1].\n\nIf you remove the last element (a[n-1]), the new max is a[n-2], and min is a[0]. Instability is a[n-2] - a[0].\n\nIf you remove any element in between, say a[i], then the min is still a[0], and max is a[n-1], so the instability is the same as original. Wait, no. Because if you remove an element that's not the min or max, then the min and max remain the same. So the instability remains the same. Therefore, in that case, removing such an element doesn't help. So the only way to reduce the instability is to remove either the first element (min) or the last element (max), or possibly some other elements if there are duplicates.\n\nWait, but if there are duplicates. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 2, 3]. Original instability is 3-1=2. If you remove one of the 2s, the instability is still 3-1=2. But if you remove the first element (1), the instability is 3-2=1. If you remove the last element (3), the instability is 2-1=1. So in this case, the best is to remove the min or the max.\n\nSo in the sorted array, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[n-2] - a[0]) and (a[n-1] - a[1]). Because those are the two possibilities when you remove the first or last element. But wait, what if there are",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps us easily identify the minimum and maximum values and their positions.\n2. **Consider Edge Cases**: After sorting, the minimum instability can be achieved by either removing the first element (minimum value) or the last element (maximum value). This is because removing these elements will reduce the range (difference between max and min) of the remaining elements.\n3. **Evaluate Options**: Calculate the instability for both scenarios:\n   - Removing the first element (minimum value), which results in the instability being the difference between the second element and the last element.\n   - Removing the last element (maximum value), which results in the instability being the difference between the first element and the second-to-last element.\n\nBy evaluating these two scenarios, we can determine the minimum possible instability efficiently in O(n log n) time due to sorting, which is optimal for large input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    # The minimum instability is the minimum between removing the first element or the last element\n    # Because removing any other element won't change the max and min\n    min_instability = min(a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1])\n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for determining instability.\n- **Evaluating Instability**: By considering the removal of the first and last elements in the sorted array, we can compute the potential instability values efficiently. This approach ensures we only need to check two possible scenarios, leading to an optimal solution with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, O(n log n).\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and edge cases, ensuring that we find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element.",
