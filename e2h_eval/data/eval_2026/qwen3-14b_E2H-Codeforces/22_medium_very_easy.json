After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But we need to count each student once even if they are the best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column), find the maximum value.\n2. For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many students meet this condition.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, input handling. The input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line is a string of digits. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the first student's marks for 3 subjects.\n\nSo, I need to read the input, parse it into a 2D array. Let's think: for each student, their marks are a list of integers. Then, for each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n\nOnce I have the maximums for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects are equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next n lines as a list of strings. Then convert each string into a list of integers. So, for example, the first example input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nThe data would be:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nThen, for each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (from student 0 and 1)\n\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 1)\n\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 0)\n\nSo, for each student:\n\nStudent 0 has 2 in subject 0 (which is max), and 3 in subject 2 (max). So he is successful.\n\nStudent 1 has 2 in subject 0 (max) and 3 in subject 1 (max). So successful.\n\nStudent 2 has none of the max values. So not successful. Hence total is 2, which matches the example.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each column, find the maximum value.\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max of that column. If yes, count them.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. Let's see: the input comes from stdin. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut wait, in the example given, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. Wait, the first input line is two integers n and m. Then next n lines each have m characters.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nSo the code should read n=3, m=3, then read 3 lines.\n\nSo in Python, the code can read the first line as n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, read the next n lines as a list of strings. Then, for each of those strings, convert into a list of integers. So, for example, for the first line, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce that's done, we need to compute for each subject (each column) the maximum value.\n\nSo, for each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( [students[i][j] for i in 0..n-1] )\n\nOnce we have this list of max_marks, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max_marks for that column.\n\nIf at least one such exists, then the student is successful.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead the next n lines, each as a string. Then, create a 2D list of integers. Let's call it grades. So grades is a list of lists.\n\nThen, for each column j, compute the max value.\n\nThen, for each student in grades, check if any of their marks in column j is equal to max_marks[j]. If yes, then count this student.\n\nNow, how to compute the max_marks for each column.\n\nFor example, for j in 0 to m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n))\n\nOnce that is done, for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max_marks for that column.\n\nSo, for each student in grades:\n\nfor any j in 0..m-1:\n\nif student[j] == max_marks[j], then mark as successful and break.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\ngrades = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    grades.append(row)\n\nThen compute max_marks for each column.\n\nmax_marks = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    col_max = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if grades[i][j] > col_max:\n\n            col_max = grades[i][j]\n\n    max_marks.append(col_max)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_marks = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nBut for each column j, compute the maximum.\n\nOnce that's done, for each student in grades, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to max_marks[j].\n\nSo, count = 0\n\nfor student in grades:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nSo, that's the code.\n\nWait, but in Python, for each student, we can check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max for that column.\n\nSo, for each student, check if any of the elements in their row is equal to the corresponding element in max_marks.\n\nSo, for example, for student's row [2,2,3], max_marks is [2,3,3]. So for j=0, 2 == 2 → yes. So this student is counted.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor row in grades:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if row[j] == max_marks[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test with the first example.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngrades is:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: max(2,2,1) → 2\n\ncolumn 1: max(2,3,1) → 3\n\ncolumn 2: max(3,2,2) → 3\n\nso max_marks is [2,3,3]\n\nCheck each student:\n\nFirst student: [2,2,3]\n\nCheck j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nSecond student: [2,3,2]. j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nThird student: [1,1,2]. For j=0, 1 < 2. j=1, 1 <3. j=2, 2 <3. So no. Not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo, grades:\n\nFirst student: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nSecond: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nThird: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks per column:\n\ncolumn 0: max(9,1,1) → 9\n\ncolumn 1: max(1,1,1) →1\n\ncolumn 2: max(7,8,1) →8\n\ncolumn 3: max(2,2,1) →2\n\ncolumn4: max(8,8,1) →8\n\nso max_marks = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow check each student:\n\nFirst student:\n\nfor j=0, 9 == 9 → yes. So counted.\n\nSecond student:\n\nj=2: 8 == 8 → yes. Also j=4: 8 ==8. So counted.\n\nThird student: check each column. For j=1, 1 ==1. So yes. So counted. So total 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase when all students have same marks. For example, n=2, m=1. All students have 5. Then max is 5. Each student is best in the subject. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the single student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=5. All marks are 5. Then the student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [9, 9], student 2 has [9, 9]. Then for each column, max is 9. Both students are successful. So count is 2.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. Then convert each character to int.\n\nCompute max_marks for each column.\n\nThen check for each student.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read n lines. For example:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngrades = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    grades.append(row)\n\nThen compute max_marks:\n\nmax_marks = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_marks = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nBut for each j, the code loops through all i.\n\nOnce that is done, count the students:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in grades:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nSo putting all together.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngrades becomes [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks is [2,3,3]\n\ncount is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ngrades:\n\n[[9,1,7,2,8], [1,1,8,2,8], [1,1,1,1,1]]\n\nmax_marks is [9, 1, 8, 2, 8]\n\nEach student:\n\nFirst student has 9 in column 0 → counted.\n\nSecond student has 8 in column 2 and 8 in column 4 → counted.\n\nThird student has 1 in column 1 → counted. So total 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngrades = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    line = input().strip()\n\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = []\n\nfor j in range(m):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in grades:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting for cases where n=1, m=1.\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n5\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, m=1\n\ninput:\n\n2 1\n\n5\n\n5\n\nmax_marks is [5]. Both students have 5. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case where n=2, m=2:\n\ninput:\n\n2 2\n\n99\n\n99\n\nmax_marks is [9,9]. Both students are counted. So output is 2.\n\nAnother case where n=2, m=2:\n\ninput:\n\n2 2\n\n98\n\n97\n\nmax_marks for column 0 is 9, column 1 is 8.\n\nFirst student has 9 (col0) → counted. Second student has 9 (col0) → counted. So output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m), followed by the gradebook entries.\n2. **Grade Conversion**: Convert each row of the gradebook from strings to lists of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Identify Successful Students**: Check each student to see if they have at least one subject where their mark matches the maximum mark for that subject.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is parsed to get the number of students (n) and subjects (m). Subsequent lines are read as the gradebook entries.\n2. **Conversion to Integers**: Each grade entry is converted from a string to a list of integers to facilitate numerical comparisons.\n3. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This helps in determining the best performance in each subject.\n4. **Checking Successfulness**: For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark matches the maximum mark for that subject. If so, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging simple iteration and comparison operations, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
