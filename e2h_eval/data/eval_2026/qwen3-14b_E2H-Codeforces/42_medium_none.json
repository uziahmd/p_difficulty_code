    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. \n\nSo, the first thing I need to understand is how these progress bars work. Let me rephrase the problem. For each byte copied, there's a current file's progress and the total progress. Both are calculated as floor(100 * x / a_i) for the current file's progress, and floor(100 * (sum of all previous files' sizes plus x) / total_sum) for the total progress. And we need to find all values that appear on both bars at the same time.\n\nThe challenge is to simulate all possible moments when these values are equal. But since the files can be up to 1000 bytes each, and n is up to 100, the total number of bytes could be up to 100*1000 = 100,000. So for each byte copied, we can compute both percentages and check if they are equal. Then collect all such values.\n\nBut wait, how do we model the moments? Because for each byte x in each file i, after copying that byte, the progress bars update. So the steps are:\n\nFor each file i from 1 to n:\n   For each byte x from 1 to a_i:\n       compute current_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n       compute total_percent = floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum)\n       if current_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\nBut also, we need to consider the initial state where both are 0. Because before any bytes are copied, both are 0. So that's included.\n\nWait, the problem says that the progress bars update after each byte. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. Then, after the first byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. So for each byte x (from 1 to a_i for each file i), we have to check the value after that byte is copied.\n\nBut how to model the sum_prev? Let's think: sum_prev is the sum of all previous files. For example, for the first file, sum_prev is 0. For the second file, sum_prev is a_1, and so on.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nCompute the total_sum = sum(a_1 ... a_n).\n\nThen, for each file i, compute the prefix sum up to file i-1. Let's call it prefix_sum[i]. For example, prefix_sum[0] = 0, prefix_sum[1] = a_1, prefix_sum[2] = a_1 + a_2, etc. Wait, maybe better to have a cumulative sum array.\n\nOnce that's done, for each file i, and for each byte x in 1..a_i:\n\ncurrent progress is floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\ntotal progress is floor(100 * (prefix_sum[i-1] + x) / total_sum )\n\nIf these two are equal, then add that value to a set.\n\nAdditionally, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0 for both. So 0 is always in the answer.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is considered as a moment. So even if there's no bytes copied, the bars are both zero. So we have to include 0 in the result if there's at least one moment where both are zero. Which is always true, because the initial state is zero. However, maybe there are other moments where both are zero again. But according to the problem statement, the output needs to collect all numbers that exist in any moment. So 0 is definitely present.\n\nBut how do we model the initial state? Because in the code, when we process the first byte of the first file, the initial state is before that. So perhaps we need to check for the initial state separately.\n\nWait, the problem says that the initial state is 0 for both. So that's a valid moment. So 0 is definitely in the answer. However, when processing the bytes, the initial state is not covered by the loop. Because for the first byte x=1, the progress bars are updated after that byte is copied. So the initial state is before any bytes are copied. Therefore, we need to include 0 in the result unless there's no such moment. But according to the problem statement, the initial state is part of the process. So the answer must include 0.\n\nBut what about the case when the total_sum is 0? No, since each a_i is at least 1, so total_sum is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Compute the total_sum.\n\n- Initialize a set to collect the valid percentages.\n\n- Add 0 to the set, since that's the initial state.\n\n- Then, for each file i (from 0 to n-1?), and for each x from 1 to a_i:\n\n   compute current_percent = (x * 100) // a_i\n\n   compute total_bytes_so_far = prefix_sum[i] + x\n\n   total_percent = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n\n   if current_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\nWait, but how to compute prefix_sum[i]? Let's think:\n\nprefix_sum[i] is the sum of the first i files. For example, for the first file (i=0?), prefix_sum is 0. For the first file, the prefix_sum before it is 0. Then, when processing the first file, each x is added to that prefix_sum. So for the first file, the prefix_sum[i-1] would be 0. So perhaps, we can precompute a list of prefix_sums where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a_1, prefix_sums[2] = a_1 + a_2, etc. So for the i-th file (assuming 1-based index?), the prefix_sum before it is prefix_sums[i-1].\n\nSo for example, if the files are [a1, a2, a3], then prefix_sums is [0, a1, a1+a2, a1+a2+a3]. Then, when processing file i (starting from 1?), the prefix_sum before is prefix_sums[i-1], and during processing of the file, the bytes are added to that.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + a[i])\n\nThen, for each file i (0-based?), the prefix_sum before is prefix_sums[i], and during processing of the file, the bytes are from 1 to a[i]. So for the i-th file (assuming 0-based in the list), the prefix_sums[i] is the sum of the previous files.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n, then read the list a of size n.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums as [0, a[0], a[0]+a[1], ... ].\n\nInitialize a set called result, and add 0 to it.\n\nThen for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   prefix_sum_before = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n\n       total_bytes_so_far = prefix_sum_before + x\n\n       total_percent = (total_bytes_so_far * 100) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to result.\n\nOnce all these are processed, collect all elements in the result set, sort them, and output.\n\nWait, but what about the end of the process? For example, when all bytes are copied, the total_percent is 100. But the last byte's processing would have that. Also, after the last byte is copied, the progress bars are 100% for both. So that's included in the processing. Because for the last file, when x is a[i], then total_bytes_so_far is prefix_sum_before + a[i] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i] = prefix_sums[i+1] = total_sum. So total_percent is (total_sum * 100) // total_sum = 100. And the current_percent is (a[i] * 100) // a[i] = 100. So 100 is added to the set. So the final state is handled.\n\nBut in the example given, the first input is 1 and 6. The output includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Let me see why. Because for each byte copied, the current percent and total percent are same. For example, when the file is 6 bytes, the total sum is 6. So for each x, the total percent is (x * 100)/6, same as the current percent. So all those values are added. But the output shows 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Let's check:\n\nFor x=0, it's 0. Then for x=1: (1*100)/6 = 16.666... floored to 16. Similarly for x=2: 33.333... floored to 33. x=3: 50. x=4: 66.666 → 66. x=5: 83.333 → 83. x=6: 100. So yes, all those numbers are collected. So the code would collect them. So the code seems correct.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 2 files of 100 and 500. Total sum is 600. The output is 0,95,96,...,100. Let's think. For the first file (100 bytes), the prefix sum before is 0. For each x from 1 to 100, current percent is (x *100)/100 = x. The total percent is (x * 100)/600 = x/6. So when x is 1, total is 0. So current is 1, total is 0. Not equal. For x=599? No, wait, the first file is 100 bytes. So during the first file, x ranges from 1 to 100. For x=100, the current percent is 100, total is (100 * 100)/600 = 16.666... → 16. So during the first file, the only possible match is when x=0 (initial state). Then, when the first file is copied, the next file is 500 bytes. So for the second file, the prefix_sum_before is 100. For each x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent percent is (x *100)/500 = 0.2x. Total bytes so far is 100 + x. So total percent is ( (100 +x)*100 ) / 600 = (100 +x)/6. So when is 0.2x = (100 +x)/6 ?\n\nMultiply both sides by 6: 1.2x = 100 +x → 0.2x = 100 → x=500. So when x=500, current percent is 0.2*500 = 100, total percent is (100 + 500) *100 / 600 = 600*100/600=100. So 100 is added. But during the second file, for x=599? No, the second file is 500 bytes. So for x=500, it's the last byte. But during the second file, for x=500, the total bytes is 600. So that's the end. But what about during the second file?\n\nBut what about when x is such that the current percent and total percent are same. For example, when x=599? Well, no, since the second file is 500 bytes. So for x from 1 to 500.\n\nBut what about when the total percent is 95? Let's see. Let's think for the second file. Suppose during the second file, the total percent is 95. So (100 + x)*100 / 600 = 95. So (100 + x) = 95 *6 = 570 → x=470. So 100 +470 = 570. Then current percent is (470 * 100)/500 = 94. So 94 != 95. So not equal. But perhaps there's some x where both are same. For example, when x is 599? No, because the second file is 500 bytes. So during the second file, x can be up to 500.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for the second case includes 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. How does that happen?\n\nWait, the note says that in the second test case, the first progress bar immediately goes ahead, then resets to zero and starts catching up again. At the end, the progress bars show the same number for some time. So maybe during the second file, when the total progress is 95, 96, etc., and the current progress is same. Let's think.\n\nLet me take the second example: n=2, a=[100, 500]. total_sum=600. So during the first file, the first progress bar is x percent (since x is from 1 to 100), and the total progress is (x * 100)/600 = x/6. So for x=1, total is 0. For x=6, total is 1. So during the first file, the only possible overlap is when x=0 (initial state). Then, when the first file is done, the first progress bar is 100% (after x=100). The total progress is 100*100/600 = 16.666... → 16. So during the second file, the first progress bar starts from 0 again. So for the second file, each x is from 1 to 500. The current progress is (x * 100)/500 = 0.2x. The total progress is (100 + x) * 100 / 600 = (100 + x)/6.\n\nWe need to find x in 1..500 where 0.2x = floor( (100 + x)/6 ), but wait, no. Wait, the current progress is floor( (x * 100)/500 ), which is floor(0.2x). The total progress is floor( (100 + x) * 100 / 600 ) = floor( (100 +x)/6 ). So we need to find x where these two are equal.\n\nBut how can that happen? Let's think for some x. Let's say the value is p. So:\n\nfloor(0.2x) = p\n\nfloor( (100 + x)/6 ) = p\n\nWhich implies that:\n\np ≤ 0.2x < p + 1\n\nand \n\np ≤ (100 + x)/6 < p + 1\n\nSo combining these equations.\n\nLet me try to find x where these hold. Let's take p=95.\n\nThen:\n\nFor the first equation: 95 ≤ 0.2x < 96 → 95 / 0.2 ≤ x < 96 / 0.2 → 475 ≤ x < 480. Since x is an integer between 1 and 500, x can be 475, 476, 477, 478, 479.\n\nFor the second equation: 95 ≤ (100 + x)/6 < 96 → multiply by 6: 570 ≤ 100 +x < 576 → 470 ≤ x < 476. So x can be 470, 471, 472, 473, 474, 475.\n\nThe intersection of the two ranges is x=475. So for x=475:\n\nCheck the current progress: 0.2 *475 = 95.0 → floor is 95.\n\nTotal progress: (100 +475)/6 = 575/6 = 95.833... → floor is 95. So yes. So p=95 is achieved here.\n\nSimilarly for p=96:\n\nFirst equation: 96 ≤ 0.2x < 97 → 480 ≤ x < 485.\n\nSecond equation: 96 ≤ (100+x)/6 < 97 → 576 ≤ 100 +x < 582 → 476 ≤x < 482. So x ranges from 476 to 481 (since 482 is excluded). The intersection between 480-485 and 476-482 is x=480,481.\n\nCheck x=480:\n\ncurrent progress: 0.2*480=96 → floor 96.\n\ntotal: (100 +480)/6 = 580/6 = 96.666..., floor is 96. So yes. So p=96 is in the set.\n\nSimilarly for p=97:\n\nFirst equation: 97 ≤ 0.2x < 98 → x in 485 <= x < 490.\n\nSecond equation: 97 ≤ (100 +x)/6 < 98 → 582 ≤ 100 +x < 588 → 482 ≤x < 488. So x ranges from 482 to 487. The intersection is x=485, 486, 487.\n\nCheck x=485: current is 97. total is (100 +485)/6 = 585/6 = 97.5 → floor 97. So yes.\n\nSame for p=97.\n\nSimilarly for p=98:\n\nFirst equation: 98 ≤ 0.2x < 99 → x in 490 ≤x < 495.\n\nSecond equation: 98 ≤ (100 +x)/6 < 99 → 588 ≤ 100 +x < 594 → 488 ≤x < 494. So x ranges 488 to 493. Intersection is x=490,491,492,493.\n\nCheck x=490: current is 98. total is (100+490)/6 = 590/6 = 98.333... → 98. So yes.\n\np=99:\n\nFirst equation: 99 ≤ 0.2x < 100 → x in 495 ≤x < 500.\n\nSecond equation: 99 ≤ (100 +x)/6 < 100 → 594 ≤ 100 +x < 600 → 494 ≤x < 500. So x ranges from 494 to 499. Intersection is x=495-499. So for x=495:\n\ncurrent is 0.2*495=99.0 → floor 99. total is (100+495)/6=595/6=99.166... → floor 99. So yes.\n\nFor x=499: current is 99.8 → floor 99. total is (100+499)/6=599/6=99.833... → floor 99. So yes. So p=99 is added.\n\nFor p=100: x=500. current is 0.2 *500=100. total is (100+500)/6=600/6=100. So yes.\n\nSo these values are all added. Also, the initial 0. So the output includes 0,95,96,97,98,99,100. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code approach seems correct.\n\nNow, considering that for each byte, we can compute these two percentages and check for equality. Since the maximum possible bytes is 100*1000=1e5, and for each byte we do O(1) operations, this is feasible.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nFirst, read n, then the list a. Then compute the prefix_sums. Then for each file, iterate through each x from 1 to a[i], compute the two percentages and check for equality.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n, then a as a list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a)\n\nCompute prefix_sums as a list, starting with 0, then adding each a[i] cumulatively.\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    prefix_sum_before = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes = prefix_sum_before + x\n\n        total_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nOnce all that is done, collect the sorted list of the elements in the result set.\n\nBut wait, what about the moment when the last byte is copied? For example, when x is the last byte of the last file. That would generate 100% for both, which is added. Also, the initial 0 is added.\n\nBut what about when the total_sum is 0? Well, the constraints say that a_i >= 1, so total_sum is at least n >=1. So no division by zero.\n\nNow, test case 1:\n\nInput is 1 and 6. The code adds 0. Then for each x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_percent is (x * 100)//6. total_bytes is 0 +x, total_sum is 6. So (x * 100) //6. So same as current_percent. So all those values are added. So the set will have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is the third example: 4 files with sizes 1000, 2, 2, 998. The output is 0,50,99,100. Let's think why.\n\nThe total_sum is 1000 +2 +2 +998 = 2002.\n\nLet's see for the first file (size 1000). For x=500, the current percent is (500 *100)/1000 = 50. The total bytes is 500. total_percent is (500 * 100)/2002 = 50000 / 2002 ≈ 24.975 → floor 24. Not equal. So not added. But perhaps during other files.\n\nBut according to the sample output, 50 is present. How?\n\nMaybe during the third file. Or during the fourth file. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the first file, when x is 1000 bytes. Then current_percent is 100. total bytes is 1000. total_percent is (1000 * 100)/2002 = 100000 / 2002 ≈ 49.95 → floor 49. So not equal. So 100 is not added here. But during the fourth file, perhaps?\n\nBut the sample output includes 50. Let's think. Maybe during the second file.\n\nLet me think. The second file is size 2. The prefix_sum_before is 1000. So for x=1, total bytes is 1000 +1 = 1001. total_percent is (1001 * 100)/2002 = 100100 / 2002 = 50. So floor is 50. The current percent is (1*100)/2 = 50. So yes. So this x=1 in the second file would add 50 to the set. Hence 50 is present.\n\nAh, that's why 50 is in the output. So the code would capture that.\n\nThus, the code approach is correct.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n from stdin. Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix_sums:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n\ntotal_sum = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nInitialize result as a set containing 0.\n\nThen for each i in 0..n-1:\n\ncurrent_file_size = a[i]\n\nprefix_sum_before = prefix_sums[i]\n\nfor x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\ncompute current_percent and total_percent as per the formula.\n\nif equal, add to the set.\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list of the set.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as a list of strings, but in practice, the code should read from stdin. So for example, in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n['1\\n6', '2\\n100 500', ...]\n\nBut in reality, the code would read from stdin. So for example, the code would read n as int(input()), then a as list(map(int, input().split())).\n\nBut in the sample input, for example, the first case is:\n\nInput:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nWhich would be read as n=1, a = [6].\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that after reading n, the next line is read properly.\n\nOnce that's done, compute prefix_sums.\n\nThen proceed as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this:\n\nRead n, then a.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a) (or prefix_sums[-1]).\n\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    prefix_sum_before = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes = prefix_sum_before + x\n\n        total_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nFinally, collect the sorted list of the elements in result.\n\nThen print them in order, each on separate lines. Or in the sample outputs, the outputs are like \"0\\n16\\n33...\" etc. So for example, the first sample output is \"0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\".\n\nSo the code would collect the sorted list, then print each element on a separate line.\n\nBut in Python, for example, sorted_result = sorted(result), then for each element in sorted_result, print it.\n\nBut in the sample outputs, the first sample's output is \"0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\", which is each number on its own line.\n\nSo the code would do:\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input's output is \"0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\", which is exactly that.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, a=[1]. Then total_sum is 1. The initial 0 is added. Then for x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent is (1 * 100) // 1 = 100. total_bytes is 1. total_percent is (1 * 100) //1 = 100. So 100 is added. So the result is {0, 100}. Output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a=[1, 1]. total_sum=2. Initial 0. For first file (size 1):\n\nx=1: current is 100, total is (1 *100)/2=50. Not equal. So nothing added. For the second file, prefix_sum_before is 1. x ranges 1:\n\ncurrent_percent is (1*100)/1=100. total_bytes is 1+1=2. total_percent is 2*100/2=100. So added. So result is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[2, 2]. total_sum=4. For first file:\n\nx=1: current is 50, total is (1 * 100)/4 = 25. Not equal. x=2: current 100, total (2*100)/4=50. Not equal. For the second file, prefix_sum_before is 2. For x=1: current is 50. total is (2+1)*100/4 = 75 → 75. Not equal. x=2: current is 100, total is (4 * 100)/4=100. So added. So result is {0, 100}.\n\nBut during the second file, for x=2, it's added. Also, during the first file, when x=0, initial state. So the output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: when during the same x, both percentages are same. For example, when the total_sum is 100, and a file is 100. Then for every x, the percentages are same. So all values from 0 to 100 are present. But the code would collect them.\n\nBut how? For example, for x=50, current is 50, total is (50 * 100)/100 = 50. So added. So the code would collect all the possible values.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case when the same value is generated multiple times? For example, when during different x's, the same percentage is generated. But since we are using a set, duplicates are handled automatically.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut what about the case when the total_sum is 0? Well, the constraints say that a_i >=1, so total_sum is at least 1.\n\nAnother thing to note: when the current_file_size is zero? No, since a_i >=1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    prefix_sums = [0]\n    for num in a:\n        prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n    total_sum = prefix_sums[-1]\n    result = {0}\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_file_size = a[i]\n        prefix_sum_before = prefix_sums[i]\n        for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n            current_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n            total_bytes = prefix_sum_before + x\n            total_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n            if current_percent == total_percent:\n                result.add(current_percent)\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for num in sorted_result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the sample input for the third case is 4 files with sizes 1000, 2, 2, 998. The output is 0,50,99,100. Let's check.\n\nIn this case, during the second file (size 2), prefix_sum_before is 1000. For x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = (1 * 100)/2 = 50.\n\ntotal_bytes = 1000 +1 = 1001. total_sum is 1000+2+2+998 = 2002.\n\ntotal_percent = (1001 * 100) // 2002 = 100100 // 2002 = let's calculate 2002 * 50 = 100100. So 100100 / 2002 = 50. So yes, exactly 50. So added. Hence 50 is in the result.\n\nAnother case: when the total_bytes is 2002 -1 = 2001. For example, during the last file, which is 998 bytes. Let's say x=998. total_bytes is prefix_sum_before (1000 +2 +2 = 1004) + 998 = 2002. So total_percent is 100. current_percent is (998 *100)/998 = 100. So added.\n\nBut also, for x= 997 in the last file:\n\ntotal_bytes = 1004 + 997 = 2001. total_percent is (2001 *100) // 2002 = 200100 // 2002. Let's compute 2002 * 99 = 198198. 2002 * 99.9 = 2002 * 99 + 2002 * 0.9 = 198198 + 1801.8 = 199999.8. So 200100 is 200100 - 199999.8 = 100.2 more than 99.9. So 200100 / 2002 = 99.95... → floor is 99. What's the current_percent for x=997 in the last file? The current_file_size is 998. So current_percent = (997 * 100) // 998 = (99700) // 998. Let's compute 998 * 99 = 98802. 99700 - 98802 = 898. So 99. So current_percent is 99. So total_percent is 99. So 99 is added. Hence, the sample output includes 99.\n\nThus, the code correctly captures these cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are simultaneously shown on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are rounded down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute prefix sums to efficiently determine the total bytes copied up to each file.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, compute both the current file progress and the overall progress. Check if these values are equal and collect such values.\n4. **Set for Unique Values**: Use a set to collect unique values of percentages that match at any point during the copying process.\n5. **Output**: Sort the collected values and print them in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    prefix_sums = [0]\n    for num in a:\n        prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n    total_sum = prefix_sums[-1]\n    result = {0}\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_file_size = a[i]\n        prefix_sum_before = prefix_sums[i]\n        for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n            current_percent = (x * 100) // current_file_size\n            total_bytes = prefix_sum_before + x\n            total_percent = (total_bytes * 100) // total_sum\n            if current_percent == total_percent:\n                result.add(current_percent)\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for num in sorted_result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using standard input functions. The first line gives the number of files, and the second line provides the sizes of these files.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: We compute prefix sums to keep track of the cumulative size of files up to each point. This helps in quickly determining the total bytes copied up to any given file.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, we calculate the current progress percentage and the overall progress percentage. These are computed using integer division to ensure they are floored as required.\n4. **Set Collection**: A set is used to collect all unique percentages where both progress bars show the same value. This ensures that each value is only counted once.\n5. **Sorting and Output**: The collected values are sorted and printed in ascending order, ensuring the output meets the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each byte's contribution to both progress bars, ensuring we capture all moments where both bars show the same percentage. The use of prefix sums and sets ensures optimal performance and correctness.",
