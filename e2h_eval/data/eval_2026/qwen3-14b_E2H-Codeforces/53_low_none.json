Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with the examples. For instance, the input 'ababa' gives output 3. The substring 'aba' occurs starting at index 0 and 2. So even though they overlap, it's counted. So overlapping is allowed.\n\nThe challenge is to find all possible substrings, check their occurrences, and find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently? Since the string length is up to 100, maybe a brute-force approach is acceptable here. Let's think about possible approaches.\n\nThe brute-force way would be to check for all possible substrings of the string, and for each substring, check if it appears at least twice. Then keep track of the maximum length found.\n\nBut how to generate all possible substrings and check their occurrences?\n\nLet me think. For each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once found, return L as the maximum.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate L from the maximum possible (length of string) down to 1.\n2. For each L, generate all possible substrings of length L.\n3. For each such substring, check if it appears again elsewhere in the string.\n4. If any substring meets the condition, return L as the answer.\n5. If no such substring is found for any L, return 0.\n\nBut how to generate all substrings of a certain length and check their occurrences?\n\nFor example, for a string s of length n, for length L, the possible substrings are s[i:i+L] for i from 0 to n-L.\n\nFor each of these substrings, we can collect all their starting indices and check if there are at least two different indices where they appear.\n\nBut for checking if a substring occurs more than once, perhaps we can use a set. For each L, iterate through all possible starting indices, collect the substrings, and check if any substring appears more than once.\n\nWait, but for each L, if we collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once. But how to do that?\n\nFor example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (positions 1-3), 'aba' (positions 2-4). So when we collect these, we can see that 'aba' appears twice. So for this L, we can return 3.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop L from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   For each possible starting index i (from 0 to len(s)-L), collect the substring s[i:i+L].\n\n   Check if any of these substrings occurs more than once.\n\n   If yes, return L as the maximum.\n\nOnce we find the maximum L for which this is true, return it.\n\nBut how to check if a substring occurs more than once?\n\nFor each L, we can create a dictionary that maps substrings to the list of starting indices. Then, for each substring in the dictionary, if the list has length >=2, then return True.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, we can collect all substrings and check if any duplicates exist. For example, using a set. For each substring in the list of substrings for that L, if adding it to a set causes the size to not increase, then there's a duplicate.\n\nBut that would only check if there's at least two occurrences. However, since the same substring can be present multiple times, but we need at least two occurrences.\n\nSo, for each L:\n\n   Create a list of all substrings of length L.\n\n   Check if there's any duplicate in this list.\n\nIf yes, then return L as the maximum.\n\nBut how to check for duplicates in the list? Well, for example, if the list has a length greater than the number of unique elements, then there's at least one duplicate.\n\nBut for this, we can use a set. For example:\n\nsubstrings = [s[i:i+L] for i in range(len(s)-L+1)]\n\nif len(substrings) != len(set(substrings)):\n\n   then there is at least one duplicate. So return L.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because if there are multiple duplicates, but the set's size is smaller than the original list's length. So for example, if there are two same elements, then the set's size is one less than the list's length. So yes, if len(substrings) > len(set(substrings)), then there's at least one duplicate.\n\nBut in this case, the problem requires that the substring occurs at least",
