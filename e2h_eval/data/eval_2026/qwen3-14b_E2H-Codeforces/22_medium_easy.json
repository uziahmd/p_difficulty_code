After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the steps. First, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters, each representing the marks. Oh right, each line is a string of digits, like '223' for a student's marks in 3 subjects.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (columns), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if in any of the subjects they have the maximum mark for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, but how to process the data? Let's think about the data structure. Let's say we have a 2D list, where each row is a student and each column is a subject. Then for each column, find the max value. Then for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns equals the max for that column.\n\nYes. So, first, I need to process the gradebook into a list of lists. For example, if the input is '223', then it becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce that's done, for each column j, find the maximum value among all students' j-th marks. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max of that column. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next n lines, each as a string, then convert each into a list of integers. So, for example, the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223 → [2,2,3]\n\n232 → [2,3,2]\n\n112 → [1,1,2]\n\nThen, for each column (0, 1, 2):\n\nColumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\n\nColumn 1: 2, 3, 1 → max is 3.\n\nColumn 2: 3, 2, 2 → max is 3.\n\nNow, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: [2,2,3]. Check each column:\n\nIn column 0, 2 equals max (2). So yes. So this student is successful.\n\nStudent 1: [2,3,2]. Column 1 has 3 which is max. So yes.\n\nStudent 2: [1,1,2]. None of their marks are equal to the max of their respective columns. So no.\n\nThus total is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- For each column, find the max value.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their entries in the columns equals the max of that column.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the inputs. Let's see. The input comes from stdin. So, the first line is n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, but in the actual code, the input is read from stdin. So, perhaps the code should read from stdin, but for testing, the sample input is given as a list. But for the code, it's standard input.\n\nSo, the code will read the first line as n, m. Then read n lines, each line being a string of m digits.\n\nSo, let's process that.\n\nFor example, in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, grades = [list(map(int, list(input().strip()))) for _ in range(n)]\n\nWait, for each of the next n lines, we take the input string, and convert each character to an integer, making a list. So that's correct.\n\nOnce we have the grades as a 2D list, then for each column j (from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum value in that column.\n\nWe can do this by transposing the matrix. For example, using zip(*grades) would transpose the rows and columns. But since each row is a list of integers, zip(*grades) would give us tuples for each column. Then, for each of those tuples, we can find the max.\n\nWait, for example:\n\ngrades = [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\ntransposed = list(zip(*grades)) → [(2,2,1), (2,3,1), (3,2,2)]\n\nThen, for each column in transposed, the max is max(column).\n\nSo, we can create a list called max_per_subject, which is [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)].\n\nOnce we have that, then for each student (each row in grades), check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max_per_subject for that subject.\n\nSo for each student in grades:\n\nfor student in grades:\n\n    for j in range(m):\n\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n\n            mark this student as successful and break.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCompute max_per_subject as a list of m elements.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each student in grades:\n\n    for j in 0..m-1:\n\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n\n            count +=1\n\n            break\n\nSo, that's the plan.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nLet me test with the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngrades becomes:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\ntransposed is [(2,2,1), (2,3,1), (3,2,2)]\n\nmax_per_subject is [2,3,3]\n\nThen, for each student:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]. Check each subject:\n\nsubject 0: 2 == 2 → yes → count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]. subject 1: 3 == 3 → yes → count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]. subject 0: 1 < 2; subject 1: 1 <3; subject 2: 2 <3 → no. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\ngrades:\n\n[[9,1,7,2,8], [1,1,8,2,8], [1,1,1,1,1]]\n\ntransposed:\n\ncolumns are:\n\n[9,1,1], [1,1,1], [7,8,1], [2,2,1], [8,8,1]\n\nmax_per_subject is [9, 1, 8, 2, 8]\n\nNow check each student:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]. Check each subject:\n\nsubject 0: 9 == 9 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]. subject 2: 8 == 8 → yes. Also subject 4: 8 ==8 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]. Check each subject:\n\nsubject 1: 1 equals max (1). So yes. So counted.\n\nHence total 3, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, handling edge cases. What if all students have same marks in all subjects? For example, n=2, m=1. All students have 5. Then each student is best in the subject. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=any. Then the single student is best in all subjects, so count is 1.\n\nAnother case: m=1, n=3. Marks are 2, 3, 1. Then max is 3. Only the second student is successful.\n\nSo code seems to handle these.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplementing in Python.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each as a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_per_subject as [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)].\n\nThen, for each student in grades, check if any of their marks in the subjects equals the max_per_subject for that subject.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input.\n\nBut wait, the input may have leading or trailing spaces? No, according to the problem statement, each of the next n lines is a string of m characters, each from 1-9. So, each line is exactly m characters long. So, when reading each line, we can just take the entire line, strip any whitespace (though probably not needed, but to be safe?), then convert each character to int.\n\nBut in code, for each line, input().strip() would get rid of any leading/trailing whitespace, but the problem says that each line is exactly m characters. So perhaps it's better to read the line as is, but perhaps in some cases, there could be leading or trailing whitespace? Probably not, but the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nOnce that's done, compute max_per_subject.\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n\nThen, for each student in grades, check if any of their elements equals the corresponding max_per_subject.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nLet me test this code with the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\ngrades:\n\n223 → [2,2,3]\n\n232 → [2,3,2]\n\n112 → [1,1,2]\n\nmax_per_subject is [2,3,3].\n\nThen, for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2,2,3. Check j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. count increases by 1.\n\nstudent 1: 2,3,2. j=1: 3 ==3 → yes. count increases by 1.\n\nstudent 2: 1,1,2. None. So no. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=3, m=5.\n\ngrades:\n\n91728 → [9,1,7,2,8]\n\n11828 → [1,1,8,2,8]\n\n11111 → [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject:\n\nfor each column:\n\ncol0: 9,1,1 → max 9.\n\ncol1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\ncol2:7,8,1 → max 8.\n\ncol3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\ncol4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nso max_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8].\n\nstudent 0: 9,1,7,2,8 → j=0: 9 ==9 → yes. counted.\n\nstudent 1: 1,1,8,2,8 → j=2: 8 ==8 → yes. counted.\n\nstudent 2: 1,1,1,1,1 → j=1: 1 ==1 → yes. counted. So total 3. Correct.\n\nSo code works for samples.\n\nNow, what about if a student has multiple subjects where they are best? Like, if a student is best in two subjects, but the code counts them once. Which is correct, since the problem says \"if there exists a subject he is the best at\".\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nNow, the code needs to read from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each as a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_per_subject.\n\nCount the students.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting edge cases.\n\nCase where n=1, m=1: input is 1 1 followed by 5. Then the student is best, count is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Input:\n\n2 1\n\n5\n\n5\n\nmax_per_subject is [5]. Both students have 5. So both are counted. Output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Input:\n\n2 2\n\n99\n\n99\n\nmax_per_subject is [9,9]. Both students have 9 in both. So both are counted. Output 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2.\n\nInput:\n\n2 2\n\n98\n\n97\n\nmax_per_subject is [9,8]. First student has 9 in first subject, so counted. Second student has 9 in first subject, so counted. So output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: First, read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m characters representing the grades of students.\n2. **Determine Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject (column in the gradebook), determine the maximum grade achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum grade in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(col) for col in zip(*grades)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and converted into a list of lists where each sublist represents a student's grades in different subjects.\n2. **Finding Maximum Grades**: Using the `zip` function, we transpose the gradebook to access each subject's grades as a column. For each column, we compute the maximum grade.\n3. **Checking Successfulness**: For each student, we check if their grade in any subject matches the maximum grade for that subject. If it does, the student is counted as successful.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the successful students by leveraging transposition and maximum value checks, ensuring an optimal solution with time complexity O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
