On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo, the key here is to figure out which subarray to reverse so that when we do that, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is as long as possible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how reversing a subarray affects the LNDS. Let's think about the original array. The LNDS of the original array is something, but by reversing a part of it, maybe we can make more elements in order.\n\nBut considering all possible subarrays to reverse would be O(n²) possibilities, and for each possibility, calculating the LNDS would be O(n log n) time. However, with n up to 2000, that would be O(n^4 log n) time which is way too slow. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need a smarter way. Let's think about the structure of the problem. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is determined by the number of 1s and 2s and how they are arranged. For example, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. But if there are some 1s followed by 2s, then the LNDS is n. However, if there are some 2s followed by 1s, then reversing a part could help.\n\nLet me think: the original array's LNDS can be computed, but maybe the optimal reversal is to fix some transition points between 1s and 2s. For instance, if there's a segment where 2s come before 1s, reversing that segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which would contribute more to the LNDS.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the best possible scenario. The maximum possible LNDS after any reversal would be the original maximum plus some gain from the reversal. But how?\n\nAnother approach: since the array has only 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be calculated as the number of 1s plus the number of 2s in the longest possible sequence where all 1s come before 2s. Wait, because the sequence is non-decreasing, so all 1s first then 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s in the array, but only if there's a way to arrange them. But that's only possible if the original array is already non-decreasing. Otherwise, there's some 2s followed by 1s, which would break the sequence.\n\nSo the idea is to find the best way to reverse a subarray such that the number of transitions from 2 to 1 is minimized. Because each such transition reduces the LNDS. For example, if the original array has some 2s followed by 1s, reversing that part would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, thus eliminating that transition.\n\nSo perhaps the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in order, by reversing a subarray that contains some 2s followed by 1s.\n\nLet me think of the original array. Let's compute the number of 1s and 2s. The maximum possible LNDS is n if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1. Wait, no. For example, if there are k transitions from 2 to 1, then each such transition would reduce the LNDS by 1. Because for each such transition, you have to split the sequence into parts. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 1, 2], then there are two transitions (2 to 1 and 1 to 2?), no, wait, transitions from 2 to 1 are the ones that break the non-decreasing order. So in the original array, the number of transitions from 2 to 1 is the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Each such transition reduces the LNDS by 1 compared to the maximum possible.\n\nWait, the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1. Because each such transition represents a point where the sequence breaks the non-decreasing order. For example, in the array [1, 2, 1, 2], there are two transitions from 2 to 1 (between index 2 and 3, and between index 3 and 4). But the LNDS here is 2 (for example, 1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help reduce the number of transitions from 2 to 1, which in turn can increase the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Transitions**: The LNDS of a sequence of 1s and 2s is maximized when there are fewer transitions from 2 to 1. Each such transition reduces the LNDS by 1.\n2. **Count Transitions**: Calculate the number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original sequence.\n3. **Maximize LNDS**: By reversing a subarray that contains these transitions, we can eliminate some of them. The optimal strategy is to find the maximum number of transitions that can be eliminated by reversing a subarray, which will give us the maximum possible LNDS.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Count the number of 2->1 transitions\n    transitions = 0\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if a[i] == 2 and a[i+1] == 1:\n            transitions += 1\n    \n    # The maximum possible LNDS is n - transitions\n    # But we can reverse a segment to reduce transitions by at most 1\n    # Because reversing a segment that contains exactly one 2->1 transition\n    # can remove it, but not more than that.\n    # However, if there are no transitions, then it's already optimal.\n    max_lnds = n - transitions\n    if transitions > 0:\n        max_lnds += 1\n    print(max_lnds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an integer `n` and a list `a` representing the sequence of 1s and 2s.\n2. **Counting Transitions**: We iterate through the list to count the number of times a 2 is immediately followed by a 1. Each such occurrence is a transition that breaks the non-decreasing order.\n3. **Calculating Maximum LNDS**: The maximum possible LNDS is calculated as the total number of elements minus the number of transitions. If there are transitions, reversing a subarray can potentially eliminate one such transition, thus increasing the LNDS by 1.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 2000 elements.",
