For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the three notes can be ordered in some way. For a major triad, there must be an ordering where X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. For minor, it's 3 then 4. So, for each possible permutation of the three notes, I need to check these conditions.\n\nBut how do I represent the notes and calculate the distances between them?\n\nHmm. The notes are given in a specific order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait. Oh right, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic. So each note can be assigned an index from 0 to 11, where C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11. Then, the distance between two notes is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but since the distance is measured as the number of semitones moving upwards, maybe?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from X to Y when moving upwards. For example, between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me check: C to C# is 1, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4. Yes. So the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12? But wait, if X is E and Y is C, then the distance would be (0 - 4) mod 12? No, because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (Y + 12 - X) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The distance between two notes is measured along the musical scale. For example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because moving upward from E to C would require going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance is (y - x) mod 12, but if you want the distance from X to Y, then it's (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + 12). Or equivalently, (y - x) % 12? Wait no. Because if X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0). Then (y -x) is -4. Mod 12 would be 8. Which is correct. So the distance from X to Y is (y -x) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (y -x). If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (y -x + 12). Which is equivalent to (y -x) mod 12. So for example, X is E (4), Y is C (0): distance is (0-4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the key is to calculate the distance between two notes as (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, when we have X and Y, the distance is the number of semitones from X to Y when moving upwards. So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), the distance is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), the distance is 8. So, the distance is (y -x) if y >=x, else (y -x + 12). Which is exactly (y -x) mod 12. Because mod 12 gives a value between 0 and 11. Wait, but 0 is allowed? Well, if X and Y are the same note, then the distance is zero. But in the problem, the chord is made of three distinct notes. Wait, the input is three space-separated notes. Are they allowed to be the same? Well, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, but the input could have duplicates? But according to the problem statement, the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But for the problem, the input is three notes. So perhaps the three notes are distinct. However, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, so perhaps the code doesn't need to handle cases where the notes are not distinct. But perhaps the code should assume that the three notes are distinct. However, the problem says that the input is three notes. So, perhaps the code can process them regardless.\n\nBut back to the problem. So, for any two notes, the distance between them is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. However, when considering the distance between X and Y, the problem says that the distance is measured as from X to Y, so for example, the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones if X is C and Y is E. But for the problem of checking major or minor triads, the order of the notes in the triad matters. For example, for a major triad, the three notes must be arranged such that X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3. So, for a given set of three notes, we need to check all possible permutations of them and see if any of them satisfies the condition for major or minor.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Assign each note to its index (like C is 0, C# is 1, etc.)\n\n2. For the three given notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the distances).\n\n3. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check:\n\n   a. For major: distance X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3.\n\n   b. For minor: distance X to Y is 3, Y to Z is 4.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies a, then it's major. If any permutation satisfies b, then it's minor. Otherwise, strange.\n\nBut how many permutations are there? For three elements, there are 6 permutations. For each permutation, check the two conditions.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for the three notes, there are 3! = 6 possible orderings. For each of them, check if the first two steps are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all permutations and see if any of them meet the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, create a mapping from note names to their indices. Let's see:\n\nThe order is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nWait, the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is:\n\nIndex 0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nSo, for example, H is index 11, and then after that comes C again.\n\nSo, the first thing is to create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. Let's make that.\n\nThen, for the three input notes, we can get their indices. Let's call them a, b, c. But since the order of the three notes in the input is arbitrary, we need to check all permutations of them.\n\nSo, for example, given the three notes, we can generate all permutations of the three, and for each permutation (x, y, z), check:\n\ndistance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3 → major.\n\nOR\n\ndistance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then output 'major'; similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\nRead the three notes as a list.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation, compute the distances between x and y, and between y and z.\n\nCheck for major or minor.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the condition, return the corresponding result.\n\nNow, how to generate permutations. In Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, for the list [a, b, c], permutations would give all 6 possible orderings.\n\nBut perhaps even better: for each of the three notes, check all possible orderings. For example, for the three notes, the permutations can be generated as follows.\n\nBut since the code is in Python, using itertools.permutations is straightforward.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\n- Read the input line. For example, input is a list of three strings, like ['C E G', 'C# B F', ...]. Wait, the input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is something like ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], but that's probably the example for the output. Wait, the actual input is a single line with three notes. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo, for example, the input could be \"C E G\" (as in the first example), and the output is \"major\".\n\nSo, the code should read a single line, split into three notes.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would read:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, the three notes are notes[0], notes[1], notes[2].\n\nNow, the next step is to map each note to its index. So, create a dictionary:\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nWait, but what about the note 'H'? The problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So yes, H is the last one. So the dictionary is correct.\n\nBut need to make sure that the note names are correctly matched. For example, 'B' is index 10, 'H' is 11.\n\nOnce the three notes are converted to their indices, let's say a, b, c. Then, generate all permutations of these three indices.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCompute distance between x and y: (y - x) mod 12?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12? Or is it (y_index - x_index) if positive, else adding 12?\n\nWait, no. The distance is calculated as (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But for example, if x is C (0), y is E (4): 4-0=4 mod 12 is 4. Correct. If x is E (4), y is C (0): 0-4 = -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But since in the problem statement, the distance is measured from X to Y, which is the number of semitones you need to move up from X to reach Y. So the distance is (y - x) mod 12. But in code, how to compute that?\n\nIn Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result when the denominator is positive. So (y - x) % 12 would give the correct distance.\n\nSo, for example, (0 - 4) % 12 = 8, which is correct.\n\nSo, for each permutation (x, y, z), we compute:\n\ndistance_xy = (y - x) % 12\n\ndistance_yz = (z - y) % 12\n\nThen, check if distance_xy is 4 and distance_yz is 3 → major.\n\nOr, distance_xy is 3 and distance_yz is 4 → minor.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that for a major triad, the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones and between Y and Z is 3. So, the order is X to Y to Z, with X to Y being 4, Y to Z being 3. So, for the permutation (X, Y, Z), the distances are computed as (Y - X) mod 12 and (Z - Y) mod 12. But since the distance is measured from X to Y, which is (Y - X) mod 12, and from Y to Z, which is (Z - Y) mod 12. So, for example, if X is C (0), Y is E (4), Z is G (7). Then Y - X is 4, which is correct. Z - Y is 3. So that's a major triad.\n\nSo, for each permutation, we can check these two distances.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor the three notes, generate all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check if the first two distances are 4 and 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor). If any permutation meets the major condition, then the answer is 'major'. Similarly for minor. Otherwise, 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\n- Read the three notes.\n\n- Convert them into their indices.\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three indices.\n\n- For each permutation, check:\n\n   if (distance between first and second is 4) and (distance between second and third is 3) → major.\n\n   if (distance between first and second is 3) and (distance between second and third is 4) → minor.\n\n- If any permutation meets the major condition, return 'major'.\n\n- Else, if any permutation meets the minor condition, return 'minor'.\n\n- Else, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, the code can be written.\n\nBut how to generate permutations. Let's see. Using itertools.permutations.\n\nFor example, for the three notes, let's say they are stored in a list called note_indices = [a, b, c]. Then, permutations would be all possible orderings of the three elements.\n\nBut since the three notes can be in any order, we need to check all permutations.\n\nBut for example, if the three notes are [0, 4, 7], then permutations would include (0,4,7), (0,7,4), (4,0,7), etc. For each of them, check the distances.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nThen, for each perm in permutations(note_indices):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n   if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n       return 'major'\n\n   elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       return 'minor'\n\nOnce any of these conditions is met, we can return the corresponding result.\n\nBut since there are multiple permutations, we need to check all of them. For example, even if one permutation meets the major condition, we can immediately return 'major'.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can loop through all permutations, check for major or minor, and if found, return the answer.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nFirst case: C E G → indices 0, 4, 7.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's take the permutation (0,4,7). d1 = 4-0=4 mod12=4, d2 = 7-4=3 mod12=3 → major. So returns 'major'.\n\nSecond case: C# B F → the notes are C#, B, F. Let's convert to indices:\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nLooking for permutations. Let's see the example says that ordering B, C#, F. So the permutation would be (10, 1, 5). Let's check:\n\nd1 = (1 - 10) mod12 = ( -9 ) mod12 = 3. Because 1 -10 is -9, mod12 is 3. Then d2 is (5 - 1) mod12 =4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So the code would find this permutation and return 'minor'.\n\nThird case: A B H → indices 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck all permutations. Let's see:\n\nFor example, permutation (9, 10, 11): d1 is 1, d2 is 1 → no.\n\nPermutation (9, 11, 10): d1 is (11-9)=2 mod12=2, d2 is 10-11 = -1 mod12=11. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: (10, 9, 11). d1 is (9-10) mod12 = 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: (10, 11, 9). d1 is 1, d2 is (9-11) mod12 = 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (11, 9, 10). d1 is (9-11) mod12 = 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (11, 10, 9). d1 is 10-11 mod12 = 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code would work for the sample.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the note_to_index mapping. However, note that the note names may have '#' in them. For example, 'C#' and 'D#'.\n\nSo, the note_to_index dictionary should have entries for each of the 12 notes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nWe can create the dictionary as:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nBut wait, the note_order is as per the problem description. Let me check:\n\nProblem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So yes. So the note_order list is correct.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nThen, the input is read as three notes. For example, input().split() gives the three notes.\n\nSo, for example, for input line 'C E G', the split gives ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nThen, for each note in the input, get their index. So:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the indices.\n\nThen, for each permutation, check for major or minor.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but this code checks all permutations. However, once any permutation meets the major condition, found_major becomes True. Similarly for minor. But since permutations are checked in order, even if a permutation meets both conditions (though the problem says that it's impossible), the code will set both flags. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so there are no cases where both are true. So, in the code, after checking all permutations, if found_major is True, output 'major', else if found_minor is True, output 'minor', else 'strange'.\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nYes. Because for example, if any permutation meets the major condition, then the answer is major. Similarly for minor. Because the problem says that the answer is unambiguous.\n\nBut let's think: suppose there are two permutations, one that meets the major condition and another that meets the minor condition. But according to the problem statement, this is impossible. So the code can safely check for found_major and found_minor.\n\nBut in code, for example, if a permutation meets both conditions (which is impossible), but the code would set both flags. However, according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. So the code can safely check for found_major first, then found_minor.\n\nBut in reality, for a given triad, can there be a permutation that meets both major and minor conditions?\n\nLet me think. For example, for a permutation (X,Y,Z) where d1=4 and d2=3 (so major), and another permutation (say, X,Z,Y) where d1 is 3 and d2 is 4. But that would require that the distances between X and Z is 3, and between Z and Y is 4. But for the original permutation, X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3. So the total distance from X to Z is 7. So, for X to Z is 7. Then, the distance from Z to Y is (Y - Z) mod 12. Since Y is X +4, Z is Y +3 = X +7. So Y is X+4, Z is X+7. Then, Z to Y is (Y - Z) mod 12 = (X+4 - (X+7)) mod 12 = (-3) mod 12 = 9. So not 3. So, no. So, it's impossible for a single triad to satisfy both major and minor conditions. Because the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So the code can safely check for found_major and found_minor.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test some examples.\n\nAnother example: the input is C# B F → which is the second sample. The notes are C#, B, F. Their indices are 1, 10, 5. Let's generate permutations.\n\nOne of the permutations is (10, 1, 5). Let's compute:\n\nd1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Because 12 -9 =3. Then d2 is (5 -1) mod 12 =4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So found_minor becomes True.\n\nAnother permutation may be (1, 10, 5). d1 is (10-1) mod12=9, d2 is 5-10 mod12= ( -5 ) mod12 =7. Not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nSo the code would find found_minor is True.\n\nThus, the code would output 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: input is A B H. Indices are 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck all permutations. For example, permutation (9, 10, 11): d1 is 1, d2 is 1. No. Permutation (9, 11, 10): d1 is 2, d2 is (10 -11) mod12 = 11. No. Permutation (10, 9, 11): d1 is (9-10) mod12 = 11, d2 is 2. No. Permutation (10, 11, 9): d1 is 1, d2 is (9-11) mod12 = 10. No. Permutation (11, 9, 10): d1 is (9-11) mod12 = 10, d2 is 1. No. Permutation (11, 10, 9): d1 is 10-11 mod12 = 11, d2 is 9-10 mod12=11. No. So none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the same note is repeated? For example, input is C C C. But according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. But the code would check permutations. For each permutation, d1 is (C - C) mod12 = 0. So no. So output 'strange'. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. But perhaps the input will not have such cases. However, the code handles it.\n\nNow, the code is ready. Let's write it properly.\n\nBut note that the code uses permutations from itertools. So, need to import permutations.\n\nAlso, the code should read from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, in the code, the permutations are generated for the three indices. For example, if the three notes are the same, then all permutations are same. But the code will check all permutations, but since d1 and d2 will be 0, nothing is found.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input: 'C E G' → output 'major'.\n\nSample Input: 'C# B F' → output 'minor'.\n\nSample Input: 'A B H' → output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G' → the code finds in one of the permutations (C, E, G) → d1 is 4, d2 is 3 → found_major is True. So output 'major'.\n\nAnother case: 'C# B F' → the permutation (B, C#, F) → which is (10, 1, 5). d1 is (1 -10) mod12 = ( -9 ) mod12 = 3. d2 is (5-1) mod12=4. So found_minor is True.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nNow, what about a minor triad that is not in the order of the notes? For example, the input is 'B C# F' → same as the sample. The code would generate permutations and check all possibilities.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the specific semitone distance criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to an index based on its position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three given notes. For each permutation, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the semitone distances between consecutive notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` dictionary maps each note to its corresponding index in the musical scale. This allows us to convert note names into numerical values for easier distance calculations.\n2. **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three input notes. This is necessary because the problem requires checking all possible orderings to determine if any of them form a valid triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, we calculate the semitone distances between the first and second note, and between the second and third note. These distances are calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Check Conditions**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major triad (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones), we mark it as found. Similarly, if any permutation meets the criteria for a minor triad (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones), we mark that as found. Based on these checks, the result is printed accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to determine the correct classification of the triad.",
