For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine whether a given set of three notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or is strange. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the definitions properly. Let me re-read the problem statement to make sure I get the details right.\n\nA major triad is when, after ordering the notes X, Y, Z, the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. The total from X to Z would be 7 semitones. For a minor triad, the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively. \n\nBut since the triad is unordered, I need to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any of them satisfy either the major or minor condition.\n\nSo, the steps I need to perform:\n\n1. Read the three notes from input.\n2. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes (since order matters for checking the distances).\n3. For each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor criteria.\n4. If any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, how do I calculate the distance between two notes? The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list of notes is given as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it cycles back. So each note has an index, and the distance between two notes is calculated as (index of higher note - index of lower note) mod 12? Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. For example, between C and E is 4 semitones. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the order: C is index 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# 3, E is 4. So from C to E is 4 semitones (since each step is one semitone). So the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) if Y is higher than X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (12 - (X's index - Y's index))? Or wait, no. Because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because if you go from E up to C, you have to wrap around. Let's think: the distance between E (index 4) and C (index 0) is (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones? Because the distance is measured as moving upwards. So the formula for the distance between two notes X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). Wait, but how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, since the notes are arranged in a cycle, the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12, but since the distance is measured as the number of semitones moving upwards. Wait, no. Because if X is before Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is after Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). For example, between E (index 4) and C (index 0), the distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones. So the general formula is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, else (Y_index + 12 - X_index). Alternatively, (Y_index - X_index + 12) % 12? Wait, no. Because if Y is higher than X, then (Y - X) is positive. If Y is lower, then (Y - X) is negative. Adding 12 and mod 12 would give the correct distance. Wait, for example, if Y is C (0) and X is E (4), then (0 -4 + 12) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct. So the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? Wait, but in the example given in the problem, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. So if X is C (0), Y is E (4), then (4-0) =4. Which is correct. So yes, the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is higher than X, otherwise (Y_index + 12 - X_index). Which can be calculated as (Y_index - X_index) % 12. Wait, no. Because if Y is lower than X, then (Y_index - X_index) is negative. For example, if X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (0-4) = -4. Mod 12 would be 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Which is exactly what this calculation gives. So the formula is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to the upper. So when you have two notes, you need to find the distance in the upward direction. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. Because for example, (Y - X) mod 12 would be (0-4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured as the distance from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is exactly (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the first thing I need to do is create a mapping from note names to their indexes. Let's create a list of the notes in order. The order given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again. So the indexes are:\n\nC: 0\n\nC#: 1\n\nD: 2\n\nD#:3\n\nE:4\n\nF:5\n\nF#:6\n\nG:7\n\nG#:8\n\nA:9\n\nB:10\n\nH:11\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the example says that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Which is correct because E is index 4, C is 0. 4-0=4. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the first step is to create a dictionary that maps note names to their indexes. Let's create that.\n\nOnce I have that, for any two notes, I can calculate the distance between them as (Y_index - X_index) % 12. Wait, but in the problem description, the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to upper. So, for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, that formula works.\n\nNow, for the triad. The problem says that the triad is an unordered set. So for the three notes, we need to check all possible orderings (permutations) of the three notes, and see if any of them satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nFor example, for a major triad, there must exist an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. Similarly for minor, the distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4.\n\nBut how to check this for all permutations?\n\nLet me think. For the three notes, there are 6 possible permutations. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check if the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. If any permutation satisfies this, then it's a major triad.\n\nSimilarly, check for minor triad: if any permutation has distance between X and Y as 3, and between Y and Z as 4.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the three given notes, generate all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check if it meets the major or minor condition.\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then output 'major'. If any meets the minor condition, output 'minor'. Else, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Well, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, permutations(notes, 3) will generate all possible orderings of the three notes.\n\nBut since the input is three distinct notes? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so perhaps there are no duplicates. However, the problem says that the input is three space-separated notes, but I think they can be the same? Well, according to the problem statement, the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But for this problem, the input is three notes. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So perhaps the input is three distinct notes. But regardless, the code should handle any three notes.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the code can process all possible permutations, even if some notes are same. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So for example, if all three notes are same, then the distances would be zero. Which would not meet any condition. So output strange.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nRead three notes as a list.\n\nGenerate all permutations of these three notes. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\nCheck if (distance between X and Y is 4) and (distance between Y and Z is 3). If yes, then it's a major triad.\n\nElse, check if (distance between X and Y is 3) and (distance between Y and Z is 4). If yes, then it's a minor triad.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, return 'major'. Similarly for minor. Else, return 'strange'.\n\nSo, the code needs to check all permutations and see if any of them meets the major or minor condition.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, create the note index mapping. Let's create a list of the notes in order, then use a dictionary to map note names to their index.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So that's correct.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the note after A is B, then H. So in the list, the indexes are:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code can have a list like that. Then, for a note name, say 'C', its index is 0, etc.\n\nSo, the code can create a dictionary:\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nWait, but how about the note names? For example, in the input, the notes are given in the format like 'C', 'C#', 'D', etc. So the code needs to read the input notes as strings, and look up their indexes.\n\nOnce that's done, for each permutation of the three notes, we can compute the distances between X and Y, and between Y and Z.\n\nSo, for example, for a permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\ndistance_xy = (Y_index - X_index) % 12\n\ndistance_yz = (Z_index - Y_index) % 12\n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But according to the problem's definition, the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So, for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So yes, the code can compute the distance between X and Y as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that for the major triad, the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones. So for the major case, the distance between X and Y must be exactly 4. Similarly for the other distances.\n\nBut wait, for example, if X is C (index 0), Y is E (index 4), then the distance is 4. Which is correct. If X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0), then the distance between X and Y is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Which is not 4. So, the code needs to check that the distance between X and Y is exactly 4 semitones. So for the major condition, the first distance must be 4, and the second must be 3.\n\nBut in the permutation (X, Y, Z), the order is such that X is the first note, Y is the second, Z is the third. So, the distance between X and Y is computed as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But for the major condition, the distance between X and Y must be 4. So that's the first check. Then the distance between Y and Z must be 3. So for the permutation to be a major triad, those two distances must be exactly 4 and 3, respectively.\n\nSimilarly for the minor: the first distance must be 3, the second must be 4.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check if the first distance is 4 and second is 3. If yes, then it's a major. Otherwise, check if the first is 3 and second is 4. If yes, then minor.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead the three notes into a list. Then generate all permutations of this list. For each permutation, check for major and minor.\n\nOnce any permutation satisfies major, return 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, create the note_to_index dictionary.\n\nThen, read the input. The input is a single line with three notes, separated by spaces. For example, in the sample input, the first case is 'C E G'.\n\nSo, the code can read the input line, split into a list of three elements.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation in permutations(notes, 3):\n\n   x, y, z = permutation\n\n   compute distance between x and y: (y_index - x_index) % 12\n\n   compute distance between y and z: (z_index - y_index) % 12\n\n   if distance_xy == 4 and distance_yz == 3:\n\n       return 'major'\n\n   elif distance_xy == 3 and distance_yz == 4:\n\n       return 'minor'\n\nIf after checking all permutations, none of them meet the major or minor conditions, then return 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So there's no case where a chord is both major and minor. So once any permutation meets major, we can return 'major' immediately, and similarly for minor.\n\nSo the code can loop through all permutations, and check for major first. If any permutation meets the major condition, then output 'major'. Else, check for minor. If any permutation meets the minor condition, output 'minor'. Else, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, for each permutation, check if it's a major. If any of them is, then return 'major'. Else, check for minor.\n\nSo the code can do:\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\n   check major condition. If yes, return 'major'\n\nif no major found:\n\n   for perm in permutations(notes):\n\n      check minor condition. If yes, return 'minor'\n\nelse return 'strange'\n\nBut that would require checking all permutations twice. Alternatively, during the first pass, check for both conditions. But perhaps it's more efficient to check for major first, and if none, check for minor.\n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps it's easier to check all permutations once, and track whether any of them meets major or minor.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nfound_major = False\n\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations:\n\n   check for major. If yes, set found_major = True\n\n   check for minor. If yes, set found_minor = True\n\nBut wait, no. Because for a given permutation, it can be both major and minor? Well, according to the problem statement, there are no such cases. So the code can check for major first. Once any permutation is found to be major, then return 'major'. Else, check for minor.\n\nBut perhaps the code can check for all permutations, and collect if any of them is major or minor.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n        exit()\n\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but this would check all permutations, and for each, check if it's major or minor. However, the code would exit as soon as a major or minor is found. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So for example, if a permutation is major and another is minor, but according to the problem statement, this cannot happen. So the code can check for major first. Once any permutation is found to be major, output 'major'. Else, check for minor. But in the code above, for each permutation, it checks for major first, and if not, checks for minor. But if a permutation meets minor, then the code would output 'minor' and exit. But perhaps there's a permutation that is major, but the code checks a permutation that is minor first. However, since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there can't be both a major and minor permutation. So the code can check for major and minor in any order. However, in the code above, for each permutation, the code checks for major first. If none is found, then check for minor. But perhaps, in some cases, a permutation could be minor, but another permutation is major. But according to the problem statement, that can't happen. So the code would return the first occurrence of either major or minor. But since the answer is unique, it's okay.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So for example, if the chord is major, then there exists at least one permutation that meets the major condition, and no permutation meets the minor condition. So the code would find the major condition first, and output 'major'.\n\nBut what if a permutation is minor and another permutation is major? According to the problem statement, this can't happen. So the code can safely check for major and minor in any order.\n\nBut in the code above, for each permutation, the code checks for major first. If any permutation meets major, the code outputs 'major'. Otherwise, after checking all permutations, it checks for minor. But in the code as written, the code checks for major and minor in each permutation. So, for example, if a permutation meets minor, then the code would output 'minor' and exit. But if there is a permutation that is major, but the code first checks a permutation that is minor, then it would output 'minor' which is wrong. But according to the problem statement, this situation cannot happen. Therefore, the code is safe.\n\nWait, no. Because the code checks for major and minor in each permutation. Suppose that the chord is major. Then there is at least one permutation that is major. However, there may be other permutations that are minor. But according to the problem statement, this is impossible. So the code can safely check for major and minor in any order. However, the code as written would check for major first, and if any permutation meets major, it returns 'major'. Otherwise, it checks for minor. But if the code checks for minor in the same permutation, but the code is not checking for that. Wait, in the code above, for each permutation, it checks for major first. If not, then check for minor. But suppose that the code checks a permutation that is minor, and returns 'minor' even though there is another permutation that is major. But according to the problem statement, this cannot happen. So the code is safe.\n\nBut how? Let's think of an example. Suppose that the chord is major, but there exists a permutation that is minor. How is that possible? According to the problem statement, it's not possible. So the code can proceed.\n\nSo the code as written would work.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample output: ['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nLet's take the first case: C E G.\n\nThe permutations would include (C, E, G). Let's compute the distances:\n\ndistance between C (0) and E (4) is 4. Then between E (4) and G (7): 7-4=3. So d1 is 4, d2 is 3. So this permutation meets the major condition. So the code returns 'major'.\n\nSecond case: C# B F.\n\nThe code would generate permutations. Let's see one of them: B, C#, F. Let's check:\n\nB is note index 10. C# is 1. F is 5.\n\ndistance between B and C# is (1 - 10) mod 12 = (1 -10) = -9 mod 12 = 3. Because 1 -10 is -9, adding 12 gives 3. So d1 is 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5-1=4. So d2 is 4. So this permutation meets the minor condition. So the code returns 'minor'.\n\nThird case: A B H.\n\nNotes are A (9), B (10), H (11).\n\nLet's check all permutations.\n\nTake permutation A, B, H:\n\ndistance between A (9) and B (10) is 1. Between B and H is 11 -10 =1. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B.\n\ndistance between A (9) and H (11) is 2. Between H and B (10): (10 - 11) mod 12 = ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H.\n\ndistance between B (10) and A (9) is (9 -10) mod 12 = 11. Which is not 3 or 4. \n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A. \n\ndistance between B (10) and H (11) is 1. Between H (11) and A (9): (9 -11) mod 12 = (-2) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B. \n\ndistance between H (11) and A (9): (9 -11) mod 12 is 10. No.\n\nH, B, A: distance between H (11) and B (10): (10 -11) mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what if the input is C# B F? Let's see.\n\nNotes are C#, B, F. Let's check permutations.\n\nOne permutation is B, C#, F. As discussed earlier, that gives 3 and 4. So minor.\n\nAnother permutation is C#, B, F. Let's compute:\n\ndistance between C# (1) and B (10): (10 -1) mod 12 is 9. Not 3 or 4. Then between B and F: 5 -10 mod 12 is (5 -10) = -5 mod 12 is 7. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, F, C#. Distance between B (10) and F (5) is (5-10) mod 12 = 7. Then between F (5) and C# (1) is (1 -5) mod 12 = 8. No.\n\nAnother permutation: F, B, C#. Distance between F (5) and B (10) is 5. Then between B (10) and C# (1) is (1-10) mod 12 = 3. So d1 is 5, d2 is 3. Not matching. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: F, C#, B. Distance between F (5) and C# (1) is (1 -5) mod 12 = 8. Then between C# (1) and B (10) is 9. No.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, F, B. Distance between C# (1) and F (5) is 4. Then between F (5) and B (10) is 5. So 4 and 5. Not matching. So no. So only the permutation B, C#, F meets the minor condition.\n\nSo the code would find that and output 'minor'.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code uses permutations. But in Python, the permutations function returns tuples of the elements. So, for example, permutations(['C', 'E', 'G']) would generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut what about the note names? For example, the input may have 'B' and 'H' as in the third sample. So the code's note_to_index dictionary must have 'B' and 'H' correctly mapped.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. For example, the input is a line with three notes. So in Python, the code would read the input line, split into parts.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the input is a single line with three notes separated by spaces. For example, the first sample input is 'C E G' as a single line.\n\nSo the code would read input().split() to get the three notes.\n\nNow, the code must handle the note names correctly, including 'C#' and 'D#', etc. So the note_to_index dictionary must have the correct keys. For example, 'C#' is a key, and so on.\n\nNow, the code for the note_to_index is correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nCase where the three notes are the same. For example, 'C C C'. Then all distances are zero. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother case: a major triad that is not in the first permutation. For example, the code checks all permutations, so it will find it.\n\nAnother edge case: the triad is minor, but in a different permutation. For example, the code checks all permutations and finds the minor.\n\nAnother case: a chord that is major in one permutation and minor in another. According to the problem statement, this is impossible, but the code would check for major first and return 'major' if found.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nNeed to import permutations from itertools.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n\n    notes = input().split()\n\n    note_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n\n        x, y, z = perm\n\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n\n            print(\"major\")\n\n            return\n\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n\n            print(\"minor\")\n\n            return\n\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nWait, but the code uses permutations, which returns all possible orderings. So, for example, for three elements, there are 6 permutations. For each, check the conditions.\n\nBut what if the same note appears multiple times? For example, input is 'C C C'? Then, all permutations are same. The code will check for d1 and d2. For example, x, y, z are all C. So d1 is (0 -0) mod 12 = 0. So no match. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother example: 'C E G' as in the sample. The code will find the first permutation that meets the major condition and return.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input. Let's take the first input as 'C E G' and see.\n\nIn the code, the first permutation is ('C', 'E', 'G').\n\nx_idx is 0, y is 4, z is 7.\n\nd1 = 4-0 =4 mod 12 is 4. d2 is 7-4=3 mod 12 is 3. So condition met. So code returns 'major'.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 'C# B F'.\n\nIn permutations, one of them is ('B', 'C#', 'F').\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\nd1 is (1 -10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is (5 -1) mod 12 = 4. So condition for minor is met. So code returns 'minor'.\n\nThird example: 'A B H'.\n\nAll permutations checked, and none meet the conditions. So code returns 'strange'.\n\nThus, the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, what about the note 'H'? For example, the note H is index 11. So, for example, if the input is 'H C E', then the code would check permutations.\n\nLet's see: permutation (H, C, E). H is index 11, C is 0, E is 4.\n\nd1 = (0 - 11) mod 12 = ( -11 ) mod 12 = 1. So no. Another permutation: C, E, H. d1 is 4, d2 is (11 -4) = 7 mod 12 =7. Not 3. So no. Another permutation: C, H, E. d1 between C and H is (11 -0) mod 12 = 11. No. So no. So the code would return strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# D# F' ?\n\nLet me see. Let's check if this is a minor triad.\n\nPossible permutation: D#, C#, F. Let's see.\n\nD# is index 3. C# is 1. F is 5.\n\ndistance between D# (3) and C# (1): (1 -3) mod 12 = -2 mod 12 = 10. No. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, D#, F. d1 is 3 -1 = 2. No. \n\nAnother permutation: C#, F, D#. d1 between C# (1) and F (5) is 4. Then between F (5) and D# (3) is (3 -5) mod 12 = -2 mod 12 = 10. No. \n\nAnother permutation: F, C#, D#. d1 between F (5) and C# (1) is (1 -5) mod 12 = 8. No. \n\nAnother permutation: F, D#, C#. d1 between F (5) and D# (3): (3-5) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: D#, F, C#. d1 between D# (3) and F (5) is 2. No. \n\nSo no. So output is strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G#'.\n\nCheck for major. Let's see. C (0), E (4), G# (8). Distance between C and E is 4, between E and G# is 8-4=4. So d1 is 4, d2 is 4. Not 3. So no. What about permutation C, G#, E? d1 between C and G# is 8-0 =8. No. \n\nAnother permutation: E, C, G#. d1 between E and C is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. No. \n\nAnother permutation: E, G#, C. d1 between E (4) and G# (8) is 4. d2 between G# (8) and C (0) is (0 -8) mod 12 =4. So d1 is 4, d2 is 4. No. \n\nSo this is not a major or minor. Output strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# D F' ?\n\nLet's see. Possible permutations. For example, C#, D, F. d1 between C# (1) and D (2) is 1. d2 between D (2) and F (5) is 3. So d1 is 1, d2 3. No. \n\nAnother permutation: D, C#, F. d1 between D (2) and C# (1) is (1-2) mod 12 = 11. No. \n\nAnother permutation: C#, F, D. d1 between C# (1) and F (5) is 4. d2 between F (5) and D (2) is (2-5) mod 12 = 9. No. \n\nAnother permutation: F, C#, D. d1 between F (5) and C# (1) is (1-5) mod 12 = 8. No. \n\nAnother permutation: F, D, C#. d1 between F (5) and D (2) is (2-5) mod 12 = 9. No. \n\nAnother permutation: D, F, C#. d1 between D (2) and F (5) is 3. d2 between F (5) and C# (1) is (1 -5) mod 12 = 8. So 3 and 8. Not matching. So no. \n\nSo output is strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G' is major. So code returns 'major'.\n\nAnother case: 'C E G#'? Let's check if any permutation meets the conditions.\n\nFor example, permutation C, E, G#: d1 is 4, d2 is 8-4=4. Not 3. No. \n\nPermutation C, G#, E: d1 between C and G# is 8. No. \n\nPermutation E, C, G#: d1 between E and C is 8. No. \n\nPermutation E, G#, C: d1 between E and G# is 4, d2 between G# and C is 4. No. \n\nPermutation G#, C, E: d1 between G# (8) and C (0) is (0-8) mod 12 = 4. So d1 is 4. Then between C",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on the distances between the notes in semitones.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Index Mapping**: Create a mapping from each note to its corresponding index in the musical scale. This helps in quickly calculating the distance between any two notes.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if it meets the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Triad Classification**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major triad, print \"major\". If any permutation meets the criteria for a minor triad, print \"minor\". If none meet the criteria, print \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    notes = input().split()\n    note_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(note_order)}\n    \n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        \n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    \n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Index Mapping**: The `note_order` list defines the sequence of notes in the musical scale, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its position in this list.\n- **Permutations Check**: Using `permutations` from the `itertools` module, we generate all possible orderings of the three input notes. This ensures that we check every possible way to order the notes for the triad conditions.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. This ensures that distances wrap around correctly from the end of the scale back to the beginning.\n- **Triad Classification**: By checking each permutation, we determine if the distances between the first and second note and between the second and third note match the criteria for a major or minor triad. If found, the corresponding result is printed immediately. If no valid triad is found after checking all permutations, \"strange\" is printed.",
