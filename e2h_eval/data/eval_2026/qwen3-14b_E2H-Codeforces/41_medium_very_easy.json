There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit.

The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$.

The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about building houses on a street with n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that the tallest house in a certain interval [l_i, r_i] must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all these restrictions.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is to assign heights to each spot such that all restrictions are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nConstraints are small: n, h, m up to 50. So maybe a brute-force approach is possible? But even with n=50, trying all possibilities would be impossible because each house has h+1 options, which is 50^50 possibilities. That's way too big.\n\nSo brute force isn't feasible. Need another approach.\n\nLet me think about the restrictions. Each restriction imposes that the maximum in some interval is <= x_i. How can I model this?\n\nAn alternative idea: For each position, determine the maximum allowed height based on the restrictions. But how?\n\nWait, the restrictions could overlap. For example, a particular house might be part of multiple intervals. The maximum allowed height for that house would be the minimum of all the restrictions that apply to it. But that's not exactly correct. Because a restriction applies to the maximum in an interval. So, for example, if a restriction says that in [1,3], the max is at most 2, then each house in that interval can be up to 2, but maybe even lower if other restrictions apply.\n\nWait, no. Suppose that in the interval [1,3], the maximum is at most 2. Then, each individual house in that interval can be at most 2. Because if any of them was higher than 2, then the maximum would be higher than 2, violating the restriction. Therefore, for each house, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between h and all the restrictions that include that house in their interval. Wait, no. Because a restriction on an interval [l_i, r_i] requires that the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. That implies that each house in that interval can be at most x_i. Because if any house in the interval is higher than x_i, then the max would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction. Therefore, for each house, the maximum possible height it can have is the minimum of h and all x_i's from restrictions where the house is in [l_i, r_i]. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose there's a restriction that says the maximum in [1,3] is <= 2. Then, each house in that interval can be at most 2. However, if there is another restriction that says the maximum in [1,2] is <= 3. Then, the first restriction is more restrictive. So for house 1, the maximum allowed is 2. But for house 3, the first restriction says it can be at most 2, but there's no other restriction on it. So the maximum for house 3 is 2.\n\nSo if we can find for each house the minimal x_i among all restrictions that cover that house. Because that would be the maximum height that house can have. Because if there's a restriction that covers that house, then the maximum for that house can't exceed x_i. So the minimal x_i across all restrictions that include that house would be the upper bound for that house's height.\n\nWait, but what if there are overlapping restrictions? For example, suppose a house is in two intervals. One restriction says that in [1,2], max is 3, and another says [2,3], max is 4. Then, for house 2, the maximum allowed is min(3,4) = 3. Because the first restriction applies to house 2. So the maximum height for house 2 can't exceed 3, since if it was 4, then the first interval [1,2] would have a maximum of 4, which violates the first restriction.\n\nSo yes, for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include that house in their interval. Because if any restriction includes that house, then the maximum height of that house can't exceed x_i of that restriction. So taking the minimum of all such x_i's gives the maximum possible height for that house.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a restriction that applies to a larger interval? For example, suppose there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, and another on [1,1] with x=3. Then for house 1, the maximum allowed is 2 (since the first restriction applies to it). But the second restriction allows up to 3. But since the first restriction requires that the max in [1,3] is <= 2, then house 1 can't be higher than 2. So the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include the house is the correct upper bound.\n\nTherefore, for each house i, compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include i in their [l_i, r_i] interval. Then, the maximum height for that house is min(h, that minimal x_i). Then, the optimal solution is to set each house to that maximum possible height. Because that would maximize each individual square, since square is increasing with height.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think. Suppose there are two restrictions. For example, suppose there's a restriction on [1,2] with x=3, and another on [2,3] with x=3. Then, for house 2, the maximum allowed is 3. For house 1, it's 3 (from the first restriction), and for house 3, it's 3 (from the second restriction). So setting all three to 3 would be allowed. But what if there's a restriction that says that the max in [1,3] must be at most 2. Then, each house can be at most 2. So the minimal x_i for each house is 2.\n\nBut if there are multiple restrictions, but none that directly cover a particular house, then the maximum height for that house is h.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- For each house i (from 1 to n), find the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include i in their interval. Let's call this value max_height[i].\n\n- Then, the maximum possible profit is the sum of (max_height[i]^2) for each i.\n\nBut wait, is that sufficient? Let me check the first example.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1-1: x=1\n\n2-2: x=3\n\n3-3: x=2.\n\nSo for each house:\n\nHouse 1 is covered by restriction 1, so max_height[1] = 1.\n\nHouse 2 is covered by restriction 2, so max_height[2] = 3.\n\nHouse 3 is covered by restriction 3, so max_height[3] = 2.\n\nSum is 1 + 9 +4 =14. Which matches the example. So that works.\n\nAnother example: the second input.\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2-3: x=8.\n\n3-4: x=7.\n\nSo for each house:\n\nHouse 1: no restrictions. So max_height is 10.\n\nHouse 2: covered by restriction 1. So x=8. So max is 8.\n\nHouse 3: covered by both restrictions. min(8,7) is 7.\n\nHouse 4: covered by restriction 2. x=7. So max is 7.\n\nSo sum is 10^2 + 8^2 +7^2 +7^2 = 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping restrictions that may not directly apply to a house but affect the maximum?\n\nWait, suppose there's a restriction that says that in [1,3], the max is 2. Then, each house in 1,2,3 can be at most 2. But suppose there's another restriction that says [1,2] must have max 3. Then, for house 1 and 2, the minimum x_i is 2 (from the first restriction), and for house 3, it's 2 (from first restriction). So the maximum for each house is 2. So the approach would set each to 2, which is correct.\n\nBut what if there is a restriction that says that the max in [1,3] is 3, and another that says the max in [1,1] is 2. Then, for house 1, the min x is 2. For house 2 and 3, the min x is 3. So setting house 1 to 2, others to 3. Then, the max in [1,3] is 3, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nSo this approach seems to work. Because for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all the x_i's that apply to it. Because any restriction that includes that house in its interval would require that the house's height is <= x_i. So the minimum of those x_i's is the maximum possible height for that house.\n\nBut how do I compute that?\n\nSo for each house i, check all m restrictions. For each restriction, check if l_i <= i <= r_i. If yes, then take x_i into account. Then, the maximum height for i is min(h, the minimum of all such x_i's).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Initialize for each house, the maximum allowed height as h.\n\n2. For each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   For each house i in l to r:\n\n      if current max allowed for i is higher than x, set it to x.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because for each restriction, the maximum in the interval [l, r] must be <= x. So, for each house in [l, r], their maximum allowed height can't be higher than x. Because if any of them is higher than x, then the maximum would be higher than x. Therefore, for each house in [l, r], their maximum allowed height is the minimum between their current value and x.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nInitialize max_height array as h for all positions.\n\nFor each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   for i in l to r:\n\n      if max_height[i] > x:\n\n          set max_height[i] = x\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, the max_height array holds the maximum possible height for each house. Then the answer is sum of squares.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nSo this approach would handle all the restrictions correctly.\n\nLet me test this approach with some examples.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=2, h=5, m=1. Restriction is [1,2] with x=3. Then, max_height for both houses is 3. Sum is 3^2 +3^2= 18.\n\nAnother case: n=2, h=5, m=2. Restriction 1: [1,1] x=4. Restriction 2: [2,2] x=3. Then max_height for house 1 is 4, house 2 is 3. Sum is 16+9=25.\n\nAnother case: n=2, h=5, m=2. Restriction 1: [1,2] x=4. Restriction 2: [1,1] x=3. Then, for house 1, the max is min(4,3)=3. House 2 is 4. Sum is 9 + 16=25.\n\nBut what if the restrictions are overlapping in a way that requires a lower value?\n\nYes, this approach handles that.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize max_height array as h for all positions.\n\nThen, for each restriction, iterate through all positions in [l_i, r_i], and set their max_height to min(current value, x_i).\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, sum the squares of the max_height array.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nFirst line: n, h, m.\n\nThen m lines, each with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nrestrictions:\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2.\n\nProcessing each restriction:\n\nFor first restriction, l=1, r=1, x=1. So for i=1, set max_height[1] = min(3, 1) =1.\n\nSecond restriction: l=2, r=2, x=3. So for i=2, set to min(3,3) =3.\n\nThird restriction: l=3, r=3, x=2. So for i=3, set to min(3,2)=2.\n\nSo sum 1^2 +3^2 +2^2=14.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input.\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nrestrictions:\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7.\n\nInitially, max_height is [10,10,10,10]\n\nProcess first restriction (2-3, 8):\n\nfor i=2 and 3:\n\nset to min(10, 8) => 8. So now array is [10,8,8,10]\n\nProcess second restriction (3-4, 7):\n\nfor i=3 and 4:\n\ni=3: current is 8, min(8,7) is 7.\n\ni=4: current is 10, min(10,7) is 7.\n\nso array becomes [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 + 64 +49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize max_height as [h] * n. But note that the spots are 1-based? Or 0-based? Well, in the code, since the input uses 1-based indices for the spots.\n\nSo in Python, perhaps we can make a list of size n, indexes 0 to n-1, representing spots 1 to n. Or maybe indexes 1 to n. Let's see.\n\nFor example, for n=3, the spots are 1,2,3. So perhaps create a list of size n+1, indexes 0 to n, and ignore index 0. So for i from 1 to n.\n\nSo code:\n\nmax_height = [h] * (n+1)  # indexes 0..n, but 0 unused.\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions:\n\nread l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nfor i in range(l_i, r_i +1):\n\n   if max_height[i] > x_i:\n\n       max_height[i] = x_i\n\nOnce done, sum the squares of max_height[1..n].\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the initial max_height, it's h for each spot. Then, for each restriction, for each position in l_i to r_i, we set their max_height to min(current, x_i). So that's correct.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmax_height = [h]*(n+1)\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r+1):\n\n        if max_height[i] > x:\n\n            max_height[i] = x\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    sum += max_height[i] **2\n\nprint(sum)\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple restrictions that apply to the same interval? For example, two restrictions on the same interval with different x's. The code will process them all, and the max_height will be the minimum of all x's.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test for the case where a restriction is redundant. For example, if there's a restriction [1,2] with x=5, and another [1,2] with x=3. Then, after processing both, the max_height for 1 and 2 will be 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nAfter processing:\n\nmax_height[1] = 1, [2] =3, [3]=2. Sum is 1+9+4=14.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nmax_height starts as [10,10,10,10,10] (indexes 0-4). Then first restriction is l=2, r=3, x=8. So for i=2 and 3, set to 8. Then the second restriction is l=3, r=4, x=7. For i=3: 8>7, so set to 7. i=4: 10>7, set to 7. So the array is [10, 10, 8,7,7]. Sum is 10^2 + 10^2? No, wait, the first element is index 1, which is 10, index 2 is 8, index 3 is 7, index 4 is 7. So sum is 10^2 +8^2 +7^2 +7^2 = 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when there are overlapping restrictions. Let's say n=2, h=5, m=2. Restrictions are [1,2] x=3, and [1,1] x=4. Then, for the first restriction, the code sets positions 1 and 2 to 3. Then, the second restriction is [1,1] x=4. So for position 1, current is 3, which is less than 4. So no change. So the max_height is [3,3]. Sum is 18. Which is correct, because the first restriction requires that the max in [1,2] is 3. So even though the second restriction allows position 1 to be up to 4, the first restriction requires it to be 3. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, h=5, m=2. Restrictions [1,2] x=4, and [1,1] x=3. Then, first restriction sets both to 4. Then the second restriction sets position 1 to 3. So the max_height is [3,4]. Sum is 9 +16=25. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the example input shows two test cases. But looking at the input description:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the code should process one test case per input.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first input is given as a string:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nBut that's probably a representation of two separate test cases. However, in the problem statement's input format, each test case is given as per the first line. But the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases? Or is it only one?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps that's just for the example, and the actual code should process one test case.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input is given as two separate cases. But the actual code is supposed to process one test case. Because the problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is given as per the first line.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. So the code needs to read from stdin, which for the problem would be one test case.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from stdin and output the correct answer. So the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first line is a list of two elements, which are the two test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement's formatting. For example, perhaps the actual input is one test case. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nand the output is 14.\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\noutput 262.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the input is given as two separate test cases. However, the code should process one test case. So perhaps the code should read from standard input, which for the actual problem is one test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read the first line as n, h, m, then read m lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is presented as two separate test cases, but perhaps that's for the purpose of the example. So the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nThus, the Python code would be:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nRead m lines of restrictions.\n\nProcess as discussed.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nRead from stdin. So, in Python:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_height = [h] * (n + 1)  # indexes 0..n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n\n        if max_height[i] > x:\n\n            max_height[i] = x\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n\n    total += max_height[i] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich would be processed correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nBut for the second sample input, the code would read n=4, h=10, m=2, then read two lines:\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7.\n\nWhich is processed as before.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, check edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, h=0, m=0. Then, the max_height is 0. Sum is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: m=0. All houses can be set to h. So sum is n * h^2.\n\nAnother edge case: when a restriction's x_i is larger than h. For example, n=2, h=3, m=1. Restriction [1,2] x=5. Then, the max_height for each is 3. Because the code takes min(h, ...). Wait, no. Because the code initializes max_height as h. Then, for the restriction, x is 5. So for each house in [1,2], the code checks if current max_height[i] (which is 3) is larger than x (5). It is not, so no change. So the max_height remains 3. Which is correct, because the restriction allows the max to be up to 5, but the maximum allowed is h=3. So the code correctly leaves it as 3.\n\nAnother case: a restriction with x_i less than h. So code reduces the max_height.\n\nAnother case: multiple restrictions on the same interval. For example, two restrictions on [1,2], x=2 and x=3. The code would process them both. The first would set the max_height to 2, the second would check if current (2) is larger than 3. No, so no change. So the max_height remains 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height, and each restriction specifies the maximum allowable height for the tallest house in a specific range. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing the maximum allowable height for each house to the given maximum height `h`.\n2. **Apply Restrictions**: For each restriction, adjust the maximum allowable height for each house in the specified range to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowable heights for each house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nmax_height = [h] * (n + 1)  # Using 1-based indexing\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    for i in range(l, r + 1):\n        if max_height[i] > x:\n            max_height[i] = x\n\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    total += max_height[i] ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize an array `max_height` where each element is set to the maximum height `h`. This array is 1-based indexed to simplify the range operations.\n2. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, we iterate over the specified range and update the maximum allowable height for each house in that range to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's height. This ensures that all restrictions are respected.\n3. **Profit Calculation**: After processing all restrictions, we calculate the total profit by summing the squares of the values in the `max_height` array, which gives the maximum possible profit under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that we maximize the profit while adhering to all zoning restrictions. The complexity is manageable given the small constraints (up to 50 houses and restrictions), making this brute-force approach feasible.",
