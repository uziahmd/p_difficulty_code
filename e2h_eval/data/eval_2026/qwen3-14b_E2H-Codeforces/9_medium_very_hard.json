Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting souvenirs with maximum total cost without exceeding a weight limit. The constraints are that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Each souvenir has a weight of 1, 2, or 3. Oh right, because the input says wi is between 1 and 3. So that's a key point here. \n\nThe classic knapsack problem, but with the twist that the weights are limited to 1, 2, 3. Since n is large (up to 1e5), a standard dynamic programming approach with O(nm) time complexity would be too slow. For example, if m is 3e5, then O(nm) would be 3e10 operations, which is way beyond feasible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to handle this. Since the weights are small (only 1, 2, 3), maybe we can group items by their weight and then find an optimal way to select them.\n\nLet me consider each weight category separately. For example, for all items of weight 1, we can take as many as possible, but maybe there's a case where taking some higher value items of weight 2 or 3 could be better. But since the weights are small, perhaps we can process each weight group in a way that allows us to compute the optimal selection.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's separate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n\nFor each group, we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, we can precompute the prefix sums. For example, for weight 1 items, sorted in descending order, the prefix sum array would give the maximum cost for taking k items of weight 1. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem becomes choosing how many items to take from each group such that the total weight is <= m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nBut how do we combine these choices?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have:\n\n- a items of weight 1, sorted in descending order of cost. Their prefix sum is s1[k] = sum of first k items.\n- b items of weight 2, sorted similarly. Their prefix sum is s2[k] = sum of first k items.\n- c items of weight 3, sorted similarly. Their prefix sum is s3[k] = sum of first k items.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose x, y, z such that x*1 + y*2 + z*3 <= m, and maximize s1[x] + s2[y] + s3[z].\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to iterate over all possible combinations of x, y, z, but that's not feasible given the possible ranges.\n\nAlternative idea: since the weights are small, perhaps for each possible number of weight 3 items, and for each possible number of weight 2 items, compute the maximum possible for the remaining weight with weight 1 items. However, even this might be computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can iterate over the possible number of weight 3 items, and for each possible number of weight 3 items, compute how many weight 2 and 1 items can be taken. But again, how?\n\nAnother approach is to note that for each possible number of weight 3 items (let's say z), and for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), the total weight used is 3*z + 2*y. The remaining weight is m - (3*z + 2*y), which can be filled with weight 1 items. So for each possible z and y, we can calculate the maximum x such that x <= (remaining weight), and take the maximum s1[x]. But even with this, the time complexity could be O(k * l), where k is the number of possible z and l is the number of possible y.\n\nBut considering that the maximum number of weight 3 items is min(c, m//3). Let's say m is 3e5, then for z, it can be up to 1e5 (if all items are weight 3). Similarly for y.\n\nBut if n is 1e5, then for each group, the number of items is up to 1e5. However, when we sort them, and take their prefix sums, we can have up to 1e5 entries for each group. But for the approach where we iterate over z and y, that would be O( (m/3) * (m/2) ) which is O(m²) which is 9e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible. Need a better idea.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible number of weight 3 items, we can compute the best combination of weight 2 and 1 items. How?\n\nLet me think: Suppose we fix z (number of weight 3 items). Then, the remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*z. Now, the problem reduces to selecting items of weight 1 and 2 such that their total weight is <= rem, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly for each rem?\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, but that would be O(m) per group. Wait, but that's the same as the original knapsack problem, but with only two types of items (weight 1 and 2). However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find an efficient way to compute the maximum for any given capacity.\n\nLet me think: For the weight 1 and 2 items, after sorting them in descending order of cost, we can compute prefix sums for each group. Let's say we have for weight 1: a list of sorted items with prefix sum s1, and for weight 2: sorted items with prefix sum s2.\n\nThen, for a given capacity rem, how do we select x items of weight 1 and y items of weight 2 such that x + 2y <= rem, and maximize s1[x] + s2[y].\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with two pointers or binary search.\n\nLet me think about this. For a given rem, the maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is up to min(len(s2), rem//2). For each possible y (number of weight 2 items), the maximum x is rem - 2y. Then, the maximum x is min( len(s1), rem - 2y ), and the total cost would be s2[y] + s1[ min( len(s1), rem - 2y ) ].\n\nBut for each y, we can compute this. However, trying all possible y for each z is O(k) per z, which could be expensive. However, if we can find the optimal y quickly.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, and the weight 1 items are also sorted, then for a given rem, the optimal choice is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. However, since the choice between weight 1 and 2 is not straightforward, perhaps we can use the following approach:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, for a given rem, we can iterate over the possible number of weight 2 items (y) from 0 to min( len(s2), rem//2 ), and for each y, take x = min( len(s1), rem - 2*y ), and compute the total cost. But again, this is O(k) for each rem, which may be too slow if done for all possible z.\n\nBut perhaps, given that the maximum possible rem is m (up to 3e5), and for each z, rem is m-3z, and for each such rem, the processing of the weight 1 and 2 items can be done in O(1) time with some pre-processing. How?\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for all possible numbers of weight 2 items (y), the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be added. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given rem, the optimal y is such that 2y is as large as possible, but not exceeding rem. But since the weight 2 items are sorted, taking more of them may not be optimal if their cost is lower than the weight 1 items.\n\nWait, but for each possible y, the maximum x is rem - 2y. So the total cost is s2[y] + s1[ x ] where x is the maximum possible (since s1 is the prefix sum, which is the maximum sum for x items of weight 1).\n\nBut since the s1 and s2 arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order (since the items are sorted in descending order and we take the prefix sum), then for each y, the cost is s2[y] + s1[ min(rem - 2y, len(s1)) ].\n\nBut how can we find the optimal y for each rem?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each possible rem, we can find the best y in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nLet me think: For each possible rem, the maximum possible y is up to floor(rem / 2). So for each possible y in 0 to floor(rem/2), we can compute the corresponding x and sum. But how to find the maximum among all these possibilities?\n\nBut trying all possible y for each rem would be O( (rem/2) ) per rem. Which is again O(m^2) in worst case. Not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute a combined array that for each possible total weight w (up to m), gives the maximum cost. But how?\n\nBut for the weight 1 and 2 items, the problem is similar to the unbounded knapsack, but with items that are sorted and can be taken once each. However, since each item is taken at most once, it's the 0-1 knapsack problem. However, with n up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, the standard DP approach would be O(nm), which is again 3e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nBut wait, the items are grouped by their weight. For weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can find a way to compute the maximum for any capacity efficiently.\n\nLet me think again. For the weight 1 items, since they are sorted in descending order, the best strategy is to take as many as possible of them. Similarly for the weight 2 items. However, combining the two is tricky.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible number of weight 2 items (y), we can compute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be taken, which is (rem - 2y). Then, the total cost is s2[y] + s1[ min( (rem - 2y), len(s1) ) ].\n\nBut to find the maximum over all possible y, perhaps we can find the optimal y by checking for each possible y in a certain range. However, given that the s2 and s1 arrays are sorted, maybe we can find that the optimal y is around (rem - x) / 2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the s2 array is non-decreasing (because adding more items increases the sum), but the term (rem - 2y) decreases as y increases, the total sum could have a single peak. So for a given rem, the optimal y is somewhere between 0 and max_y, and we can perform a binary search to find the maximum.\n\nBut how to confirm that the function is unimodal?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we increase y by 1. The gain in s2 is the next item's cost. The loss is that we have 2 less weight available for the weight 1 items. The loss in s1 is the difference between the previous x (rem - 2*(y-1)) and the new x (rem - 2y). So the net change depends on whether the gain from adding one more weight 2 item is greater than the loss from losing two units of weight for the weight 1 items.\n\nBut since the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, the loss from losing two units of weight is the value of the (x)th item (if x was the previous number of weight 1 items) minus the value of the (x-2)th item. But since the items are sorted, the first x items are the best possible, so taking x-2 items would lose the sum of the x-1 and x-th items.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps for the purpose of optimization, the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min(rem - 2y, len(s1)) ] is unimodal. If that's the case, then ternary search can be applied to find the maximum y.\n\nBut how can we be sure of that? Well, it's possible that the function is not strictly unimodal, but perhaps for practical purposes, it's possible to find the maximum by checking a few candidates.\n\nAlternatively, given that the number of possible y is up to rem//2, which for rem up to 3e5 is up to 1.5e5, but for each z, which can be up to m//3 (say 1e5), the total operations would be 1.5e5 * 1e5 = 1.5e10, which is way too big.\n\nSo that's not feasible. So perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think again. Since the weights are 1, 2, 3, and the items are sorted in each group, maybe we can find for each possible total weight, the optimal selection.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me consider that for the weight 3 items, since they are the heaviest, perhaps we can iterate through all possible numbers of them (z) and for each, compute the optimal selection of weight 1 and 2 items. Then take the maximum over all z.\n\nBut how to compute the optimal selection for weight 1 and 2 items quickly?\n\nLet me think about the weight 1 and 2 items. Suppose we have for weight 1 items a sorted list with prefix sum s1, and for weight 2 items a sorted list with prefix sum s2. For a given capacity rem, what is the best way to select items of weight 1 and 2?\n\nLet me think of this as a two-dimensional problem. For a given rem, we can take any number of weight 2 items (y) such that 2y ≤ rem, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (x = rem - 2y). The total cost is s2[y] + s1[x].\n\nBut since the s2 and s1 arrays are sorted, perhaps the maximum occurs when y is chosen such that the marginal gain of adding a weight 2 item is higher than the loss of not being able to take two weight 1 items.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, the best way to take x items is to take the top x. Similarly for weight 2 items.\n\nBut how can we find the optimal y?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For a given rem, we can try all possible y in the vicinity of (rem * 2) / (2 + 1) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible rem, the optimal y is between max(0, (rem - k)/2) and min( len(s2), rem//2 ), where k is the maximum number of weight 1 items. But again, not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible rem, the optimal number of weight 2 items can be found by considering the following:\n\nWe can take up to y_max = min(len(s2), rem // 2) weight 2 items.\n\nFor each possible y, the x is min( len(s1), rem - 2*y ). The maximum of s2[y] + s1[x].\n\nBut since the s1 and s2 are sorted, perhaps for a given rem, the optimal y is either:\n\n- Take as many weight 2 items as possible (y_max), and then fill with weight 1 items.\n\nOR\n\n- Take as few weight 2 items as possible (y=0), and fill with weight 1 items.\n\nOR\n\n- Some balance between the two.\n\nBut how to find this balance?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible rem, the optimal y is such that the next weight 2 item is more valuable than the two best weight 1 items that would be lost.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. Let's imagine that we have already selected y weight 2 items, and then x = rem - 2y weight 1 items. Suppose we consider adding one more weight 2 item (y+1) and subtracting two weight 1 items (so x' = x - 2). The gain would be s2[y+1] - s2[y] (the cost of the new weight 2 item) minus (s1[x] - s1[x-2]) (the loss of two weight 1 items). If this is positive, then it's better to take the new weight 2 item and reduce the weight 1 items. So the optimal y is when this condition is no longer true.\n\nBut how to find this y?\n\nThis seems like a greedy approach. We can start with y=0 and x=rem, then check whether adding a weight 2 item (if possible) and removing two weight 1 items (if possible) improves the total cost. If yes, do it. Repeat until no more improvement is possible.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nFor example, suppose we have the sorted lists of weight 1 and 2 items, and their prefix sums. For a given rem, we can start with y=0 and x=rem, and then compare the next weight 2 item (cost s2[y+1] - s2[y]) with the sum of the next two weight 1 items (s1[x] - s1[x-2]). If the weight 2 item is better, then we take it and decrease x by 2. Repeat this until we can't take any more weight 2 items or the comparison is negative.\n\nThis seems promising. But how to implement this for each rem?\n\nThe problem is that for each rem, we would have to perform this process, which could take O(k) steps where k is the number of items taken. However, given that the items are sorted, perhaps this process would run quickly in practice.\n\nBut considering that for each z (number of weight 3 items), we have to process this for rem = m - 3*z, and z can be up to m//3, this might be feasible.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess the three groups (w=1, w=2, w=3) by sorting each group in descending order of cost. Then compute their prefix sums.\n\nFor example:\n\ns1 = [0] (for zero items), then s1[1] = cost of first item, s1[2] = s1[1] + cost of second item, etc.\n\nSimilarly for s2 and s3.\n\n2. Iterate over all possible z (number of weight 3 items taken). For each z, compute rem = m - 3*z. If rem < 0, skip. Otherwise, compute the maximum cost for the weight 1 and 2 items with capacity rem.\n\n3. For each rem, compute the maximum cost for weight 1 and 2 items using the greedy approach above.\n\nLet me think about the greedy approach for step 3. For a given rem, let's say the current number of weight 2 items is y, and the number of weight 1 items is x = rem - 2*y. Initially, y = 0, x = rem.\n\nBut x can't exceed the number of weight 1 items. So x = min(rem, len(s1)).\n\nWait, but for the initial step, x is rem, but if there are not enough weight 1 items, we take as many as possible. So perhaps we should take x = min(rem, len(s1)), and then proceed.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize y = 0, x = min(rem, len(s1)).\n\nThen, while y < len(s2) and (y+1) <= (rem - 2*(y+1)) + ... ?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nWe can try to swap two weight 1 items with one weight 2 item. So, for each possible step, check if adding a weight 2 item (cost of s2[y+1] - s2[y]) is better than the two best weight 1 items (s1[x] - s1[x-2]).\n\nIf yes, then do the swap: y increases by 1, x decreases by 2.\n\nBut x must be at least 2, otherwise we can't subtract 2.\n\nSo the loop would be:\n\nwhile y < len(s2) - 1 and x >= 2:\n\n   compare (s2[y+1] - s2[y]) vs (s1[x] - s1[x-2])\n\n   if the former is larger, then take it: y += 1, x -= 2.\n\n   else break.\n\nBut this seems to require O(k) steps per rem, where k is the number of swaps. However, since each swap increases y by 1, and the maximum possible y is len(s2), which is O(n), this could be O(n) per rem. But if for each z, this is O(n), then the total time would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\nHmm, but perhaps in practice, the number of swaps is small. However, for worst-case scenarios, this would be O(n) per rem, leading to O(n^2) time.\n\nBut given that the problem constraints are tight, this might not be feasible. So perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for each possible total weight w, the maximum cost. But how?\n\nBut since the items are sorted, for a given capacity w, the optimal selection is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, but only if they are more valuable than two weight 1 items. So perhaps we can precompute a combined array for weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute this array efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Let's imagine that for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can create a combined list of items, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items (y) the best x (number of weight 1 items) that can be taken given the remaining weight.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAnother observation: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal solution for capacity rem can be found by considering two possibilities:\n\na) Take as many weight 2 items as possible, then fill with weight 1 items.\n\nb) Take as many weight 1 items as possible, then fill with weight 2 items.\n\nc) Some other combination.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum is achieved by either a) or b), or some combination that is close to these extremes.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible rem, we can try all possible y in a small range around the optimal value. For example, check y = floor( (rem - x)/2 ), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted, and the weight 1 items are sorted, the maximum for a given rem can be found by trying all possible y in the range [max(0, y_opt - K), min(y_max, y_opt + K)] for some small K like 100. This would allow us to find the optimal y quickly.\n\nBut how to determine y_opt?\n\nWell, y_opt is approximately (rem * c2) / (2 * c1), but this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, for a given rem, the optimal y is such that 2y is roughly equal to rem - x, where x is the number of weight 1 items. But this seems circular.\n\nAlternatively, think of the maximum value as the maximum between:\n\n- taking y = 0, x = min(rem, len(s1)).\n\n- taking y = min( len(s2), rem//2 ), x = rem - 2*y.\n\n- taking y = min( len(s2), (rem - k) // 2 ), where k is some value.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible rem, the optimal y is in the vicinity of (rem * 2) / (2 + 1) ? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum for a given rem can be found by iterating y from 0 to min(len(s2), rem//2), but only up to a certain limit, say 200, and then take the maximum. This is based on the assumption that the optimal y is not too far from the maximum possible y or zero. However, this is not guaranteed, but may work for the given constraints.\n\nBut how to decide the limit? For example, if the limit is 200, then for each rem, we check y from max(0, y_max - 200) to y_max, and also check y from 0 to min(200, y_max). This would be O(400) operations per rem, which multiplied by the number of z (say 1e5) would be 4e7 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut is this approach correct? Well, for cases where the optimal y is within 200 of the maximum possible y or zero, this would work. However, if the optimal y is further away, this approach would fail.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps the optimal y is not too far from the extremes. For example, if the weight 2 items are very valuable compared to weight 1 items, then taking as many as possible of weight 2 items is optimal. Conversely, if weight 1 items are much more valuable, then taking as many as possible of them is better. In between cases, the optimal y may be somewhere in the middle, but perhaps checking a limited number of possibilities around the maximum possible y and zero would capture it.\n\nAlternatively, we can check all possible y up to the minimum of len(s2) and (rem//2) and len(s2), but this is again O(k) per rem.\n\nBut given that the weight 2 items are sorted, and the weight 1 items are sorted, perhaps for a given rem, the optimal y is the one where the next weight 2 item's value is higher than the two best weight 1 items that would be lost. So we can find the point where this condition changes.\n\nLet me think of this as a two-pointer approach. Let's say we start with y=0 and x=rem. Then, we check if adding a weight 2 item (y+1) is better than losing two weight 1 items. If yes, we do it, and repeat. This is similar to the earlier greedy approach, but how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet's try to model this:\n\nInitialize y = 0, x = min(rem, len(s1)).\n\nThen, while y < len(s2) and (y+1) <= len(s2) - 1 and x >= 2:\n\n   if s2[y+1] - s2[y] > s1[x] - s1[x-2]:\n\n       y += 1\n\n       x -= 2\n\n   else:\n\n       break\n\nAfter this loop, the current y and x are the best possible for this scenario. However, this might not capture all possibilities, but it's a way to greedily improve the selection.\n\nBut this is just one possible path. What if there are multiple steps where you can swap between weight 2 and weight 1 items? For example, after swapping once, there might be another swap that is beneficial. The above loop would do that.\n\nOnce this loop is done, we can also check other possibilities, like decreasing y by 1 and increasing x by 2 if that would be better. But this complicates things.\n\nHowever, if we assume that this greedy approach gives us the optimal solution for the weight 1 and 2 items for a given rem, then this would be a viable approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each possible z (number of weight 3 items taken):\n\n   rem = m - 3*z\n\n   if rem < 0: continue\n\n   compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items with capacity rem using the greedy two-pointer approach described above.\n\n   total = s3[z] + (best combination)\n\n   keep track of the maximum total.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Preprocess the three groups, sorted and with prefix sums.\n\n- Iterate z from 0 to min( len(s3), m//3 )\n\n   rem = m - 3*z\n\n   compute the best for weight 1 and 2 items with capacity rem.\n\n   update max_total.\n\nNow, the question is, how efficient is this approach.\n\nLet's think about the time complexity.\n\nFor each z, we process the weight 1 and 2 items in O(k) time, where k is the number of swaps in the greedy approach. However, in the worst case, this could be O(len(s2)) per z, which is O(n) per z, leading to O(n^2) total time. But with n up to 1e5, this is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, the number of swaps is small. However, for the worst case, it's still O(n^2), which is not acceptable.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can precompute for all possible y, the maximum x that can be taken for a given rem, and find the maximum sum.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the following: For a given rem, the maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is y_max = min( len(s2), rem // 2 ). For each possible y in [0, y_max], the corresponding x is min( rem - 2*y, len(s1) ). The total cost is s2[y] + s1[x]. To find the maximum of this over all y in [0, y_max].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nIf we can find for each possible rem, the optimal y quickly, perhaps using binary search.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min( rem - 2*y, len(s1) ) ]\n\nWe want to find the maximum of f(y) for y in [0, y_max].\n\nBut since s2[y] is non-decreasing and s1[...] is non-increasing as y increases, the function f(y) may have a single maximum, which can be found using ternary search.\n\nWait, because as y increases, s2[y] increases, but rem - 2y decreases, so s1[...] decreases. So the function f(y) could be unimodal — first increasing, then decreasing. If this is the case, then ternary search can be used to find the maximum.\n\nBut is this true?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose rem is fixed. As y increases, s2[y] increases (since items are sorted in descending order, and we take prefix sums), but the term s1[...] decreases because rem - 2y decreases. So the total function could have a single peak.\n\nAssuming this is true, then for each rem, we can perform a ternary search on y in [0, y_max] to find the maximum value of f(y).\n\nThis would reduce the time for each rem to O(log y_max), which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to confirm that the function is indeed unimodal?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the function is not unimodal. Suppose rem is 5, and the weight 2 items have s2 values [0, 5, 6, 7], and weight 1 items have s1 values [0, 10, 15, 18]. So for y=0: x=5 → s1[5] is 18 (assuming len(s1) is at least 5). For y=1: x=5-2=3 → s1[3]=18. Total is 5 + 18 = 23. For y=2: x=5-4=1 → s1[1]=10. Total is 6 + 10 = 16. For y=3: 5-6 is negative, so x is 0. Total is 7 + 0 =7. So the function increases from y=0 to y=1, then decreases. So it's unimodal.\n\nAnother example: suppose rem=6, s2[y] is [0, 3, 5, 6], s1[x] is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. For y=0: x=6 → s1[6]=6. Total 0+6=6. y=1: x=4 → s1[4]=4 → total 3+4=7. y=2: x=2 → s1[2]=2 → total 5+2=7. y=3: x=0 → 6+0=6. So the function increases from y=0 to y=1, then stays flat, then decreases. Still unimodal.\n\nAnother example where it might not be unimodal: Let's say rem=4. s2[y] is [0, 3, 4], and s1[x] is [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]. For y=0: x=4 → 5. Total 0+5=5. y=1: x=4-2=2 → 3. Total 3+3=6. y=2: x=4-4=0 → 4+0=4. So the function increases then decreases. Unimodal.\n\nAnother scenario: rem=5. s2[y] is [0, 3, 5, 6], s1[x] is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10]. For y=0: x=5 → 10. Total 10. y=1: x=3 → 6. Total 3+6=9. y=2: x=5-4=1 → 1. Total 5+1=6. y=3: x=5-6=-1 → 0. Total 6. So again, unimodal.\n\nIt seems that the function is unimodal. Thus, for each rem, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max], where y_max is min(len(s2), rem//2), to find the maximum value of f(y).\n\nIf this is true, then the time complexity would be O( log (y_max) ) per rem, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each z:\n\n   rem = m - 3*z\n\n   if rem < 0: continue\n\n   compute y_max = min( len(s2), rem // 2 )\n\n   perform ternary search on y in [0, y_max] to find the maximum value of f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min(rem - 2*y, len(s1)) ]\n\n   add this to s3[z], and keep track of the maximum.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement the ternary search correctly.\n\nBut what if the function is not strictly unimodal? Well, even if it has plateaus, the ternary search will find the maximum.\n\nSo, implementing ternary search for each rem.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the optimal y is at the edges (like 0 or y_max)? Well, ternary search should handle that.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nSort the three groups by cost descending.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group.\n\nInitialize max_total = 0\n\nFor z in 0 to len(s3):\n\n   if 3*z > m: break\n\n   rem = m - 3*z\n\n   y_max = min( len(s2), rem // 2 )\n\n   low = 0, high = y_max\n\n   best_val = 0\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n       mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n       val1 = compute_f(mid1, rem)\n\n       val2 = compute_f(mid2, rem)\n\n       if val1 < val2:\n\n           best_val = max(best_val, val2)\n\n           low = mid1 + 1\n\n       else:\n\n           best_val = max(best_val, val1)\n\n           high = mid2 - 1\n\n   # After ternary search, also check the endpoints?\n\n   # Or perhaps after the loop, we need to check the best_val again?\n\n   # Alternatively, perform a linear scan in the final few points.\n\n   # However, due to possible errors in ternary search, it's safer to check all possible y in the vicinity.\n\n   # Alternatively, after ternary search, we can check all y in [low, high], but that might not be feasible.\n\n   # Another approach is to perform the ternary search and then check the best value between low and high, but this could be time-consuming.\n\n   # Alternatively, for the ternary search, after the loop, we can check all possible y in the range [low, high], but that's again O(k) time.\n\n   # However, given that the function is unimodal, the ternary search should find the maximum, but to be safe, we can check the endpoints and the midpoints.\n\n   # Alternatively, after the ternary search, we can check a few points around the best guess.\n\n",
