Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (which can be 1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The total weight can't exceed m. And n can be up to 1e5, m up to 3e5. Hmm, so we need an efficient solution here.\n\nFirst, I remember that for knapsack problems with large n and m, the standard DP approach (O(nm)) is not feasible. But since the weights are limited to 1, 2, 3, maybe there's a way to optimize.\n\nLet me think. For items with weight 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can process them separately and then combine the results. Let's break it down.\n\nFor example, for all items of weight 1, we can take as many as possible. Similarly for weight 2 and 3. But since different combinations might give better results, we need to find an optimal way.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when you have items of different weights, choosing which ones to take is more complex. So maybe the approach is to sort the items of each weight by their value per unit weight, then greedily take the best ones first.\n\nBut since the weights are small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can use a dynamic programming approach tailored for these weights.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: since the maximum weight is 3, for each weight category, we can precompute the best possible selections for each possible number of items taken. Then combine these in a way that considers how they fit into the total weight.\n\nLet me think about this. For example, suppose we have all items sorted in descending order of cost per weight. For each weight group (1, 2, 3), we can precompute prefix sums. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each group, we can compute the total cost and check if the total weight is within m.\n\nBut how to combine them efficiently?\n\nAnother approach: Let's separate the items into three groups based on their weight. Then, for each group, we can sort them in descending order of cost. For each group, we can compute the prefix sums of their costs. Then, for each possible number of items taken from the weight 1 group, and similarly for weight 2 and 3, we can try to find the combination that gives the maximum total cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nBut even that seems computationally heavy. For example, if we have up to m items of weight 1, and similarly for others, but m can be 3e5. However, since the weight of each item is fixed, maybe we can find the optimal combination by considering how many of each weight to take.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Split the items into three lists based on their weight (w=1, w=2, w=3).\n2. Sort each list in descending order of cost. This way, the first elements are the most valuable.\n3. Compute prefix sums for each list. So for weight 1, prefix1[i] is the sum of the first i items. Similarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, the problem becomes: choose a number of items a from weight 1, b from weight 2, c from weight 3, such that a*1 + b*2 + c*3 <= m, and the total cost is prefix1[a] + prefix2[b] + prefix3[c], and we need to maximize this.\n\nBut how do we efficiently find the best a, b, c?\n\nThe problem is that iterating through all possible a, b, c would be O(m^3), which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter way. Let's consider that for each possible a and b, we can compute the maximum possible c that fits into the remaining weight. But even that might be O(m^2), which for m=3e5 is 9e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible number of weight 1 and weight 2 items, we can compute the maximum possible weight 3 items. But again, that's too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can fix the number of weight 3 items, and then handle the rest. Or maybe find for each possible total weight, the best combination.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight of each item is small, perhaps we can use a dynamic programming approach that's optimized for the weight constraints.\n\nLet me think. The standard unbounded knapsack is O(m) time, but this is 0-1 knapsack. However, with the items grouped by weight, maybe there's a way to process them efficiently.\n\nAnother thought: For items of weight 1, since they are sorted, taking the first k of them is optimal. Similarly for weight 2 and 3. So perhaps the optimal solution is to take some number of items from each group, and the problem reduces to finding the best combination of counts from each group.\n\nBut again, how to compute that efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let's say we precompute the prefix sums for each weight group. Then, for each possible number of weight 3 items, we can calculate how much weight remains, and then find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fit into that remaining weight.\n\nBut how to find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items given a certain weight limit.\n\nLet me think: for a given weight limit W (which is m - 3*c), how can we find the best a and b such that a + 2*b <= W. Since the items for weight 1 and 2 are sorted, we can try to iterate over b (number of weight 2 items) and compute the maximum possible a (number of weight 1 items) that can fit into the remaining weight.\n\nBut even that could be O(W) for each c. However, since c can be up to m//3, which is up to 1e5, and for each c, the inner loop is O(W), which could be up to 3e5, that would be O(1e5 * 3e5) = 3e10 operations—way too slow.\n\nHmm, that's not feasible. So we need a better way to compute the best a and b for a given W.\n\nWait, but for the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, given a total weight limit W, what's the optimal selection? Let's think about this.\n\nSuppose we have two lists: prefix1 for weight 1 items, and prefix2 for weight 2 items. For each possible number of weight 2 items b, the maximum possible a is min(k, W - 2*b), where k is the number of weight 1 items available. So for each possible b, the maximum a is (W - 2*b) if that is non-negative and doesn't exceed the number of weight 1 items. Then, for each b, we can compute the sum of prefix2[b] + prefix1[a], where a is the maximum possible for that b.\n\nBut how to find the optimal b quickly. Since the prefix arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order (since each item is added in order of decreasing cost), the total cost for a given b would be prefix2[b] plus the maximum possible prefix1 for the remaining weight.\n\nBut how to find the optimal b?\n\nLet me think. For the weight limit W, we can iterate b from 0 to min(b_max, len(prefix2)), where b_max is W//2. For each b, the maximum a is min(len(prefix1), W - 2*b). Then, the total cost is prefix2[b] + prefix1[a]. We need to find the maximum of this over all possible b.\n\nBut if W is up to 3e5, and for each c (for weight 3 items), we do this, then it's still O(m) per c, leading to O(m^2) time.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to optimize this part. Let's consider that for the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum possible total cost can be found by trying all possible b up to min(b_max, len(prefix2)), but perhaps we can find the optimal b quickly.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 items are sorted, for each possible b, the a is (W - 2b) if possible. So for each possible b, the a is the maximum possible number of weight 1 items that can be taken given that 2b is used for weight 2 items.\n\nSo the maximum a is min(number of weight 1 items, W - 2b). Let's assume that the number of weight 1 items is sufficient, so that a = W - 2b. Then the total cost is prefix2[b] + prefix1[W - 2b].\n\nBut this is only valid if W - 2b >=0. So for each possible b from 0 to W//2, we can compute this sum. The maximum of these would be the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for the given W.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that for each W, this requires O(W) time, which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find the optimal b for a given W quickly. Let's think of the function f(b) = prefix2[b] + prefix1[W - 2b]. We need to find the maximum f(b) for b in [0, B], where B is min(W//2, len(prefix2)).\n\nNow, since the prefix arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order (because each item is more valuable than the next), prefix1 increases as a increases, and prefix2 increases as b increases. However, the term W-2b decreases as b increases. So the trade-off is between taking more weight 2 items (which may have higher value per item) and taking more weight 1 items (which may also have higher value per item).\n\nBut how can we find the maximum of this function efficiently? Perhaps using ternary search if the function is unimodal. However, I'm not sure if the function is unimodal. Alternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, maybe we can find the optimal b using a two-pointer approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's imagine that for a given W, we can try to find the optimal b by considering that for each possible b, the a is W - 2b. But since the prefix1 array is sorted in non-decreasing order, taking as many as possible of weight 1 items (given the remaining weight) is optimal.\n\nBut how to find the optimal b. Let's consider that for each b, the value is prefix2[b] + prefix1[min(W - 2b, len1)], where len1 is the number of weight 1 items. Let's assume that len1 is large enough, so that min(...) is W - 2b.\n\nSo the function is prefix2[b] + prefix1[W - 2b]. Now, since prefix2 is increasing and prefix1 is increasing, but W - 2b is decreasing as b increases. So the function may first increase and then decrease, making it unimodal. If that's the case, then ternary search can be applied.\n\nAlternatively, since the possible values of b are up to W//2, which can be up to 3e5, perhaps we can precompute for all possible W and store the maximum, but that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, we can iterate b in a limited range. For example, considering that the optimal b is around W//2 divided by some factor. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute all possible combinations where we take some number of weight 2 items and the maximum possible weight 1 items. Then, for a given W, the maximum is the maximum among all possible b where 2b ≤ W. But again, how to compute this quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, we can compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items by considering that for each possible number of weight 2 items up to min(W//2, len2), and for each of those, take as many weight 1 items as possible. However, if we can find that the optimal b is up to some small number, like up to sqrt(W), then maybe we can compute that.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of the following. Let's say that for each possible W, the maximum is achieved either by taking as many weight 2 items as possible, or as many weight 1 items as possible, or some combination in between. However, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.\n\nBut here's another idea: for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for all possible total weight up to m, the maximum value. How?\n\nWell, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can model this as a knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2. But with n up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, the standard DP approach would be O(m) for each weight type.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this as follows. Let's process the weight 1 items first. For each possible weight up to m, the maximum value is the sum of the top k items where k is the weight. Then, for the weight 2 items, we can process them in a similar way, combining with the existing DP array.\n\nBut even that would be O(m) for each group. Let's think:\n\nInitialize dp as an array where dp[w] is the maximum value for weight w.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0, and others are zero.\n\nThen, for each weight 1 item, since they are sorted in descending order, we can update the dp array by taking the item. However, since each item can be taken once, we need to process them in a way that allows for 0-1 knapsack. However, for weight 1 items, since they are sorted, taking the first k items for weight w =k would be optimal. So maybe we can compute the prefix sum for weight 1 items, and then for each weight w, the maximum value is the sum of the first min(w, len1) items.\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 items. But combining them is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by the fact that the weight is small. Let's process the weight 1 and 2 items, and for each possible weight w, compute the maximum value.\n\nFor weight 1 items:\n\nWe can create a prefix sum array for weight 1, say sum1, where sum1[k] is the sum of the first k items (sorted descending). Then, for any weight w, the maximum value from weight 1 items is sum1[min(w, len1)].\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 items: sum2[k] is the sum of the first k items, and for a given weight w, the maximum value from weight 2 items is sum2[min(w // 2, len2)].\n\nBut how to combine these two. For example, for a total weight W, we can take some x items from weight 1 and y items from weight 2, such that x + 2y ≤ W. The maximum sum would be sum1[x] + sum2[y], and we need to find x and y that maximize this under the constraint.\n\nThis is similar to the earlier problem. But again, how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut here's an idea: for each possible y (number of weight 2 items), the maximum x is W - 2y. So for each y in 0 to min(W//2, len2), we can calculate the value sum2[y] + sum1[min(W - 2y, len1)]. Then the maximum of all these is the answer for the weight W.\n\nBut again, for each W, this would take O(W) time, which is not feasible for large W.\n\nBut considering that the weight 1 and 2 items are processed once, perhaps we can precompute for all possible W up to m, the maximum value. Let's think of how to do this.\n\nLet me think of the following. For all possible y (number of weight 2 items), we can compute for each possible weight 2y, and then add the maximum possible weight 1 items for the remaining weight.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 2 items, since they are sorted, for each possible y (up to len2), we can compute the weight 2y. Then, for each such y, we can add the maximum sum1 for weight (W - 2y). But again, how to combine this with varying W.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the entire problem, after processing the weight 1 and 2 items, we can create a dp array where dp[w] represents the maximum value achievable with weight exactly w using only items of weight 1 and 2.\n\nBut how to compute this dp array.\n\nLet me think. For the items of weight 1 and 2, the standard 0-1 knapsack approach would be O(nm), but with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, that's 3e10 operations, which is impossible.\n\nBut since the weight is limited to 1 and 2, perhaps we can find a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the weight 1 items. Suppose we have sorted them in descending order. Then, for any weight w, the maximum value is sum1[min(w, len1)].\n\nSimilarly for weight 2 items, the maximum value for weight 2y is sum2[y], where y is up to min(w//2, len2).\n\nBut combining them for a given total weight W is the problem. However, if we can find for each possible W, the best combination of x and y where x + 2y ≤ W.\n\nBut how to find that quickly.\n\nAn alternative idea: For a given W, the maximum value is the maximum between taking some number of weight 2 items and then filling the rest with weight 1 items, or taking some number of weight 1 items and filling the rest with weight 2 items. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, we can iterate over y from 0 to min(W//2, len2), and compute the corresponding x = W - 2y, and take sum1[x] + sum2[y], then take the maximum over all y. However, if we can find that the optimal y is in a small range, say up to sqrt(W), then this could be feasible.\n\nBut for W up to 3e5, and for each W, this would take O(sqrt(W)) time, which would be acceptable.\n\nBut how to determine the optimal range for y.\n\nAlternatively, note that for the sum sum2[y] + sum1[W - 2y], the maximum can be found by considering that for each possible y, the value depends on both sum2 and sum1. Since sum1 is increasing with x (as x increases), and sum2 is increasing with y, but x decreases as y increases.\n\nSo, for a given W, the optimal y could be in the vicinity of the point where the marginal gain of adding a weight 2 item is equal to the marginal loss of removing two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible W, we can iterate y from max(0, y_min) to min(y_max, len2), where y_min and y_max are determined based on some heuristic. For example, we can iterate y from 0 to min(len2, W//2), but only up to some limit, say 1000 steps. But this would miss some cases where the optimal y is outside this range.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each W, the optimal y is either:\n\n- The maximum possible y (i.e., W//2), or\n\n- The maximum possible y such that 2y is less than or equal to W, and the sum is maximum.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nWait, here's another thought. Since the sum1 and sum2 are prefix sums sorted in descending order, the sum1 is maximized when x is as large as possible. Similarly for sum2. But when you increase y by 1, you add sum2[y] - sum2[y-1], but you lose the value of two weight 1 items (assuming that x was previously W - 2(y-1), and now x is W - 2y).\n\nSo, for the optimal y, the marginal gain of adding a weight 2 item should be greater than the marginal loss of losing two weight 1 items. Once this is no longer true, we stop increasing y.\n\nSo, for a given W, we can start from y=0 and incrementally check whether adding another weight 2 item is beneficial.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFor a given W:\n\nInitialize current_max = sum1[W] (taking no weight 2 items, all weight 1).\n\ncurrent_y = 0.\n\nThen, while current_y + 1 <= len2 and 2*(current_y+1) <= W:\n\n   new_value = sum2[current_y + 1] + sum1[W - 2*(current_y + 1)]\n\n   if new_value > current_max:\n\n       current_max = new_value\n\n       current_y += 1\n\n   else:\n\n       break\n\nBut this approach would only check increasing y until the gain stops. However, this might miss cases where after some y, the gain starts increasing again. But given that the items are sorted in descending order, perhaps this is not the case.\n\nWait, suppose that the next weight 2 item is very valuable. For example, sum2[y+1] - sum2[y] is very large, while the loss of two weight 1 items is small. In that case, even if the previous step didn't improve, adding the next one might improve.\n\nSo this greedy approach of checking sequentially might not find the maximum. However, it's possible that the optimal y is near the point where the marginal gain of adding a weight 2 item is higher than the marginal loss of removing two weight 1 items. But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, we can try all possible y in the range [max(0, y_opt - K), min(y_opt + K, ...)], where K is a small number (like 200), and find the maximum. This is called the \"two pointers\" approach with a limited window. However, this is heuristic and may not work for all cases.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum1 and sum2 are sorted, for each W, the optimal y is such that the value of sum2[y] + sum1[W - 2y] is maximized. Let's think of this as a function of y. Since sum2 is increasing and sum1 is increasing, but W-2y decreases as y increases, the function may have a single peak. Thus, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, min(len2, W//2)].\n\nIf this function is unimodal, then ternary search can find the maximum.\n\nBut is it unimodal?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose sum2[y] increases with y, and sum1[W-2y] decreases with y. The total function could be unimodal. For example, initially, adding more y increases the sum2[y], but the sum1 decreases. At some point, the gain from sum2 is offset by the loss in sum1, leading to a peak. After that, adding more y leads to a decrease in the total. So yes, it's possible that the function is unimodal.\n\nIf this is true, then ternary search can be used to find the maximum in O(log n) steps.\n\nSo, for a given W, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, Y_max], where Y_max is min(len2, W//2). For each candidate y, we compute the value of sum2[y] + sum1[ min(W - 2y, len1) ].\n\nThus, for each W, this would take O(log Y_max) time. And since we need to do this for each possible c (number of weight 3 items), this might be feasible.\n\nBut how does this fit into the overall solution?\n\nLet me outline the overall steps:\n\n1. Split the items into three groups based on weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group. For example, prefix1[i] = sum of the first i items in group 1.\n\n4. For the weight 3 items, compute prefix3[i] = sum of the first i items.\n\nNow, the total maximum cost is the maximum over all possible a, b, c such that a*1 + b*2 + c*3 <= m. And a is up to len1, b up to len2, c up to len3.\n\nTo find this, we can iterate over possible c (number of weight 3 items), compute the remaining weight rem = m - 3*c. Then, for this rem, find the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items (using the ternary search method discussed above), and add it to prefix3[c].\n\nThe maximum of all these possibilities would be the answer.\n\nBut how to iterate c. The maximum possible c is min(len3, m//3). So for each c in 0 to that value, we compute rem = m - 3*c. If rem < 0, skip. Else, compute the maximum value for rem using the weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nThe question is, how efficient is this approach.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\nFor each c, we do a ternary search on y (number of weight 2 items) for the rem weight. Each ternary search takes O(log Y) steps, where Y is up to min(len2, rem//2). For each step, we compute the value for a particular y, which involves O(1) operations.\n\nThe number of c's is up to m//3, which for m=3e5 is up to 1e5. So total operations would be O(1e5 * log(1e5)) = acceptable.\n\nSo this seems feasible.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to implementing this approach.\n\nBut first, let's think about the steps for the ternary search part.\n\nImplementing ternary search for a given W:\n\ndef get_max_1_2(W):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = min(len2, W // 2)\n\n    best = 0\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        val1 = compute(mid1)\n\n        val2 = compute(mid2)\n\n        if val1 < val2:\n\n            best = max(best, val2)\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            best = max(best, val1)\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n    # Also check the endpoints?\n\n    return best\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact implementation of ternary search here. Alternatively, we can use a binary search approach, but I think ternary search is applicable if the function is unimodal.\n\nAlternatively, since the function may not be strictly unimodal, but for the purposes of finding the maximum, we can check all possible candidates in the vicinity of the peak found by ternary search.\n\nAnother possibility is to use a binary search approach for the optimal y. However, this may not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, we can iterate y from 0 to min(len2, W//2), but only up to a certain limit. However, for W up to 3e5 and len2 up to 1e5, this would be O(3e5) per c, which is not feasible.\n\nTherefore, relying on the ternary search approach seems necessary.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the code steps.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen read the n items, split into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each list. For example, prefix1[0] = 0, prefix1[1] = w1[0], prefix1[2] = w1[0] + w1[1], etc. Similarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, for each possible c in 0 to min(len3, m//3):\n\n    rem = m - 3*c\n\n    if rem < 0: continue\n\n    current_max = get_max_1_2(rem)\n\n    total = prefix3[c] + current_max\n\n    keep track of the maximum total.\n\nNow, the key is to implement get_max_1_2(W).\n\nImplementing get_max_1_2(W):\n\nWe need to find the best combination of b (number of weight 2 items) and a (number of weight 1 items), such that a + 2b <= W. The maximum is prefix2[b] + prefix1[a], where a is as large as possible for the given b.\n\nBut a is min(W - 2b, len1). So for each possible b, the a is min(W - 2b, len1).\n\nSo, for a given b, the value is prefix2[b] + prefix1[ min(W - 2b, len1) ].\n\nNow, for the ternary search, we can define the function f(b) as that value.\n\nBut how to find the maximum of f(b) over b in [0, B], where B = min(len2, W//2).\n\nAssuming that f(b) is unimodal, we can use ternary search.\n\nBut to confirm that, let's think of a scenario where the function increases to a peak and then decreases. For example, when adding more weight 2 items gives higher value, but after a certain point, the loss of weight 1 items makes the total decrease.\n\nBut what if the function has multiple peaks? Well, in that case, ternary search may not find the global maximum. However, given the way items are sorted, it's possible that the function is unimodal.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to find the maximum by checking all possible b in a small range around the optimal point found by ternary search.\n\nBut for the sake of time, let's proceed with the ternary search approach and see.\n\nNow, code-wise, let's think about how to compute the value for a given b.\n\nIn Python, for the prefix arrays, we can precompute them as lists. For example, prefix1 is a list where prefix1[i] is the sum of the first i items in the sorted list. So for the sorted list of weight 1 items, which is sorted descending, prefix1[0] = 0, prefix1[1] = cost of first item, prefix1[2] = cost of first two items, etc.\n\nNow, during the get_max_1_2(W) function, for a given b, the a is min(W - 2*b, len1). So:\n\ndef get_max_1_2(W):\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    len2_ = len(prefix2) - 1  # because prefix2[0] = 0, prefix2[1] = first item, etc.\n\n    len1_ = len(prefix1) - 1\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = min(len2_, W // 2)\n\n    # Perform ternary search between low and high\n\n    # But maybe we can just iterate all possible b in 0 to high?\n\n    # Wait, but for W up to 3e5, and high up to 1.5e5, this would be O(1.5e5) per call, which multiplied by 1e5 c's would be O(1.5e10), which is way too slow.\n\n    # So, back to the ternary search idea.\n\n    # So, let's implement ternary search.\n\n    # However, for the sake of correctness, perhaps we can try all possible b in a small window.\n\n    # Alternatively, since the function is unimodal, we can use ternary search.\n\n    # Let's proceed with ternary search.\n\n    # For the ternary search, we need to find the maximum of f(b) in [low, high]\n\n    # So, the code for ternary search:\n\n    # But in practice, sometimes people use binary search for unimodal functions.\n\n    # Alternatively, since the function may not be strictly unimodal, but we can check all possible candidates in a small range.\n\n    # Another idea: since the items are sorted, the optimal b is likely to be in the range where the value of the next item of weight 2 is higher than the value of two items of weight 1.\n\n    # However, this is getting complicated.\n\n    # Given time constraints, perhaps the best way is to implement the ternary search, and also check the endpoints and some other points.\n\n    # For now, let's proceed with the ternary search approach.\n\n    # So, the code for get_max_1_2(W):\n\n    # Initialize best as 0\n\n    best = 0\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = min(len2, W // 2)\n\n    # To handle cases where len2 is larger than the possible b.\n\n    # Perform ternary search for 100 iterations (to be safe)\n\n    for _ in range(100):\n\n        if high - low <= 3:\n\n            # Check all possible values between low and high\n\n            for b in range(low, high + 1):\n\n                a = W - 2*b\n\n                if a < 0:\n\n                    continue\n\n                a = min(a, len1)\n\n                current = prefix2[b] + prefix1[a]\n\n                if current > best:\n\n                    best = current\n\n            break\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        val1 = prefix2[mid1] + prefix1[ min(W - 2*mid1, len1) ]\n\n        val2 = prefix2[mid2] + prefix1[ min(W - 2*mid2, len1) ]\n\n        if val1 < val2:\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n            best = max(best, val2)\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n            best = max(best, val1)\n\n    return best\n\nBut this is a bit of a hack, but it might work. The idea is that after a few iterations of ternary search, we check all possible b in the small range. This way, even if the function isn't perfectly unimodal, we can find the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, for the given W, we can try all possible b in the range [max(0, high - 200), high], and take the maximum. This is a heuristic but may work given that the items are sorted.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving this problem, let's proceed with the ternary search approach with checking all possibilities in the end.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\nSo, the item has weight 2, cost 1. The maximum weight is 1. So cannot take it. Output is 0.\n\nSecond example:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, items are (weight 1, cost 3) and (weight 2, cost 2). m=2.\n\nPossible options:\n\nTake the first item (cost 3, weight 1) and can't take the second. Or take the second item (cost 2, weight 2). So maximum is 3.\n\nThird example:\n\n4 3\n\n3 10\n\n2 7\n\n2 8\n\n1 1\n\nSo, items:\n\nweight 3: 10\n\nweight 2: 7, 8\n\nweight 1: 1.\n\nm=3.\n\nWe can take the weight 3 item (cost 10, weight 3) which is allowed. So output is 10.\n\nNow, let's see how the code would handle this.\n\nFor the third example:\n\nprefix1 is [0, 1], since there is one weight 1 item.\n\nprefix2 is [0, 7, 15] (sorted in descending order: 8,7?), wait no:\n\nWait, the items for weight 2 are 7 and 8. When sorted descendingly, they are 8, 7. So prefix2[0] = 0, prefix2[1] = 8, prefix2[2] = 8+7=15.\n\nprefix3 is [0, 10], since there is one weight 3 item.\n\nNow, when c=0, rem=3. Then, we need to find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nFor rem=3, W=3.\n\nThe possible b ranges from 0 to 1 (since W//2=1, len2 is 2, so min(2, 1) is 1).\n\nSo for b=0: a=3, which is min(3, len1=1) → a=1. sum is 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nFor b=1: 2*1=2, a=3-2=1 → sum is 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo the maximum is 9. Adding prefix3[0] (0) → total 9.\n\nWhen c=1: rem = 3 - 3*1 = 0. So W=0. So for weight 1 and 2, the maximum is 0. So total is 10 + 0 = 10. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nThus, the code seems to work for this example.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing the steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each",
