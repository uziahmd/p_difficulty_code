The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is to maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, we want to keep the districts with the highest possible numbers. But there's a catch: removing some districts might disconnect the graph. So we can't just remove the k smallest districts, because maybe they are in positions that are critical for connectivity.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after removal, all remaining districts must be connected. So the remaining districts must form a connected subtree. So the question becomes: select n - k districts that form a connected subtree, and their sum of 2^i is maximum.\n\nSince the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible districts, perhaps we need to find a way to include as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut how do we ensure connectivity? Let's think about the structure of the tree. Since the tree is connected, any subset of nodes that forms a connected subtree must have a certain structure.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to consider that the optimal solution will include the largest possible nodes. So perhaps we can start by selecting the largest (n - k) nodes, but then check if they form a connected subtree. If they don't, we need to adjust by replacing some lower-numbered nodes with higher ones that help maintain connectivity.\n\nBut how to efficiently do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as finding a subtree with exactly (n - k) nodes that has the maximum possible sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, the maximum sum would be achieved by including the largest possible nodes, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting a connected subtree of size m = n -k, where m is the number of districts to keep, and this subtree must contain as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nBut how do we find such a subtree?\n\nAn idea here is to perform a greedy approach. Since higher-numbered districts have higher values, we want to include them. However, their inclusion may require including some lower-numbered districts to maintain connectivity.\n\nWait, but the tree is connected. So if we want to include the largest possible nodes, perhaps we can start from the largest node and build up the subtree by adding necessary nodes.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe using a priority queue approach. Let me think.\n\nAnother idea: the problem is similar to finding a tree with m nodes that has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since the sum is maximized when the nodes are as large as possible, the optimal subtree must consist of the largest m nodes, but connected. However, if those m nodes are not connected, we need to find the minimal number of lower nodes that connect them, but since we can only have m nodes, perhaps we need to find a way to select the largest nodes that form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how can we check if the largest m nodes form a connected subtree? Well, if they are connected, then that's the optimal. Otherwise, we need to replace some of the lower nodes in the largest m with higher ones that help connect them.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where we need to choose a subtree of size m, and the subtree must include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So perhaps we can model this as a priority-based selection, where we start with the largest node and then add the next largest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nWait, but that sounds like a BFS or DFS approach, but how to manage which nodes to include.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by Krusky's algorithm or Prim's algorithm. We can think of the problem as building a tree with maximum possible sum. Since the sum is maximized by including higher-numbered nodes, perhaps we can use a priority-based approach where we greedily include the highest nodes and ensure connectivity.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. The optimal set of nodes to keep is a connected subtree of size m = n -k.\n\n2. Since the sum is maximized when we have the largest possible nodes, we can think that the optimal subtree must contain the largest m nodes, but possibly some of them are not connected. So we need to find the minimal number of nodes to remove from the top m nodes to make them connected, but since we can only remove k nodes (so keep m), perhaps we need to find the connected subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the way to proceed is to start with the largest node, and then add nodes in order of their value, ensuring that each addition connects",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is to prioritize keeping districts with higher numbers since their fan counts grow exponentially.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there's exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since the fan count for a district `i` is `2^i`, we aim to keep the highest-numbered districts possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected component. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered district and iteratively adding the next highest-numbered districts that maintain connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = n - k\n\n    # Build the tree as adjacency list\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n\n    # We need to select m nodes with maximum values, connected.\n    # Use a priority queue (max-heap) approach, but since Python has min-heap, we invert the values.\n    # Start with the largest node, then add neighbors in order of their value.\n\n    # Initially, we have a set of nodes to keep.
