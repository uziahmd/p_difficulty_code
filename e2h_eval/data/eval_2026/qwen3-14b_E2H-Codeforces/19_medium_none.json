The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. Let me think. The key here is that the districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So when we remove some districts, the remaining ones must form a connected subtree. But how do we choose which ones to remove to maximize the sum?\n\nThe sum of 2^i for the districts is maximized by keeping as many high-numbered districts as possible. Because 2^i grows exponentially with i. So the higher the district number, the more valuable it is. Therefore, our goal is to keep the largest possible numbers, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut how to ensure connectivity? Well, if we think about the tree structure, maybe we can find a way to select the districts with the highest values while maintaining connectivity.\n\nWait, but the problem is similar to finding a subtree with (n -k) nodes, which has the maximum possible sum of 2^i. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible numbers, perhaps the optimal strategy is to keep the largest (n -k) districts, but they must be connected.\n\nBut how to ensure that those largest districts are connected? Because if they are not connected, we need to remove some lower-numbered districts to connect them. Wait, but maybe the approach is to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to choose which nodes to remove, but the remaining nodes form a connected component. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest nodes, perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we try to keep the largest nodes and then check if they are connected. However, that might not be straightforward.\n\nAnother idea: Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible nodes, maybe the optimal solution is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but they must form a connected subtree. If they do, then we can remove the rest. If not, then we need to remove some of the smaller ones and include some larger ones.\n\nBut how to check if the largest (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree? That seems computationally heavy for large n. However, given that n can be up to 1e6, we need an efficient algorithm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we want to select a subtree with (n -k) nodes, and the sum is the sum of 2^i for those nodes. To maximize the sum, we need to select the nodes with the highest possible values. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to select all nodes except the smallest k nodes, but only if they form a connected subtree. But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the nodes with the highest numbers may be scattered in the tree. For example, suppose the tree is a chain like 1-2-3-4-5-6. If k is 3 and n is 6, then we need to remove 3 nodes. The best would be to keep 4,5,6. But if the tree is structured such that 4,5,6 are connected, then that's possible. But if the tree is structured in a way that 4 is connected to 1, and 5 and 6 are connected to 2, then perhaps the largest nodes are not connected. So we need to find a way to select the largest nodes possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to start from the largest node and greedily build a subtree, adding the largest nodes possible. But how?\n\nAnother thought: Since the sum depends on the nodes' numbers, and higher numbers are better, the optimal set must be a connected subtree that includes the highest possible nodes. Therefore, perhaps we can model this as a priority-based selection, where we select the largest nodes first and then ensure their connectivity.\n\nThis reminds me of the problem where you have to find a subtree with certain properties, and you use a priority queue. Maybe we can use a priority queue (max-heap) approach, where we start with the largest node, then add its neighbors, etc., but ensuring that we select the nodes with the highest possible values.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the reverse: we need to remove k nodes. The nodes to remove are those that are not in the optimal subtree. Since the optimal subtree has (n -k) nodes, and we want the maximum sum, the optimal subtree must contain the largest (n -k) nodes, but adjusted for connectivity.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to exclude?\n\nLet me think of this as a problem where we need to select a subset of nodes S with size m = n -k, such that S is connected and the sum of 2^i for i in S is maximum.\n\nThe maximum sum is achieved when S contains the largest possible nodes. So, the ideal scenario is that the largest m nodes form a connected subtree. If they do, then we can just remove the other k nodes. If not, then we need to find the largest m nodes that can be connected.\n\nBut how can we check if the largest m nodes form a connected subtree?\n\nFor example, let's take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n6 3\nEdges: 2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3\n\nSo the tree is rooted at 2? Or maybe not. The districts are numbered 1-6. The largest m = 6-3=3 nodes are 4,5,6. Are these connected? Let's see:\n\nDistrict 4 is connected to 2. District 5 is connected to 6. District 6 is connected to 2. So 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So 4,5,6 are connected via 2. So the subtree containing 4,5,6 is connected. So why in the sample output, the answer is removing 1,3,4? Wait, no. Wait the sample output says that the districts removed are 1,3,4. Then the remaining are 2,5,6. Wait that's three districts. But m is 3. But according to the sample explanation, the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. Wait why isn't it 4,5,6? Because 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 is 16+32+64= 112, which is bigger. So why is the sample output not that?\n\nAh, wait maybe I made a mistake in the sample input. Let me check again. Oh wait the sample input says:\n\nIn the first sample, the output is 1 3 4. Which means the remaining districts are 2,5,6. Wait why isn't 4 included?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the maximum total is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100. But if we kept 4,5,6, that would be 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 16 + 32 + 64 = 112. Which is higher. So why is that not the case?\n\nAh, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. So the remaining districts must be connected, but the path between any two districts must not pass through any removed district. Therefore, the remaining districts must form a connected subtree.\n\nSo, in the first sample, if we remove districts 1,3,4, then the remaining districts are 2,5,6. Let's check if they are connected. The original edges are:\n\nEdges are:\n\nBetween 2 and 1, 2 and 6, 4 and 2, 5 and 6, 2 and 3.\n\nIf we remove 1,3,4, then the remaining districts are 2,5,6. The edges between 2-6 and 5-6 exist. So 2 is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So yes, connected.\n\nBut what about districts 4,5,6? If we remove 1,2,3. Then the remaining districts are 4,5,6. Are they connected? Let's see. The original edges: 4 is connected to 2, but 2 is removed. So 4 is disconnected. So the districts 4,5,6 are not connected. So that's why in the sample, keeping 4 is not possible.\n\nAh! So the problem is that even if we want to keep the largest m nodes, they may not be connected. Therefore, we need to find a connected subtree of m nodes that includes as many of the largest nodes as possible.\n\nSo the approach is to find a connected subtree with m nodes that has the maximum sum. How can we do that?\n\nAn idea comes to mind: the optimal subtree must include the node with the highest value (since otherwise, we could replace a lower node with the highest one and get a better sum). Then, recursively, the subtree must include the next highest nodes that are connected.\n\nBut how to model this. Perhaps, we can think of this as building the subtree starting from the highest node, and then adding the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes. So perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we prioritize keeping the higher-numbered nodes, and remove the lower ones, but ensuring connectivity.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a problem where we need to remove k nodes, but the remaining nodes must form a connected subtree. Since we want to maximize the sum, the nodes to remove are the ones with the smallest values, but only if they are not necessary for the connectivity of the higher nodes.\n\nBut again, how to find which nodes to remove.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: We need to select a connected subtree with m = n -k nodes. The sum of 2^i for the selected nodes is maximum. Since 2^i is strictly increasing, the maximum sum is achieved by selecting the m nodes with the largest possible values, provided that they form a connected subtree. But if they don't, then we need to adjust by possibly replacing some lower nodes with higher ones that are connected.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to keep.\n\nAn alternative approach is to think in terms of a priority queue. Start with the node with the highest value. Then, for each step, add the next highest node that is connected to the current subtree. However, this might not work because the highest node may be isolated, but in a tree, each node is connected to others.\n\nWait, but in a tree, any node is connected to others. So if we start with the highest node, then we can expand the subtree by adding adjacent nodes. But to maximize the sum, we need to add the highest possible nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to implement this. Maybe using a priority queue (max-heap) approach where we track the nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree and have not been added yet. At each step, we select the highest available node that is adjacent to the current subtree and add it to the subtree.\n\nWait, but that sounds like Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree, but here we want to collect the maximum possible nodes.\n\nWait, but the problem is to select a subtree of size m, which is connected. So, the process could be:\n\nStart with the node with the highest value. Then, for each step, select the next highest node that is adjacent to the current subtree. Repeat until the subtree has m nodes.\n\nBut this approach would ensure that the subtree contains the highest possible nodes, as we always add the next highest node that is connected to the current subtree.\n\nLet's test this approach with the first sample.\n\nSample 1: n=6, k=3, m=3. Highest node is 6. Then, we need to add two more nodes. The current subtree is {6}. Adjacent nodes are 2 and 5. The next highest is 5 (value 5), so add 5. Now the subtree is {5,6}. Next, adjacent nodes are 2 (connected to 6) and 2 (connected to 5?), no. Wait, original edges for 6 are connected to 2 and 5. So the adjacent nodes to the current subtree {5,6} are 2 (from 6) and 2 (from 5?), no. Wait, the subtree includes 5 and 6. The adjacent nodes are 2 (connected to 6) and any other nodes connected to 5? In the sample input, 5 is connected to 6. So the adjacent nodes to the subtree are 2 (connected to 6) and any other nodes connected to 5 or 6. But in the tree, 5 is only connected to 6. So the next candidate nodes are 2. The next highest node is 2 (since 6 and 5 are already in the subtree). So we add 2. Now the subtree is {5,6,2}, which has size 3. The sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. Which matches the sample. But why didn't we add 4 instead of 2?\n\nBecause 4 is not adjacent to the current subtree. The current subtree is {5,6,2}. The adjacent nodes to this subtree would be 1, 3, 4. The next highest node is 4 (value 4). So adding 4 would give us a subtree of size 4. But since m is 3, we need to stop once we have 3 nodes. So in this case, the algorithm gives us the correct answer.\n\nBut why is the subtree {5,6,2} considered better than {4,5,6}? Because in that case, the subtree {4,5,6} would require that 4 is connected to the subtree. But 4 is connected to 2. However, if the subtree is {4,5,6}, then 2 is not part of the subtree. So how is the subtree connected? 4 is connected to 2, but 2 is not in the subtree. So 4 is not connected to 5 or 6. So the subtree {4,5,6} is not connected. Hence, the algorithm is correct.\n\nSo the approach of starting from the highest node and greedily adding the next highest adjacent node seems promising.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. Build the tree as an adjacency list.\n\n2. Initialize a priority queue (max-heap) with the highest node (n). Also, keep track of visited nodes.\n\n3. For each step, we need to add the next highest node that is adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to track which nodes are adjacent to the current subtree. Because once a node is added to the subtree, its neighbors become candidates for addition.\n\nThis seems similar to Prim's algorithm. Let's think of it as building a maximum spanning tree, but not exactly. Because in Prim's, you want to select edges with maximum weight. Here, the nodes have weights (their numbers), and we want to select nodes with maximum weights, ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut perhaps the algorithm can be modeled as follows:\n\nWe maintain a set of nodes that are part of the current subtree. Initially, this set contains the highest node. We also maintain a priority queue (max-heap) of nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree. Each time, we select the node with the highest value from the priority queue, add it to the subtree, and then add its neighbors to the priority queue (if they are not already in the subtree or the queue).\n\nBut to avoid processing the same node multiple times, we need to track which nodes are already in the priority queue or in the subtree.\n\nWait, but in Prim's algorithm, the priority queue holds the edges. Here, perhaps the priority queue holds the nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree and not yet added. Each time, we pick the node with the highest value, add it to the subtree, and then add its neighbors to the priority queue if they are not already in the subtree or the queue.\n\nBut how to manage the priority queue. Let's think:\n\nInitialize:\n\ncurrent_subtree = {n}\n\npriority_queue = max-heap containing all neighbors of n, but not in current_subtree.\n\nBut for the initial step, we need to add the neighbors of the starting node (n) into the heap.\n\nThen, for each of the next (m-1) steps (since m is the number of nodes to select):\n\n- Extract the node with the highest value from the priority queue.\n\n- Add it to the current_subtree.\n\n- Add all its neighbors that are not already in the current_subtree to the priority queue.\n\nThis way, we ensure that the subtree is built by adding the highest possible nodes that are adjacent to the current subtree.\n\nBut this approach will build a subtree of size m, which is connected. And since we always choose the highest available node, the sum should be maximized.\n\nWait, but this approach may not work. For example, suppose that adding a slightly lower node now allows adding several higher nodes later. But since the priority is always to select the highest possible node, perhaps this approach is optimal.\n\nLet's see. Suppose that the current subtree is {A}, and there are two options: B (value 5) and C (value 4). B is connected to A, and C is connected to A. If we choose B, then later we can add D (value 6) connected to B. But if we choose C, then D is not connected. But in this case, the algorithm would select B first, then D. So the sum would be higher.\n\nBut in this case, the algorithm would select B first, then D. So the approach seems correct.\n\nBut how to handle cases where choosing a lower node allows more higher nodes to be added later. But given that the algorithm picks the highest possible node at each step, perhaps it's optimal.\n\nSo this seems like a valid approach. Once we have the subtree, the nodes not in the subtree are the ones to be removed. But since we need to remove k nodes, and the subtree has m = n -k nodes, this approach would generate the correct subtree.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Build the adjacency list for the tree.\n\n- Use a priority queue (max-heap) to select the next node to add to the subtree.\n\n- Start with the highest node (n), and add its neighbors to the priority queue.\n\n- Then, for (m-1) times, extract the max node from the heap, add to the subtree, and add its neighbors to the heap if not already added.\n\nOnce the subtree is built, the nodes not in the subtree are the ones to be removed. But since the problem requires to output the k districts to remove, we need to collect all nodes not in the subtree, sort them, and output.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently for n up to 1e6.\n\nIn Python, using a priority queue (heapq) is possible, but since heapq is a min-heap, to implement a max-heap, we can insert negative numbers.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, and m up to n, the time complexity would be O(n log n), which should be acceptable.\n\nBut the problem is that for each node added, we need to add its neighbors to the heap. However, the same neighbor can be added multiple times to the heap. For example, if a node is adjacent to multiple nodes in the current subtree, but it's not yet in the subtree. However, once the node is added to the heap once, adding it again is redundant. So to avoid processing the same node multiple times, we need to track whether a node is already in the heap or in the subtree.\n\nWait, but in the algorithm, once a node is added to the subtree, we don't process it again. However, if a node is in the heap but not yet processed, it can be added multiple times. For example, suppose node X is adjacent to node A (already in the subtree) and node B (not yet in the subtree). When node A is processed, X is added to the heap. Later, when node B is processed, X is again added to the heap. However, when X is extracted from the heap, it's already in the subtree (if it was processed before) or not. So, to avoid processing the same node multiple times, we need to track whether it's already in the subtree or in the heap.\n\nBut how to track this. One way is to have a visited array. Initially, all nodes are unvisited. When a node is added to the subtree, it's marked as visited. When adding neighbors to the heap, we check if they are unvisited. If so, add them to the heap and mark them as visited. Wait, no. Because if a node is already in the heap but not yet processed, but we add it again, that would be redundant. However, since the heap can have multiple entries of the same node, but when we extract it, we check if it's already in the subtree. If it is, we skip processing it.\n\nSo here's the modified algorithm:\n\nInitialize:\n\nsubtree = empty set\n\nvisited = array of booleans, initialized to False.\n\npriority_queue = max-heap (using negative values)\n\nStart with the highest node (n). Add it to the subtree, mark as visited. Then add all its neighbors to the heap, but only if they are not visited. Then, for each step:\n\n- Extract the node with the highest value from the heap.\n\n- If it is already in the subtree, skip it.\n\n- Else, add it to the subtree, mark as visited.\n\n- Add all its neighbors to the heap if they are not visited.\n\nBut how to check if the node is already in the subtree. Because when you add a node to the heap, it's possible that it's added multiple times. For example, node X can be added to the heap when processing node A, and again when processing node B. When you extract X from the heap, you need to check if it's already in the subtree. If not, you add it. Otherwise, you ignore.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently. The visited array marks whether the node is in the subtree. So during the extraction step, if the node is not visited, then we add it to the subtree and process its neighbors. Otherwise, we skip.\n\nThis way, even if the same node is added multiple times to the heap, when it's extracted, if it's already visited, it's skipped.\n\nThis approach would work. Let's see for the first sample:\n\nInitial subtree is {6} (node 6). Marked as visited. Its neighbors are 2 and 5. Add them to the heap. The heap has 5 and 2. The next step is to extract the max (5). It's not visited. Add to subtree. Now subtree is {6,5}. Mark 5 as visited. Then, add its neighbors. 5's neighbors are 6 (already visited) and maybe others? In the sample input, 5 is connected to 6. So no other neighbors. Then, the heap contains 2. Extract 2, add to subtree. Now subtree has 3 nodes. So done.\n\nThus, the subtree is {6,5,2}. Which matches the sample. The nodes to remove are all except these three. So 1,3,4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose the tree is a straight line 1-2-3-4-5-6. n=6, k=3. m=3. The highest node is 6. Its neighbors are 5. So the initial heap has 5. Extract 5, add to subtree. Then add 4. Then extract 4, add to subtree. Now the subtree has 6,5,4. Which is connected. Sum is 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 16 + 32 + 64 = 112. Which is better than the sample's case. So this approach would work.\n\nSo this seems like a valid approach. Now, the implementation steps.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then read n-1 edges. Then build an adjacency list.\n\nThen, we need to perform the algorithm.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, using a standard adjacency list is feasible.\n\nBut in Python, for 1e6 nodes, using a list of lists is manageable.\n\nNow, the priority queue. Since Python's heapq is a min-heap, to simulate a max-heap, we can push the negative of the node numbers.\n\nBut for each node, when we add it to the heap, we push -node_value, so that the smallest negative (i.e., largest node) is popped first.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nInitialize:\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1) (assuming nodes are 1-based)\n\nsubtree_nodes = set()\n\nheap = []\n\nstart with node n. Push -n into the heap. Mark visited[n] = True.\n\nThen, for m = n -k steps. Wait, no. The number of nodes to select is m = n -k. We start with 1 node (the highest), and need to add (m-1) more nodes.\n\nSo, the loop runs (m-1) times. So:\n\ncount = 1\n\nwhile count < m:\n\n    extract the node with max value from the heap (i.e., pop the smallest negative value, which is the largest node)\n\n    if the node is already visited, skip.\n\n    else:\n\n        add to subtree_nodes, mark as visited, increment count.\n\n        for each neighbor in adjacency list of the node:\n\n            if not visited:\n\n                push -neighbor into heap.\n\nBut wait, the initial step is to push the first node (n) into the heap. Then, during the first iteration, we extract it. But since it's already visited, we skip. Then, we add its neighbors. Then, in the next steps, we extract the max.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The initial code:\n\nInitially, the starting node is n. We add it to the visited set. Then, we add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut the code starts with:\n\nheap = []\n\npush -n into heap.\n\nvisited[n] = True.\n\ncount = 1\n\nthen, for (m-1) times:\n\n    while heap is not empty:\n\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n        if not visited[current]:\n\n            visited[current] = True\n\n            count += 1\n\n            add to subtree.\n\n            for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n                if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n            break\n\n        else:\n\n            continue\n\nBut this is not correct. Because the heap may have multiple entries. So during each iteration of the loop, we need to extract elements from the heap until we find one that is not visited. However, this could take O(n) time in the worst case, leading to O(n^2) time. Which is not feasible for n up to 1e6.\n\nSo this approach may not be efficient enough. Because for each step, we may have to extract multiple elements from the heap until we find an unvisited one.\n\nBut how else can we manage this? Because the same node can be pushed multiple times into the heap. For example, a node may be pushed once when processing node A, and again when processing node B. However, when we extract it, if it's already visited, we skip it.\n\nBut in the worst case, each node is pushed multiple times into the heap. For example, in a star-shaped tree, where one central node is connected to all others. When building the subtree, the heap would have many entries, but most of them are duplicates.\n\nThis could lead to a lot of unnecessary operations. For example, in a star-shaped tree, the initial node is the highest. Then, all other nodes are pushed into the heap. Then, during the first step, we extract the highest node (say, 2nd highest), add it to the subtree. Then its neighbors (the central node) are already visited, so nothing added. Then, the next step would extract the next highest node (the third highest) from the heap, etc. But the heap could have O(n) entries, and for each step, popping the max would take O(log n) time.\n\nBut in the worst case, the number of operations on the heap would be O(n log n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e6.\n\nBut in practice, for Python, with n up to 1e6, and O(n log n) operations, it may be tight, but perhaps manageable.\n\nBut how to implement this correctly.\n\nLet me outline the code:\n\nimport heapq\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor _ in range(n-1):\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    adj[a].append(b)\n\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\nm = n - k\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\nheap = []\n\n# Start with node n\n\nheapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\ncount = 1\n\nwhile count < m:\n\n    # Extract nodes from heap until we find one not visited\n\n    while True:\n\n        if not heap:\n\n            break\n\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n        if not visited[current]:\n\n            break\n\n    # Now, current is the next node to add\n\n    visited[current] = True\n\n    count += 1\n\n    # Add its neighbors to the heap\n\n    for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nOnce this is done, the nodes that are not visited are the ones to be removed. So collect all nodes not in visited, sort them, and output.\n\nWait, but the visited array marks the nodes that are in the subtree. So the nodes to remove are those not in visited. So collect all nodes from 1 to n where visited[i] is False. Then sort them, and output the first k.\n\nBut wait, the number of nodes to remove is exactly k. Because m = n -k, so the number of unvisited nodes is k.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample, after processing, the visited array would be True for 6,5,2. The others are False, so the nodes to remove are 1,3,4. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's check for the case where the initial node is part of the subtree, and the heap has multiple entries.\n\nBut in code, the while loop inside the 'count < m' loop will extract the next node.\n\nBut in the code above, the 'while True' loop will pop elements from the heap until it finds one that is not visited. If the heap is empty, then it breaks, but that would imply that the tree is disconnected, which is impossible because the original graph is a tree. So the code should not reach that case.\n\nOnce the code has collected the visited nodes, the rest are the ones to remove.\n\nNow, let's test this code on the first sample.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3\n\nEdges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nAdjacency list for node 6 is [2,5], node 5 is [6], node 2 is [1,6,4,3], etc.\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitially, heap has -6. visited[6] = True. count is 1.\n\ncount < 3 (m is 3), so enter loop.\n\nExtract current = 6. It's already visited. So loop continues.\n\nWait, no. Wait in the code, the initial heap has -6. Then, the code enters the 'while True' loop. The first pop gives current = 6. Check if not visited. But visited[6] is True. So the code continues to pop from the heap. But the heap is empty now. So the code breaks. But then, what happens?\n\nWait no. The initial code is:\n\nAfter pushing -n (6) into the heap, and visited[6] is True. Then, count is 1, and the loop runs for count < m (3). So the code enters the loop.\n\nInside the loop:\n\nThe 'while True' loop checks the heap. The heap has -6. Pop it, current is 6. visited[current] is True. So the code continues to pop. But the heap is now empty. So the code breaks. Then, what happens?\n\nBut this is a problem. Because in this case, the code would not add any new nodes, and the count remains at 1. Which is less than m=3. So the code would crash.\n\nWait, this is a critical error. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because in the code, after pushing the starting node into the heap, we have to process the neighbors of the starting node. But in the code above, the initial code pushes the starting node into the heap, marks it as visited, but then during the first iteration of the loop (count < m), the code tries to extract a node from the heap. However, the starting node is already visited, and the heap is empty after popping it. So the code breaks, and the loop ends, leaving count=1 < m=3.\n\nBut this is wrong. What's the problem here?\n\nAh, the code's logic is incorrect. The starting node is already in the visited array, but we need to process its neighbors. The initial code does not add the neighbors of the starting node into the heap. Wait, no. Let's look back at the code:\n\nInitially, the code pushes the starting node (n) into the heap. Then, in the loop for count < m, the code enters the inner while loop. It pops the starting node (current = n), which is already visited. So the code continues popping until the heap is empty. But the code never adds the neighbors of the starting node into the heap. Because that code is only executed after the node is added to the subtree.\n\nWait, the code is missing that step. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nThe code starts with:\n\nheapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\ncount = 1\n\nThen, the code enters the while count < m loop. Inside this loop, the code tries to extract nodes from the heap. However, the initial heap has only the node n. After popping it, since it's already visited, the code continues popping until the heap is empty. Then, the code breaks out of the inner loop. But in this case, the code never processes the neighbors of the starting node.\n\nAh, this is a critical error. The code is missing the step where the starting node's neighbors are added to the heap. Because in the current code, the code only adds neighbors when a node is processed (i.e., when it's popped from the heap and added to the subtree). But the starting node is already in the subtree, and the code never adds its neighbors to the heap.\n\nSo the code is incorrect. The initial step should add the starting node's neighbors to the heap. But how?\n\nAh, the code is missing that. Let's think again.\n\nThe correct algorithm is:\n\nStart with the starting node (n) added to the subtree. Then, add its neighbors to the heap. Then, for each step, extract the max node from the heap, add to the subtree, and add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut in the code above, the code does not add the neighbors of the starting node to the heap. Because the code only adds the neighbors when a node is added to the subtree. But the starting node is already in the subtree, and thus, its neighbors need to be added to the heap.\n\nSo the code should, after pushing the starting node into the heap and marking it as visited, then add its neighbors to the heap. But how?\n\nWait, no. The code's logic is that when a node is added to the subtree, then its neighbors are added to the heap. But the starting node is already in the subtree. So after pushing it into the heap and marking it as visited, we need to add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut in the current code, that is not done. So the code needs to be modified.\n\nLet me think again about the algorithm steps.\n\nThe algorithm starts with the starting node (n) in the subtree. Then, we need to add all its neighbors to the heap. So after initializing the heap with the starting node, we need to process it (i.e., add its neighbors to the heap), but since it is already in the subtree, we don't add it again.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nAfter pushing the starting node into the heap, and marking it as visited, we need to add its neighbors to the heap. But how?\n\nAh, perhaps the code should be:\n\nInitially, the starting node is added to the subtree. Then, we add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut how to do this in the code.\n\nLet me modify the code:\n\nInitially:\n\nheap = []\n\npush -n into heap.\n\nvisited[n] = True.\n\ncount = 1\n\n# Now, add the neighbors of n to the heap.\n\nfor neighbor in adj[n]:\n\n    if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n        heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nThen, proceed with the loop.\n\nBut this is not part of the code I wrote earlier. So the code needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nOnce the starting node is added to the subtree, we need to add its neighbors to the heap. Then, during the loop, we extract the max from the heap, add to the subtree, and add their neighbors.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nAfter pushing the starting node into the heap and marking it as visited, we need to add its neighbors to the heap. But how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, during the initial setup, after adding the starting node to the subtree, we add its neighbors to the heap",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is to prioritize keeping the districts with the highest values since the number of fans grows exponentially with the district number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree, so there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Greedy Strategy**: To maximize the sum of fans, we should keep the districts with the highest numbers. However, they must form a connected subtree.\n3. **Max-Heap for Greedy Selection**: Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always select the next highest district that can be connected to the current subtree. This ensures that we build the largest possible subtree while maintaining connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        b = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n    \n    m = n - k\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    heap = []\n    \n    # Start with node n\n    start_node = n\n    heapq.heappush(heap, -start_node)\n    visited[start_node] = True\n    \n    # Add neighbors of the start node to the heap\n    for neighbor in adj[start_node]:\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n    \n    count = 1\n    while count < m:\n        # Extract nodes from heap until we find one not visited\n        current = -1\n        while True:\n            if not heap:\n                break\n            current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n            if not visited[current]:\n                break\n        if current == -1:\n            break  # This should not happen as the tree is connected\n        \n        visited[current] = True\n        count += 1\n        \n        # Add its neighbors to the heap\n        for neighbor in adj[current]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n    \n    # Collect all unvisited nodes\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(result))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an adjacency list representing the tree structure.\n2. **Initialization**: We start with the highest-numbered district (`n`) and push it into a max-heap (using negative values for Python's min-heap).\n3. **Greedy Selection**: Using a max-heap, we repeatedly extract the highest-numbered district that can be connected to the current subtree. Each time we add a district to the subtree, we also add its neighbors to the heap if they haven't been visited yet.\n4. **Result Collection**: After forming the required connected subtree of size `n - k`, we collect all districts not in this subtree, sort them, and print them.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by always selecting the highest possible districts while maintaining connectivity through the greedy use of a max-heap.",
