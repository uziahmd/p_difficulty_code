Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem statement first.\n\nSo, Leha wants to choose two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x days, and they don't overlap. And we need to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nThe input gives n vouchers, each with li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. The two vouchers must not intersect, meaning one ends before the other starts. So for two vouchers i and j, either ri < lj or rj < li.\n\nHmm. So the approach here is to find all pairs of vouchers where their durations sum to x, and they are non-overlapping, then find the minimum cost among those pairs.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, checking all possible pairs would be O(n²), which is way too slow. So we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think. For each voucher, if I can find another voucher that has a duration of (x - duration_i), and that doesn't overlap with it. Then, for each voucher, check if there exists a voucher with the required duration that comes after or before it.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the minimum cost for such vouchers?\n\nFirst, let's pre-process the vouchers by their duration. For each possible duration d, we can keep track of the minimum cost for vouchers of that duration. But also, for each voucher, we need to find vouchers of duration (x - d) that do not overlap with it.\n\nWait, but how to handle the non-overlapping condition?\n\nLet me think: For a given voucher A with duration d, we need to find a voucher B with duration (x - d) such that B ends before A starts (so B's ri < A's li) or A ends before B starts (A's ri < B's li). But since we are considering pairs, perhaps we can split into two cases:\n\nCase 1: Voucher B ends before voucher A starts. So B's ri < A's li.\n\nCase 2: Voucher A ends before voucher B starts. So A's ri < B's li.\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can look for vouchers B of duration (x - d_A) that end before A starts, or start after A ends.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nFor each voucher, compute its duration. Let's say the duration is d. Then the required duration for the other voucher is target = x - d. So, for each voucher with duration d, we need to find vouchers with duration target that are either completely before it or completely after it.\n\nSo, if we can, for each possible target duration, have some data structure that allows us to query the minimum cost of vouchers with that duration that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day.\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher, we can check for the target duration and find the minimal cost of vouchers that end before the current voucher's start, or start after the current voucher's end.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet's consider that for all vouchers of duration target, we can pre-process them in a way that allows us to quickly find the minimal cost of vouchers that end before a certain day (say, li of current voucher) or start after a certain day (ri of current voucher).\n\nSo, for example, for vouchers of duration t, we can sort them by their end day, and for each possible end day, have a prefix minimum. Similarly, sort them by their start day, and have a suffix minimum.\n\nWait, maybe. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we have all vouchers of duration t. Let's sort them by their end day. Then, for any given day L (like the start day of voucher A), we can find all vouchers in this group that end before L. Since they are sorted, we can binary search for the largest end day less than L. All such vouchers up to that index would end before L. The minimal cost among them can be found using a prefix minimum array.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case where we want vouchers that start after a certain day R (the end day of voucher A). If we sort the vouchers of duration t by their start day, then for a given R, we can find the first start day greater than R, and take the minimum cost from that point onwards. Again, a suffix minimum array would help here.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess for each possible duration t, the list of vouchers with that duration. For each such list, sort them by end day, and create a prefix min array. Also, sort them by start day, and create a suffix min array.\n\nThen, for each voucher A with duration d, compute target = x - d. If target is not present in the preprocessed data, skip. Otherwise, for the target duration, check two possibilities:\n\n1. Find the minimal cost of vouchers in target duration that end before A's li. This would be the case where voucher B ends before A starts.\n\n2. Find the minimal cost of vouchers in target duration that start after A's ri. This would be the case where voucher B starts after A ends.\n\nIf either of these exists, then combine with the current voucher's cost and keep track of the global minimum.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we perform two lookups (for the two cases) in the target duration's data structures.\n\nThis approach would be O(n log n) time, assuming that for each voucher, the binary searches and lookups are O(log m), where m is the number of vouchers with the target duration.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, we need to group all vouchers by their duration. So, create a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers (each voucher has li, ri, cost).\n\nBut for each duration, we need to have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end day (ri) for the prefix min.\n\n- Another sorted by start day (li) for the suffix min.\n\nWait, but for the first case (vouchers ending before A's li), we need to process the vouchers of target duration sorted by ri. Then, for a given li, find the largest ri that is less than li. All vouchers up to that index in the sorted list would end before li. The prefix min array can give the minimum cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (vouchers starting after A's ri), we need to process the vouchers of target duration sorted by li. Then, for a given ri, find the first li that is greater than ri. All vouchers from that index onwards in the sorted list would start after ri. The suffix min array can give the minimum cost from that index onwards.\n\nSo for each duration t, we can pre-process two sorted lists:\n\nsorted_by_end: list of (ri, cost) sorted by ri. Also, a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost in sorted_by_end[0..i].\n\nsorted_by_start: list of (li, cost) sorted by li. Also, a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost in sorted_by_start[i..end].\n\nWait, but for the sorted_by_end list, the actual vouchers are sorted by ri. For each voucher in that list, we can have a prefix min array that keeps track of the minimum cost up to that index. Similarly for the sorted_by_start list.\n\nSo, for example, when we have a list sorted by ri, the prefix min array would be built as follows: for each position i in the sorted list, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], current voucher's cost). This way, for any index j, the minimum cost in the first j+1 elements is prefix_min[j].\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_by_start list, the suffix_min array is built as follows: for each position i, suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], current voucher's cost). So, for any index i, the minimum cost from i to end is suffix_min[i].\n\nOnce these are preprocessed, for each voucher A, we can compute target = x - duration_A. If target is not in duration_dict, skip. Otherwise, for that target duration, check both cases:\n\nCase 1: Find the minimal cost in the target duration's sorted_by_end list where ri < A's li. How?\n\nWe can perform a binary search on the sorted_by_end list to find the largest ri that is less than A's li. Let's say the index is k. Then, if k >=0, the prefix_min[k] is the minimal cost for vouchers ending before A's li.\n\nCase 2: Find the minimal cost in the target duration's sorted_by_start list where li > A's ri. How?\n\nWe can perform a binary search on the sorted_by_start list to find the first li that is greater than A's ri. Let's say the index is m. Then, if m < len(sorted_by_start), the suffix_min[m] is the minimal cost for vouchers starting after A's ri.\n\nSo for each voucher, we check these two possibilities and take the minimum between them (if any), then add to the current voucher's cost and update the global minimum.\n\nBut there's a catch: the voucher A and the voucher B must be different. However, since we're considering all vouchers in the target duration, even if the voucher A itself is part of that target duration, but when we look for vouchers in the target duration, we need to make sure that the voucher B is not the same as voucher A. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, for example, if a voucher A has duration d, and target is x -d. Suppose that target equals d. Then, the voucher A could be part of the target duration. So when we check for vouchers in target duration, we need to ensure that we don't select the same voucher again. However, since we are looking for two different vouchers, the code needs to account for that.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, during the processing of voucher A, when we check for vouchers of duration target, which may include voucher A itself, but in that case, when we check for vouchers that end before A's li, or start after A's ri, we need to ensure that the voucher B is not A.\n\nBut how can that happen? For example, suppose voucher A has duration d, target is x -d. Suppose x -d is equal to d, so target = d. Then, voucher A is part of the target duration. Now, if we check for vouchers ending before A's li. Since A's ri is >= A's li, and the voucher B would need to end before A's li. So if voucher A is part of the target duration, but its ri is >= A's li, then voucher A cannot be part of the set of vouchers that end before A's li. Because A's ri is >= A's li, so the voucher A's ri is not less than A's li. Therefore, in this case, the voucher A would not be considered in the first case. Similarly for the second case. So, when we process voucher A, the voucher B is from the target duration, but not the same as A. Because in the case where target is d, and voucher A is part of the target duration, when we check for vouchers that end before A's li, voucher A can't be included. Similarly for the other case. Thus, the code can proceed without worrying about duplicates. Because when we process voucher A, the voucher B is from the target duration, but in the case where the voucher B is A, it would not satisfy the condition of ending before A's li or starting after A's ri. Hence, the code will not pick it. Therefore, the code is safe.\n\nBut wait, what if there's another voucher B that is same as voucher A? Like, same li, ri, cost. Well, the code would still work because even if voucher B is same as voucher A, the code would check for two different vouchers. But since the problem says i != j, but in this case, when we process voucher A, and there's another voucher B which is same as A (but different index), then the code would find it. However, in the case where there's only one voucher with that duration, then the code would not select it. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers grouped by their duration. For each duration, store two sorted lists (sorted by end and sorted by start), along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\n2. For each voucher in the list, compute its duration d. Compute target = x -d. If target is not in the duration_dict, skip. Else, for the target duration, check both cases (voucher B ends before A's li, and voucher B starts after A's ri).\n\n3. For each case, perform the binary search and get the minimal cost if possible. Combine with the current voucher's cost and update the global minimum.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nFor example, when x is 0? But according to the input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, no. The input says x is between 2 and 2e5. Wait, the problem says that x is the duration of Leha's vacation. The first line says \"n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5)\".\n\nWait, no. Looking back: the first line says \"n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105)\". So x can be as small as 2. So for example, if x is 2, then each voucher's duration must be 1 and 1. But the duration of a voucher is ri - li + 1. So for a voucher to have duration 1, ri must be equal to li. So, two vouchers with duration 1 that do not overlap.\n\nBut the code should handle that.\n\nAnother edge case is when two vouchers have exactly the required durations and are non-overlapping. Also, when there are multiple vouchers with the same duration, and we need to find the minimal cost.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplementing the grouping by duration:\n\nIn Python, we can use a dictionary, say from collections import defaultdict. For each duration, we have a list of vouchers. Then, for each duration, we sort the vouchers by their end day (ri) and create a prefix min array. Also, sort the vouchers by their start day (li) and create a suffix min array.\n\nBut how to create the prefix min array.\n\nFor example, for the sorted_by_end list:\n\nsorted_by_end is a list of tuples (ri, cost). Then, the prefix_min array is of the same length. prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][1]. For i>0, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][1]).\n\nSimilarly, for sorted_by_start, which is a list of (li, cost), sorted by li. The suffix_min array is built from the end. suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][1]. For i from len-2 down to 0: suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][1]).\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher A:\n\nd = ri_A - li_A + 1.\n\ntarget = x - d.\n\nif target is not in the duration_dict, skip.\n\nElse, for the target duration, check both cases:\n\nCase 1: find vouchers in target duration with ri < li_A.\n\nTo find the maximum ri in the sorted_by_end list that is < li_A.\n\nWe can perform a binary search on the sorted_by_end list's ri values. For example, in Python, using bisect_left or bisect_right.\n\nLet me think: sorted_ri is a list of the ri's of the vouchers in the target duration, sorted. For example, for the sorted_by_end list, we can have a list of ri's. Then, using bisect_left to find the insertion point of li_A. The index would be the number of elements less than li_A. So, if the insertion point is k, then all elements before index k have ri < li_A.\n\nSo, if k is 0, there are none. Else, the minimal cost is prefix_min[k-1].\n\nCase 2: find vouchers in target duration with li > ri_A.\n\nFor the sorted_by_start list, which is sorted by li. We can perform a bisect_right to find the first li that is greater than ri_A. The index m is the first such element. Then, if m is less than the length of the list, the suffix_min[m] is the minimal cost for vouchers starting after ri_A.\n\nSo, for example, using bisect.bisect_right on the list of li's of sorted_by_start. Let me think:\n\nsorted_li is a list of the li's of the target duration's vouchers, sorted in ascending order.\n\nWe want to find the first index m where sorted_li[m] > ri_A.\n\nbisect.bisect_right returns the insertion point for ri_A in the list. So, all elements before that index are <= ri_A. The elements from index m onwards are > ri_A.\n\nSo, if m is the result of bisect_right, then the minimal cost is the suffix_min[m] if m < len(sorted_li).\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, for each duration t in duration_dict, we need to have:\n\nsorted_by_end: list of (ri, cost), sorted by ri. Also, a list of ri's for binary search.\n\nprefix_min array.\n\nsorted_by_start: list of (li, cost), sorted by li. Also, a list of li's for binary search.\n\nsuffix_min array.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration in duration_dict:\n\n- Sort the vouchers by ri, create sorted_by_end list, and a list of ri's (for binary search). Also compute prefix_min.\n\n- Sort the vouchers by li, create sorted_by_start list, and a list of li's. Also compute suffix_min.\n\nSo, for example, for the target duration, we can have:\n\nsorted_ri_list = [voucher[0] for voucher in sorted_by_end]\n\nsorted_li_list = [voucher[0] for voucher in sorted_by_start]\n\nNow, in code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the grouping.\n\nLet me think of code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, each with li, ri, cost.\n\nCompute for each voucher, duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup all vouchers by their duration. For example, using a defaultdict(list). So:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor each voucher in input:\n\n    li, ri, cost = ... \n\n    duration = ri - li + 1\n\n    duration_dict[duration].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict, process the list to create the sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start structures, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nBut for each duration, we need to process:\n\nsorted_by_end: sort the vouchers by ri. Then, create a list of ri's, and a prefix_min array of costs.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start: sort by li, create list of li's, and suffix_min array of costs.\n\nSo for example, for a duration t:\n\nvouchers = duration_dict[t]\n\nsorted_by_end_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])  # sorted by ri\n\nsorted_ri = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end_vouchers]\n\nprefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_end_vouchers)\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end_vouchers[0][2]\n\nfor i in range(1, len(prefix_min)):\n\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end_vouchers[i][2])\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start_vouchers:\n\nsorted_by_start_vouchers = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nsorted_li = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start_vouchers]\n\nsuffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start_vouchers)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start_vouchers[-1][2]\n\nfor i in range(len(suffix_min)-2, -1, -1):\n\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start_vouchers[i][2])\n\nBut storing all these for each duration would take some memory, but given that n is up to 2e5, it's manageable.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher in the original list, process as follows:\n\ncurrent voucher has li, ri, cost. duration = ri - li + 1.\n\ntarget = x - duration.\n\nif target not in duration_dict: continue.\n\nelse:\n\n    process the target duration's sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start.\n\n    case1: find min cost in target duration where ri < current li.\n\n    case2: find min cost in target duration where li > current ri.\n\n    if case1 exists, candidate1 = current cost + case1_min.\n\n    if case2 exists, candidate2 = current cost + case2_min.\n\n    take the min between candidate1 and candidate2, and update the global answer.\n\nSo, for case1:\n\nwe need to get the sorted_ri list for target duration's sorted_by_end_vouchers.\n\nWe perform a bisect_left on sorted_ri for current_li (li of current voucher). Let's say the index is k. So the number of elements less than current_li is k. So if k > 0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min[k-1].\n\nSimilarly for case2: perform a bisect_right on sorted_li (of target duration's sorted_by_start_vouchers) for current_ri (ri of current voucher). The index is m. If m < len(sorted_li), then the minimal cost is suffix_min[m].\n\nBut how to get the sorted_ri and sorted_li for the target duration?\n\nWe need to pre-process for each duration, the sorted_ri and sorted_li, along with prefix_min and suffix_min.\n\nThus, perhaps during preprocessing, for each duration, we can store:\n\nfor each duration t, a tuple (sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min).\n\nBut how to store that. Maybe create another dictionary, say, preprocessed_data, which for each duration t, stores:\n\npreprocessed_data[t] = (sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min)\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\npreprocessed_data = {}\n\nfor t in duration_dict:\n\n    vouchers = duration_dict[t]\n\n    # process sorted_by_end\n\n    sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n    sorted_ri = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n\n    prefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_end)\n\n    prefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(prefix_min)):\n\n        prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i][2])\n\n    # process sorted_by_start\n\n    sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    sorted_li = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n\n    suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n\n    suffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(suffix_min)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_by_start[i][2])\n\n    # store in preprocessed_data\n\n    preprocessed_data[t] = (sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min)\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher, when target is found, we can get the sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min for the target duration.\n\nNow, during the processing of each voucher, we can do:\n\nfor voucher in all_vouchers:\n\n    li, ri, cost = voucher\n\n    duration = ri - li + 1\n\n    target = x - duration\n\n    if target not in preprocessed_data:\n\n        continue\n\n    # process case1: find vouchers with duration target, ri < li\n\n    sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min = preprocessed_data[target]\n\n    # case1: find in sorted_ri\n\n    # use bisect_left to find insertion point of li in sorted_ri\n\n    import bisect\n\n    k = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_ri, li)\n\n    if k > 0:\n\n        min_case1 = prefix_min[k-1]\n\n        current_total = cost + min_case1\n\n        update the global minimum.\n\n    # case2: find vouchers with li > ri\n\n    # use bisect_right on sorted_li for ri\n\n    m = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_li, ri)\n\n    if m < len(sorted_li):\n\n        min_case2 = suffix_min[m]\n\n        current_total = cost + min_case2\n\n        update the global minimum.\n\nBut wait, the sorted_li is the list of li's of the target duration's sorted_by_start_vouchers. So, for case2, we want to find the first index where li > ri of current voucher. So, bisect_right finds the insertion point of ri in the sorted_li, which is the first element larger than ri. So m is that index. If m is within the list, then the suffix_min[m] is the minimal cost.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the target duration is same as current voucher's duration? For example, if x is 2*d, then target is d. But the code handles that, as discussed earlier.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple vouchers with the same duration and same li/ri. But the code handles that, since it's looking for the minimal cost.\n\nNow, the code needs to collect all possible candidates and find the minimal.\n\nNow, the initial value for the answer can be set to infinity. After processing all vouchers, if the answer is still infinity, output -1, else output the answer.\n\nBut what about when there are two vouchers that are non-overlapping and sum to x. For example, voucher A and voucher B. When processing voucher A, we find voucher B. When processing voucher B, we find voucher A. So the code will process both possibilities. But since we are taking the minimum, it's okay. The code will find both possibilities and take the minimum.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo x is 5. So for each voucher:\n\nVoucher 1: duration 3. target is 5-3=2. So check for vouchers with duration 2.\n\npreprocessed_data for target=2:\n\nsorted_by_end: vouchers with duration 2. Let's see:\n\noriginal vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher2: li=1, ri=2, cost5.\n\nvoucher3: li=5, ri=6, cost1.\n\nvoucher4: li=1, ri=2, cost4.\n\nsorted_by_end is sorted by ri. So all have ri=2 or 6. So sorted by ri, the order is voucher2, voucher4 (both ri=2?), then voucher3 (ri=6). Wait, voucher2 and voucher4 have ri=2. So sorted_by_end would be sorted by ri, which is same for voucher2 and voucher4. So their order depends on their li? No, the sorted_by_end is sorted by ri, and if same ri, then their order may vary. But the prefix_min will take care of the minimal cost.\n\nSo sorted_by_end would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)] ?\n\nWait, no. The vouchers for duration 2 are voucher2 (li=1, ri=2, cost5), voucher3 (li=5, ri=6, cost1), voucher4 (li=1, ri=2, cost4). So sorted by ri, the first two have ri=2, the third has ri=6. So the sorted_by_end would be sorted by ri, then by li? Or just by ri. So the sorted_by_end list would have the vouchers with ri=2 first, but their order between them depends on how the sort is done. However, since the prefix_min is built as the minimum up to that index, the order between them doesn't matter as long as the prefix_min is computed correctly.\n\nFor example, if the sorted_by_end is [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3], then the prefix_min would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1].\n\nSimilarly, sorted_li for the sorted_by_start would be sorted by li. So voucher2 and voucher4 have li=1, voucher3 has li=5. So sorted_by_start would be [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3], sorted by li. Then the suffix_min would be [min(5,4,1) = 1, min(4,1)=1, 1].\n\nNow, when processing voucher1 (li=1, ri=3, cost=4). Its duration is 3, target is 2.\n\nCase1: find vouchers with duration 2 that end before li=1. So ri < 1. But the vouchers in target duration have ri=2, 2, 6. All are >=1, so no such vouchers. So case1 is not possible.\n\nCase2: find vouchers with duration 2 that start after ri=3. So li > 3. The sorted_li is [1,1,5]. bisect_right(sorted_li, 3) would return 2 (since 3 is between 1 and 5). So m=2. suffix_min[2] is 1. So case2 gives 4 + 1 = 5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo this is captured.\n\nNow, when processing voucher3 (li=5, ri=6, cost=1). Its duration is 2. target is 5-2=3. So check for vouchers with duration 3. Which is voucher1 (duration 3). So preprocessed_data for duration 3.\n\nsorted_ri for duration 3 is [3], prefix_min [4].\n\nsorted_li for duration 3 is [1], suffix_min [4].\n\nCase1: find vouchers with duration 3 that end before voucher3's li=5. So ri < 5. The sorted_ri is [3], which is <5. So k = bisect_left([3], 5) is 1. So k>0, so prefix_min[0] is 4. So case1 is 1+4=5. Which is valid.\n\nCase2: find vouchers with duration 3 that start after voucher3's ri=6. So li >6. The sorted_li is [1], bisect_right([1], 6) returns 1, which is >= len(sorted_li) (which is 1). So no case2.\n\nThus, this pair is found when processing voucher3, adding 1+4=5.\n\nThus, the code would capture this.\n\nSo the code seems to work for the sample.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut what about the initial setup?\n\nImplementing this:\n\nBut for the code, we need to read the input, process all vouchers, and for each voucher, check the two cases.\n\nBut in Python, for the bisect module, we need to import bisect.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines, storing all vouchers as a list.\n\nThen group by duration.\n\nThen preprocess for each duration.\n\nThen for each voucher, process as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the preprocessed_data, we need to process each duration.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n    \n    # Group vouchers by duration\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[duration].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n    \n    # Preprocess data for each duration\n    preprocessed_data = dict()\n    for duration in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[duration]\n        # Process sorted_by_end (sorted by ri)\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_ri = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        # compute prefix_min\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_by_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n        # Process sorted_by_start (sorted by li)\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_li = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        # compute suffix_min\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_by_start))):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        # store in preprocessed_data\n        preprocessed_data[duration] = (sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        target = x - duration\n        if target not in preprocessed_data:\n            continue\n        # Get the preprocessed data for target\n        sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min = preprocessed_data[target]\n        # Case 1: find vouchers with ri < li (current voucher's li)\n        # Use bisect_left on sorted_ri\n        k = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_ri, li)\n        if k > 0:\n            case1 = prefix_min[k-1]\n            min_total = min( min_total, cost + case1 )\n        # Case 2: find vouchers with li > ri (current voucher's ri)\n        # Use bisect_right on sorted_li\n        m = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_li, ri)\n        if m < len(sorted_li):\n            case2 = suffix_min[m]\n            min_total = min( min_total, cost + case2 )\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print( min_total )\n\nBut wait, in the code above, during the preprocessing of the prefix_min and suffix_min, there's a mistake. Let me check.\n\nFor the prefix_min:\n\nInitially, min_so_far is set to infinity. Then for each v in sorted_by_end, min_so_far is min of previous and current. But the first v would set min_so_far to its cost. Then the next ones compare.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code above, for the prefix_min, the code is:\n\nprefix_min = []\nmin_so_far = float('inf')\nfor v in sorted_by_end:\n    min_so_far = min( min_so_far, v[2] )\n    prefix_min.append( min_so_far )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor the suffix_min:\n\nsorted_by_start is sorted by li.\n\nsuffix_min is a list where suffix_min[i] is the min cost from i to end.\n\nInitially, min_so_far is set to infinity. Then for i in reversed(range(...)):\n\nmin_so_far = min( min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2] )\n\nand suffix_min[i] = min_so_far.\n\nYes. That's correct.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4\n\n1 2 5\n\n5 6 1\n\n1 2 4\n\nThe vouchers are:\n\nvoucher0: (1,3,4) duration 3.\n\nvoucher1: (1,2,5) duration 2.\n\nvoucher2: (5,6,1) duration 2.\n\nvoucher3: (1,2,4) duration 2.\n\npreprocessed_data for duration 2:\n\nsorted_by_end is sorted by ri. The vouchers with duration 2 are vouchers1,2,3. Their ri are 2,6,2. So sorted by ri, the order would be vouchers1 (ri=2), voucher3 (ri=2), voucher2 (ri=6). So sorted_ri is [2, 2, 6].\n\nprefix_min for these is:\n\nvoucher1's cost is 5, then min(5,4)=4, then min(4, 1) =1. So prefix_min is [5,4,1].\n\nsorted_by_start is sorted by li. The vouchers have li 1, 5, 1. So sorted_by_start would be vouchers1 (li=1), voucher3 (li=1), voucher2 (li=5). So sorted_li is [1,1,5].\n\nsuffix_min is computed from the end:\n\nfor i=2 (voucher2, cost 1): min_so_far is 1. suffix_min[2] =1.\n\ni=1 (voucher3, cost4): min(4, 1) is 1. suffix_min[1] =1.\n\ni=0 (voucher1, cost5): min(5, 1) is 1. suffix_min[0] =1.\n\nSo suffix_min is [1,1,1].\n\nNow, when processing voucher0 (li=1, ri=3, cost=4). target is 5-3=2.\n\nsorted_ri is [2,2,6], prefix_min [5,4,1].\n\ncase1: bisect_left on sorted_ri for li=1. The sorted_ri is [2,2,6]. bisect_left finds the first element >=1. Since all elements are >=1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches Leha's vacation duration, and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently searching for valid voucher pairs using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in quickly accessing vouchers of a specific duration when needed.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, preprocess the vouchers to sort them by their end day and start day. Additionally, create prefix minimum arrays for sorted end days and suffix minimum arrays for sorted start days. These arrays help in quickly finding the minimum cost of vouchers that meet specific criteria.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, determine the required complementary duration. Use binary search on the preprocessed data to find the minimum cost of valid non-overlapping vouchers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Group vouchers by duration\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess data for each duration\n    preprocessed_data = dict()\n    for duration in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_list = duration_dict[duration]\n        # Process sorted_by_end (sorted by ri)\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_ri = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_end]\n        # compute prefix_min\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_by_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        # Process sorted_by_start (sorted by li)\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_li = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_start]\n        # compute suffix_min\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in reversed(range(len(sorted_by_start))):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_by_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        # store in preprocessed_data\n        preprocessed_data[duration] = (sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        target = x - duration\n        if target not in preprocessed_data:\n            continue\n        # Get the preprocessed data for target\n        sorted_ri, prefix_min, sorted_li, suffix_min = preprocessed_data[target]\n        # Case 1: find vouchers with ri < li (current voucher's li)\n        k = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_ri, li)\n        if k > 0:\n            case1 = prefix_min[k-1]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost + case1)\n        # Case 2: find vouchers with li > ri (current voucher's ri)\n        m = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_li, ri)\n        if m < len(sorted_li):\n            case2 = suffix_min[m]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost + case2)\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate quick access when checking for complementary durations.\n2. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end day and start day.
