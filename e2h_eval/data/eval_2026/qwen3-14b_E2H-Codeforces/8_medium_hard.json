Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The key points are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So, it's like a conservation of flow.\n2. The source has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The resulting directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nWait, but how do I ensure that? Also, the given ci values are already the flow amounts for each edge, so we just need to assign directions such that the flow is valid and maximum.\n\nLet me think. Since the original graph is undirected, but the flow is already determined (the ci's are given as part of the max flow), we need to find a direction for each edge that satisfies the flow conservation and acyclicity.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nFirst, considering the flow conservation. For each node except 1 and n, the total inflow equals outflow. For node 1, all edges must be outgoing (since no incoming). For node n, all edges must be incoming (since the sink can't have outgoing edges in a max flow, but maybe that's not necessarily the case? Wait, the problem says that the flow is a maximum flow. So the sink can have outgoing edges, but the flow is such that the total flow into the sink equals the maximum flow. However, in our case, since the flow is already fixed (ci's are given), we need to assign directions such that the flow is valid.\n\nBut perhaps the way to model this is to think of the flow as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that for each node except source and sink, the net flow is zero.\n\nSo, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of the flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\nThis seems similar to finding an Euler tour, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph with certain constraints. The key here is that the graph must be acyclic. So, perhaps we can arrange the directions such that the directed graph forms a DAG, which would automatically satisfy the acyclicity condition.\n\nMoreover, since the graph is connected and we need to assign directions, maybe we can construct a DAG where all edges are directed in a way that follows some topological order.\n\nWait, but how to ensure the flow conservation?\n\nAnother thought: The flow conservation implies that the sum of flows going into a node (except source and sink) must equal the sum going out. Which is equivalent to saying that the net flow at each such node is zero. So, if we model the problem as a flow network, then the direction of each edge must be such that the flow is feasible.\n\nBut since the flow is already given (the ci's), the direction determines whether the flow is going through the edge in one direction or the other.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's consider that for each edge between u and v, if we direct it from u to v, then the flow contributes +ci to u's outflow and +ci to v's inflow. Conversely, if directed from v to u, it contributes +ci to v's outflow and +ci to u's inflow.\n\nNow, for each node v (other than 1 and n), the total inflow must equal the total outflow. Which means that the sum over all edges adjacent to v of (ci if directed into v) equals sum over edges adjacent to v of (ci if directed out of v). Which simplifies to: the sum of ci for edges directed into v equals the sum of ci for edges directed out of v. Therefore, for each such node v, the total sum of ci of edges adjacent to v must be even? No, wait. Because the sum of inflow equals the sum of outflow. So, the total sum of all flows adjacent to v (inflow + outflow) is twice the inflow (since inflow equals outflow). But the sum of all flows adjacent to v is fixed (sum of ci for all edges connected to v). Let me denote this as S_v. Then, since inflow = outflow, S_v must be equal to 2 * inflow. Therefore, S_v must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so perhaps the input ensures that this holds for all nodes except source and sink.\n\nWait, but the source and sink can have any sum. For example, the source has all edges directed out, so the sum of flows from the source is the total flow. The sink has all edges directed into it, so the sum of flows into the sink is the total flow. But for the other nodes, their sum must be even.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution, so we don't need to check that.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning directions to edges such that for each node except 1 and n, the sum of inflows equals the sum of outflows. And the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nNow, how to model this? One approach is to model this as a flow problem again. But perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAnother idea: The problem requires that the directed graph is acyclic. So, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order, and direct all edges according to that order. But how to ensure the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the graph as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with edges directed in such a way that they follow a topological order. Then, for each node, the inflow equals outflow. How to find such a direction.\n\nWait, but the flow conservation condition may require that for each node (except 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges directed into it equals the sum on edges directed out. Which can be rewritten as the sum of flows on edges directed into it minus the sum of flows directed out of it is zero. Which is equivalent to the net flow at the node being zero.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe we can model this as a flow problem where each node (except 1 and n) has a balance of zero, and the source has a balance of -total_flow (since all edges are outgoing) and the sink has a balance of +total_flow (all edges are incoming). But how to find the direction of edges.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as constructing a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the net flow at each node is correct.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: For each node v (excluding 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges entering v must equal the sum of flows on edges leaving v. Let's denote for each node v, the total flow of edges connected to it as T_v. Then, for each such node, the sum of flows entering is equal to sum of flows leaving. Thus, T_v must be equal to 2 * sum_entering. Which implies that T_v must be even. But the problem states that a solution exists, so this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to assign directions. Let's think of the problem as building a directed graph where the net flow for each node (except source and sink) is zero.\n\nBut how to model this. It's similar to an Eulerian trail, but in this case, the graph is not necessarily Eulerian. Wait, but for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows entering equals the sum of flows leaving. Which is exactly the condition for an Eulerian trail, but only if the in-degree and out-degree are balanced. However, here the flows are not about degrees but about the sum of the flow values.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model this as a flow network where each edge can be directed in either direction, and we need to assign directions such that for each node (except 1 and n) the net flow is zero.\n\nBut how to find such directions.\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's construct a directed graph where the directions of edges are determined based on a spanning tree. For example, build a spanning tree of the graph, and direct all edges in the tree away from the root (source?), and then handle the remaining edges. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's imagine that we have a topological order of the nodes, where the source (node 1) comes first, and the sink (node n) comes last. Then, all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes in the topological order. This ensures that the graph is acyclic.\n\nIf we can find such a topological order and assign directions accordingly, then the acyclicity condition is satisfied. Now, the question is: can we choose such a topological order such that the flow conservation conditions are satisfied?\n\nBut how to find this order.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows entering v must equal the sum of flows leaving. If we have a topological order, then for each node v (except the source and sink), the edges directed into v come from nodes before v in the order, and edges directed out go to nodes after v in the order. However, the sum of flows entering v (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows leaving v (to later nodes).\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a flow problem where we need to find a directed graph with the given constraints, and then find a topological order.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to model this as a directed graph where each node has a certain 'balance' of flow. For example, for each node except 1 and n, the total flow entering equals the total flow leaving. For node 1, all edges must be directed away (so the total flow leaving is the total flow of all edges connected to it). For node n, all edges must be directed towards it (so the total flow entering is the sum of all edges connected to it).\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe we can model this as a problem of finding a directed graph where each node has a certain required net flow. For example, the source has a net outflow of total_flow (sum of all edges connected to it), and the sink has a net inflow of total_flow. All other nodes have net inflow zero.\n\nBut how to find such a directed graph. This seems like a flow problem again, but perhaps we can model it as a circulation problem with demands.\n\nWait, but the problem is already given that the flow is maximum. So perhaps the sum of flows for the edges connected to the source is equal to the maximum flow value. Similarly for the sink.\n\nBut how does this help us in assigning directions.\n\nAnother approach: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's say we have a topological order where node 1 is first, node n is last. Then, for each node in the order, we can process its edges and decide the direction.\n\nBut how to ensure that the flow conservation is met. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a node v in the topological order (after node 1, before node n). For all edges between v and nodes that come before it in the order, we can direct them towards v (but that would contribute to inflow) or away from v (contributing to outflow). Similarly for edges to nodes that come after v.\n\nBut how to choose directions so that the inflow equals outflow for v.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed acyclic graph with edges directed according to the topological order. Then, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows from edges directed into v (from earlier nodes) plus the sum of flows from edges directed into v (from later nodes) must equal the sum of flows directed out of v (to later nodes) plus the sum of flows directed out of v (to earlier nodes). Wait, but in a topological order, edges cannot go from later to earlier. So all edges between v and nodes before it are directed from earlier to v (inflow), and edges between v and nodes after are directed from v to later (outflow). So for node v, the inflow is sum of flows of edges from earlier nodes to v, and the outflow is sum of flows of edges from v to later nodes. Then, for flow conservation, these two sums must be equal.\n\nBut how to choose the topological order so that this is possible.\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps we can construct the topological order in such a way that for each node, the difference between the sum of flows to nodes before it and the sum of flows to nodes after it is zero. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has inflow equal to outflow. We can model this as a system of equations. But solving this for large n (up to 2e5) is computationally impossible unless we find a clever way.\n\nAnother idea: Since the graph is connected and we need to assign directions, perhaps we can perform a DFS traversal and assign directions based on the traversal. For example, during a DFS, when we visit a node, we can direct the edges from parent to child, ensuring that the graph is a tree with back edges directed appropriately. However, this might not satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed according to a BFS or DFS tree. But again, the flow conservation is unclear.\n\nWait, but what if we model this as a directed graph where each node has a certain 'potential' and the direction of the edge depends on the potentials. For example, if the potential of u is less than that of v, then the edge is directed from u to v. This would make the graph acyclic if the potentials are assigned in a way that forms a DAG.\n\nBut how to assign potentials such that the flow conservation conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation again. For a node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum on edges directed out of v. Let's denote for each edge (u, v), if the direction is u→v, then the flow contributes to the outflow of u and inflow of v. If the direction is v→u, it contributes to outflow of v and inflow of u.\n\nSo for node v, the inflow is sum_{edges directed into v} c_i, and the outflow is sum_{edges directed out of v} c_i. The condition is inflow = outflow.\n\nLet me denote for each node v, the total sum of flows on edges adjacent to it as S_v. Then, for node v (not 1 or n), inflow = outflow. So, inflow + outflow = S_v = 2 * inflow → inflow = S_v / 2.\n\nThus, for each node v (not 1 or n), the inflow is exactly half of S_v. So, the problem reduces to assigning directions to the edges such that for each such node v, the sum of the flows of edges directed into v is S_v / 2.\n\nSo, how to compute this? It's like a problem of choosing directions for edges so that each node v (not 1 or n) has exactly S_v/2 of the flow directed into it.\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where we need to find a subset of edges incident to v that sum to S_v/2. However, since the edges are undirected, the choice of direction affects multiple nodes.\n\nBut how to find such a subset for all nodes simultaneously.\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled as a flow network. For example, imagine that we need to select for each edge a direction, and for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows directed into it is exactly S_v/2.\n\nBut how to model this as a flow problem.\n\nLet me think of each edge as a variable that can contribute to the inflow of its endpoints. For example, if an edge between u and v is directed from u to v, then it contributes c to the outflow of u and inflow of v. If it's directed the other way, it contributes c to the outflow of v and inflow of u.\n\nBut since the inflow of u must be S_u / 2, and similarly for other nodes, this seems like a system of equations.\n\nBut solving this system directly is not feasible for large n and m.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the graph is connected, perhaps we can construct a directed spanning tree rooted at node 1, and assign directions based on the tree. Then, for the non-tree edges, assign directions in a way that maintains the flow conservation.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the spanning tree. Suppose we have a spanning tree where all edges are directed away from the root (node 1). Then, for each node in the tree, the inflow would be the sum of flows from its parent, and the outflow would be the sum of flows to its children. However, this may not satisfy the flow conservation conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform a DFS traversal and assign directions based on the traversal, adjusting the flows as needed.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the concept of Eulerian trails. For each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows into it must equal the sum of flows out. So, the difference between the sum of flows into the node and out of the node must be zero. For the source, it's the sum of flows out minus sum of flows in, which is the total flow. For the sink, it's the sum of flows in minus sum of flows out, which is the total flow.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the problem as a flow network where each edge can carry flow in either direction. But since the flow is already given (the ci's), we just need to choose the direction.\n\nAnother thought: For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges incident to v is S_v. We need to choose directions so that exactly S_v / 2 of that sum is directed into v. So, for each such node, the total amount of flow directed into it must be S_v / 2.\n\nThis looks like a problem of finding for each node a subset of its edges whose sum is S_v / 2. However, since edges are shared between nodes, this is a global problem.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a problem of finding a directed graph where for each node v, the sum of flows directed into it is exactly S_v / 2.\n\nNow, how to find such directions. Here's an idea: start by building a directed graph where we have a directed spanning tree from the source to the sink. Then, for each node, we can adjust the directions of edges to meet the inflow requirements.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where the inflow into each node (except 1 and n) is S_v / 2. We can model this as a flow problem where we need to route certain amounts of flow into each node.\n\nLet me try to think of it as a flow problem. Suppose we create a new graph where each edge can be used in either direction. For each node v (not 1 or n), we need to have exactly S_v / 2 units of flow directed into it. This is equivalent to saying that the net flow at node v is zero. For the source, the net flow is -total_flow (since all edges are outgoing), and for the sink it's +total_flow.\n\nThis sounds exactly like a flow problem where we have to find a flow that satisfies certain demands. However, since the edges are undirected and can be used in either direction, but with fixed capacities (the ci's), perhaps we can model this as a flow network where each edge has capacity ci, and we need to find a flow that meets the demands.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the flow is already given (the ci's are the flow values). So, the flow is fixed, and we just need to assign directions. So, the flow is not something we can choose; it's given. So, the problem is to find a direction for each edge so that the flow is valid.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of variables. For each edge between u and v, we can assign a variable d_uv which is +1 if the direction is u→v, and -1 if it's v→u. Then, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum over all edges incident to v of (d_uv * c_uv) must be zero. Because the net flow into v is zero.\n\nFor example, for each edge (u, v), if it's directed from u to v, then it contributes +c_uv to the outflow of u and +c_uv to the inflow of v. The net contribution to node v is +c_uv (inflow). If it's directed from v to u, it contributes +c_uv to the outflow of v and inflow of u, so the net contribution to node v is -c_uv.\n\nSo, the equation for node v (not 1 or n) is sum_{edges incident to v} (direction_contribution) = 0. Where direction_contribution is +c for edges directed into v, and -c for edges directed out of v.\n\nWhich is the same as sum_{edges incident to v} (direction_contribution) = 0. So, for each node v (not 1 or n), sum_{edges incident to v} (direction_contribution) = 0.\n\nBut how to solve this system of equations. Since each edge is involved in two equations (for its two endpoints), and the variables are the directions (which can be ±1).\n\nBut solving this for large n and m is not straightforward. However, the problem says that a solution exists, so perhaps we can find a way to construct it.\n\nAnother observation: The sum of all equations for the nodes (except 1 and n) will be zero. Because each edge contributes to exactly two nodes. For example, if an edge between u and v is directed from u to v, then it contributes +c to v's equation and -c to u's equation. So, the sum of all equations is zero. Which is consistent with the fact that the sum of all equations for the nodes (including 1 and n) would be sum (net flow) = total flow (from source) - total flow (to sink) = 0, since it's a maximum flow.\n\nBut how to proceed.\n\nLet me think about the following approach: \n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph where we want to assign directions to edges such that the net flow at each node (except 1 and n) is zero. This is similar to finding an Eulerian orientation for the graph, but with weights.\n\nIn an Eulerian orientation, each node has equal in-degree and out-degree. But here, it's about the weighted in-flow and out-flow.\n\nSo, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows into it equals the sum of flows out of it. This is similar to having a directed graph where each node has a balance of zero.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation. One possible way is to model this as a flow problem where we need to find a flow that satisfies the balance conditions. But since the flow values are fixed (the ci's), it's more like finding a direction for each edge that satisfies the balance.\n\nLet me think of this as a system of equations. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows directed into v is equal to the sum directed out. Which is equivalent to:\n\nsum_{edges incident to v} (direction_contribution) = 0.\n\nBut this is a system of equations. However, solving this system directly is not feasible for large n and m.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the graph is connected and we need to assign directions, perhaps we can use a DFS-based approach to assign directions while maintaining the balance.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Start with node 1 (the source). All edges connected to node 1 must be directed away from it. So, for each edge between 1 and another node u, we direct it from 1 to u. This contributes to the outflow of node 1 and inflow of u.\n\n- For each other node v, we can track the current imbalance. Initially, the imbalance for node 1 is the sum of flows on its edges (since all are outgoing). For other nodes, their initial imbalance depends on the edges directed so far.\n\n- As we traverse the graph, we can adjust the direction of edges to balance the nodes.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a node v that currently has an imbalance. We can find an edge connecting v to another node u, and reverse the direction of that edge to adjust the imbalance.\n\nBut this sounds like a greedy approach, and may work if we process the nodes in a certain order.\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where we can adjust the directions to balance the nodes. For example, starting with node 1, and processing nodes in a certain order.\n\nHere's an outline of the algorithm:\n\n1. Compute for each node v, S_v = sum of ci of edges incident to v.\n\n2. For the source node 1, the required inflow is zero (since all edges are outgoing). For the sink node n, required inflow is S_n (since all edges are incoming). For other nodes, required inflow is S_v / 2.\n\n3. We can model this as a flow problem where each node has a demand (required inflow). For example:\n\n   - Node 1: demand is 0 (inflow is zero).\n   - Node n: demand is S_n (inflow is S_n).\n   - Other nodes: demand is S_v / 2.\n\n   However, since the sum of all demands must be equal to the total flow from the source to the sink. Let's see:\n\n   Total inflow across all nodes is sum_{v} demand_v.\n\n   For node 1: 0.\n\n   For other nodes (not n): sum (S_v / 2).\n\n   For node n: S_n.\n\n   The total sum is sum (S_v / 2 for v not 1 or n) + S_n.\n\n   But each edge is counted twice in the sum of S_v (once for each endpoint). So sum S_v for all v is 2 * sum of all edge ci's.\n\n   Let's compute the total demand:\n\n   sum_{v} demand_v = 0 + sum_{v ≠1, n} (S_v / 2) + S_n.\n\n   Let me think of the sum of all S_v:\n\n   sum S_v = 2 * total_flow (since each edge is counted twice).\n\n   So, sum_{v ≠1, n} S_v = 2 * total_flow - S_1 - S_n.\n\n   Therefore, sum_{v ≠1, n} (S_v / 2) = (2 * total_flow - S_1 - S_n) / 2.\n\n   Adding S_n gives:\n\n   total_demand = (2 * total_flow - S_1 - S_n)/2 + S_n = (2 * total_flow - S_1 - S_n + 2 S_n) / 2 = (2 * total_flow - S_1 + S_n)/2.\n\n   But what is the total flow? Well, the maximum flow from source to sink is equal to the sum of flows on edges leaving the source (since all edges from the source are outgoing). Or is it the sum of flows into the sink?\n\n   Actually, the total flow is the sum of flows from the source to the sink. In the maximum flow scenario, this is equal to the sum of flows on edges leaving the source (since the source has no incoming edges). So, total_flow = sum of flows on edges incident to source, since all are outgoing.\n\n   Let me denote total_flow as F = sum of flows on edges incident to source.\n\n   Then, the total_demand should be equal to F (since the sink's demand is F, and others are zero except for the sum of their demands). Let's check:\n\n   total_demand = (2F - S_1 + S_n)/2 ?\n\n   Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe this approach isn't leading me anywhere.\n\nAlternative plan: Let's think of the problem as a directed graph where we need to assign directions to edges so that the inflow for each node (except 1 and n) is exactly S_v / 2. To achieve this, we can model it as a problem of finding for each node a set of edges incident to it that sum to S_v / 2. But since the edges are shared between nodes, this is a global problem.\n\nBut how to find such a set. Perhaps we can use a greedy approach with a priority queue. For example, we can process nodes in some order and adjust the edges connected to them to meet the required inflow.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. For each node v, calculate S_v = sum of ci of edges incident to v.\n\n2. For each node v (not 1 or n), the required inflow is req_v = S_v / 2.\n\n3. Start with the source node 1. All edges connected to 1 are directed away from it. This contributes to the inflow of the neighboring nodes.\n\n4. For each node v, keep track of the current inflow (current_inflow). Initially, current_inflow for node 1 is zero (since no incoming edges), and for other nodes, it's the sum of flows from edges directed into them so far.\n\n5. Process the nodes in a certain order (like BFS or DFS), and for each node, if its current_inflow is less than req_v, find an edge that can be reversed to increase the inflow.\n\nFor example, if node v has current_inflow < req_v, we look for an edge between v and another node u that hasn't been processed yet, and reverse the direction of that edge to add its flow to v's inflow.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have a node v with current_inflow less than req_v. We can find an edge between v and u, and if the edge is currently directed away from v (so contributing to outflow), we can reverse it to contribute to inflow. This would increase v's inflow by ci and decrease u's inflow by ci.\n\nBut how to manage this without getting into infinite loops.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding an Eulerian trail, where we adjust the directions to meet certain conditions.\n\nPerhaps this can be implemented with a BFS-like approach:\n\n- Start with the source node 1, directing all its edges away from it.\n\n- For each node in the queue, check if its current_inflow meets the required req_v. If not, find an edge to another node that can be reversed to adjust the inflow.\n\n- Repeat until all nodes are processed.\n\nBut how to choose which edge to reverse.\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each node has a certain deficit (req_v - current_inflow). We need to eliminate this deficit.\n\nFor example, if a node v has a deficit, we can find an edge between v and another node u. Suppose the edge is currently directed from v to u. Reversing it would add ci to v's inflow (since now it's coming from u to v), and subtract ci from u's inflow. So, this would reduce v's deficit by ci, and increase u's deficit by ci. But if u's deficit is positive, this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, if the edge is directed from u to v, reversing it would subtract ci from v's inflow (now directed from v to u), which would increase v's deficit. That's bad.\n\nSo, to reduce v's deficit, we need to find an edge that is currently directed away from v, and reverse it to bring it into v.\n\nBut how to find such an edge.\n\nMaybe we can use a BFS approach where we process nodes and for each node, if it has a deficit, we find an edge that can be reversed to help it.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n\nInitialize all edges directed away from the source. For example, for each edge between node 1 and u, we direct it from 1 to u. This adds ci to u's current_inflow.\n\nFor other nodes, initially, their current_inflow depends on the edges connected to them that are directed into them.\n\nThen, for each node v (starting from those connected to the source), we check if current_inflow[v] is less than req_v. If it is, we need to find an edge that can be reversed to increase current_inflow[v].\n\nFor example, take the first such node v with deficit. We look for an edge between v and another node u, which is currently directed away from v (so, from v to u). Reversing this edge would add ci to v's current_inflow (since now it's directed from u to v), and subtract ci from u's current_inflow.\n\nBut this could affect u's deficit. However, if we process nodes in a certain order, perhaps this can be handled.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a BFS or DFS approach, where we process nodes and adjust edges to balance their deficits.\n\nLet's think about implementing this:\n\nWe can maintain for each node the current deficit (deficit[v] = req_v - current_inflow[v]).\n\nInitially, for node 1, deficit is 0 (since all edges are outgoing, current_inflow is zero). For other nodes, current_inflow is the sum of flows from edges directed into them (initially, edges from the source are directed into them).\n\nFor each node v, if deficit[v] > 0, we need to find an edge to another node u that can be reversed to increase current_inflow[v].\n\nWe can use a queue to process nodes with deficit. For each node v in the queue:\n\n   while deficit[v] > 0:\n\n      find an edge (v, u) that is currently directed away from v (i.e., from v to u). Reverse it, which increases current_inflow[v] by ci and decreases current_inflow[u] by ci. This reduces deficit[v] by ci and increases deficit[u] by ci.\n\n      if u was previously processed (deficit[u] == 0), then we add u to the queue.\n\nBut how to efficiently find an edge directed away from v.\n\nThis suggests that for each node, we need to keep track of edges that are currently directed away from it. But maintaining this data structure for large n and m may be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, for each edge, we can store its direction, and for each node v, we can iterate through its edges to find one that is directed away from it.\n\nBut for large graphs, this could be time-consuming unless optimized.\n\nHowever, given that the problem guarantees a solution exists, perhaps this approach would work.\n\nLet me think through an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\n3 3\n\nEdges:\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nThe nodes are 1, 2, 3. Source is 1, sink is 3.\n\nS_1 = 10 (edge 1-2) +5 (edge 1-3) = 15.\n\nS_2 = 10 (edge 1-2) +10 (edge 2-3) = 20 → req_2 = 10.\n\nS_3 = 10 (edge 2-3) +5 (edge 1-3) = 15 → req_3 is S_3 (sink) which is 15.\n\nInitially, all edges connected to 1 are directed away from it. So:\n\nEdge 1-2 is directed from 1→2. This contributes 10 to current_inflow[2].\n\nEdge 1-3 is directed from 1→3. This contributes 5 to current_inflow[3].\n\nOther edges: edge 2-3 is undirected. Initially, it's not directed yet. Wait, no— initially, the edges not connected to the source are not directed yet. Or are they directed in some way?\n\nWait, the initial step is to direct all edges connected to the source away from it. For edges not connected to the source, their direction is initially undefined. But this approach may not be sufficient.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the initial step of directing edges from the source is not enough. We need to have a way to process all edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can start with an arbitrary spanning tree, and direct the edges in a certain way, then handle the rest.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think again of the algorithm:\n\nInitialize all edges as undirected. Then, for the source node 1, direct all its edges away from it. For other nodes, their initial current_inflow is the sum of flows from edges directed into them. Initially, this is only the edges from the source.\n\nThen, for each node v, we calculate the deficit. For example, for node 2 in the sample:\n\nreq_2 = 20 / 2 = 10. current_inflow is 10 (from edge 1-2). So deficit is zero. For node 3, req_3 is S_3 (sink) which is 15. current_inflow is 5 (from edge 1-3). So deficit is 15 - 5 = 10. For node 3, we need to increase its inflow by 10.\n\nTo do this, we look for an edge connected to node 3 that is directed away from it. The edge 3-2 is currently undirected. Wait, initially, after directing the edges from the source, what about other edges? Are they directed arbitrarily?\n\nThis suggests that the initial setup is incomplete. So perhaps the algorithm needs to process all edges, not just those connected to the source.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for existing algorithms or similar problems.\n\nAnother idea: This problem resembles the problem of finding an orientation of an undirected graph such that the in-degree of each node is a certain value. In our case, it's weighted in-degree.\n\nThere's a known algorithm for this: if the graph is connected and the sum of required in-degrees is equal to the sum of the weights, then",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions and is acyclic. The key steps involve ensuring that each node (except the source and sink) has equal inflow and outflow, the source has no incoming edges, and the resulting graph is acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Flow Conservation**: For each node (except the source and sink), the sum of flows entering the node must equal the sum of flows leaving the node.\n2. **Acyclicity**: The directed graph must be acyclic, which can be ensured by using a topological order or processing nodes in a way that avoids cycles.\n3. **Direction Assignment**: We use a BFS-like approach starting from the source node, directing all edges away from the source initially.
