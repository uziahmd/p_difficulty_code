Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem requires us to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain flow conditions and is acyclic. \n\nFirst, let me restate the requirements. We need to direct each edge so that:\n\n1. For every vertex except the source (vertex 1) and sink (vertex n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. This is the conservation of flow condition.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The resulting directed graph has no cycles.\n\nHmm. Also, the given flows are already the maximum flow values for each edge, so we just need to assign directions correctly.\n\nSo the main challenge is to find a way to direct the edges such that all these conditions are met. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nLet me recall that in a flow network, the maximum flow is determined by the capacities of the edges. However, here the problem is different. We are given the flow values (ci) for each edge, and need to assign directions to them. The key is that the flow must be a valid maximum flow, which implies that the flow conservation holds except for the source and sink.\n\nBut how do we assign directions to the edges? One approach is to model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation is satisfied, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nWait, but the problem also requires that the directed graph is acyclic. That suggests that there's a topological order of the vertices. Since the graph is connected and acyclic, it's a DAG. So perhaps we can arrange the vertices in a topological order where the source comes first, and the sink comes last. Then, all edges would be directed in the direction of the topological order.\n\nBut how do we ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed acyclic graph with the given flow values, such that the flow conservation holds. How can we model this?\n\nAnother idea: Since the graph must be acyclic, we can perform a topological sort. If we can assign directions based on a topological order, then there are no cycles. But how to determine the topological order?\n\nBut the flow conservation requires that for each intermediate node, the total inflow equals the outflow. Which means that the net flow at each such node is zero.\n\nWait, but the flow conservation is the same as in a standard max flow problem. So, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that their flow values satisfy the conservation laws.\n\nBut how to find such directions? Let's think about the problem in terms of flow values. For each edge, the flow is given, and we need to assign a direction. Once assigned, the direction determines whether the flow is entering or leaving a node.\n\nFor example, consider an edge between u and v. Suppose we direct it from u to v. Then, for node u, this contributes to its outflow, and for node v, it contributes to its inflow. Alternatively, if directed the other way, the opposite happens.\n\nThe problem requires that for every node except 1 and n, the sum of inflows equals the sum of outflows. Let's denote for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\nSo, for each node v (other than 1 and n), the total flow of edges incident to it must be even? No, not necessarily. Because for each edge, the flow is counted either as inflow or outflow. So the total sum of flows for all edges incident to v is (inflow + outflow). But since inflow equals outflow, the total sum must be even? Wait, no. Because inflow = outflow, so total sum is 2 * inflow. So yes, the sum of all flows on edges incident to v must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so that's guaranteed.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of each node (except 1 and n) as needing to have a balance of 0. For node 1, the balance is the total outflow minus inflow (but since it has no inflow, it's the total outflow). For node n, the balance is the total inflow minus outflow (since it's the sink).\n\nBut how to assign directions so that this is achieved?\n\nThis seems like a problem of assigning directions to edges such that the net flow (outflow - inflow) for each node is as required.\n\nBut how do we compute the required net flows?\n\nWell, the net flow for the source is the total flow that leaves it. For the sink, it's the total flow that enters. For all other nodes, it's zero.\n\nBut how can we compute this? Well, the maximum flow from source to sink is fixed. The sum of all flows on edges leaving the source must equal the maximum flow. Similarly, the sum of flows entering the sink must equal the maximum flow.\n\nBut since the problem says that the given flows are part of a maximum flow, perhaps the sum of all flows on edges adjacent to the source (directed away from it) is the value of the max flow. Similarly for the sink.\n\nBut how to find the directions of edges such that this is satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow conservation holds, and the graph is a DAG. One approach is to construct a directed acyclic graph with the source as the first node and the sink as the last node in a topological order. Then, for each node, the sum of the flows on edges directed into it must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of it.\n\nWait, but how can we ensure that? Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has in-degree and out-degree flows balanced.\n\nAnother thought: since the graph is undirected and connected, and we need to direct the edges to form a DAG, perhaps we can perform a DFS traversal and assign directions based on the traversal. For example, when we visit a node, we direct edges towards unvisited nodes. But how does that help with the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each node has a potential, and the direction of the edge depends on the potential. For instance, if the potential of u is higher than that of v, the edge is directed from u to v. Then, the graph is acyclic if the potentials are assigned in a way that no cycles can exist (like a topological order). But how to ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nBut how can we assign potentials such that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges going out equals the sum of flows going in?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For a node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed into v. Let me denote this as:\n\nsum_{e directed out of v} c_e = sum_{e directed into v} c_e.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{e incident to v} c_e * (direction) = 0,\n\nwhere direction is +1 if the edge is directed out of v, -1 if directed into v.\n\nBut since each edge is between two nodes, for each edge (u, v), the direction choice affects both u and v. For example, if the edge is directed from u to v, then for u, this contributes +c to its balance, and for v, this contributes -c. \n\nThe overall balance for each node must be zero (except for source and sink). \n\nSo, for all nodes except source and sink, the sum of all c_e multiplied by their direction (as +1 or -1) must be zero. \n\nThis looks like a system of equations. However, solving such a system for large n and m (up to 2e5) is computationally challenging. \n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Since the graph is connected, and the problem says that a solution exists, maybe we can model this as a directed tree structure, or find a way to assign directions based on some hierarchy.\n\nAnother approach is to think of the problem as building a directed acyclic graph with the source as the root, and the sink as a leaf, such that the flow conservation holds. \n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the standard max flow algorithms. Let's imagine that the flow is a valid flow, and we want to assign directions to the edges according to the flow. In a standard flow, each edge has a direction (from u to v if the flow is positive in that direction). However, since the original graph is undirected, perhaps the problem is to find such directions that correspond to a valid flow. \n\nBut how to do that without knowing the actual flow?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow values are already given, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow is pushed from the source to the sink, and the conservation holds.\n\nBut again, how to find this direction assignment?\n\nAnother thought: Since the graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's say the topological order is such that the source comes first, followed by other nodes, and the sink comes last. Then, all edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes in the topological order. This ensures that there are no cycles.\n\nNow, given this topological order, how can we assign directions to edges to satisfy the flow conservation?\n\nLet's think of the nodes in this order. For each node (except the source and sink), the sum of flows on edges going into it (from previous nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges going out of it (to later nodes). \n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me consider the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where each node has a \"balance\" that needs to be adjusted. The balance for node v is the difference between the outflow and inflow. For non-source/sink nodes, this balance must be zero. For the source, it's the total outflow (which is the max flow value). For the sink, it's the total inflow (same as the max flow value).\n\nBut how do we compute this balance? Well, the total outflow minus inflow for the source is the max flow value. Similarly, for the sink, the inflow minus outflow is the same value.\n\nBut how to find this value? Well, the sum of all flows on edges incident to the source must be equal to the max flow value. Wait, no. Because the source's outflow is the sum of flows on edges directed away from it, and since it has no inflow, the balance is that sum. Similarly, the sink's balance is the sum of flows on edges directed into it minus those directed away from it.\n\nBut how to compute this? Well, perhaps the sum of all flows on edges incident to the source is the max flow value. Because in a valid flow, the total outflow from the source is the max flow. However, since the edges are undirected, but the flow is directed, the sum of the flows on edges that are directed away from the source would be the max flow.\n\nBut how do I know what the max flow is? Well, the problem states that the given flows are part of a maximum flow. However, the problem doesn't give us the value of the maximum flow. So perhaps we need to find it indirectly.\n\nBut maybe we don't need to know the max flow value directly. Let's think again about the flow conservation. For the entire graph, the sum of all flows on edges directed away from the source must equal the sum of flows directed into the sink. \n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of the balance for each node. Let me denote for each node v, the balance B_v is equal to (outflow - inflow). Then, for the source, B_1 = total outflow, which is the max flow. For the sink, B_n = total inflow - outflow, which is also the max flow. For all other nodes, B_v = 0. \n\nBut how can we compute this? Well, the sum of all B_v over all nodes must be zero. Because the total outflow minus inflow for all nodes adds up to zero (since each edge's flow is counted once as outflow and once as inflow, except for the source and sink). \n\nBut since B_1 = max_flow and B_n = max_flow, then B_1 + B_n + sum_{others} B_v = 2*max_flow. But the sum must be zero. Therefore, 2*max_flow = 0 → which is impossible unless max_flow is zero, which can't be. So clearly, my understanding of B_v is wrong. \n\nAh, right! The balance B_v is (outflow - inflow). For the source, since there are no incoming edges, the outflow is the total flow from the source. For the sink, the inflow is the total flow into it, and the outflow is the total flow out of it. For the rest, outflow equals inflow, so their B_v is zero. \n\nThe sum of all B_v is (B_1 + B_n) + sum_{others} 0 = (outflow_source - inflow_source) + (inflow_sink - outflow_sink). But since the source has no inflow, B_1 = outflow_source. For the sink, B_n = inflow_sink - outflow_sink. \n\nBut in a valid flow, the outflow from the source equals the inflow to the sink. So, B_1 = outflow_source = inflow_sink. And B_n = inflow_sink - outflow_sink = outflow_source - outflow_sink. But for the sink, the outflow_sink is zero? No, the sink can have outgoing edges. Wait, the sink is just a node where the flow ends. However, in general, the sink can have outgoing edges, but the net flow is that the inflow minus outflow equals the max flow. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think again. \n\nIn a standard flow network, the total outflow from the source equals the total inflow to the sink. For any other node, the inflow equals outflow. So, the sum of B_v across all nodes is (outflow_source - 0) + (inflow_sink - outflow_sink) + others (which are zero). But outflow_source = inflow_sink. So the sum becomes (inflow_sink) + (inflow_sink - outflow_sink) = 2 * inflow_sink - outflow_sink. But this should be zero. So 2 * inflow_sink = outflow_sink. Which implies that outflow_sink = 2 * inflow_sink. That can't be right. \n\nClearly, I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-express the balances. \n\nEach edge contributes to the balance of its endpoints. For an edge directed from u to v, it contributes +c to u's balance (outflow) and -c to v's balance (inflow). \n\nSo, the total sum of all balances is sum_{v} B_v = sum_{edges} (c_e) * (contribution to u) + contribution to v. For each edge, the contribution is +c for u and -c for v. Adding them gives zero. Hence, the total sum of all balances is zero. \n\nBut for the source, B_1 = outflow (since no inflow). For the sink, B_n = inflow - outflow. For other nodes, B_v = 0. \n\nSo, the sum of all balances is B_1 + B_n = 0. Which means that B_1 = -B_n. But B_1 is the outflow from source, and B_n is (inflow to sink) - (outflow from sink). However, since the outflow from the source equals the inflow to the sink (in a valid flow), we have:\n\nB_1 = outflow_source = inflow_sink. \n\nB_n = inflow_sink - outflow_sink. \n\nBut since B_1 + B_n = 0 → outflow_source + (inflow_sink - outflow_sink) = 0. \n\nBut outflow_source = inflow_sink → substituting:\n\ninflow_sink + (inflow_sink - outflow_sink) = 0 → 2 * inflow_sink - outflow_sink = 0 → outflow_sink = 2 * inflow_sink. \n\nThis seems incorrect. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Wait, the total sum of all balances is zero. So B_1 + B_n + ... (others) = 0. Others are zero, so B_1 + B_n = 0. Therefore, B_1 = -B_n. \n\nBut B_1 is the outflow from the source (since no inflow). B_n is (inflow to sink) - (outflow from sink). \n\nBut in a valid flow, the outflow from the source is equal to the inflow to the sink. So:\n\nB_1 = outflow_source = inflow_sink. \n\nB_n = inflow_sink - outflow_sink. \n\nThen, B_1 + B_n = 0 → outflow_source + (inflow_sink - outflow_sink) = 0. \n\nSince outflow_source = inflow_sink, substituting:\n\ninflow_sink + (inflow_sink - outflow_sink) = 0 → 2 * inflow_sink - outflow_sink = 0 → outflow_sink = 2 * inflow_sink. \n\nThis seems to suggest that the outflow from the sink is twice the inflow. That's impossible in a normal flow scenario. \n\nClearly, I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think again. \n\nIn a standard flow network, the outflow from the source equals the inflow to the sink. For all other nodes, inflow equals outflow. So, the sum of balances is (outflow_source - 0) + (inflow_sink - outflow_sink) + ... others. \n\nBut since outflow_source = inflow_sink, and for the other nodes, their balances are zero, the total sum is (inflow_sink) + (inflow_sink - outflow_sink) = 2 * inflow_sink - outflow_sink. \n\nBut this must be zero. Therefore, 2 * inflow_sink = outflow_sink. \n\nBut how can that be? For example, in a simple case where the sink has no outgoing edges, outflow_sink is zero. Then 2 * inflow_sink = 0 → inflow_sink = 0, which contradicts the fact that the source sends flow to the sink. \n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about the definition of B_v is wrong. \n\nLet me re-define B_v as the net outflow from node v. For the source, this is the total outflow (since no inflow). For the sink, it is the total outflow minus the inflow. For other nodes, it's zero. \n\nBut then, the sum of B_v for all nodes must be zero. \n\nSo:\n\nB_1 + B_n + sum_{others} 0 = 0 → B_1 = -B_n. \n\nBut B_1 is the total outflow from the source. B_n is the net outflow from the sink. \n\nIn a valid flow, the outflow from the source equals the inflow to the sink. The net outflow from the sink is (outflow_sink - inflow_sink). \n\nBut since inflow_sink = outflow_source, then B_n = outflow_sink - inflow_sink = outflow_sink - outflow_source. \n\nSo B_1 + B_n = outflow_source + (outflow_sink - outflow_source) = outflow_sink. This must be zero. Hence, outflow_sink = 0. \n\nThat makes sense. Because the sink has no outgoing flow. Wait, but that's not true. The sink can have outgoing edges, but in the standard flow, the sink's outflow is zero. Because the flow is directed towards the sink, and no flow leaves it. \n\nAh! So the net outflow from the sink is zero. Which implies that B_n = 0. But then B_1 must be zero as well. Which is impossible unless the max flow is zero. \n\nThis suggests that my entire approach is flawed. \n\nLet me take a step back. Perhaps I should think of the problem differently. \n\nThe problem says that the given flows are already part of a maximum flow. So the sum of flows on edges leaving the source must equal the sum of flows entering the sink. And for every other node, the sum of flows entering equals the sum leaving. \n\nSo, the direction assignment must ensure that for each edge, the flow is directed in a way that the conservation holds. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nMaybe we can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed from the node with higher \"potential\" to the node with lower potential. This way, the graph is acyclic (if potentials are assigned uniquely). \n\nBut how to assign potentials such that the conservation holds? \n\nLet me think of the problem as a directed graph where the flow conservation holds. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v equals the sum of flows on edges directed into v. \n\nThis can be rephrased as: the sum of flows on edges incident to v is even, and half of them are directed into v and half out. But that's not necessarily the case. \n\nAlternatively, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v must be equal to the sum directed into it. Let's call this value S. Then, the total sum of flows for edges incident to v is 2S. \n\nSo, for each such node, the sum of flows on all edges incident to it must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so this must be true. \n\nBut how to assign directions? \n\nPerhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a net outflow of zero. \n\nThis feels like a problem that can be solved with a DFS-based approach, where we assign directions based on the traversal, and adjust the flows accordingly. \n\nHere's an idea inspired by the standard way of finding an Eulerian trail. For a directed graph to have an Eulerian trail, certain conditions must be met. But I'm not sure if this is applicable here. \n\nAnother idea: since the graph is connected and we need to assign directions to make it acyclic, perhaps we can build a directed tree structure. For example, construct a directed spanning tree rooted at the source, and direct all edges away from the root. However, this may not account for the flow conservation. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG with the source as the root and the sink as a leaf. Then, for each node, the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum of flows on outgoing edges. \n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nWe can perform a DFS traversal of the graph. For each edge, when we visit a node, we direct the edge from the current node to the next node. This ensures that the graph is a DAG. However, this might not satisfy the flow conservation. \n\nBut perhaps during the traversal, we can keep track of the balance of flows at each node. For example, when visiting a node, we direct the edges in a way that helps balance the flows. \n\nBut this is vague. Let's think of it more concretely. \n\nLet's consider that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into it must equal the sum directed out of it. \n\nSuppose we have a node v that is not the source or sink. Let's imagine that we have already directed some edges incident to v. The sum of flows on the edges directed into v is I, and the sum on those directed out is O. The difference between I and O is D. To balance this, we need to direct the remaining edges in a way that adjusts this difference. \n\nFor example, if D is positive, meaning that more flow is coming into v than going out, we need to direct the remaining edges out of v to increase O. \n\nBut how to manage this during traversal?\n\nThis seems like a problem that could be modeled using a priority queue or some greedy approach. However, for large n and m, this needs to be efficient. \n\nAnother thought: since the graph is connected and acyclic after direction assignment, it's a DAG. So, there is a topological order. Let's assume that the topological order starts with the source and ends with the sink. \n\nIn this topological order, all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes. Now, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v (to later nodes). \n\nSo, during the topological ordering, we can process the nodes in order and direct the edges accordingly. \n\nBut how to determine the topological order and the directions? \n\nPerhaps we can model this as a directed graph and perform a topological sort, but the problem is that we don't know the directions yet. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the flow conservation for each node v (non-source/sink) implies that the sum of flows on edges incident to v is even, and that exactly half of the flow is directed into v and half out. \n\nWait, no. Because the sum of flows on edges incident to v is equal to I + O, where I is inflow and O is outflow. Since I = O, sum is 2I. So the total sum must be even. \n\nBut again, how to use this to assign directions? \n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each node has a certain amount of \"excess\" flow that needs to be directed out. For example, the source has an excess of the total flow, and the sink has a deficit. Other nodes have zero excess. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nThis seems similar to a problem where you have to find an orientation of the edges such that the excess at each node is satisfied. \n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a flow network. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of this as a directed graph where the excess of each node is the amount of flow that needs to leave it. For the source, this is the total flow. For the sink, it's negative of the total flow. For others, it's zero. \n\nBut how to find orientations of edges to satisfy this? \n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an orientation of edges such that the net outflow from each node is equal to its excess. \n\nThis is known as the \"orientation problem\" for flows. \n\nYes! This is exactly the problem of finding an orientation of an undirected graph such that the net outflow from each node equals a given value. \n\nIn our case, the net outflow for node 1 is the total flow value (let's call it F), for node n it's -F, and for all others, it's zero. \n\nSo, how can we find such an orientation?\n\nThis problem can be solved by finding an Eulerian orientation. Wait, no. But there's a theorem that says that if the sum of the excesses is zero (which it is in our case, since F + (-F) = 0), then such an orientation exists. And since the problem states that a solution exists, we can proceed. \n\nSo, the question now is: how to find an orientation of the edges such that the net outflow for each node is as specified (F for source, -F for sink, 0 otherwise). \n\nOnce we have such an orientation, the graph may contain cycles, but the problem requires that the resulting graph is acyclic. \n\nSo, how to find such an orientation and ensure it's acyclic?\n\nLet me think. First, find the orientation that satisfies the net outflow conditions. Then, check if it's acyclic, and if not, adjust the directions. But that seems computationally intensive for large graphs. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to orient the edges in a way that both satisfies the net outflow conditions and ensures the graph is acyclic. \n\nLet's focus first on finding the orientation that satisfies the net outflow conditions. Once we have that, perhaps we can perform a topological sort and adjust directions to break cycles. But I'm not sure. \n\nSo, how to find the orientation that satisfies the net outflow conditions?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using a depth-first search approach. \n\nLet's think of the problem as a directed graph where we need to assign directions to edges such that for each node v, the number of flows leaving v minus the flows entering v equals the desired value. \n\nLet me denote for each node v, the desired net outflow is d_v. \n\nFor our case:\n\nd_1 = F (the total flow)\n\nd_n = -F\n\nd_v = 0 for others.\n\nBut how to compute F? \n\nThe total flow F is the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source. But since we don't know the directions yet, how can we compute F? \n\nBut wait, the sum of all flows on edges incident to the source must be equal to 2F. Because, the source's net outflow is F. The sum of flows on edges incident to the source is the sum of flows directed away from it plus the sum of flows directed towards it. But since the source has no incoming edges (as per condition 2), all flows on edges incident to the source are directed away from it. Thus, the sum of flows on edges incident to the source is equal to F. \n\nWait, no. Because the source has no incoming edges, all edges incident to it are directed away. So the sum of flows on edges incident to the source is F. \n\nBut the sum of flows on edges incident to the source is the sum of all c_i where one end is the source. Let's call this value S. So, F = S. \n\nAh! So the total flow F is simply the sum of all flows on edges incident to the source. Because all of these edges are directed away from the source. \n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n3 2 10\n1 2 10\n3 1 5\n\nThe edges incident to source (node 1) are (1-2, 10) and (3-1, 5). Sum is 15. So F=15. \n\nBut in the sample output, the directions are:\n\nEdge 1: 3→2 → direction is 1 (original was 3-2, so direction is 1 means it's bi→ai, which is 2→3? Wait no. The input gives each edge as ai, bi, ci. The output di is 0 if the direction is ai→bi, else 1 (bi→ai). \n\nSo for the first edge in sample input, which is 3-2, the output is 1. That means direction is bi→ai, i.e., 2→3. \n\nSo for the source (node 1), edges are directed away. Edge 1-2 is directed as 1→2 (output 0), and edge 3-1 is directed as 1→3 (output 1, since original was 3-1, and 1→3 is bi→ai, so di is 1). \n\nThus, the sum of flows from the source is 10+5=15, which is the total flow. \n\nSo, F is the sum of all flows on edges incident to the source. \n\nSo, to compute F, we can calculate the sum of ci for all edges where one of the endpoints is 1. \n\nOnce we have F, we can compute the desired net outflow for each node. \n\nNow, how to find an orientation of the edges that satisfies the net outflow conditions?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a modified DFS or BFS approach. \n\nLet's think of each edge as a variable that can be directed in either direction. For each node, we need to track the current net outflow, and adjust the directions of edges to reach the desired net outflow. \n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nInitialize for each node v, a variable 'balance' which represents the current net outflow. Initially, balance[v] = 0 for all nodes. \n\nWe need to adjust the directions of edges to make balance[v] = d_v for all v. \n\nFor each edge, we can choose to direct it from u to v or from v to u. Each choice affects the balance of u and v. \n\nFor example, directing from u to v increases balance[u] by c and decreases balance[v] by c. \n\nThe problem is to choose directions such that balance[v] = d_v for all v. \n\nThis is equivalent to solving a system of equations. However, for large n and m, we need an efficient way to do this. \n\nOne possible approach is to model this as a directed graph and perform a DFS or BFS, adjusting the balance as we go. \n\nHere's an idea inspired by the standard method for finding an Eulerian trail:\n\nWe can start from the source and traverse the graph, directing edges as we go, and adjusting the balance accordingly. \n\nLet's see:\n\nStart with the source. The desired balance for the source is F. Initially, balance is 0. We need to add F to it. \n\nWe can pick an edge from the source, and direct it away from the source. This increases the source's balance by c. \n\nThen, we move to the other end of the edge and repeat the process. \n\nBut this might not work for all cases. \n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of finding a directed graph with the desired balances, and then ensuring it is acyclic. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where we greedily direct edges to satisfy the balance constraints. \n\nFor example, for each node v (starting from the source), while there are edges incident to v that haven't been directed yet:\n\n- If the current balance of v is less than the desired balance, we need to direct some edges away from v. \n- If it's more, we need to direct some edges towards v. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nLet's think of the following approach:\n\n- For each node v, maintain a list of undirected edges that are still not directed. \n- While there are undirected edges:\n   - Pick a node v that has a non-zero balance. \n   - Pick an undirected edge incident to v. \n   - Direct the edge in a way that brings the balance closer to the desired value. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, since the desired net outflow for all nodes except source and sink is zero, and for the source it's F, for the sink it's -F. \n\nWe can treat this as a flow problem where we need to find an orientation of the edges such that the net outflow is as required. \n\nThis is similar to finding an Eulerian orientation. \n\nAn Eulerian orientation is one where every node has equal in-degree and out-degree, which corresponds to a balance of zero. However, in our case, the balance is not zero for the source and sink. \n\nBut perhaps we can modify the graph to include the source and sink. \n\nLet me think: create a new graph where we add a super-source and super-sink to balance the flows. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, here's a possible way to find the orientation:\n\nWe can model the problem as follows. For each edge, we need to decide its direction. The net outflow for each node must be d_v. \n\nWe can represent this as a graph where each edge has a direction, and the sum of flows for each node is as required. \n\nThis is equivalent to finding a directed graph where for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed out of v minus the sum directed into v is d_v. \n\nThis is a system of equations, but since the graph is connected and a solution exists, there must be a way to find this orientation. \n\nLet me think of the following approach. \n\nWe can perform a DFS traversal, and for each edge, decide its direction based on the current balance of the nodes. \n\nFor example:\n\n- Start at the source. \n- For each edge incident to the source, direct it away from the source. This increases the source's balance by c. \n- Then, for the other end of the edge, we need to adjust their balance accordingly. \n\nLet's try to formalize this. \n\nInitialize balance[v] = 0 for all v. \n\nSet desired_balance[v] = d_v for all v. \n\nFor the source, desired_balance is F. \n\nFor the sink, it's -F. \n\nFor others, zero. \n\nNow, perform a DFS or BFS traversal. \n\nAt each step, pick a node u with current balance not equal to desired_balance. \n\nPick an undirected edge from u to v. \n\nIf the current balance of u is less than desired_balance, we need to direct the edge away from u (so that balance[u] increases by c, and balance[v] decreases by c). \n\nOtherwise, direct it towards u (balance[u] decreases by c, and balance[v] increases by c). \n\nRepeat until all edges are directed and all balances are correct. \n\nThis seems like a possible approach. \n\nLet me test this idea with the first sample input. \n\nSample input:\n\nn=3, m=3. \n\nEdges:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2, 10 \n\nEdge 2: 1-2, 10 \n\nEdge 3: 3-1, 5 \n\nF is the sum of flows on edges incident to source (node 1). These are edges 2 (10) and 3 (5). Total F=15. \n\nDesired balances:\n\nbalance[1] = 15 \n\nbalance[2] = 0 \n\nbalance[",
