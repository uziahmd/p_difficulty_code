There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key constraint here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm, so the winner needs to play as many games as possible. Let's think about how this works. In a normal knockout tournament, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced bracket. But here, the structure is different because of the rule. So maybe the maximum number of games isn't straightforward.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=2, the answer is 1. That makes sense because there's only one game. For n=3, the answer is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: maybe first they play against player 2, then against player 3. But wait, when they play the second game, the other player (player 3) hasn't played any games yet. So the difference is 1 (the winner has played 1 game, the other 0). That's allowed. So that's okay. So the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because if you have four players, normally in a knockout bracket, the winner would play 3 games (like in a single elimination with 4 players). But according to the example, the answer is 2. Oh right, because the rule might restrict that. Let me think. How can the winner play 3 games? Let's see. Suppose the winner plays three games. Each time, they need to have opponents that meet the condition.\n\nLet's think: for the first game, the winner plays someone. Then, they play another. Then, another. But for each of those steps, the opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less. Let's see:\n\nIn the first game, the opponent has 0 games. So after that, the winner has 1 game. Next, the winner needs to play someone who has either 0 or 1 games. Suppose they play against someone who has 0. Then, after that, the winner has 2 games. Now, the next opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But the only other player left would have to be someone who has played once. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the structure of the tournament is such that the winner can't have a path where they play three games. For example, with four players, maybe the structure is that the winner plays two games. Like, the first round is two matches (players 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4), then the winners play each other. So the winner plays two games. Hence, the answer is 2. So the maximum is 2 here.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play, given the constraints on how matches are arranged.\n\nNow, how do we model this? Let's think recursively. Let's say that for a given number of players, the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). How can we find f(n)?\n\nLet's think about the process. The winner must play against opponents in such a way that each time, the opponent has a number of games that is either equal to or one less than the winner's current count. \n\nSuppose the winner plays k games. Then, each time they play, they must have an opponent. Let's consider that for each game the winner plays, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let's think of the winner's path as a sequence of games. Let's say that in the first game, the opponent has 0 games. Then, after winning, the winner has 1 game. For the next game, the opponent could have 0 or 1 games. But if the opponent has 0 games, then after that game, the winner has 2 games. Then for the next game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. \n\nBut how does this relate to the number of players? Let's think about the structure. For the winner to play k games, they must have defeated k opponents. Each of these opponents must have been part of a subtree where they themselves had to play some number of games. \n\nThis feels similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for example, to have a winner play k games, the number of players required is the sum of the players needed for each of the previous steps. Let me think. \n\nFor example, suppose the winner plays k games. Let's think about the first game: the winner plays against someone. That opponent must have played 0 games (since the winner has 0 before the first game). So that opponent is from a subtree where they had to play",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule that restricts matchups based on the number of games each player has already played.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using a recursive approach similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The rule that two players can only play against each other if their number of previously played games differs by at most one implies that the structure of the tournament must be such that each match the winner plays requires a certain number of players in the subtrees leading up to that match.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Using a recursive function to determine the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games.\n2. Iteratively increasing the number of games until the number of players required exceeds the given input `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef max_games(n):\n    # We need to find the maximum k such that f(k) <= n\n    # where f(k) is the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play k games\n    # f(0) = 1 (no games, just one player)\n    # f(1) = 2 (one game, two players)\n    # f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)\n    # This is similar to Fibonacci numbers\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        return 0\n    \n    a, b = 1, 2  # f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2\n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        if b > n:\n            return k\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Recursive Insight**: The function `max_games` uses a loop to simulate the Fibonacci sequence. Here, `f(k)` represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games. This sequence is derived from the requirement that each match the winner plays must have opponents who meet the game count constraint.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from the base cases (1 player for 0 games, 2 players for 1 game), we iteratively compute the next values in the sequence until the number of players required exceeds the input `n`. The maximum number of games `k` for which `f(k) <= n` is then returned.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using a linear scan through the Fibonacci-like sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
