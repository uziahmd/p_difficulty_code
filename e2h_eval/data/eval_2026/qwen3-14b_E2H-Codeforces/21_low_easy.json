The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, yes. Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. So the total is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys). \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. Calculate the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) and min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's the plan. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9, 11). \n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7). \n\nThen, min(3, 1) is 1 (even chests paired with odd keys). Then min(2, 3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3, which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: input is 5 1. Chests are all even (2,4,6,8,10). Keys is 5 (odd). So even_chests is 5, odd_keys is 1. So min(5,1) is 1. The other term is min(0, 0) since odd_chests is zero. So total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. The other term is min(0, 4) which is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this logic works. \n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the list of a_i, count even and odd.\n- Read the list of b_j, count even and odd.\n- Compute the sum of min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nThat's straightforward. \n\nNow, how to count even and odd in Python?\n\nFor the a list: even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0), same for odd_a = n - even_a.\n\nSame for the keys: even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 ==0), odd_b = m - even_b.\n\nThen compute min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nYes. So the code would be something like:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read a list, then read b list.\n\nCompute even_a, odd_a, even_b, odd_b.\n\nResult is min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nPrint that.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where there are multiple keys and chests? Like, if there are more keys than needed. But since the problem allows using each key once and each chest once, the min is correct.\n\nYes. Because for example, if there are 5 even chests and 3 odd keys, you can only pair 3 of them. Similarly for the other part.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5,",
