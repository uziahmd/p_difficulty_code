Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where there's a string of digits and a series of substitution queries. After applying all the substitutions, I have to compute the number represented by the resulting string modulo 1e9+7. But the problem is that directly applying the substitutions might lead to very large strings, especially since each substitution could replace a single digit with a long string. So if there are many substitutions, the string could become huge, which would be impossible to handle directly due to time and memory constraints.\n\nHmm, right. So the straightforward approach of processing each query by replacing every occurrence of di in the string with ti would be too slow for large inputs. Because for each query, replacing all instances of di in the current string would take O(len(s)) time, and with n up to 1e5, that's O(n * len(s)) which could be up to 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter way to model the substitutions. Let me think about how the substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. However, substitutions are applied in order. For example, if there's a query that replaces '2' with '00', and then another query that replaces '0' with '1', then the first substitution would be processed first, and then the second substitution would replace the 0s generated from the first substitution.\n\nBut if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can find a way to model the transformations more efficiently. Wait, but the problem says that the queries are applied in the order given. So the first query is applied first, then the second, etc. So the order is important.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of dynamic programming or some kind of mapping. For each digit, we can track what it expands to after all substitutions. But since substitutions can overwrite previous mappings, we need to process them in the order they are given. For example, suppose initially, digit '2' maps to '00'. Then later, a query replaces '0' with '1'. So after that, the original '2' would expand to '00', which would then expand to '11'. But if another query comes along that replaces '2' with something else, that would override the previous mapping.\n\nWait, but each substitution replaces all occurrences of di in the current string. So the order of substitutions matters. So for example, if you first replace '2' with '00', then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's become '00's, which then become '11's. But if you first replace '0' with '1', then replace '2' with '00', then the original '2's would become '00's, which are not affected by the earlier substitution of '0'.\n\nTherefore, the substitutions are applied in sequence, and each substitution affects the current state of the string. So the key is that when processing a substitution, we need to replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti. However, doing this naively is not feasible for large strings.\n\nSo, how can we model the substitutions without actually building the entire string?\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of tracking the actual string, track for each digit, what it would expand to after all substitutions. But since substitutions can be applied in sequence, we need to track for each digit, what it maps to at any given time.\n\nBut here's the thing: when a substitution is applied (di → ti), any existing occurrences of di in the current string will be replaced with ti. However, if later substitutions change other digits, those changes will affect the expansion of ti. So for example, if we first replace '2' with '00', then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's become '00's which then become '11's. However, if we track for each digit what it expands to, then after the first substitution, '2' expands to '00'. Then, when '0' is replaced with '1', the expansion of '2' would now be '11', because the '0's in its expansion are replaced.\n\nAh, so the problem is that each substitution affects not only the direct replacement of di, but also any digits that were previously substituted into ti. Therefore, we need to model the expansion of each digit in a way that takes into account subsequent substitutions.\n\nThis suggests that we can model the expansion of each digit as a function. For example, for each digit d, we can keep track of the expansion that would result when we apply all substitutions up to the current point. When a new substitution is made (say, replacing d_old with t_old), we need to update the expansions of all digits that might have been expanded into d_old. Wait, no. Wait, when a substitution is made for di, we need to replace all instances of di in the current string. But the current string is built from the initial string and previous substitutions. So, for example, if the current expansion of some digit d is a string that contains di, then when we replace di with ti, the expansion of d would be updated accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to model this is to track for each digit d, the value of the expansion of d as a string. However, since the expansions can be very long, we can't store them as actual strings. Instead, we can track for each digit d, two things:\n\n- The length of the expansion of d (mod MOD, but maybe not necessary yet)\n- The value of the expansion of d mod MOD.\n\nBut how do we compute these values when substitutions are applied?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a mapping from each digit to its current expansion. Initially, each digit maps to itself. For example, if the initial string is '123123', then each digit in the string is part of the initial mappings. But when substitutions are applied, we need to update these mappings.\n\nFor example, when we process a substitution \"d -> t\", we need to replace all occurrences of d in the current string with t. However, the current string is built from the initial string and all previous substitutions. So, the way to model this is that each substitution affects the expansion of d. But when we replace d with t, then any future expansion of digits that previously included d in their expansion would now include the expansion of t instead.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model for each digit, what is the expansion that would be generated when all substitutions up to now are applied. So, for example, if a substitution is made for digit '2' to be replaced by '00', then the expansion of '2' is now '00'. If later, a substitution is made for '0' to be replaced by '1', then the expansion of '2' becomes '11', because the expansion of '0' is now '1'.\n\nSo, for each substitution, when we replace di with ti, we need to update the expansion of di to be ti. However, the expansion of ti is already computed based on previous substitutions. So, for example, if ti is '0', and '0' has been substituted to '1', then the expansion of di would be '1'.\n\nSo the idea is that when a substitution is made for di, we can compute the expansion of di as ti, but with all digits in ti replaced according to the current mappings. Wait, no. Because ti is the string that replaces di. But ti may contain digits that have their own substitutions. However, since the substitution is applied in order, when we process the substitution \"di → ti\", we need to replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti. But the current string is built by applying all previous substitutions. So, the ti is a string that is processed as-is, but during the substitution, when we replace di with ti, the ti is not further substituted. Because the substitution is applied in sequence. For example:\n\nSuppose the initial string is '2'. First substitution is '2 → 0', then substitution '0 → 1'. The first substitution replaces '2' with '0', giving '0'. Then the second substitution replaces '0' with '1', giving '1'.\n\nBut if the substitution was done in reverse order, first '0 → 1' (but there's no 0 in the original string), then '2 → 0' would replace 2 with 0, and then the 0 would not be replaced again. So the final string is '0'.\n\nSo the key is that each substitution replaces the current occurrences of di in the current string. So, the ti is not processed further during the substitution. Only the substitutions that are processed after this one would affect ti's digits.\n\nSo, when we process a substitution \"di → ti\", we need to replace all current instances of di in the string with ti. However, the ti may contain digits that have their own substitutions. But those substitutions are applied later, so they are not considered during this step.\n\nTherefore, the problem is that the ti is fixed at the time of substitution, and any future substitutions that affect digits in ti will affect the expansion of ti, but not the substitution that was applied when ti was inserted.\n\nSo, this suggests that we need to track for each digit, the current expansion (the string that it would be replaced with). But when a substitution is made, we need to replace the expansion of di with ti, and then for any other digits whose expansion includes di, they would have to be updated as well. However, that seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, think of the substitutions as a series of replacements. For example, each substitution is a rule that applies to the current string. However, since the substitutions are applied in order, the effect of each substitution can be modeled by keeping track of the current expansion for each digit.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about this. Let's say we have a map called expand, where expand[d] represents the string that digit d would expand to after applying all substitutions so far. Initially, expand[d] = d for all digits d. Then, when a substitution comes in, say, replace d_old with t_old, we need to update expand[d_old] to be t_old. But wait, no. Because the substitution replaces all instances of d_old in the current string with t_old. However, the current string is built by expanding all the digits according to the current expand map. So, for example, if the current expand map is such that some digits expand into other digits, then the substitution replaces all instances of d_old in the current string. But the current string is the result of expanding the original string using the expand map.\n\nBut how can we track the current string? We can't, because it's too big. So, perhaps we need to track for each digit, the value of the expansion of that digit, and when a substitution occurs, we update the expand map for that digit. However, when a substitution replaces d_old with t_old, we need to set expand[d_old] = t_old, but the t_old is a string that may contain digits that are subject to future substitutions. However, during the substitution, the t_old is added as-is, and any future substitutions will affect the digits in t_old.\n\nSo, when we process a substitution, we can just update the expand map for the digit being replaced. But how does this affect the overall value of the string?\n\nThe problem is that when we want to compute the final value, we need to take the original string, expand each character according to the expand map, and then compute the value mod 1e9+7. However, expanding each character directly would be impossible for large strings, since the expansion could be extremely long.\n\nSo, the challenge is to compute the value of the expanded string mod MOD, without actually building the string.\n\nSo, perhaps we can model for each digit, not only the string expansion, but also the value of that expansion mod MOD and the length of the expansion. Because when you have a string that represents a number, the value can be computed as follows:\n\nIf you have two numbers A and B, then concatenating B after A gives A * 10^len(B) + B. So, for each digit d, if we track the value of expand[d] mod MOD and the length of expand[d], then we can compute the value of the entire string by processing each character in the original string and combining their values accordingly.\n\nYes! That's a key insight.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each digit d (0-9), maintain two values:\n   - val[d]: the value of the expansion of d mod MOD.\n   - len[d]: the length of the expansion of d (as an integer).\n\nInitially, for each d, val[d] = int(d), len[d] = 1.\n\nThen, for each substitution query \"d_old -> t\", we need to update the val and len for d_old. How?\n\nThe substitution replaces all occurrences of d_old in the current string with the string t. However, the string t is processed as per the current expand map. Wait, no. Because the substitution is applied to the current string. The current string is built by expanding all digits according to the current expand map. So, when we perform the substitution, we replace each occurrence of d_old in the current string with the string t. However, the string t is a literal string. But during the substitution, the t is not expanded further. Because substitutions are applied in sequence. For example, if we have a substitution \"2 → 0\", then later a substitution \"0 → 1\", then the first substitution replaces 2 with 0, and the second replaces 0 with 1. But the first substitution's t is '0', which is not expanded during that substitution.\n\nTherefore, when we process a substitution \"d_old → t\", the string t is not expanded. However, when we later process other substitutions, the digits in t may be expanded.\n\nTherefore, for the purpose of val and len for d_old, when we process the substitution, we need to compute the val and len of the string t. But since t is a string, which can be processed by combining the val and len of each digit in t. Wait, no. Because the string t is a literal string. So, for example, if t is \"00\", then the expansion of d_old would be \"00\", but the 0's in that string may be expanded in future substitutions. However, when we process the substitution, we need to set the val and len of d_old to the value and length of the string t. However, since the t is a literal string, not expanded. But wait, no. Because during substitution, the current string is being modified. For example, the substitution replaces d_old with t. The t is a string that may contain digits that have been substituted before. However, since the substitution is applied in sequence, the t is not processed further. So, the substitution replaces d_old with the literal t, and any future substitutions will affect the digits in t.\n\nBut how do we compute the val and len of d_old after this substitution?\n\nWait, the val and len for d_old should represent the value of the expansion of d_old after all substitutions up to this point. Since the substitution replaces d_old with t, the expansion of d_old is now t. However, the t is a string that, when expanded, would be processed by future substitutions. But at the moment of substitution, the expansion of d_old is t, and the val and len for d_old should be the value of t and its length. However, when t is processed, the digits in t may have their own expansions. But since the substitution is applied now, and the t is not expanded further. Wait, no. Because the substitution replaces d_old with t. So, in the current string, the t is added as is. But in the future, when other substitutions are applied, the digits in t will be replaced. However, when we process the substitution, the val and len for d_old should be computed based on the current state of the expand map. Because when we later use the expansion of d_old, it's the t string, which may have digits that are expanded further.\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution replaces d_old with the string t. However, the t is not expanded during this substitution. The expansion of the digits in t will happen in future substitutions. Therefore, when we process this substitution, the expansion of d_old is t, and the val and len for d_old should be the value of t (as a number) and its length. However, since t may contain digits that have their own expansions (which are already accounted for in the val and len of those digits), but during this substitution, the t is not expanded. Therefore, the val and len of d_old should be computed as the value and length of the string t. But how?\n\nWait, this is conflicting. Let me think with an example.\n\nSuppose the substitution is '2 → 00', and the current expand map for '0' is '1' (i.e., when you expand '0', you get '1'). So, the substitution replaces all '2's in the current string with '00'. But the '00' is a literal string. However, in the current state, the '0's in the string would be expanded to '1's during future substitutions. But during this substitution, the '00' is added as is. So, the val and len for '2' should be the value of '00' (which is 0) and length 2. However, in reality, the '0's in '00' would later be replaced by '1's, so the actual value of '2' would be 11, which is 11 mod MOD. But according to the current approach, the val of '2' is 0, which is not correct.\n\nSo, this suggests that the approach of tracking the val and len of each digit as the value and length of the literal string t is incorrect. Because the substitution replaces d_old with t, and t's digits may be expanded in future substitutions. Therefore, the val and len of d_old should not be the value of t, but the value of the expansion of t, considering the current state of the expand map.\n\nAh, right. Because when we replace d_old with t, the t is processed as per the current expansion rules. Wait, no. Because the substitution replaces the current instances of d_old in the string with t. The t is a literal string. But the current string is the result of all previous substitutions. So, when the substitution is applied, the t is inserted into the string as is. However, the digits in t will be expanded in future substitutions. Therefore, when we process the substitution, the val and len for d_old should be computed as the value and length of the string t, but with the digits in t expanded according to the current expand map. Because when the substitution is applied, the t is added to the string, and during future substitutions, those digits will be replaced.\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution replaces the current instances of d_old in the string with t. The t is a string that is not expanded during this substitution. However, in the current string, the digits in t are not expanded yet. They will be expanded during future substitutions.\n\nSo, for example, if we have a substitution \"2 → 00\", and the current expand map for '0' is '1', then when we process this substitution, the '00' is added to the string. But the '0's are not expanded during this substitution. They will be expanded in future substitutions.\n\nTherefore, the val and len of d_old should be the value of the string t (without any expansion), and the length of t. But that would not account for future substitutions. However, when we process future substitutions, the expand map for the digits in t will be updated, and thus, the val and len of d_old would need to be recomputed based on those changes. But how?\n\nThis seems like a problem. Because if we set the val and len of d_old to the value of t, then when future substitutions change the val and len of the digits in t, the val and len of d_old would not automatically update. Therefore, this approach would not work.\n\nSo, how to model this correctly?\n\nAlternative idea: whenever a substitution is made for d_old, we need to set the expansion of d_old to be the expansion of t. Because when you replace d_old with t, the t is processed according to the current expand map. Wait, but no. The substitution replaces d_old with the literal string t, not with the expansion of t. So, the t is added to the string as is, and future substitutions will affect the digits in t.\n\nBut then, the expansion of d_old is t. However, when we process future substitutions, the digits in t may be replaced. Therefore, the expansion of d_old is t, but when the digits in t are replaced, the expansion of d_old would change. However, this seems impossible to track unless we can recompute the expansion of d_old whenever any of the digits in t are updated.\n\nThis suggests that the expand map is not sufficient, and that we need a way to dynamically compute the value and length of each digit's expansion based on the current expand map.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to represent for each digit d, the expansion as a function that depends on the current expand map. Then, when a substitution is made, we can update the expand map for that digit, and when computing the value of the entire string, we process each character in the original string, and recursively expand it according to the current expand map.\n\nBut how can we compute the value of the entire string efficiently?\n\nLet me think again. Let's say that for each digit d, we have a way to compute its value and length. When we process the original string s, which is a sequence of digits, we can compute the total value by processing each character in s, and for each character, multiply the current total by 10^len(d) and add val(d), mod MOD.\n\nBut to compute this, we need to know for each digit in the original string, the value and length of its expansion. So, during the substitution steps, we need to keep track of val and len for each digit, where val[d] is the value of the expansion of d, and len[d] is the length of that expansion.\n\nNow, the key is that when a substitution replaces d_old with t, the expansion of d_old becomes the expansion of t. Because when you replace d_old with t, the t is processed according to the current expand map. Wait, no. The substitution replaces the current instances of d_old with the string t. The t is a literal string, but when the substitution is applied, the t is added to the string. However, the expansion of the digits in t will be handled by future substitutions. Therefore, the expansion of d_old is the string t. However, the expansion of t is the expansion of each of its digits. Therefore, the val and len of d_old can be computed based on the val and len of each digit in t.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the substitution as replacing d_old with the expansion of t. But no, the substitution is replacing d_old with the literal string t. However, the expansion of t is determined by the current expand map. Because during substitution, the t is inserted into the string. Then, when future substitutions are processed, the digits in t will be replaced.\n\nSo, when we process the substitution \"d_old → t\", we need to compute the value and length of the string t, considering the current expand map for each digit in t. Because the t is inserted into the string, and when we later process the original string, the expansion of d_old will be the expansion of t, which depends on the current expand map.\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution replaces d_old with t. So, when we later expand d_old, it's the string t. However, during the substitution, the t is a literal string. But the digits in t may be expanded in future substitutions. Therefore, the val and len of d_old should be computed as the value and length of the string t, but the digits in t are expanded according to the current expand map. Because when the substitution is processed, the t is inserted into the string, and the current expand map determines how the digits in t are expanded.\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because during substitution, the t is added to the string as is. The digits in t are not expanded during this substitution. They will be expanded in future substitutions. Therefore, the expansion of d_old is the string t. But the expansion of the digits in t is determined by future substitutions. Therefore, the val and len of d_old should be the value and length of the string t. However, this would not account for future substitutions. So, this approach would not work.\n\nBut this seems like a dead end. How else can we model this?\n\nAlternative approach: think of the substitutions as a series of replacements, and for each substitution, we need to update the mappings in a way that allows us to compute the final value.\n\nLet me consider that each substitution is applied to the current string. However, since the string can be very large, we can't store it. Instead, we can track for each digit, the value and length of the expansion as follows:\n\nWhen a substitution is applied (d_old → t), we need to replace all occurrences of d_old in the current string with t. However, since we can't track the entire string, we need to track for each digit, what it would expand to. However, when we replace d_old with t, the expansion of d_old is now t. However, the expansion of t is determined by the current mappings of its digits. Wait, no. Because when the substitution is applied, the t is added to the string, and the current mappings for the digits in t are already in place. Therefore, the expansion of d_old is the expansion of t, which is the concatenation of the expansions of each digit in t. Therefore, when processing the substitution, the val and len of d_old should be computed as the value and length of the expansion of t, which can be computed by combining the val and len of each digit in t.\n\nYes! This seems to be the correct way.\n\nSo, for example, when we process a substitution \"d_old → t\", we need to compute the value and length of the expansion of t. Since the expansion of t is the concatenation of the expansion of each character in t. Therefore, for each character c in t, we can get its current val[c] and len[c], and compute the combined value and length of the entire t string.\n\nSo, the process for substitution is:\n\n- For the string t, compute its value and length based on the current expand map (val and len for each digit).\n- Set the val[d_old] and len[d_old] to this computed value and length.\n\nThis way, whenever a substitution is made, the val and len of d_old are updated to reflect the expansion of the string t, which is based on the current state of the expand map. Then, any future substitutions that affect the digits in t will automatically affect the val and len of d_old, because when those substitutions are processed, the val and len of the digits in t will be updated, and if d_old is involved in another substitution, the new val and len will be computed accordingly.\n\nWait, no. Because once we set val[d_old] and len[d_old] to the value and length of the expansion of t, those values are fixed. Unless there's a future substitution that affects d_old again. For example, if d_old is replaced with another string, then the val and len of d_old will be updated again.\n\nSo, this approach seems correct. Because when we process a substitution for d_old, we compute the expansion of t as per the current mappings, and then set d_old's val and len to that. This way, even if the digits in t are later changed by substitutions, those changes will not affect the current val and len of d_old, because those were computed based on the current state at the time of substitution. However, if another substitution is made for d_old, then the new substitution will overwrite the val and len of d_old with the new expansion of t.\n\nBut that's exactly what should happen. Because when a substitution is made for d_old, it replaces all instances of d_old in the current string with t. The current string is built using the current expand map. Therefore, the expansion of t is computed using the current expand map. Any future changes to the expand map for digits in t will not affect the previous substitutions, because those substitutions have already been applied. Only future substitutions for d_old will change its expansion.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nLet me take the example where the substitution is '2 → 00', and then '0 → 1'.\n\nInitially, val[2] = 2, len[2] = 1; val[0] = 0, len[0] = 1.\n\nFirst substitution: '2 → 00'. To compute the expansion of '00', we take each character in '00' and combine their val and len.\n\nThe expansion of '00' is 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0, and length 2. So val[2] is set to 0, len[2] is 2.\n\nThen, substitution '0 → 1'. Now, val[0] is 1, len[0] is 1.\n\nNow, if we have a digit '2' in the original string, its expansion is val[2] = 0, len[2] = 2. However, the actual expansion of '2' would be '00', which would then be replaced by '11' due to the substitution of '0 → 1'. But according to our model, the val[2] is still 0. That's a problem.\n\nWait, why is this happening? Because when we processed the substitution '2 → 00', we computed the expansion of '00' based on the current val and len of '0', which was 0. So the value of '00' was 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. But after the substitution of '0 → 1', the expansion of '00' would be 11, which is 11 mod MOD. However, the model doesn't account for this, because the substitution for '0' happened after the substitution for '2'.\n\nThis suggests that the model is incorrect. Because the substitution for '2' was processed based on the current state of the expand map at that time, but future substitutions can change the expand map of the digits in t, leading to the val and len of d_old being outdated.\n\nSo, this approach would not capture the fact that the expansion of '2' should now be '11', not '00'.\n\nHmm, this is a critical problem. What's the solution?\n\nThe root of the problem is that when we process a substitution for d_old, we set its val and len to the expansion of t, which is computed based on the current state of the expand map. However, if the expand map for digits in t changes later, the val and len of d_old should also change, because the expansion of t would now be different.\n\nBut how can we track that? It seems impossible unless we can recompute the val and len of d_old whenever any of the digits in t are updated. But that would be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative idea: whenever a substitution is made, we need to recompute the val and len of all digits that can be affected by this substitution. But how?\n\nWait, but the substitution replaces d_old with t. The digits in t may be any digits, and their val and len may change in the future. However, the val and len of d_old are computed based on the current state of the expand map. Once that substitution is processed, the val and len of d_old are fixed until another substitution for d_old is processed.\n\nIn the example above, the substitution for '2' was processed when '0' had val 0. Later, when '0' is substituted to 1, the val of '2' is not automatically updated. So, the model is wrong.\n\nSo, the problem is that the substitution replaces d_old with the expansion of t at that moment. However, future substitutions can change the expansion of digits in t, which would mean that the expansion of d_old is now different. But the model does not account for this.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to model the substitution as replacing d_old with t, and then whenever we compute the value of the string, we need to expand each digit according to the current expand map. However, this would require that when we compute the value of the string, we process the original string and for each digit in it, expand it recursively according to the current expand map.\n\nBut how to compute the value of the entire string efficiently, given that the expand map can change over time.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe maintain for each digit d, the expansion string (as a string), but this is not feasible for large substitutions. However, we can maintain for each digit d, the value and length of its expansion. But when a substitution is made, we need to update the value and length of d_old based on the current value and length of the digits in t. However, this approach would not account for future changes to the digits in t. But this is the same problem as before.\n\nSo, what's the alternative?\n\nPerhaps we need to model the substitutions in a way that allows us to compute the value of the entire string based on the original string and the substitutions, without having to track the val and len for each digit. Let me think of the problem in terms of dependency graphs.\n\nEach substitution for a digit d replaces it with a string t. So, the expansion of d is now t. However, the expansion of t depends on the current expand map of its digits.\n\nBut when we process the substitutions in order, the expansion of each digit is determined by the substitutions applied up to that point.\n\nSo, for example, if we have substitutions:\n\n1. 2 → 00\n2. 0 → 1\n\nThen, the expansion of 2 is 00, which is expanded to 11 after substitution 2. But how do we model this?\n\nThe key is that the substitution for 0 happens after the substitution for 2. So, when we compute the value of the original string, which may contain 2s, we need to expand them according to the latest substitutions.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the correct way is to model the substitutions in reverse order. For example, when processing the substitutions in reverse order, we can build a mapping from each digit to its current expansion. Let me think.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem as follows: the final expansion of the original string is determined by applying all substitutions in the order given. However, each substitution replaces all occurrences of a digit in the current string. So, the substitutions are applied in sequence, and each substitution affects the current state of the string.\n\nBut since we can't store the string, we need to find a way to compute the final value based on the substitutions.\n\nAnother idea: think of the substitutions as a series of replacements that can be represented as a tree. For example, each substitution for a digit d sets its expansion to t. However, if t contains digits that are later substituted, those substitutions will affect the expansion of d.\n\nSo, the expansion of a digit d is the string that results from applying all substitutions in order, starting from the original d.\n\nBut how can we compute the value of the original string s after all substitutions?\n\nLet me think of it as follows: for each character in the original string, we need to compute the value of its expansion after all substitutions. Then, the total value is the concatenation of all these expansions, which can be computed as the sum over each character's contribution multiplied by appropriate powers of 10.\n\nTo compute this, we need for each digit d in the original string, the value and length of its expansion after all substitutions.\n\nThe challenge is to compute these values efficiently.\n\nSo, how to compute for each digit d, the value and length of its expansion after all substitutions?\n\nLet me think of this as a dynamic programming problem. Initially, for each digit d, its expansion is itself. Then, for each substitution in order, we process it and update the expansion of the corresponding digit.\n\nBut how to update the expansion's value and length?\n\nWhen a substitution replaces d_old with t, the new expansion of d_old is t. However, the expansion of t is determined by the current expansions of its characters. So, for example, if t is \"ab\", then the expansion of d_old is the concatenation of the expansion of a and the expansion of b. Therefore, the value of the expansion of d_old is (value_a * 10^length_b + value_b) mod MOD, and the length is length_a + length_b.\n\nThis suggests that whenever we process a substitution for d_old, we need to compute the value and length of the string t, using the current value and length of each character in t.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nFor each substitution \"d_old -> t\":\n\n   Compute the value and length of the string t by iterating through each character in t and combining their current value and length.\n\n   Update val[d_old] and len[d_old] to be this computed value and length.\n\nThis way, even if future substitutions change the expansions of the characters in t, the val and len of d_old will not change, because they were computed at the time of substitution. However, if another substitution is made for d_old, it will overwrite the val and len with the new computed value and length based on the current state.\n\nLet's test this with the previous example.\n\nExample:\n\nInitial substitutions:\n\nOriginal string: '2'\n\nSubstitutions:\n\n1. 2 → 00\n\nAt this point, the current val and len for 0 is 0 and 1.\n\nProcessing substitution 2 → 00:\n\nt is \"00\".\n\nCompute the value of \"00\" as follows:\n\nFor the first '0', value is 0, length 1.\n\nFor the second '0', value is 0, length 1.\n\nThe combined value is 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\nThe combined length is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, val[2] = 0, len[2] = 2.\n\nThen, substitution 0 → 1:\n\nProcessing this substitution, we compute the value and length of t, which is \"1\".\n\nFor '1', value is 1, length 1.\n\n",
