Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is to take the first two strings, concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in that concatenated string matches exactly with the count in the third string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to use the Counter class from the collections module. For example, we can create a Counter for the combined guest and host names, and another Counter for the pile. Then compare the two Counters.\n\nWait, but what about the order? Since the pile is a permutation of the combined letters, the counts must be exactly the same.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Combine the first two into a single string.\n3. Check if the count of each character in the combined string equals the count in the third string.\n\nBut how to handle the reading of input? The input is three lines. So for each test case, perhaps?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input, the input is given as a list of three elements. Wait, no, the sample input shows something like:\n\nThe first input line is ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...], but that's probably a representation of the input. Wait, the actual input is three lines. For example, in the first example, the three lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo for each test case, we need to read three lines. But the problem says that the input is three lines. So the code needs to read three lines from stdin.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows that there are three test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input is a list of three elements, each being three lines? Or perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases. Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nOutput:\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nAh, so each element in the input list represents a separate test case. Each test case has three lines. So for each test case, we have three lines. So the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, but how is the input structured? Because the problem says that the input consists of three lines. But the sample input seems to have three test cases, each with three lines.\n\nWait, maybe the original problem is that the user is supposed to read three lines for each test case, but in the sample input, there are three test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is three lines. So perhaps the actual problem is that the program must process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile...\n\nSo for each test case, the input is three lines. However, the sample input shows three different test cases. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each with three lines. But how does that work?\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the first input is a list of three elements, each being three lines. But that's probably a way to represent the input for multiple test cases. So for example, the first test case has three lines: guest, host, pile. Then the second test case has three lines, etc.\n\nBut how is the input provided in reality? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. But the problem description here says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not standard. Maybe the actual input is three lines per test case, and the code needs to process multiple test cases. But how many?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input is three test cases. For example, the first test case's input is three lines:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich outputs YES.\n\nThe second test case's input is:\n\nPAPAINO",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the character counts in the pile exactly match the combined character counts of the guest and host names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case has three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: For each test case, concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Character Count Check**: Use a frequency counter to compare the characters in the combined string of the guest and host with the characters in the pile. If both frequency counters match exactly, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read all input lines\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    \n    # Process each test case\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        \n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of lines, stripping any empty lines.\n- **Processing Test Cases**: Each test case is processed in chunks of three lines. The first two lines are the guest and host names, and the third line is the pile of letters.\n- **Character Frequency Check**: Using `Counter` from the `collections` module, we count the frequency of each character in both the combined guest-host string and the pile. If these counters match, the letters can be rearranged to form the names, otherwise they cannot.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for exact character matches using frequency counting, which is optimal for this type of problem.",
