Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. Each takes turns, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the total sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of moves (H for Homer, M for Marge) that achieves this maximum total.\n\nHmm. So the key is to choose, at each step, whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit, such that the total sum is maximized. But since both players are trying to maximize their own totals, but we need to maximize the sum of both, maybe there's a way to model this with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that at any point, the number of digits left is 2n - k, where k is the number of digits already taken. Wait, but the initial state is that there are 2n digits. Each move reduces the length by one. The process continues until all digits are taken.\n\nBut for the DP approach, the state needs to capture the current position in the string A, as well as how many moves each player has made so far. Because the choice of who takes the next digit depends on how many moves each has left.\n\nWait, since each player must make exactly n moves, the number of moves remaining for Homer and Marge can be tracked. For example, if Homer has made h moves and Marge has made m moves, then the total moves so far is h + m. Since each move is either H or M, the next move can be H only if h < n, and M only if m < n.\n\nBut the problem is that the total number of steps is 2n. So for the DP state, perhaps we can track the current index in the string (i.e., how many digits have been taken already), and the count of how many times Homer and Marge have taken digits. Wait, but since the total steps so far is i, and each step is either H or M, then the count for Homer is h = number of H's taken so far, and m = number of M's taken so far. But h + m = i. Also, since h can't exceed n and m can't exceed n.\n\nSo for the DP state, perhaps we can represent it as (pos, h), where pos is the current position (i.e., how many digits have been taken so far), and h is the number of moves Homer has made so far. Then, since m = pos - h, and m can't exceed n. Also, since the total steps is pos, and the next step will be either H or M.\n\nWait, but for each state (pos, h), the number of M moves is pos - h. So the state can be represented by pos and h. The maximum possible pos is 2n. And h can range from 0 to n. So the number of states is O(2n * n) = O(n^2), which for n up to 18 would be 18*36= 648 states. That's manageable.\n\nNow, for each state, we need to decide whether to take H or M next. But the decision depends on which choice leads to the maximum total sum. However, since the sum depends on the digits chosen by each player, we need to track the accumulated sum. Wait, but that's part of the DP state too. But that would be impossible because the sum can be very large (digits are up to 9, and 2n digits, so sum could be up to 9*2n * 10^{something}... but that's not feasible to track directly in the state.\n\nWait, but the problem is not to compute the actual sum, but to find the sequence of moves that gives the maximum total sum. However, the actual sum depends on the digits collected by each player. So, the DP needs to track the sum, but that's impossible for n=18, since the sum can be up to 9*18*10^18, which is way too big for memoization.\n\nHmm. So perhaps there's a smarter way to model the DP. Let me think again. The total sum is the sum of the digits that Homer takes multiplied by their respective positions (since each digit is added to the end of his number, so the first digit he takes is the most significant digit, etc.). Wait, no. Wait, the way the digits are taken: when a player takes a digit, it's the leftmost digit of the remaining A. So, for example, if the original A is 1234, and Homer takes the first digit (1), then the next digit is 2, etc. So the digits taken by Homer are added to his number in the order they are taken. So, the first digit he takes is the first digit of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a number A, where each player takes exactly n turns, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers formed by the digits they take.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach where the state is defined by the current position in the string and the number of moves Homer has already made. This allows us to efficiently explore all possible sequences of moves.\n2. **Recursive Decision Making**: At each step, we decide whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit based on which choice leads to a higher total sum. This decision is made recursively while keeping track of the current state to avoid redundant calculations.\n3. **Memoization**: To optimize the recursive solution, we use memoization to store results of subproblems, ensuring each state is computed only once.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    length = 2 * n\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(pos, h):\n        # pos: current position (number of digits taken so far)\n        # h: number of moves Homer has made so far\n        m = pos - h\n        if pos == 2 * n:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        # Next move can be H if h < n, or M if m < n\n        max_total = -1\n        best_move = ''\n        if h < n:\n            # Homer takes the next digit\n            digit = int(A[pos])\n            # The contribution to the total is digit * 10^(n - h - 1)\n            # But since we are maximizing the total, we can just consider the digit value\n            # However, since the actual total depends on the digits collected, we need to compute it\n            # Wait, but how?

The decision is based on which choice leads to a higher total prize, considering the contribution of the current digit and the optimal solution for the remaining digits.\n3. **Memoization**: The `@functools.lru_cache` decorator is used to memoize results of subproblems, ensuring efficient computation by avoiding redundant calculations.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible sequences of moves while ensuring the optimal solution is found using dynamic programming and memoization.",
