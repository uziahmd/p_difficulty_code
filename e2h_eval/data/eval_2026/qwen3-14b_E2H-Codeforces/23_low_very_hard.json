            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The answer is the minimum number of tiles required to achieve either of those.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. So the first thing is to parse these three tiles.\n\nThe output is the minimum number of draws needed. Let's think about all possible cases.\n\nLet me think: for the current three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to get a mentsu.\n\nBut how to check if the current three tiles can form a mentsu? Well, for a triplet, all three must be same. For a sequence, they must be three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nSo first, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nFor example, if the three tiles are all same suit but not consecutive, maybe adding one tile can make a sequence. Or if there's two same tiles, maybe adding another same tile to make a triplet.\n\nBut since the problem allows adding any number of tiles, but we need the minimal, perhaps we can consider all possible ways to reach a mentsu with minimal steps.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCheck whether the current tiles already have a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nOtherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu. Let's think about all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about the different possibilities for the existing three tiles.\n\nCase 1: All three tiles are same. Then, it's a triplet. So answer is 0. But if the three are same, then that's a koutsu.\n\nWait, the example given in the input includes '9m 9m 9m' which outputs 0.\n\nCase 2: The three tiles can form a sequence. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. Then answer is 0.\n\nSo first, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal steps.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the total tiles (original + added) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nSo, for example, if the original three tiles can't form a mentsu, but adding one tile can make a mentsu, then answer is 1.\n\nSo the question is, for the original three tiles, what is the minimal number of tiles to add to reach a mentsu.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nPossible approaches:\n\nFor each possible way to form a mentsu (triplet or sequence), compute the minimal number of tiles needed to reach that mentsu, and then take the minimum over all possibilities.\n\nSo, for example, for the current three tiles, check all possible triplets or sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles, and find the minimal required.\n\nBut how to check all possibilities?\n\nLet me think for each possible mentsu type (triplet or sequence) that could be formed with the current tiles plus some added tiles.\n\nFirst, check for triplet possibilities:\n\nA triplet requires three identical tiles. So, suppose the current tiles have some counts of each tile. For example, if there are two of a certain tile, then adding one more would make a triplet. So for each tile type present in the original three, check how many are present. If there are two, then adding one more gives a triplet. If there is one, then adding two. If none, then adding three.\n\nBut perhaps the current tiles have multiple types, but maybe we can form a triplet by adding tiles. For example, if the original three are 1m, 2m, 3m. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add two more of any tile. But that's probably not the optimal way. However, maybe in some cases, it's better to form a triplet than a sequence.\n\nBut the minimal steps would be to find the minimal between the options.\n\nAlternatively, for the triplet case, the minimal steps required would be:\n\nFor each possible tile type (like 1m, 2p, etc.), determine how many of that tile are present in the original three. Then, the number of tiles needed to make a triplet is 3 - count. For example, if there are two of that tile, then 1 needed.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw in order to form a valid meld (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. The solution involves checking both possible types of melds and determining the minimal steps required to achieve either.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Meld**: First, check if the current three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence. If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Triplet Possibility**: For each tile type present in the current hand, calculate how many more tiles are needed to form a triplet.\n3. **Sequence Possibility**: Check if the current tiles can be extended to form a sequence by adding one or two tiles. This involves checking all possible sequences that can include the current tiles.\n4. **Determine Minimum**: Calculate the minimum number of tiles required from both triplet and sequence possibilities and return the smallest value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    tiles = input.split()\n    \n    # Parse the three tiles\n    tile_counts = {}\n    suits = []\n    numbers = []\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = t[0]\n        suit = t[1]\n        suits.append(suit)\n        numbers.append(num)\n        key = (num, suit)\n        if key in tile_counts:\n            tile_counts[key] += 1\n        else:\n            tile_counts[key] = 1\n\n    # Check if already has a mentsu\n    # Check for triplet\n    has_triplet = any(count == 3 for count in tile_counts.values())\n    if has_triplet:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Check for sequence\n    # All must be same suit\n    if len(set(suits)) == 1:\n        nums = sorted([int(n) for n in numbers])\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[0] + 2:\n            print(0)\n            return\n\n    # Now, need to find the minimal draws\n    min_draws = float('inf')\n\n    # Check for triplet possibilities\n    for (num, suit), count in tile_counts.items():\n        needed = 3 -
