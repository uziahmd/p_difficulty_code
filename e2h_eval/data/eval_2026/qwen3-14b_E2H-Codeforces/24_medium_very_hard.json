She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nSo, Luba has n tabs open, numbered 1 to n from left to right. The mouse is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs except those from l to r inclusive. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to do this. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but within the current a and b, which are the min and max of the unclosed tabs), or close all tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is figuring out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to get to the desired state with the least time.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. First, check if the current tabs already satisfy the condition. Like, if l=1 and r=n, then nothing needs to be done. So the answer is 0. Also, if the current position is already in the [l, r] range, maybe some steps can be saved.\n\nBut the main thing is that she needs to close tabs outside of [l, r]. So, the tabs to the left of l and to the right of r must be closed. But how?\n\nThe key here is that closing tabs can be done in one second, but you have to be positioned at the correct spot. For example, to close all tabs to the left of the current position, you need to be at some position i, and then perform the close operation. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut when you close tabs, the a and b values change. For example, if you close all tabs to the left of i, then the new a becomes i. So, the movement is constrained by the current a and b.\n\nBut since we're trying to close tabs outside of [l, r], perhaps we can model this as needing to close the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r). Let's think about each part separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider that the final a and b are l and r. So during the process, after closing all tabs outside [l, r], the a and b will be l and r.\n\nBut how to reach the positions where we can perform the close operations?\n\nLet me think about the steps required:\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, maybe we can close the left and right parts.\n\nBut to close the left part (tabs before l), we need to be at position l, then close all to the left. Similarly, to close the right part, we need to be at position r, then close all to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to close both in fewer steps. But perhaps the minimal steps would involve moving to the correct positions to perform these closes.\n\nBut what if l is 1? Then there are no tabs to the left of l, so no need to close them. Similarly for r = n.\n\nSo first, determine whether we need to close left and/or right parts.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed for each part:\n\nFor the left part (tabs < l):\n\nIf l is 1, nothing to do. Otherwise, we need to close all tabs to the left of l. How?\n\nTo do that, we need to be at position l. Because when you are at position l, closing all tabs to the left (which are from a to l-1, but since a is initially 1, but after closing, it's updated).\n\nWait, but during the process, the a and b might be changing. However, since the final state is that the only open tabs are [l, r], perhaps we can think of the problem as needing to perform two operations: close all tabs to the left of l, and close all tabs to the right of r.\n\nBut how to do that optimally.\n\nLet me think about the steps for closing the left part. Suppose that we need to close tabs to the left of l. So, the first step is to reach position l. Then, perform the close operation. That takes (time to move to l) + 1 second (for the close).\n\nSimilarly, for the right part: reach position r, then perform the close. Time is (time to move to r) + 1.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range? Then, moving to l or r might take some steps.\n\nBut also, maybe there's an optimal way to do both closes. For example, if we can reach a position that allows us to close both parts in some way. But I think that's not possible, because closing one part changes the a and b, which affects movement. For example, if you close the left part first, then the a becomes l, so moving to the right part (r) is possible.\n\nBut let's think of the two cases: closing left first, then right, or vice versa.\n\nLet me think of the example given in the first input:\n\nInput is 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The desired tabs are 2,3,4. So the initial tabs are 1-6. The steps in the example are moving to 2, close left (tabs 1), then move to 3, then to 4, then close right (tabs 5 and 6). Let's see how that works.\n\nIn this case, the steps for the left part: need to be at l=2. The initial position is 3. So moving left once (to 2). Then close left (which closes tabs 1). Then, the a is now 2, and the b is 6. Now, to close the right part (tabs 5 and 6), need to be at position 4. From 2, moving to 3 (1 sec), then to 4 (another sec). Then close right (tabs 5-6). So total steps: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close) + 2 (move to 4) + 1 (close) = 5 steps. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, if we first close the right part. Let's see: initial position is 3. To close the right part (tabs 5,6), need to be at position 4. So move from 3 to 4 (1 sec). Close right (tabs 5-6). Then, the a is 1, b is 4. Then need to close tabs to the left of l=2. So need to be at 2. From current position 4, move left to 3 (1 sec), then to 2 (another sec). Close left (tabs 1). Total steps: 1 (move to 4) + 1 (close) + 2 (move to 2) + 1 (close) = 5. Same total.\n\nSo regardless of the order, it's same steps. So maybe the order doesn't matter. But in some cases, maybe it does.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal steps?\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\n- Determine whether we need to close left (if l > 1) and/or right (if r < n).\n\nThen, for each of these, compute the steps needed to reach the required positions (l for left close, r for right close) and add the time.\n\nBut how to calculate the movement steps.\n\nBut movement steps depend on the initial position and the current a and b. However, since initially, a=1 and b=n, and during the movement steps, the a and b haven't been changed yet. Because the movement steps are done before any closing steps. So, for example, when moving to reach l or r, the movement is done in the initial state (since the first action is to move, then close).\n\nWait, but if you first close one side, then the movement for the other side is constrained by the new a and b.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to first move to the required positions, then perform the closes. Because if you first close one side, then the movement for the other side may be shorter. Or not?\n\nLet me think of an example where closing one side first reduces the steps needed for the other.\n\nSuppose n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3. So need to close tabs 1,4,5.\n\nIf I first close the left part (tabs <2). To do that, need to be at 2. Current position is 3. Move left once (1 sec). Close left (tabs 1). Then, the a is 2, b is 5. Now, need to close tabs 4 and 5. To do that, need to be at 3 (since r=3). Then, close right (tabs 4-5). So from position 2, move to 3 (1 sec). Close right. Total steps: 1 (move) + 1 (close) + 1 (move) + 1 (close) = 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, if I first close the right part. Need to be at 3 (current position). Close right (tabs 4-5). Then, a is 1, b is 3. Then, need to close tabs to the left of l=2. Need to be at 2. From current position 3, move left once (1 sec). Close left (tabs 1). Total steps: 1 (close) + 1 (move) + 1 (close) = 3 steps. Which is better.\n\nAh! So in this case, the order matters. So the previous approach of assuming that we need to move to l and r in the initial configuration may not be optimal. Therefore, the order in which we perform the closing operations can affect the total time.\n\nThis complicates things. How can I model this?\n\nHmm. So the problem requires considering all possibilities of closing left and right, and choosing the order that gives the minimal time.\n\nBut since there are only two possibilities (close left first, then right; or close right first, then left), perhaps we can compute both options and choose the minimum.\n\nBut also, there's the possibility that we don't need to close one of them (like if l=1, then no left to close). So the steps would vary based on whether we need to close left and/or right.\n\nSo, let's break it down into cases.\n\nCase 1: No need to close left (l=1) and no need to close right (r=n). Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Need to close left and right.\n\nWe have two options: close left first, then right; or close right first, then left.\n\nFor each option, calculate the time required.\n\nCase 3: Need to close only left.\n\nThen, the time is the time to reach l, plus 1 second for closing.\n\nCase 4: Need to close only right.\n\nTime is the time to reach r, plus 1 second for closing.\n\nBut how to calculate the time to reach l or r, considering the current position and the a and b of the current state.\n\nBut in the initial state, a is 1 and b is n. So, for the first movement steps (before any closing), the movement is allowed between 1 and n. So, the time to reach l from pos is |pos - l| steps. Because you can move directly left or right.\n\nWait, but in the example above where closing right first was better, the movement to reach the position to close the left part was easier.\n\nSo, for example, in the case where we need to close both left and right:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then right.\n\nTime to reach l: |pos - l|. Then 1 second to close left. Now, a becomes l, and b remains n. Now, to reach r, we need to move from l to r. But since the current a is l, and the current b is n. So the movement is allowed from l to r. So the steps to move from l to r is |r - l| steps. Then 1 second to close right. So total steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then left.\n\nTime to reach r: |pos - r|. Then 1 second to close right. Now, a is 1, and b is r. Then, to reach l, need to move from current position (r) to l. But since a is 1 and b is r, the movement is allowed. So steps is |r - l|. Then 1 second to close left. Total steps: |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut in the example where n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3. So l=2, r=3. So:\n\nOption 1: Close left first. |3-2|=1, then |3-2|=1. So total 1+1 + 2 = 4.\n\nOption 2: Close right first. |3-3|=0, then |3-2|=1. So 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. Which is better.\n\nSo the minimal between the two options is 3.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo for the case where both left and right need to be closed, we need to calculate both options and take the minimum.\n\nBut what about other possibilities? For example, maybe there's a way to close both in a single step? Well, no. Because closing left or right only closes one side. So you need to perform two operations.\n\nSo the minimal steps for both cases is min( option1, option2 )\n\nBut what if the initial position is already in the required area?\n\nFor example, if l=2, r=4, and pos=3. Then, the steps for closing left and right are as discussed.\n\nAnother example: suppose l=2, r=4, pos=4. So need to close left (tabs <2) and right (tabs>4). So, for option 1: close left first. To reach l=2, from pos=4, steps is 2. Then close left. Then move to r=4 (steps 0) and close right. Total steps 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4. Option 2: close right first. pos is 4, so steps to reach r=4 is 0. Close right (tabs>4, which is none, since r=4 and n is say 5. Wait, but in this case, r is 4, and if n is 5, then closing right would close tabs 5. So after that, a is 1, b is 4. Then, to close left, need to reach l=2. So steps from 4 to 2 is 2 steps. So total steps: 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. So same as option 1.\n\nSo, in this case, the options are same.\n\nSo, the formula for both options is:\n\nFor closing left first: time_to_l + 1 + time_to_move_from_l_to_r + 1\n\nBut time_to_move_from_l_to_r is |r - l| steps. Because after closing left, the current position is l. Then, moving to r takes |r - l| steps.\n\nSimilarly for closing right first: time_to_r + 1 + |r - l| steps + 1.\n\nSo the total steps for both options is:\n\noption1 = (|pos - l|) + |r - l| + 2\n\noption2 = (|pos - r|) + |r - l| + 2 \n\nWait, no. Because the |r - l| is the steps between l and r. So for option1, after closing left, you are at l. Then you need to move to r. So steps is |r - l|. For option2, after closing right, you are at r. Then you need to move to l, which is |r - l| steps. So yes, the |r - l| term is same for both options.\n\nThus, the difference between the options is |pos - l| vs |pos - r|. So the minimal between (|pos - l| + |r - l| + 2) and (|pos - r| + |r - l| + 2) is the same as (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r| )) + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut wait, that's only for the case where both left and right need to be closed.\n\nSo, in this case, the minimal steps would be min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |r - l| + 2 ?\n\nNo, because the option1 is |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2, and option2 is |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2. So the min between them is (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r| )) + ... etc.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the minimal steps is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut wait, why is that? Because the |r - l| is added in both options, so it's common. So the difference is in the |pos - l| vs |pos - r|.\n\nSo, the total steps would be (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r| )) + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut let me test this with the earlier example where n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3. So |r - l| is 1. min(|3-2|, |3-3|) is min(1, 0) = 0. So total steps is 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: first sample input. n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. |r-l| is 2. min(|3-2|=1, |3-4|=1) → 1. So 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nNow, for the case when only left needs to be closed (r = n). Then steps are |pos - l| + 1. Because you need to move to l, then close left. Since after that, the right is already okay (since r =n, no need to close anything else).\n\nSimilarly, if only right needs to be closed (l=1), steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is not n? Then, need to close right. So steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the required area?\n\nLike, if l=1 and r=3, and pos is 2. Then, need to close tabs to the right of 3. So need to move to 3 (steps 1) and close. So 1 + 1 = 2 steps.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at r?\n\nLike, pos is 3. Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps needed depend on whether we need to close left, right, both, or none.\n\nSo, first, check if l == 1 and r == n. Then answer is 0.\n\nElse, check if l > 1 and r < n. Then need to close both.\n\nElse, if l > 1: need to close left only.\n\nElse, if r < n: need to close right only.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCompute whether left needs to be closed (left_needed = l > 1) and right_needed = r < n.\n\nIf not left_needed and not right_needed: return 0.\n\nElse if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   compute min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |r - l| + 2\n\nElse if left_needed:\n\n   return |pos - l| + 1\n\nElse if right_needed:\n\n   return |pos - r| + 1\n\nWait, but is this always correct?\n\nWait, let's take the example from the second sample input:\n\nSample input: 6 3 1 3. Output is 1.\n\nIn this case, l=1, r=3. So left_needed is false (since l=1), right_needed is true (since r=3 < 6). So steps are |pos - r| + 1. pos is 3. |3-3| is 0. So 0 +1 =1. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: third input is 5 2 1 5. So l=1, r=5. So no need to close anything. Output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: when l=1 and r=3, pos is 5. Then, need to close right. So steps is |5 - 3| + 1 = 2 +1 = 3. Let's think: move from 5 to 3 (steps 2), then close right (tabs 4,5). So 3 steps. Correct.\n\nBut what about when closing left and right is required, but the pos is already in the [l, r] range. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (tabs <2) and right (tabs>3). So, according to the formula: min(|3-2|, |3-3|) is 0. |r - l| is 1. So 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. Which is correct as discussed earlier.\n\nAnother example: pos is inside the [l, r] range, but need to close both sides. For example, l=2, r=4, pos=3. So steps is min(1, 1) + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5? Wait, no. The formula is min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + |r - l| + 2. For this case, |pos - l| is 1, |pos - r| is 1. min is 1. |r - l| is 2. So 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the first sample's scenario.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the pos is not in the [l, r] range?\n\nLet's say, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (tabs <2, which is tab 1) and right (tabs >3, which is 4,5). So, according to the formula: min(|1-2|, |1-3|) is 1. |r - l| is 1. So 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 steps.\n\nHow?\n\nOption 1: close left first. Steps to reach l=2 from pos=1: 1 step. Close left (tab 1). Then move to r=3 (steps 1). Close right (tabs 4 and 5). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. Correct.\n\nOption 2: close right first. Steps to reach r=3 from pos=1: 2 steps. Close right. Then move to l=2 (steps 1). Close left. Total steps: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. So the formula correctly chooses the first option.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nBut wait, the formula is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |r - l| + 2.\n\nSo in this example, min(1, 2) is 1. So 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula seems to handle that case.\n\nBut what about when the pos is outside the [l, r] range, but in the left side?\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So need to close left (tabs <2, which is tab 1), and right (tabs>4, which is 5). So formula: min( |1-2|=1, |1-4|=3) → 1. |r-l|=2. So total steps 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption 1: close left first. Move from 1 to 2 (1 step). Close left. Then move to 4 (steps 2). Close right. Total steps 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Correct.\n\nAnother option: close right first. Steps from 1 to 4 is 3 steps. Close right. Then move to 2 (steps 2). Close left. Total steps 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7. So the formula is correct.\n\nThus, the formula works.\n\nSo, this suggests that the formula for the case when both left and right are needed is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut wait, why is that? Because when you choose to go to either l or r first, then the movement between l and r is |r - l| steps. So the formula accounts for that.\n\nSo, putting all this together, the steps for the problem can be calculated as follows:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n: return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n   return min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n   return abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n   return abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nBut wait, what about when the pos is already in the [l, r] range? For example, l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, the formula for both left and right needed is min(1, 1) + 2 + 2 = 5 steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the pos is already at l or r?\n\nLike, l=2, r=4, pos=2. Then, min(0, 2) is 0. So 0 + 2 + 2 = 4 steps. Which would be: close left (already at l=2, so 1 sec. Then move to r=4 (steps 2), close right (1 sec). Total 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother example: pos is at r. So, l=2, r=4, pos=4. min( |4-2|=2, |4-4|=0) → 0. So 0 + 2 + 2 = 4 steps. Which is correct: close right (already at r, 1 sec. Then move to l (steps 2), close left (1 sec). Total 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 steps.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nBut what about when l and r are adjacent? Like l=2, r=3. Then, |r - l| is 1. So the formula for both left and right needed would be min(...)+1 + 2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input: 6 3 2 4. So l=2, r=4. left_needed is true (2>1), right_needed is true (4 <6). So formula: min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 ) + (4-2)=2 + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input: 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. left_needed is false (l=1), right_needed is true (r=3 <6). So steps are |3-3| +1 = 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 5 2 1 5. l=1, r=5. So no steps needed. Output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when pos is not in [l, r]. For example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So steps are min( |1-2|=1, |1-3|=2) + (3-2) + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo, this logic seems to cover all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the initial position is already in the [l, r] range, but we need to close both left and right? For example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (tabs <2) and right (tabs>3). So formula: min(|3-2|=1, |3-3|=0) → 0. |r - l| is 1. So 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: pos=2, l=2, r=3. Need to close right (tabs>3). So steps are |2 - 3| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo, this seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    res = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    res = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n    res = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    # this is impossible, since we checked if l==1 and r==n earlier.\n\n    res = 0\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r <n? Then, left_needed is false (l=1), right_needed is true. So code returns abs(pos - r) +1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let me think about another case where l=1 and r is less than n. For example, n=5, l=1, r=3. So need to close right. So steps is |pos - r| +1.\n\nBut what if pos is 4? Then, steps is |4-3| +1 = 1 +1 = 2. So move from 4 to 3 (1 step), then close right (tabs 4 and 5). Correct.\n\nAnother case: pos is 5, l=1, r=3. So steps is 5-3 =2 steps to move to r, then 1 sec to close. Total 3 steps.\n\nBut what if the user can close the right by moving to 3 (from 5, steps 2) and then close right. Yes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when l=1 and r= n? Then, output is 0.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r =n? For example, n=5, l=1, r=5. Then, output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when l=1 and r is less than n, but the pos is already to the right of r? For example, n=5, l=1, r=3, pos=4. Then steps is |4-3| +1 = 1 +1 = 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, l=2, r=3. pos=1. So left_needed is true (l=2>1), right_needed is true (r=3 <5). So formula: min( |1-2|=1, |1-3|=2) → 1. r - l is 1. So 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → output 5.\n\nAs per code: l=2>1, r=4<6. So min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1) → 1. r-l=2. So 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3 <6. So right_needed. steps: |3-3| +1 = 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1 and r=5. Output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3. So left_needed (2>1) and right_needed (3 <5). So min(|3-2|=1, |3-3|=0) → 0. r-l=1. 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So left_needed and right_needed. min(|1-2|=1, |1-4|=3) →1. r-l=2. 1+2+2=5 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead the input as four integers: n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n → print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    ans = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n    ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    ans = 0\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r <n? Then, left_needed is false, right_needed is true. So code returns abs(pos - r) +1.\n\nBut what if the pos is already in the [l, r] range? Like, l=1, r=3, pos=2. Then steps is |2-3| +1 = 1 +1= 2 steps. Which is correct: move to 3 (1 step) and close right (tabs 4 and 5). But in this case, the current position is already in the [l, r] range. So, the code is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=3, pos=3. Then steps is 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, what about when l=1 and r <n, but the pos is already at r? Then, steps is 0 +1=1. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input line as four integers. For example, the input could be given as a single line, like the examples. For example, the first sample input is '6 3 2 4'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a single line with four integers.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into four integers.\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, check if l == 1 and r == n: print(0)\n\nElse:\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    res = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    res = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n    res = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    res = 0\n\nprint(res)\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r <n, but the code is in the else part. For example, when l=1 and r <n, then left_needed is False, right_needed is True. So code enters the elif right_needed block. Correct.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r =n? Then the first condition is true, and 0 is printed.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r is n? For example, n=5, l=1, r=5. Then the code returns 0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r is n, but the pos is somewhere else? Well, since the code returns 0, because the required tabs are already present. So no need to do anything.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r =n, but the pos is not in the [l, r] range? But that's impossible, since pos is between 1 and n.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut let's think about some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, pos=1, l=1, r=1. Output 0.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=2. Output 0.\n\nEdge case 3: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=1. So need to close tabs to the right. So steps: |1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified range [l, r] while starting from a given position pos. The solution involves calculating the optimal steps to move the cursor and close the necessary tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] already includes all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no action is needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Closing Needs**: Check if tabs to the left of l (left_needed) or right of r (right_needed) need to be closed.\n3. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - **Both Left and Right Needed**: Calculate the minimum steps required by considering moving to either end of the range first and then closing the other side.\n   - **Only Left Needed**: Calculate steps to move to l and close the left tabs.\n   - **Only Right Needed**: Calculate steps to move to r and close the right tabs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needed = l > 1\n    right_needed = r < n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n        res = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    elif left_needed:\n        res = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_needed:\n        res = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        res = 0\n    print(res)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the required range [l, r] spans all tabs, no actions are needed.\n- **Left and Right Needed**: When both sides need closing, the optimal strategy involves moving to the nearest end of the range first, then moving to the other end to close the remaining tabs. This minimizes movement time.\n- **Single Side Needed**: Directly calculate the steps required to move to the respective end of the range and close the tabs on that side.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible scenarios efficiently, minimizing the number of movements and operations required to achieve the desired tab closure.",
