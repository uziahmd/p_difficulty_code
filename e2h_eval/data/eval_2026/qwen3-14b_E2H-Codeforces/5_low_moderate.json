Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what compatibility means here. A specific color (like 'a') is compatible with another specific color if they are the same. A question mark (?) can pair with any color, including another ?. So for example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right is '?', they can pair. Similarly, two ?s can pair. But if a left is 'a' and right is 'b', they can't pair.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. One approach is to first pair the specific colors that match exactly, then handle the question marks. But since question marks can be flexible, maybe there's a way to optimally use them.\n\nLet me break it down into steps:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots where both have specific colors and they match. For example, if l[i] is 'a' and r[j] is 'a', pair them. But how to do this optimally? Because if we pair them, that uses up both boots, so we need to make sure that we don't pair them in a way that leaves more question marks unpaired.\n\nBut maybe the optimal way is to first pair all the specific matches, then use the question marks to pair with remaining specific colors or other question marks.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a better way. Let's think of it as a bipartite graph problem where each left node is connected to right nodes that are compatible. Then the maximum matching would be the answer. However, with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp would be too slow. So we need an efficient approach without using general graph matching.\n\nSo we need a greedy approach that can be implemented efficiently.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider the following steps:\n\n- First, count the number of each color on the left and right, excluding question marks. For example, for each color c (a-z), count how many left boots have c, and how many right boots have c. The number of pairs that can be formed between these is the minimum of left[c] and right[c]. But wait, this is only if we pair same colors. However, this approach might not account for the fact that some of these could be paired with question marks, leading to a better overall total. Hmm, but maybe not. Let's think: if we pair as many same-color specific pairs as possible, then use the question marks to pair with remaining specific colors or other question marks.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can first pair specific colors with each other, then use the ?s to pair with remaining specific colors, then pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me outline a possible plan:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots with specific colors that match. For example, for each color c, take as many pairs as possible between left[c] and right[c]. But how to do this in practice? Since the order matters, but perhaps we can process each color and pair them. However, we need to track which boots are already used.\n\nBut with n up to 150,000, we need an O(n) approach.\n\nWait, but the problem requires not only the count but also the actual pairs. So we need to track which positions are used.\n\nAlternative idea: For each color c (excluding '?'), collect all the indices of left boots with color c, and similarly for right boots. Then for each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, if there are m left boots with color c and k right boots with color c, we can pair min(m, k) of them. But how to choose which ones to pair? Well, since any pairing is acceptable, we can just pair the first m or k elements.\n\nBut then, after pairing those, the remaining left and right boots with color c can't be paired with same color, but maybe they can be paired with ?s.\n\nBut then, after that, we have the question marks. Let's think about the ?s. The question marks can be paired with any other boots. So perhaps we can pair the remaining left ?s with the remaining right boots (either specific or ?s), and vice versa.\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. Process all the specific color pairs first. For each color c (not ?), pair as many left and right boots with color c. For example, for each c, take the left list and right list, and pair them. Let's say we have left_c list and right_c list. We",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs between left and right boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot with compatible colors. The compatibility rules are such that a specific color (e.g., 'a') is compatible only with itself, while a question mark ('?') is compatible with any color, including another question mark.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Specific Color Pairing**: First, we pair boots with specific colors that match exactly. For each color (excluding '?'), we collect indices of left and right boots with that color and form pairs between them.\n2. **Question Mark Pairing**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots with question marks. These can be paired with any remaining specific color boots or other question marks. We use two separate lists for left and right question marks and pair them with each other first, then with remaining specific color boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport collections\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    left_used = [False] * n\n    right_used = [False] * n\n\n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors\n    color_count = collections.defaultdict(lambda: {'left': [], 'right': []})\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            color_count[l[i]]['left'].append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            color_count[r[i]]['right'].append(i)\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    for c in color_count:\n        left_list = color_count[c]['left']\n        right_list = color_count[c]['right']\n        min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(min_len):\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n            if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n                pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                left_used[left_idx] = True\n                right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n    # Step 2: Collect remaining left and right question marks\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not left_used[i]:\n            left_q.append(i)\n        if r[i] == '?' and not right_used[i]:\n            right_q.append(i)\n\n    # Pair the remaining ?s with each other\n    min_len = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        left_idx = left_q[i]\n        right_idx = right_q[i]\n        pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\n    # Step 3: Pair remaining ?s with specific colors\n    # For left ?s not yet used\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not left_used[i]:\n            for j in range(n):\n                if not right_used[j] and r[j] != '?':\n                    pairs.append((i + 1, j + 1))\n                    left_used[i] = True\n                    right_used[j] = True\n                    break\n\n    # For right ?s not yet used\n    for j in range(n):\n        if r[j] == '?' and not right_used[j]:\n            for i in range(n):\n                if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?':\n                    pairs.append((i + 1, j + 1))\n                    left_used[i] = True\n                    right_used[j] = True\n                    break\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Color Counting**: We use a dictionary to count indices of left and right boots for each color, excluding question marks.\n3. **Specific Color Pairing**: For each color, we pair as many left and right boots as possible.\n4. **Question Mark Handling**: Remaining question marks are paired with each other first.
