Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) are compatible if they are the same. A question mark (which represents an indefinite color) is compatible with any color, including another question mark.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the two strings l and r. Each character in l represents a left boot's color, and each in r represents a right boot's color. The goal is to pair them optimally.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. One approach is to first pair the specific colors that match exactly. Then, handle the question marks. But how?\n\nWait, but there's also the case where a question mark can be used to pair with a specific color or another question mark. However, since we want maximum pairs, maybe we should prioritize pairing specific colors first where possible, then use the question marks to fill in the gaps.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think step by step.\n\nStep 1: Pair left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same specific color. For example, if there's a 'a' in l and a 'a' in r, pair them. This is straightforward. However, we need to track which boots are already paired.\n\nBut how to efficiently do this? Maybe count the frequencies of each color in l and r, and for each color, take the minimum between the counts in l and r. But that's not enough, because the positions matter. Because once you pair a particular left boot with a right boot, they can't be used again.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to output the actual pairs. So, perhaps the way to approach this is to first pair the specific colors where possible, then use the question marks to pair with remaining specific colors, and then pair the remaining question marks among themselves.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nLet me outline a possible plan:\n\n1. First, pair all left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same specific color. For each color c (not ?), we can iterate through both l and r, and pair them. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each color c (excluding ?), collect the indices of left boots with color c and right boots with color c. Then, pair them in some way (like first come first served). For example, for each color c, we can pair as many as possible between the left and right lists. For example, for each c, the number of pairs is min(number of left c's, number of right c's). Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired) would be the ones with either specific colors that don't match, or question marks.\n\nBut the problem is that when you pair, you need to track which boots are already used.\n\nSo, perhaps we can create for each color c (not ?) a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, for each color c, pair the left and right indices in order, taking as many as possible. For example, for color 'a', if there are 3 left boots and 5 right boots, we pair 3 pairs, using up all the left boots and 3 of the right ones.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left and right boots would be those that have specific colors that didn't match, and the question marks.\n\nThen, for the question marks, we need to pair them with any remaining boots (either specific or question marks). However, the question marks can be used to pair with any remaining boots. So, perhaps we can first pair the left question marks with the right non-question marks that are still available (i.e., those with specific colors that haven't been matched yet). Then, pair the remaining question marks between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. After step 1, we have:\n\n- Left boots that are not paired: these could be specific colors (if their matching right was not available) or question marks.\n\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nSo, for step 2, we can collect all the left question marks and right non-question marks that are unpaired, and pair them. For example, each left ? can be paired with a right boot that has a specific color (since ? can match any). Similarly, each right ? can be paired with a left boot with a specific color.\n\nBut perhaps we should first pair left ? with right non-? (specific colors) that are not yet paired. Then, pair right ? with left non-? (specific colors) that are not yet paired. Then, pair the remaining ? with ?.\n\nBut how to track which ones are",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors, where a question mark ('?') can match any color. The solution involves efficiently pairing specific colors first and then using question marks to fill in remaining gaps.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors**: First, pair left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same specific color.
