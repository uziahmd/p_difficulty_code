The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all tasks before it), we need to process them in sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3,2,3]. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Time taken is 2.\n- Then, the second task is at 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2 clockwise, she has to go all the way around. From 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4→1 (another), then 1→2 (another). Total of 3 steps. So total time now is 2+3=5.\n- Third task is at 3 again. She's at 2. Moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total time 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time taken to move from the previous position to the current task's position, moving clockwise. But how do we compute that?\n\nLet me think about the movement between two positions. Suppose she is currently at position prev, and needs to move to position curr. Since the movement is clockwise, the number of steps is (curr - prev) mod n? Wait, no. Because if prev is 3 and curr is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - prev + curr) steps. For example, when n=4, prev=3, curr=2: steps are 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Let me see. (curr - prev) could be negative. So the formula for the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Or equivalently, (curr - prev + n) % n. But wait, if prev is 3 and curr is 2, (2 -3 +4) is 3, which is correct. If prev is 2 and curr is 3, then (3-2) is 1, which is correct. So yes, the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which can be written as (curr - prev + n) % n. But since in Python, modulo can handle negative numbers, maybe that's a way to compute it.\n\nBut wait, for example, if prev is 1 and curr is 3, n=4. Then (3-1) = 2 steps. Which is correct. So yes, the formula (curr - prev) if curr >= prev else (curr - prev + n) is correct. Alternatively, (curr - prev) % n would give the same result. Wait, let's check:\n\nFor prev=3, curr=2, n=4. (2-3) = -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) % n. But wait, what if prev is 1 and curr is 1? Then steps is zero. Which is correct. So yes, the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) % n. But wait, in the first case, when prev is 3 and curr is 2, the steps are 3, which is (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. Correct.\n\nSo the total time is the sum of the steps between consecutive tasks, starting from position 1.\n\nWait, but the initial position is 1. So the first task is a_1. So the steps from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Wait, no. Because if a_1 is 3, n=4, then steps are 2. Which is (3-1) = 2. Which is correct. If a_1 is 2, then steps are 1. Which is correct. If a_1 is 1, steps are 0. So yes. So the initial step is from position 1 to a_1. Then from a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if the tasks are [3,3], then she is already at 3 after the first task, so moving to the second task takes 0 steps.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a:\n\n    steps = (task - current_position) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_position = task\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but let's test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_position starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3: steps = (3-1) mod 4 = 2 → total_time is 2. current_position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3 → total_time becomes 2+3=5. current_position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1 → total_time 5+1=6. Which matches the example. Correct.\n\nAnother example given is input '4 3\\n2 3 3' → output is 2. Let's see.\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps (2-1) mod 4 = 1 → total_time 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1 → total_time 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nYes, that seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: iterate through the list of a's, compute the steps between current position and next task's position, add to total, update current position.\n\nBut wait, what about when the tasks are in the same position? Like consecutive tasks in the same house. Then steps is zero. So that's handled correctly.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m, the second line has m integers a_1 to a_m.\n\nSo the code needs to read n and m, then read the list of a's.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']? Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the example shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\nOutput:\n\n['6', '2']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a typo. Oh, no, perhaps the user is showing two separate test cases. For example, the first input is \"4 3\\n3 2 3\" which gives output 6, and the second input is \"4 3\\n2 3 3\" which gives output 2. So the code should process each input case separately.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So for each test case, the first line is n and m, the second line is m integers.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, process each test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input seems to have two test cases. However, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line containing n and m, then the second line containing m integers. So perhaps the user is showing two examples, but the actual code needs to process one input.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m.\n\nThe second line contains m integers a_1 ... a_m.\n\nSo the code should read two lines. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich outputs 6.\n\nThe second example input is:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nWhich outputs 2.\n\nSo the code needs to read from stdin, process one test case.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nRead the next line as list of integers.\n\nCompute the total time as per the algorithm above.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list a.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each num in a:\n\n    steps = (num - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but let me check for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then steps is (1-1) mod 2 = 0. So output is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1, a=[2]. Steps is (2-1) mod 2 = 1. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: when the tasks are in the same position. Like n=5, m=2, a=[3,3]. Then steps from 1 to 3 is 2. Then steps from 3 to 3 is 0. Total is 2.\n\nAnother case: when the tasks require going around the circle multiple times. Like n=5, m=3, a=[5,1,5]. So:\n\nStart at 1. First task is 5: steps (5-1) mod 5 = 4. total is 4. current is 5.\n\nSecond task is 1: (1-5) mod 5 = ( -4 ) mod 5 = 1. So steps is 1. total is 5. current is 1.\n\nThird task is 5: steps (5-1) mod 5 =4. total is 5+4=9. So output 9.\n\nWhich is correct. Because moving from 5 to 1 is 1 step (clockwise), and from 1 to 5 is 4 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, the code needs to be O(m) time, which this approach is.\n\nNow, in Python, reading the input correctly is important.\n\nBut for the code, the steps are:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading input, there may be leading or trailing spaces, but in Python, splitting on whitespace is handled by split().\n\nSo code:\n\nIn Python, something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says that the second line contains m integers. So the code should read exactly m integers. But in the case where the input has more or less, but according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2 → total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3 → total 5. current is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1 → total 6. Output is 6. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: (2-1) mod 4 = 1 → total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond num is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1 → total 2. current 3.\n\nThird num is 3: 0 → total remains 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a=[2]. Output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a=[5,1,5]. Output is 4 + 1 +4 =9. Which is correct.\n\nWhat about when the list is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because in the input, m is given as 1<=m<=1e5.\n\nSo the code handles all cases.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, I need to write this in Python, making sure to read from stdin and output the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, in Python, sometimes when reading from stdin, if the input is given with multiple lines, but sometimes the second line may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if the list a has more or less than m elements? According to the problem statement, the input is correct, so the code can assume that.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nLet me check the sample input again.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[1, 2]. The steps are:\n\ncurrent is 1. first num is 1: steps 0. current is 1. Then next num is 2: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. total is 0+1=1. Output is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=2, a=[1, 5]. Steps from 1 to 1 is 0. Then from 1 to 5: (5-1) mod 5 =4. Total is 4. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time taken to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires moving clockwise to a specific house. The time taken to move from one house to another is calculated based on their positions on the circular road.\n2. **Circular Movement Calculation**: The time to move from the current position to the next task's position is calculated using modulo arithmetic. Specifically, the time taken to move from house `current` to house `next` is `(next - current) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This formula ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the road.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Iterate through each task, updating the total time required and the current position after each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        diff = (num - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1, and initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular movement. Update the total time and current position accordingly.\n- **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required time in linear time, O(m), where m is the number of tasks, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000.",
