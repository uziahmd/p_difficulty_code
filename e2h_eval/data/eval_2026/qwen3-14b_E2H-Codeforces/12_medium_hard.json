The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the first example input: n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps between tasks.\n\nThe tasks are in order 3, 2, 3. But she has to do them in order. So:\n\nFirst task is at 3. Starting from 1, how long to get there? Well, moving clockwise. From 1 to 3 is two steps (1→2→3). So that's 2 units. Then, the second task is at 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2, since it's a ringroad, she can go clockwise. From 3 to 4 to 1 to 2. That's 3 steps. So adding 3 units. Then the third task is at 3 again. She's at 2, so moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total time is 2+3+1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is to track her current position and for each task, compute the time needed to get from her current position to the next task's house, moving clockwise. Then accumulate all those times.\n\nBut how to compute the time between two positions?\n\nLet's think: for two positions current and next, the distance is (next - current) mod n? Wait, no. Because if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - current + next) steps. For example, when n=4, current=3, next=2. The distance is 3 →4 →1 →2: 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 +4) mod 4? Let me see. (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. So yes. So the formula for the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be written as (next - current) % n. Wait, but if next is less than current, then (next - current) is negative. So mod n would give the correct positive value. For example, (2-3) mod 4 is 3. So yes. So the distance between current and next is (next - current) % n. But wait, in the first case, when current is 1 and next is 3, (3-1) mod 4 is 2, which is correct. So yes.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize current position as 1 (since she starts there).\n- For each task in the list a, compute the distance from current to a_i, add that to the total time, then update current to a_i.\n\nWait, but what about the order of tasks? Because the tasks must be done in order. So for each task i (from 1 to m), we have to process them in sequence. So for the list a, the order is important. So for example, if the list is [3,2,3], then the first task is 3, then 2, then 3.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in the list a:\n\n   distance = (ai - current) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current = ai\n\nSo that's the idea. Let's test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example: n=4, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3. (3-1) mod 4 is 2. total_time is 2. current becomes 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2. (2-3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3. total_time becomes 2+3=5. current becomes 2.\n\nThird ai is 3. (3-2) mod 4 is 1. total_time becomes 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example given is input ['4 3\\n2 3 3'], output is 2. Let's see:\n\nn=4, m=3, a is [2,3,3].\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total_time is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total_time is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3) mod 4 = 0. total_time remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where the same house is repeated. Like a = [1,1,1]. Then the total time is (1-1) mod n (0) for first, then 0 again, etc. So total time is 0. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Then first step: 1 to 1 (distance 0), then 2-1 mod 2 is 1. So total is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, current is 5, next is 1. (1-5) mod 5 is ( -4 ) mod 5 = 1. Which is correct (moving 5 →1 is 1 step).\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in a:\n\n   distance = (ai - current) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current = ai\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1? Oh, but according to the input constraints, n is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, let's check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]. The code gives 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [2,3,3]. The code gives 1+1+0=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then the time is (1-1) mod 2 = 0. So output 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Time is 0 + (2-1) mod 2 = 1. So total 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, in Python, reading the input. The input is given as two lines. First line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of strings, like ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'] but that's for the example. But the actual input is from stdin.\n\nSo the code needs to read from stdin. So for the code, in Python:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in Python, the code could be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen, current = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    distance = (ai - current) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but in the first example, the a list is [3,2,3]. Let's see.\n\nYes. So that code would process each element in order.\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nBut let me check for the case where the same house is repeated. For example, if a is [3,3,3], then the code would add (3-1) mod n, then (3-3) mod n, then (3-3) mod n. So for n=4, that's 2 + 0 + 0 = 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when the list is empty? Well, m is at least 1, according to the input constraints. Because m is given as 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. She starts at house 1 and must move clockwise between houses, completing tasks in the given order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia moves clockwise around a ringroad with `n` houses. Moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time.\n2. **Task Order**: Each task must be completed in the order given. For each task, we calculate the time required to move from Xenia's current position to the house where the task is located.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses `current` and `next` on a ringroad can be calculated using the formula `(next - current) % n`. This handles both cases where moving clockwise directly or wrapping around the end of the ringroad is needed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        distance = (ai - current) % n\n        total_time += distance\n        current = ai\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The second line contains `m` integers representing the house numbers where each task is located.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with `total_time` initialized to 0.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task location, compute the distance from the current house to the task location using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. Accumulate this distance into `total_time` and update the current position to the task location.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by considering each task in sequence and leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement. The solution runs in O(m) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints.",
