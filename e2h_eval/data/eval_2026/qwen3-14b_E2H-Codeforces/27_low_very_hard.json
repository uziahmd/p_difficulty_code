On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing any subarray of the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what reversing a subarray does. For example, if the original array is [1, 2, 1, 2], reversing the subarray from index 2 to 3 (assuming 1-based) gives [1, 1, 2, 2], which is perfectly non-decreasing, hence the maximum length is 4.\n\nThe challenge is to find which subarray to reverse so that when you do that, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is as long as possible.\n\nBut how do I approach this efficiently? Because for each possible subarray reversal, checking the LNDS would be O(n^2) per check, and with n up to 2000, that would be O(n^4), which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the original array and how reversing a subarray can affect the LNDS.\n\nSince the array only contains 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be thought of in terms of counting the number of 1s and 2s, but also considering their arrangement.\n\nIn the original array, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s, or something else? Wait, no. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 2 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But after reversing a subarray, it can become all non-decreasing.\n\nSo the maximum possible LNDS is n if the entire array is non-decreasing. But if not, maybe we can reverse a part to make it better.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the optimal reversal. Since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the best scenario is to have as many 1s followed by 2s as possible. Reversing a subarray could help in merging some regions of 1s and 2s.\n\nFor example, suppose there's a segment where there are 1s followed by 2s, but then some 1s again. Reversing a part could fix that.\n\nBut how to find the best reversal?\n\nLet me think about the following: The LNDS of the modified array can be calculated based on the original array's structure. Let's consider that after reversing some interval [l, r], the new array will have some parts that are the same as before, except the reversed part.\n\nBut how can we compute the maximum LNDS without checking all possibilities?\n\nAnother thought: The maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is equal to the maximum between the original LNDS and some value achieved by reversing a subarray. But how to find that value?\n\nAlternatively, since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s plus the maximum number of 2s in a non-decreasing way. Wait, but since the sequence is non-decreasing, all 1s come before 2s. So the LNDS is the maximum of:\n\nnumber of 1s in the array (if all 1s are first) + number of 2s (if all 2s are next). But if the array is already arranged like that, then the LNDS is n. Otherwise, perhaps by reversing a subarray, we can increase the number of 1s before 2s.\n\nWait, but the LNDS can be more than that if there are overlapping parts. Wait, no. Because the LNDS can't be longer than the total number of elements. So the maximum possible is n. So the problem reduces to finding whether there's a way to reverse a subarray to make the entire array non-decreasing. If not, then find the maximum possible.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the array as having some transitions between 1s and 2s. For example, in the original array, the positions where a 1 is followed by a 2 are good, but where a 2 is followed by a 1 are bad. Reversing a subarray that includes such a bad transition might help.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the original array's structure. Let's say the original array has some number of 1s and 2s, and the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, or some combination. Wait, no. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 2 (the count of 1s is 2, 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of the given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help in merging regions of 1s and 2s to form a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: Since the sequence consists only of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be maximized by ensuring as many 1s as possible are followed by 2s.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We use prefix arrays to count the number of 1s up to each position and suffix arrays to count the number of 2s from each position to the end.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Reversals**: For each possible subarray reversal, calculate the potential increase in the LNDS by combining the counts of 1s before the subarray, the counts of 2s after the subarray, and the total number of 1s and 2s within the subarray.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix counts of 1s\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n    \n    # Precompute suffix counts of 2s\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    max_len = 0\n    # Try all possible intervals [l, r]\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Calculate the number of 1s before l\n            ones_before = prefix_ones[l]\n            # Calculate the number of 2s after r\n            twos_after = suffix_twos[r+1]\n            # The number of 1s and 2s in the reversed subarray\n            # When reversed, the subarray will have all 1s first then 2s\n            # So the total is the number of 1s in the subarray plus the number of 2s in the subarray\n            # But since we reverse, the subarray's contribution to the LNDS is min(ones_in_sub, twos_in_sub) + max(ones_in_sub, twos_in_sub)\n            # Wait no, when reversed, the subarray's elements can be part of the increasing sequence.\n            # However, since the entire array is made of 1s and 2s, the best case is that the reversed subarray has all 1s followed by 2s.\n            # Therefore, the number of 1s in the subarray plus the number of 2s in the subarray is just the length of the subarray.\n            # But how does it contribute to the overall LNDS?\n            # The total would be ones_before + twos_after + (number of 1s in the subarray) + (number of 2s in the subarray) if they can be arranged properly.\n            # Wait, no. Because the subarray when reversed might have some 1s and 2s that can connect with the parts before and after.\n            # For example, if the original subarray has some 1s and 2s, when reversed, the 1s may come first, which can be followed by the 2s after the subarray.\n            # So the total LNDS would be ones_before + (number of 1s in subarray) + (number of 2s in subarray) + twos_after if the subarray can be arranged as 1s followed by 2s.\n            # But since the subarray is reversed, the number of 1s and 2s in it remains the same. So the total number of 1s and 2s is the same as the original.\n            # However, the way they are arranged can allow more of them to be part of the LNDS.\n            # Therefore, the maximum possible LNDS after reversing [l, r] is:\n            # (number of 1s before l) + (number of 2s after r) + min(number of 1s in subarray, number of 2s in subarray) + max(number of 1s in subarray, number of 2s in subarray) ?\n            # No, because the subarray can be arranged as 1s followed by 2s, so their contribution is the sum of their counts.\n            # So the total LNDS would be:\n            # ones_before + (number of 1s in subarray) + (number of 2s in subarray) + twos_after\n            # But that would be the total number of elements, which is n. However, that's only possible if the entire array is non-decreasing.\n            # So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum possible by considering all possible [l, r] reversals.\n            # But how to compute it efficiently?\n            # Let me think again.\n            # The LNDS can be computed as the maximum of the following:\n            # 1. The original LNDS\n            # 2. For each possible [l, r], the LNDS after reversing [l, r]\n            # But calculating the LNDS for each [l, r] is O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2000.\n            # So we need an efficient way to compute the best possible scenario.\n            # Alternative idea: the maximum LNDS after any reversal is the maximum between:\n            # (number of 1s in the array) + (number of 2s in the array) - (number of transitions from 2 to 1 in the original array)\n            # Or something similar.\n            # Alternatively, consider that the optimal scenario is to have all 1s followed by all 2s. The number of such 1s and 2s is fixed (count_ones and count_twos).\n            # The problem is that in the original array, there might be some 2s followed by 1s. Each such occurrence reduces the LNDS by 1. So the maximum possible LNDS is count_ones + count_twos - (number of 2->1 transitions).\n            # But how to find the minimum number of 2->1 transitions after reversing a subarray?\n            # Let's think about the original number of 2->1 transitions. If we reverse a subarray that contains some of these transitions, we can reduce the number of such transitions.\n            # For example, if the subarray has a 2 followed by a 1, reversing it would turn it into a 1 followed by a 2, which is better.\n            # So the maximum possible LNDS is count_ones + count_twos - (original number of 2->1 transitions - improvement from reversing a subarray).\n            # However, this seems complex to model.\n            # Another approach inspired by the solution to similar problems: the maximum LNDS after reversal is the maximum between:\n            # - the original LNDS\n            # - for each possible split point where the array can be divided into three parts: left, middle (to be reversed), right. The left part has all 1s, the middle part has a mix, and the right part has all 2s. But this seems too vague.\n            # Given time constraints, perhaps the optimal approach is to precompute for all possible l and r, the maximum possible LNDS by considering how many 1s are before l, how many 2s are after r, and the number of 1s and 2s in the subarray [l, r].\n            # Since the reversed subarray can be arranged as 1s followed by 2s, the total number of 1s before l, plus the number of 1s in the subarray, plus the number of 2s in the subarray, plus the number of 2s after r. But this sum is equal to (prefix_ones[l] + (number of 1s in subarray) + (number of 2s in subarray) + suffix_twos[r+1]) = prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]. But this can't be more than n, which is the total number of elements.\n            # However, this would be possible only if the subarray can be arranged as 1s followed by 2s, which it can be after reversal. So the total LNDS would be prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1].\n            # Wait, but the number of 1s in the subarray is (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]), and the number of 2s in the subarray is (suffix_twos[l] - suffix_twos[r+1]).\n            # But the total length of the subarray is (r - l + 1). So prefix_ones[l] + (number of 1s in subarray) + (number of 2s in subarray) + suffix_twos[r+1] is prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1].\n            # Which is (prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1]) + (r - l + 1). But since (r - l + 1) is the length of the subarray, this equals prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1] + (r - l + 1).\n            # However, this is not necessarily correct, because the 1s in the subarray could be followed by the 2s after the subarray. But if there are 1s before l and 2s after r, then the subarray's 1s can be connected to the previous 1s, and the subarray's 2s can be connected to the next 2s.\n            # So the total would be:\n            # (number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in the subarray) + (number of 2s in the subarray) + (number of 2s after r)\n            # But since the number of 1s in the subarray plus the number of 2s in the subarray is (r - l + 1), this simplifies to (prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]).\n            # However, this can't exceed n, which is the total length of the array. So the maximum possible value of this expression over all l and r would give us the maximum possible LNDS.\n            # Let's test this with the first example:\n            # Original array: [1, 2, 1, 2]\n            # count_ones = 2, count_twos = 2\n            # For l=1 (0-based?), wait let's clarify indices.\n            # In the example, when reversing [2,3] (assuming 1-based), which is l=1, r=2 (0-based). Let's compute:\n            # prefix_ones[l] = prefix_ones[1] = 1 (since the first element is 1)\n            # suffix_twos[r+1] = suffix_twos[3] = 1 (the last element is 2, and the suffix from index 3 (0-based) is 2)\n            # (r - l + 1) = 2\n            # So total is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which matches the example.\n            # So this formula seems to work.\n            # Therefore, the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum of:\n            # (prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]) for all l <= r.\n            # Additionally, we should also consider the original LNDS, which is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, or the actual LNDS.\n            # But for the purpose of this problem, since the maximum possible is n (if the array can be made non-decreasing), and the formula above gives us that when possible, it's sufficient to compute the maximum of this expression and compare with the original LNDS.\n            # So the steps are:\n            # 1. Compute prefix_ones and suffix_twos.\n            # 2. Iterate all possible l and r, compute the value as above.\n            # 3. The maximum of these values is the answer.\n            # So let's implement this.\n            # Compute the current value for this l and r\n            ones_before = prefix_ones[l]\n            twos_after = suffix_twos[r+1]\n            length_sub = r - l + 1\n            current = ones_before + twos_after + length_sub\n            if current > max_len:\n                max_len = current\n    \n    # Also, the original LNDS could be the count of 1s or 2s, but our calculation above already considers that.\n    # For example, if the original array is non-decreasing, then for l=0, r=n-1, the value would be prefix_ones[0] (which is 0) + suffix_twos[n] (which is 0) + n.

The number of such 1s and 2s is fixed (count_ones and count_twos).\n            # The problem is that in the original array, there might be some 2s followed by 1s. Each such occurrence reduces the LNDS by 1. So the maximum possible LNDS is count_ones + count_twos - (number of 2->1 transitions).\n            # But how to find the minimum number of 2->1 transitions after reversing a subarray?\n            # Let's think about the original number of 2->1 transitions. If we reverse a subarray that contains some of these transitions, we can reduce the number of such transitions.\n            # For example, if the subarray has a 2 followed by a 1, reversing it would turn it into a 1 followed by a 2, which is better.\n            # So the maximum possible LNDS is count_ones + count_twos - (original number of 2->1 transitions - improvement from reversing a subarray).\n            # However, this seems complex to model.\n            # Another approach inspired by the solution to similar problems: the maximum LNDS after reversal is the maximum between:\n            # - the original LNDS\n            # - for each possible split point where the array can be divided into three parts: left, middle (to be reversed), right. The left part has all 1s, the middle part has a mix, and the right part has all 2s. But this seems too vague.\n            # Given time constraints, perhaps the optimal approach is to precompute for all possible l and r, the maximum possible LNDS by considering how many 1s are before l, how many 2s are after r, and the number of 1s and 2s in the subarray [l, r].\n            # Since the reversed subarray can be arranged as 1s followed by 2s, the total number of 1s before l, plus the number of 1s in the subarray, plus the number of 2s in the subarray, plus the number of 2s after r. But this sum is equal to (prefix_ones[l] + (number of 1s in subarray) + (number of 2s in subarray) + suffix_twos[r+1]) = prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]. But this can't be more than n, which is the total number of elements.\n            # However, this would be possible only if the subarray can be arranged as 1s followed by 2s, which it can be after reversal. So the total LNDS would be prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1].\n            # Wait, but the number of 1s in the subarray is (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]), and the number of 2s in the subarray is (suffix_twos[l] - suffix_twos[r+1]).\n            # But the total length of the subarray is (r - l + 1). So prefix_ones[l] + (number of 1s in subarray) + (number of 2s in subarray) + suffix_twos[r+1] is prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1].\n            # Which is (prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1]) + (r - l + 1). But since (r - l + 1) is the length of the subarray, this equals prefix_ones[l] + suffix_twos[r+1] + (r - l + 1).\n            # However, this is not necessarily correct, because the 1s in the subarray could be followed by the 2s after the subarray. But if there are 1s before l and 2s after r, then the subarray's 1s can be connected to the previous 1s, and the subarray's 2s can be connected to the next 2s.\n            # So the total would be:\n            # (number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in the subarray) + (number of 2s in the subarray) + (number of 2s after r)\n            # But since the number of 1s in the subarray plus the number of 2s in the subarray is (r - l + 1), this simplifies to (prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]).\n            # However, this can't exceed n, which is the total length of the array. So the maximum possible value of this expression over all l and r would give us the maximum possible LNDS.\n            # Let's test this with the first example:\n            # Original array: [1, 2, 1, 2]\n            # count_ones = 2, count_twos = 2\n            # For l=1 (0-based?), wait let's clarify indices.\n            # In the example, when reversing [2,3] (assuming 1-based), which is l=1, r=2 (0-based). Let's compute:\n            # prefix_ones[l] = prefix_ones[1] = 1 (since the first element is 1)\n            # suffix_twos[r+1] = suffix_twos[3] = 1 (the last element is 2, and the suffix from index 3 (0-based) is 2)\n            # (r - l + 1) = 2\n            # So total is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which matches the example.\n            # So this formula seems to work.\n            # Therefore, the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the maximum of:\n            # (prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]) for all l <= r.\n            # Additionally, we should also consider the original LNDS, which is the maximum between the count of 1s and the count of 2s, or the actual LNDS.\n            # But for the purpose of this problem, since the maximum possible is n (if the array can be made non-decreasing), and the formula above gives us that when possible, it's sufficient to compute the maximum of this expression and compare with the original LNDS.\n            # So the steps are:\n            # 1. Compute prefix_ones and suffix_twos.\n            # 2. Iterate all possible l and r, compute the value as above.\n            # 3. The maximum of these values is the answer.\n            # So let's implement this.\n            # Compute the current value for this l and r\n            ones_before = prefix_ones[l]\n            twos_after = suffix_twos[r+1]\n            length_sub = r - l + 1\n            current = ones_before + twos_after + length_sub\n            if current > max_len:\n                max_len = current\n    \n    # Also, the original LNDS could be the count of 1s or 2s, but our calculation above already considers that.\n    # For example, if the original array is non-decreasing, then for l=0, r=n-1, the value would be prefix_ones[0] (which is 0) + suffix_twos[n] (which is 0) + n. Wait, no.\n    # Wait, for l=0, r=n-1, the value is prefix_ones[0] (0) + suffix_twos[n] (0) + n = n, which is correct.\n    # So the code above already captures the case where the entire array is non-decreasing.\n    print(max_len)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
