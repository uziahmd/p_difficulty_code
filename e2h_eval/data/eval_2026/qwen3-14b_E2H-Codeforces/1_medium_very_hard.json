    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe plate is divided into w rows and h columns. The gilded rings are added starting from the edge. Each ring is one cell thick. The first ring is the outer edge. The second is two cells in, and so on. For each i-th ring, it's the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, right. Because each ring takes away two cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the next one is 2 cells inward on each side. So for the first ring, the rectangle is the original size. Then for the second, it's (w-4) by (h-4), since each ring reduces each dimension by 2*2? Wait, no. Wait, the first ring is the border of the original rectangle. The second ring is the border of a rectangle that's 2 cells in from the edge. So for example, if the original rectangle is w by h, then the second ring would be the border of a rectangle that's (w - 2*2) by (h - 2*2)? Because each side you go in by 2 cells. Wait, for example, if you have a rectangle of width 7 and height 9, then the first ring is the perimeter. The second ring would be the perimeter of a rectangle that's 7-4=3 in width and 9-4=5 in height. Wait, but how does that work? Because the first ring is the outermost, then the next ring is inside, so the next ring's rectangle is (original width - 2*2) and same for height. Because each ring takes 2 cells from each side. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, because for the first ring, i=1, so 4*(i-1) is zero. Then for the second ring, i=2, subtract 4*(1) = 4. So yes.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of cells in each ring? For a rectangle of size W x H, the perimeter (the border cells) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter is the total cells in the outermost layer. For example, a rectangle of 3x3: perimeter is 3*4 - 4 = 8 (since each side has 3 cells, but corners are counted twice). Alternatively, 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 2*(4) = 8. Which matches the first example input. The first example is 3 3 1, output is 8. So that formula seems correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but what if the rectangle becomes too small? For example, if the current ring's rectangle has width or height less than 3? Wait, but according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's <= floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. Let's say min(w, h) is m. Then k is up to floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's take m=3, then (3+1)/4=1. So k can be 1. For m=4, (4+1)/4 is 1.25, floor is 1. So k can be 1. For m=5, (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor 1. For m=6: (6+1)/4=1.75 → 1. For m=7: (7+1)/4=2. So k can be up to 2. So for each i-th ring, the rectangle dimensions are w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But since k is chosen such that for the i-th ring, the min(w', h') is at least 3? Or maybe not. Let me think: For example, if the original w and h are 3 and 3, and k=1. Then for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3, which is valid. If k was 2, then for i=2, the rectangle would be 3 - 4*(1) = -1, which is invalid. But the input constraints ensure that k is such that it's possible. So the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me check for min(w, h) = m. Let's suppose that m is the minimum of the two. Then for the k-th ring, the rectangle's width and height would be m - 4*(k-1). Let's see: For example, if m=7, then for k=2, the value is 7-4*(2-1) = 3. Which is okay. For k=3, 7-4*(2) = 7-8= -1. But the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (m +1)/4 ). For m=7, (7+1)/4 is 2. So floor is 2. So k can't be 3. So for each i from 1 to k, the rectangle sizes are valid. So we don't have to worry about negative numbers here.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each ring i from 1 to k:\n\nCalculate the current width and height as:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nThen compute the perimeter of this rectangle, which is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). Then sum all these perimeters.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because the ring is the border of the rectangle. So the perimeter is the number of cells in that border. So for each ring, we add that perimeter to the total.\n\nSo the problem reduces to summing for each i from 1 to k the value 2*( (current_w + current_h - 2) ), where current_w and current_h are as above.\n\nSo let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, current_w=3, current_h=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So i=1. current_w=7, current_h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So for i=1, perimeter is 28. For i=2, current_w=7-4*(1) = 3, current_h=9-4*(1) =5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: loop from 1 to k, compute for each i the current_w and current_h, compute the perimeter, add to the sum.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nRead w, h, k from input. Then initialize total = 0. Then for each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nadd to total.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h is less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. Because for the maximum k allowed, the min(w, h) - 4*(k-1) >= 3? Let me think. Let me check the input constraints again.\n\nThe input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think for example: if min(w, h) is m. Then for the k-th ring, the current_w and current_h would be m - 4*(k-1). Let me see for the maximum k allowed. Let's say m=3. Then (3+1)/4 = 1, so k can be 1. For k=1, 3 - 4*(0) = 3. Which is okay. For m=7, (7+1)/4 = 2. So k can be 2. For i=2, 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. Which is okay. So for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3. Because for the k-th ring, the min(w, h) -4*(k-1) >= 3? Let me see:\n\nLet me suppose that m = min(w, h). Then k is at most floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's take the maximum k allowed as floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's check for this k, whether m -4*(k-1) >= 3?\n\nLet me take m=7. (7+1)/4 = 2. So k=2. m -4*(k-1) =7-4*(1)=3 >=3. Yes.\n\nIf m=6, (6+1)/4 = 1.75 → floor is 1. So k=1. Then m -4*(0) =6 >=3.\n\nAnother example: m=4. (4+1)/4 = 1.25 → floor 1. So k=1. Then 4 - 0=4 >=3.\n\nAnother example: m=5. (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor 1. So k=1. m -4*0=5 >=3.\n\nWhat about m=8? (8+1)/4=2.25 → floor 2. So k=2. For i=2, m -4*(2-1) =8-4=4 ≥3. Yes.\n\nSo for the k-th ring, the min(w, h) -4*(k-1) is ≥3. So the current_w and current_h are at least 3. So their sum is at least 6, and the perimeter is 2*(sum -2) which is 2*(something ≥4) → ≥8. So no problem.\n\nSo the code can proceed as described.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the current_w or current_h is less than 3? But according to the input constraints, that's not possible. So the code is safe.\n\nLet me test the third example: input 7 9 2. So for i=1, current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. For i=2, current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nAnother example: let's say w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Total 24+8=32.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. The input is given as a single line with three integers. So for example, in the sample input, the first line is '3 3 1'.\n\nSo code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the current_w or current_h is less than 3? Well, according to the problem constraints, k is chosen such that this does not happen. So the code is safe.\n\nSo that's the solution. Let me check the sample inputs again.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code should work.\n\nNow, code is straightforward. So that's the solution.\n",
