    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nHmm, let me think about how to model each ring. For the i-th ring (starting from 1), the ring is part of a rectangle that's (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we find the number of cells in that ring?\n\nWait, the ring is the border of that inner rectangle. So for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, no, the formula 2*(W + H - 2) would be 2*(3+3-2) = 8, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1, output is 8. So that seems correct.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we need to compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w', h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, wait. Because each ring is added inwards. For example, the first ring is the outermost, then the next is two cells in, so the next ring's rectangle is smaller by 2 cells on each side. Wait, but the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's the original rectangle. Wait, no. Wait, the first ring is along the edge. So the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. Then the second ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that's 2 cells in from the edge. Which would be (original width - 2*2) and same for height. Wait, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1))? Because for the first ring, i=1, so it's w and h. Then for the second ring, i=2, it's w - 4*(1) = w-4, h-4. So the rectangle is smaller by 4 in each dimension. Wait, but why 4? Because each ring takes 2 cells from each side. So for each ring, the next rectangle is 2 cells smaller in each direction. So for the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. The next ring is (w-4) x (h-4), because you subtract 2 from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So for each i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\nBut then, the perimeter for that rectangle is 2*( (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h - 4*(i-1)) - 2 ), which simplifies to 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2). Wait, maybe I should compute it as 2*(width + height - 2). Because for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side has W cells (top and bottom) and H cells (left and right), but the four corners are counted twice. So subtracting 4, but wait 2*(W + H) - 4 = 2(W + H - 2). So yes.\n\nSo for each ring i, compute 2*( (w' + h' - 2) ), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all these perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch here. What if the rectangle for a certain i becomes too small? For example, if the rectangle's width or height is less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, min(w, h) is say m. Then the maximum k is floor( (m + 1)/4 ). Let's see for m=3, floor( (3+1)/4 )=1. Which makes sense. Because for k=1, the first ring is 3x3. For the next ring, the rectangle would be 3-4*(2-1) = 3-4= -1, which is invalid. So the input constraints ensure that for all i up to k, the rectangles are valid. So we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So i=1: w'=3, h'=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input:7 9 1. So i=1: w=7, h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example:7 9 2. So first ring is 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring: i=2, w'=7 -4*(1) = 3, h'=9-4*(1)=5. So perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28 + 12 =40. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each i from 1 to k:\n\n   compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   add 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) to the total.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, let me check for another case. Let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\nFirst ring: 5x5. perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16.\n\nSecond ring: 5-4*(1) = 1, h same. So 1x1. perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0? Wait, but that's impossible. Wait, but according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). For w=5, h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So in the input, k would not be allowed to be 2. So the code doesn't have to handle cases where current_w or current_h is less than 1. Because the input constraints ensure that for all i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 1.\n\nBut how? Let's think. For the i-th ring, the current_w is w -4*(i-1). Similarly for current_h. Since k is given as up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ), let's see.\n\nLet m = min(w, h). Then the maximum possible k is floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's take for example m=5. Then (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, current_w = w -4*(0) = w. Which is >=3. For i=2, current_w would be w-4*1. If w was 5, that's 1. But since k is 1, it's not allowed. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the Python code would be straightforward. Read the input, loop over each ring, compute the perimeter, sum them.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nThe input is three integers on one line. So, read them as w, h, k.\n\nThen, initialize total to 0.\n\nLoop for i in 1 to k (inclusive), compute current_w and current_h, then perimeter.\n\nBut wait, the code needs to handle the case where the current_w or current_h is 1. For example, if the rectangle is 1x1. Then perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 0. Which is correct, because a 1x1 rectangle has no perimeter. But according to the problem statement, the rings are added as per the given rules. However, the input constraints ensure that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or not?\n\nWait, let's think again. The input constraints for k are 1 ≤ k ≤ floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 )\n\nLet me take m = min(w, h). For example, if m=3, then floor( (3+1)/4 )=1. So k can be 1. For i=1, current_w is w -4*(0) = w. Which is 3. Similarly for h. So the rectangle is 3x3, which is okay. For i=2, current_w would be 3-4*(1) = -1. But since k is 1, it's not allowed.\n\nAnother example: m=7. Then floor( (7+1)/4 ) = 2. So k can be 2. For i=2, current_w is 7-4*(1) = 3. Which is okay. So for the 2nd ring, the rectangle is 3x (h -4*(i-1)).\n\nSo in this case, the code is okay.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo let's code this.\n\nSample input:\n\nFor example, the third sample input is 7 9 2. So:\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=9 → perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28.\n\ni=2: current_w=7-4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5 → perimeter 2*(3+5-2)= 2*6=12. Sum is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 5 1. Output would be 2*(5+5-2) = 16.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. Then compute the sum.\n\nSo the code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the current_w or current_h is less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that for all i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 1. Because for i up to k, the minimum of current_w and current_h is m -4*(i-1), where m is min(w, h). Since k is at most floor( (m +1)/4 ), then for i=k, 4*(k-1) ≤ m +1 -4 ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think. Let's take m = min(w, h). The maximum allowed k is floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's take m=5, then (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k=1. For i=1, 4*(i-1) = 0. So current_w is 5, which is okay. If m=7, then (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be 2. For i=2, 4*(2-1) =4. So current_w is 7-4=3 ≥1. So yes. For m=8, (8+1)/4 is 2.25 → floor is 2. For i=2, 4*(2-1)=4. 8-4=4. So current_w is 4. So that's okay. For i=3, it would be 8-4*2=0. But k is 2, so it's not allowed.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nLet me test another example. Let's say input is 5 5 1. Output is 16. Let's see:\n\ncurrent_w =5, current_h=5. perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input 7 7 2. Then:\n\ni=1: 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Total 24+8=32.\n\nSo output is 32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells to be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that the first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells inward, and so on. Each ring has a width of one cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is essentially the perimeter of a rectangle that gets smaller as we move inward. For the i-th ring, the dimensions of the rectangle are adjusted by subtracting 4*(i-1) from both the width and height of the original plate. This adjustment accounts for moving 2 cells inward on each side (top, bottom, left, right).\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is calculated as `2 * (w + h - 2)`. This formula accounts for the fact that each side of the rectangle contributes to the perimeter, but the corners are counted twice.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: For each ring from 1 to k, calculate the perimeter of the corresponding adjusted rectangle and sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the adjusted width and height by subtracting `4*(i-1)` from the original dimensions. This adjustment ensures we move inward by 2 cells on each side for each subsequent ring.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: Using the adjusted dimensions, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for each ring using the formula `2 * (width + height - 2)`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and applying the perimeter formula, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
