Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) are compatible if they are the same. A question mark (which represents an indefinite color) is compatible with any color, including another question mark.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the two strings l and r. Each character in l represents a left boot's color, and each in r represents a right boot's color. The problem requires pairing them optimally.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. One idea is to first pair the specific colors where they match. Then handle the question marks. But how?\n\nWait, but question marks can be used as wildcards. So perhaps we should:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots that have specific colors matching. For example, if l[i] is 'a' and r[j] is 'a', pair them. But how to do this optimally? Because if we pair them directly, that might leave some question marks which could be better used elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we should first pair all the specific colors that match. Then use the remaining question marks to pair with other question marks or specific colors. But how to manage that?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each question mark can be used as a wildcard. So for each color (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. Then, the maximum possible pairs for those specific colors would be the minimum of the counts. But since question marks can also be used for those, perhaps we need to first pair the non-? colors, then handle the ?s.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not the best approach. For example, suppose there are some left boots with color 'a' and some right boots with color 'a'. Pairing them directly is better than using a question mark for that. Because if you pair a '?' with a specific color, you could use that '?' to pair with another specific color later. Wait, but maybe not. Let's think.\n\nSuppose there are two left boots with 'a' and three right boots with 'a'. Then, pairing them directly gives two pairs. The remaining right boots with 'a' can't be paired with left boots unless there are more left 'a's. But if instead, you pair some left 'a's with right '?', then maybe you can use the right '?'s to pair with other left 'a's. Hmm, but that seems worse. Because the right '?' could be used to pair with left 'a's, but that would be better than leaving them unpaired. So maybe the optimal way is to first pair as many specific colors as possible, then use the question marks to pair with the remaining specific colors, and then pair the question marks among themselves.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nStep 1: Pair all left and right boots with specific colors that match. For example, for each color c (not '?'), count the number of left and right boots. For each such color, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But how to track which ones are used? Because once a left boot is used in a pair, it can't be used again.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Because we need to track which indices are used. So maybe we can't just count, but need to actually pair them. However, for the purpose of counting, perhaps we can first process the specific colors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to first pair all the specific colors. For example, for each color c (not '?'), pair left boots with color c with right boots with color c. Once that's done, then pair the remaining left and right question marks with each other, and also with any remaining specific colors.\n\nWait, but how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. For all left and right boots, collect their positions and colors.\n\n2. First, pair left and right boots where both are specific colors and match. For example, for each color c (not '?'), pair left boots with c to right boots with c. We can do this by creating a mapping for each color to a list of indices. Then, for each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\n3. Then, collect the remaining left and right boots that are either '?' or have specific colors that couldn't be paired. For example, after step 1, there may be left boots with color 'a' that couldn't be paired because there were no right 'a's left. Similarly for right boots.\n\n4. Now, for the remaining left and right boots, we can pair the '?'s with each other, and also with the specific colors. However, since '?' can match any, we need to find the optimal way to pair them.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think. Suppose after step 1, there are some left boots with specific colors (say, 'a') and some right boots with specific colors (say, 'a'). But maybe they were not paired because they were already used. Wait, no. In step 1, we would have paired all possible specific color matches. So after step 1, any left or right boots with specific colors that are not paired would have no corresponding specific color on the other side. So, for example, if there are left 'a's left, but no right 'a's left. So those left 'a's can't be paired with any right boots except '?'s.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the remaining left and right boots. Let's think of the following:\n\nWe have:\n\n- Left boots that are specific colors (but couldn't be matched in step 1)\n- Right boots that are specific colors (same)\n- Left and right boots that are '?'\n\nNow, for each of these, we can pair:\n\n- Left '?' with right '?' (they can be paired)\n- Left '?' with right specific colors (since '?' can match any)\n- Right '?' with left specific colors (same)\n\nBut how to maximize the total pairs?\n\nThe optimal approach here is to first pair the left '?' with right specific colors (if possible), and vice versa. Then pair the remaining '?'s among themselves.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose there are some left '?' and some right specific colors. Each left '?' can pair with a right specific color. Similarly, each right '?' can pair with a left specific color. However, since we want to maximize the number of pairs, we need to pair as much as possible.\n\nSo here's a possible approach:\n\nFor each specific color c (not '?'):\n\n- Count how many left boots have color c (left_c) and how many right boots have color c (right_c). But after step 1, these numbers may have been reduced.\n\nWait, no. Step 1 was to pair all possible specific color matches. So after that, for each color c, the number of left and right boots with color c would be zero (if they were all paired), or some remaining. But perhaps not. Wait, no. For example, if there are 5 left 'a's and 3 right 'a's, step 1 would pair 3 pairs. So after that, there are 2 left 'a's left and 0 right 'a's.\n\nSo, in step 2, for these remaining left 'a's, we can pair them with right '?'s. Similarly, for any right 'b's that are left, pair them with left '?'s.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nAfter step 1, collect all the left boots that are not yet paired (including those with specific colors and '?') and same for right.\n\nThen, for each left boot with specific color c, we can pair it with a right '?' (if any). Similarly for each right boot with specific color c, pair with left '?'.\n\nOnce that is done, pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAn efficient way would be to:\n\n- Keep track of the available left and right boots (those not yet paired).\n\nLet me think about data structures. For example, for the left boots, after step 1, we can have a list of left boots that are unpaired. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\n1. Create two lists: left_available and right_available. Initially, all boots are available.\n\n2. For step 1, pair as many specific color matches as possible. For example, for each color c (not '?'), iterate through the left_available and right_available and pair them. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nWait, but for n up to 150,000, we need an O(n) approach. So, perhaps we can create dictionaries that map color to list of indices. For example, left_counts is a dictionary where for each color c (not '?'), we have a list of indices of left boots with color c. Similarly for right_counts.\n\nThen, for each color c (not '?'), the number of pairs possible is the minimum of len(left_counts[c]) and len(right_counts[c]). But we need to pair them. However, how to track which indices are used.\n\nSo, for each color c, we can take the first min(len(left), len(right)) elements from left_counts[c] and right_counts[c], and pair them. Then, remove those from the available lists.\n\nWait, but this is not feasible if we have to track which indices are used. Because once a left boot is paired, it can't be used again.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nInitialize for each color c (not '?'), collect the list of left indices and right indices. Then, for each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for each c, pair the left indices with the right indices. For example, take the first x elements from left and first x elements from right, where x is the minimum of the two.\n\nOnce paired, those indices are marked as used and not considered in further steps.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n, l, r.\n\nThen, for each left and right boot, we can track whether they are used. Maybe create two arrays, left_used and right_used, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for step 1, process specific color matches.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   get all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   get all right indices where r[j] == c and not used.\n\n   pair as many as possible between them. For example, for each i in left list and j in right list, pair them until one of the lists is exhausted.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently. For example, for each color c, we can collect the list of left and right indices, and then pair them in order.\n\nBut for large n, this may take O(n) time.\n\nOnce that's done, we can move to step 2, which is to pair the remaining left and right boots.\n\nNow, the remaining left boots are those that are either '?', or specific colors but couldn't be paired with their counterparts.\n\nSimilarly for the right.\n\nSo, for step 2:\n\nWe need to pair the remaining left and right boots. How?\n\nWe can collect all the remaining left boots (unpaired) and remaining right boots (unpaired). Then, for each left '?' and right '?', pair them. But also, pair left '?' with right specific colors, and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do this optimally.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can collect all the left '?' and right '?'.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots, we can:\n\n- For each left '?' and right specific color, pair them. Similarly, for each right '?' and left specific color, pair them. But how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, we can collect:\n\nLeft_question = list of unpaired left boots with '?'\n\nRight_question = list of unpaired right boots with '?'\n\nLeft_specific = list of unpaired left boots with specific colors (non '?')\n\nRight_specific = list of unpaired right boots with specific colors (non '?')\n\nThen, for each left in left_specific, we can pair it with a right_question. Similarly, for each right in right_specific, pair with a left_question. Once that is done, pair the remaining left_question and right_question.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nLet me think:\n\nThe maximum number of pairs between left_specific and right_question is the minimum of len(left_specific) and len(right_question). Similarly for the other direction.\n\nWait, but if we pair left_specific with right_question, then those left_specific can't be used again, and the right_question are used. Similarly for the other direction.\n\nBut what's the optimal way? For example, if we have 5 left_specific and 3 right_question and 4 right_specific and 2 left_question, then pairing left_specific with right_question and right_specific with left_question would give 3 + 2 = 5 pairs. Alternatively, pairing left_question with right_specific and right_question with left_specific, but that's same thing.\n\nSo the optimal is to pair as much as possible between left_specific and right_question, and between right_specific and left_question.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nPair all left_specific with right_question. How?\n\nTake each left_specific and pair with a right_question. For example, take the first m elements, where m is the minimum of len(left_specific) and len(right_question).\n\nSimilarly, pair right_specific with left_question.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired among themselves.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nAfter step 1, collect all the unpaired left and right boots.\n\nFor the left boots, create a list of left_unpaired, which contains indices of left boots not yet paired. Similarly for right_unpaired.\n\nThen, for the left_unpaired, we can split into left_q (those with '?') and left_s (specific colors).\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired: right_q and right_s.\n\nNow, for the left_s and right_q:\n\nWe can pair each left_s with a right_q. How many? The minimum of len(left_s) and len(right_q). So, for example, take the first min(len(left_s), len(right_q)) elements from left_s and right_q, and pair them.\n\nSimilarly, take the first min(len(right_s), len(left_q)) elements from right_s and left_q and pair them.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as much as possible. The number of pairs is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nSo the total pairs from step 2 is (number of pairs from left_s and right_q) + (number from right_s and left_q) + (number from left_q and right_q).\n\nThis seems like a good approach.\n\nNow, the problem is how to implement this, keeping track of which indices are used.\n\nBut how to collect the left_s, left_q, etc.?\n\nLet me think of code steps.\n\nAfter step 1, we have left_used and right_used arrays.\n\nWe can collect:\n\nleft_unpaired = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i]]\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nThen, for left_unpaired, split into left_q and left_s:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] == '?']\nleft_s = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] != '?']\n\nSimilarly for right_q and right_s.\n\nThen, for pairing left_s with right_q:\n\nTake the first k elements from left_s and right_q, where k = min(len(left_s), len(right_q)). For each pair, mark them as used and add to the result.\n\nSimilarly for right_s and left_q.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this.\n\nBut for the pairing steps, we need to process these lists and pair them.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used. For example, when we pair a left_s with a right_q, we need to mark both as used.\n\nBut during this step, the left_used and right_used arrays are already tracking which are used.\n\nSo, during step 2, the left_unpaired and right_unpaired are the ones not used yet.\n\nSo, during step 2:\n\nProcess left_s and right_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_s), len(right_q))):\n\n   pair left_s[i] with right_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for right_s and left_q.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_q))):\n\n   pair left_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect these lists. Because when we split left_unpaired into left_q and left_s, those lists are already the unpaired ones.\n\nBut in code, we can generate these lists once.\n\nNow, the question is, how to generate the pairs.\n\nBut in code, the steps would be:\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as arrays of False.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nfor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left_indices = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n\n   collect right_indices = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n\n   for i in range(min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices))):\n\n       pair left_indices[i] with right_indices[i]\n\n       mark left_used[left_indices[i]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_indices[i]] = True\n\nBut this approach would take O(n * 26) time, which is acceptable for n=150,000 (since 26*150,000 is 3.9 million operations).\n\nWait, but for each color c, collecting the left and right indices would take O(n) time. So for 26 colors, that would be O(26n) time. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize this. For example, precompute for each color, the list of indices. But for now, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, then collect the left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps it's better to collect the left and right indices for each color once, and then process them.\n\nBut in Python, for each color, we can loop through the entire string and collect indices. However, that's O(n) per color. Which is manageable.\n\nBut for n=150,000 and 26 colors, that's 3.9 million steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, proceed to step 2.\n\nNow, collect left_unpaired, which are indices where left_used[i] is False.\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nThen, split into left_q and left_s, etc.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to pair as discussed.\n\nBut in code, how to collect these lists?\n\nFor example, after step 1, we can generate:\n\nleft_unpaired = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i]]\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nThen, left_q = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] == '?']\n\nleft_s = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] != '?']\n\nSame for right.\n\nThen, for the first part of step 2:\n\nk1 = min(len(left_s), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(k1):\n\n   pair left_s[i] with right_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nSimilarly, k2 = min(len(right_s), len(left_q)):\n\nfor i in range(k2):\n\n   pair right_s[i] with left_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nk3 = min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nBut wait, after the first two steps, some of the left_q and right_q may have been used. So perhaps the code should be:\n\nAfter splitting left_q and left_s, and right_q and right_s:\n\nNow, for the left_s and right_q:\n\nfor i in range(len(left_s)):\n\n   if there are any right_q left:\n\n       pair left_s[i] with right_q[0], and remove right_q[0]\n\nBut in code, perhaps it's easier to take the first min(len(left_s), len(right_q)) elements from left_s and right_q, and pair them.\n\nBut in code:\n\nleft_s and right_q are lists. So, for i in range(k1):\n\n   pair left_s[i] with right_q[i]\n\nBut how to make sure that after that, the left_s and right_q are properly processed. So, for example, after pairing, the left_s and right_q elements are marked as used.\n\nBut once we have the lists, the code can be:\n\nfor i in range(k1):\n\n   left_idx = left_s[i]\n\n   right_idx = right_q[i]\n\n   add to the result list\n\n   left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n   right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for the other parts.\n\nBut in code, after this, the left_s and right_q lists are modified? No, because the lists are generated before the processing. So, for example, in the left_s list, the indices are those that are not used yet. So when we pair them, we have to mark them as used.\n\nBut once that's done, the rest of the code proceeds.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_q and right_q are the ones that were not used in the previous steps. So, for the remaining left_q and right_q, we can pair them as min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left_q and right_q after the first two steps.\n\nWait, no. Because the initial left_q and right_q lists are the ones collected before any pairing. So, for example, after pairing k1 pairs between left_s and right_q, the right_q list has len(right_q) - k1 elements remaining. But since we have already processed those elements, perhaps we need to collect the remaining elements.\n\nBut in code, perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nAfter generating left_s and right_q, take the first k1 elements of left_s and first k1 elements of right_q, and pair them. Then, the remaining elements in left_s and right_q are not used. But in reality, after pairing, the left_s elements are marked as used, so they can't be used again. Similarly for right_q elements.\n\nBut in code, the left_s and right_q are lists of indices. So, after pairing the first k1 elements, the rest of the left_s and right_q elements are not used, but they are still in the lists. So, for the next steps, the code should process the remaining elements.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the left_s and right_q are generated, take the first min(len(left_s), len(right_q)) elements from left_s and right_q and pair them. Then, for the remaining elements in left_s and right_q, they are not paired in this step, but may be processed in other steps.\n\nBut after this, the code will process the right_s and left_q.\n\nSo, for example, after pairing left_s and right_q, the left_s elements that were paired are marked as used. The remaining left_s elements (if any) are still in the left_s list, but they are not used yet. However, since they are specific colors, they can't be paired with anything else except with right '?', which have already been processed (the right_q list has been partially processed).\n\nWait, but after pairing left_s with right_q, the right_q list has some elements left. However, the right_q elements that were not used in this step are still in the right_q list. So, for example, if len(left_s) < len(right_q), then after pairing, there are len(right_q) - len(left_s) elements left in right_q.\n\nBut those right_q elements can be used for pairing with right_s and left_q.\n\nWait, no. The right_q elements are right boots with '?'. So, they can be used to pair with left_s (specific colors) or left_q (question marks). However, the left_s have already been processed in the first step. So, the right_q elements that are not used in the first step can be used in the second step (pairing with right_s and left_q).\n\nSo, perhaps the code should:\n\nAfter the first step (pairing left_s and right_q), the code should process the right_s and left_q.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining right_q elements. Because after the first step, some right_q elements have been used. But the code can't track that, because the right_q list is generated before any processing.\n\nSo perhaps this approach is flawed. Because the code can't track which elements in the right_q list have been used. For example, if we have a list right_q = [a, b, c], and we pair a and b with left_s elements, then c is still in the list. But in code, after pairing, the code would need to know that a and b are now used, and c is still available.\n\nBut the code can't do that. Because the right_q list is generated before any processing. So, the code would need to track which elements in the right_q list are still available.\n\nThis suggests that the approach of generating lists and then pairing elements by index is not correct. Because once we pair some elements, the rest of the list is not updated.\n\nSo, perhaps a better way is to collect the lists, and then process them in a way that tracks which elements are used.\n\nAlternative approach for step 2:\n\nOnce we have left_unpaired and right_unpaired, collect all the left and right indices.\n\nThen, for the left_unpaired, we can iterate through them and try to pair with right_unpaired.\n\nBut how to do that optimally.\n\nAnother idea: For the remaining left and right boots, collect all the left and right indices. Then, for each left boot in left_unpaired, if it's a '?', try to pair it with the first available right boot that is not yet paired. Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, we can collect all the left and right boots that are not yet paired, and for each left boot, try to pair it with a right boot that is compatible.\n\nBut this would be O(n^2) in worst case, which is not acceptable for n=150,000.\n\nSo, we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think again. After step 1, the remaining left boots are those that couldn't be paired with their specific color counterparts. Now, for the step 2:\n\nWe can collect:\n\n- For the left boots, the ones that are '?', and the ones that are specific colors (but couldn't find a match in the right boots).\n\nSimilarly for the right.\n\nNow, the maximum pairs possible is:\n\nFor each left specific color, we can pair with a right '?', and for each right specific color, pair with a left '?'. Then pair the remaining '?'s.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of using queues or counters.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe can count the number of left specific colors and right '?'s. For each left specific color, we can pair it with a right '?'. Similarly for right specific colors.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used.\n\nAlternatively, we can create two separate lists:\n\nleft_specific_remaining = list of left boots with specific colors that are not yet paired.\n\nright_specific_remaining = list of right boots with specific colors that are not yet paired.\n\nleft_question_remaining = list of left boots with '?' that are not yet paired.\n\nright_question_remaining = list of right boots with '?' that are not yet paired.\n\nNow, for the left_specific_remaining and right_question_remaining:\n\nWe can pair them as much as possible. For example, take each left_specific_remaining and pair with a right_question_remaining.\n\nSimilarly, take each right_specific_remaining and pair with a left_question_remaining.\n\nOnce that is done, pair the remaining left_question_remaining and right_question_remaining.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nIn code, perhaps:\n\nleft_specific_remaining = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] != '?']\nright_question_remaining = [i for i in right_unpaired if r[i] == '?']\nright_specific_remaining = [i for i in right_unpaired if r[i] != '?']\nleft_question_remaining = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] == '?']\n\nThen:\n\n# Pair left specific with right question\npairs = min(len(left_specific_remaining), len(right_question_remaining))\nfor i in range(pairs):\n    pair left_specific_remaining[i] with right_question_remaining[i]\n    mark them as used.\n\n# Pair right specific with left question\npairs = min(len(right_specific_remaining), len(left_question_remaining))\nfor i in range(pairs):\n    pair right_specific_remaining[i] with left_question_remaining[i]\n    mark them as used.\n\n# Pair remaining left question and right question\npairs = min(len(left_question_remaining), len(right_question_remaining))\nfor i in range(pairs):\n    pair left_question_remaining[i] with right_question_remaining[i]\n    mark them as used.\n\nBut this approach is similar to what I thought before, but the problem is that after the first step, the left_specific_remaining and right_question_remaining are lists that are not modified. So, when pairing, the code would need to track which elements are used. However, the lists are generated before any pairing, so after pairing, the code would have to mark the indices as used.\n\nBut in code, the lists are generated once, and then during pairing, the code pairs the first few elements of the lists, and marks them as used. The remaining elements in the lists are not processed further.\n\nBut how to track the indices. For example, after pairing the first k elements of left_specific_remaining and right_question_remaining, the code needs to mark those indices as used. The remaining elements in those lists are not used yet, but they are not processed in this step. However, they will be processed in the next steps.\n\nBut this approach would work. Because the left_specific_remaining is a list of indices that are not yet used. When we pair the first k elements, those indices are marked as used. The rest of the list is not processed here, but they are still unpaired and will be processed in the next steps.\n\nBut in the next steps, for example, when pairing right_specific_remaining with left_question_remaining, the code will process those lists, which contain the unpaired indices.\n\nSo, this seems correct.\n\nBut in code, how to generate these lists.\n\nOnce again, after step 1, the left_unpaired and right_unpaired are known.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCollect the left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nThen, create:\n\nleft_specific_remaining = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] != '?']\nright_question_remaining = [i for i in right_unpaired if r[i] == '?']\nright_specific_remaining = [i for i in right_unpaired if r[i] != '?']\nleft_question_remaining = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] == '?']\n\nThen, for the first pairing:\n\nk1 = min(len(left_specific_remaining), len(right_question_remaining))\nfor i in range(k1):\n    left_idx = left_specific_remaining[i]\n    right_idx = right_question_remaining[i]\n    add to result\n    mark left_used[left_idx] = True\n    mark right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for the second pairing:\n\nk2 = min(len(right_specific_remaining), len(left_question_remaining))\nfor i in range(k2):\n    right_idx = right_specific_remaining[i]\n    left_idx = left_question_remaining[i]\n    add to result\n    mark left_used[left_idx] = True\n    mark right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, for the third pairing:\n\nk3 = min(len(left_question_remaining), len(right_question_remaining))\nfor i in range(k3):\n    left_idx = left_question_remaining[i]\n    right_idx = right_question_remaining[i]\n    add to result\n    mark left_used[left_idx] = True\n    mark right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nBut here's the problem: after pairing in the first step, the left_specific_remaining and right_question_remaining lists are not modified. However, the code uses the first k1 elements of each list, and marks them as used. However, in the second and third steps, the code may process the same indices again. Wait, no. Because in the first step, the code marks those indices as used. So, in the second and third steps, when generating the left_question_remaining and right_question_remaining lists, they are generated from the left_unpaired and right_unpaired lists, which include only indices not used yet. So, during the first step, after pairing, the indices are marked as used. So, in the second step, the left_question_remaining and right_question_remaining lists are generated from the left_unpaired and right_unpaired, which already exclude those indices.\n\nNo, that's not the case. Because the left_unpaired and right_unpaired lists are generated once, before any of the step 2 pairings. So, the left_unpaired list includes all indices not used after step 1. Then, the code splits this into left_specific_remaining, left_question_remaining, etc. So, during the first pairing step (left_specific_remaining and right_question_remaining), the code pairs some of these indices and marks them as used. However, the left_question_remaining and right_question_remaining lists are generated before this step. So, they include those indices that were not used yet. But after the first pairing, those indices are marked as used, but the left_question_remaining and right_question_remaining lists still contain them. Therefore, in the second and third steps, those indices may be processed again, leading to errors.\n\nAh! This is a critical mistake. Because the left_question_remaining and right_question_remaining lists are generated once, before any of the step 2 pairings. So, during the first pairing (left_specific_remaining and right_question_remaining), some indices from right_question_remaining are marked as used. However, the left_question_remaining list still contains those indices, which are now used. Thus, in the second and third steps, those indices may be processed again, which is invalid.\n\nThis is a big problem. How to avoid this?\n\nThe solution is to generate the lists for each step dynamically, taking into account which indices have been used.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternative idea: during step 2, we can process the left and right boots in a way that ensures that once an index is used, it is not processed again.\n\nPerhaps using queues or pointers.\n\nLet me think of this:\n\nAfter step 1, we have left_used and right_used arrays.\n\nWe can collect all the left boots that are unpaired and have specific colors (left_specific_queue) and all the right boots that are unpaired and have '?', (right_question_queue). Similarly, collect right_specific_queue and left_question_queue.\n\nThen, for the first pairing (left_specific with right_question):\n\nWhile there are elements in left_specific_queue and right_question_queue:\n\n   take the first element from left_specific_queue and pair with first element from right_question_queue.\n\nSimilarly for other pairings.\n\nBut how to collect these queues.\n\nIn code, perhaps:\n\nleft_specific_queue = deque([i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] != '?'])\nright_question_queue = deque([i for i in right_unpaired if r[i] == '?'])\nright_specific_queue = deque([i for i in right_unpaired if r[i] != '?'])\nleft_question_queue = deque([i for i in right_unpaired if r[i] == '?'])  # No, left_question_queue should be [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] == '?']\n\nWait, sorry, left_question_queue is [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i] == '?'].\n\nOnce these queues are created, we can process them.\n\nFor example:\n\n# Pair left specific with right question\nwhile left_specific_queue and right_question_queue:\n    left_idx = left_specific_queue.popleft()\n    right_idx = right_question_queue.popleft()\n    add to result\n    mark left_used[left_idx] = True\n    mark right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for the other pairings.\n\nThen, for pairing right specific with left question:\n\nwhile right_specific_queue and left_question_queue:\n    right_idx = right_specific_queue.popleft()\n    left_idx = left_question_queue.popleft()\n    add to result\n    mark left_used[left_idx] = True\n    mark right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, for pairing left question and right question:\n\nwhile left_question_queue and right_question_queue:\n    left_idx = left_question_queue.popleft()\n    right_idx = right_question_queue.popleft()\n    add to result\n    mark left_used[left_idx] = True\n    mark right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nThis way, the queues are dynamically modified as elements are removed, ensuring that each element is processed once.\n\nYes! This approach would solve the problem of reprocessing the same indices. Because the queues are built once, and then processed in order, removing elements once they are used.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nCollect left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nCreate four deques:\n\nleft_specific_queue = deque of left_unpaired indices with l[i] != '?'\n\nright_question_queue = deque of right_unpaired indices with r[i] == '?'\n\nright_specific_queue = deque of right_unpaired indices with r[i] != '?'\n\nleft_question_queue = deque of left_unpaired indices with l[i] == '?'\n\nThen, process:\n\nPair left_specific with right_question:\n\nwhile both queues are not empty:\n\n   take left from left_specific_queue and right from right_question_queue.\n\nPair them.\n\nThen, pair right_specific with left_question:\n\nwhile both queues are not empty:\n\n   take right from right_specific_queue and left from left_question_queue.\n\nPair them.\n\nThen, pair left_question and right_question:\n\nwhile both queues are not empty:\n\n   take left from left_question_queue and right from right_question_queue.\n\nPair them.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as [False] * n.\n\nresult_pairs = []\n\n# Step 1: Pair specific colors\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_list = []\n    right_list = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_list.append(i)\n        if not right_used[i] and r[i",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots based on their colors.
