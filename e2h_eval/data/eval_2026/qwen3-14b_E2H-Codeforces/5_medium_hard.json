Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about pairing left and right boots with compatible colors. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the compatibility rules. A specific color (like 'a') is compatible only with another same color or a '?'. A '?' can pair with any color, including another '?'.\n\nSo the challenge is to pair as many left and right boots as possible under these rules. And we have to output the actual pairs too, not just the count.\n\nLet me think about the steps required here. Maybe we can approach this by first handling the pairs where both are specific colors. Then handle the ones involving question marks.\n\nBut how to maximize the pairs? Let's think of it as a bipartite graph matching problem. However, given that n can be up to 150,000, standard algorithms like maximum bipartite matching (like Hopcroft-Karp) would be too slow. So we need a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n1. First, match all left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same specific color. For example, if there's a left boot with 'a', we can pair it with a right boot with 'a'.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining boots (those that couldn't be paired in step 1), use the question marks. But how?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Let's think of grouping the counts of each color on both sides, and then process them in a way that maximizes the matches.\n\nAnother idea: For each color c (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots with color c (L_c) and right boots with color c (R_c). The number of pairs for this color is the minimum of L_c and R_c. Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots with '?' can be matched. But wait, the '?' can also be used to pair with other colors, but we need to account for that.\n\nWait, but the '?' can be used to pair with any color. So perhaps the optimal strategy is:\n\n- First, match all specific color pairs. For each color c (not '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for color 'a', take min(left_a, right_a) pairs. Then subtract those from the counts of left and right for that color.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which could be either specific or '?'), we can pair the '?'s. However, since '?' can be used to pair with any, but we need to pair them optimally.\n\nWait, but what about the case where a left '?' can pair with a right '?', or with a right specific color. Similarly for right '?'.\n\nBut how to maximize the total pairs. Let me think again.\n\nAfter handling the specific color matches, we have:\n\nLeft boots with specific colors (but not matched yet) and left '?'s. Similarly for right.\n\nFor example, suppose there are some left boots with color 'a' that couldn't be matched because there were not enough right 'a's. These can be paired with right '?'s. Similarly, right boots with color 'b' that couldn't be matched can be paired with left '?'s.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe:\n\nWe can first compute for each color (excluding '?'), the number of left and right boots. Then, for each color, we can pair as many as possible. Then, collect all the remaining left and right boots (including the '?'s) and pair them.\n\nBut how to pair the remaining. For example, the remaining left boots may have some specific colors and some '?'. Similarly for the right.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Match all same-color pairs (excluding '?'). For example, for each color c (from a-z), pair left[c] with right[c], taking min(left[c], right[c]) pairs. Then subtract that from left[c] and right[c].\n\nStep 2: Now, for the remaining left and right boots, which include '?' and possibly some specific colors. Now, we can pair the left '?' with right specific colors (if they are not already matched), and vice versa. Also, pair the left '?' with right '?', and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do this optimally. Let's think:\n\nThe remaining left boots have some specific colors (which couldn't be matched in step 1) and some '?'. Similarly for the right.\n\nLet me think of the remaining specific colors on the left and right. For example, if there's a left boot with color 'a' (unmatched), and a right boot with color 'a', but they were not matched in step 1? Wait no, because in step 1, we took min(left[c], right[c]). So if left[c] was more than right[c], then after step 1, there are left[c] - right[c] left boots with color c. But those can't be matched with right[c] anymore. So they can only be matched with right '?'s.\n\nSimilarly, for the right side.\n\nSo after step 1, for each color c (not '?'), the left has left_rem[c] = original_left[c] - matched_pairs[c], and similarly for right_rem[c].\n\nNow, for step 2, the idea is:\n\n- For each color c (not '?'), we can pair the left_rem[c] with right '?'s. Similarly, pair the right_rem[c] with left '?'s.\n\nBut how to do that optimally. Let's think of the following:\n\nWe can collect all left_rem (specific colors) and try to pair them with right '?', and vice versa. Then, the remaining '?'s can be paired among themselves.\n\nBut how to track which indices are available. Because the problem requires us to output the actual pairs, not just the count. So we need to track which boots are used.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think of data structures.\n\nMaybe the approach is:\n\n- For each color (excluding '?'), we can collect the list of left boots with that color and the list of right boots with that color. Then, pair them as much as possible.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those that are not matched yet), we can process the '?'s.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Create two dictionaries: left_counts and right_counts. For each color, store the list of indices (positions) of left and right boots. For example, for left, left_colors['a'] is a list of indices where the left boot is 'a'.\n\n2. For each color c in a-z (excluding '?'), pair as many as possible between left_colors[c] and right_colors[c]. For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, pair 3 of them. Then, mark those left and right boots as used.\n\n3. After that, collect the remaining left boots (those not yet used) and the remaining right boots (those not yet used). These may include specific colors and '?'.\n\n4. Now, for the remaining left and right boots, we can pair them in the following way:\n\n   a. For each left boot that is not used and is a specific color, try to pair it with a right boot that is a '?'. Similarly for right boots with specific color and left '?'.\n\n   b. Then, pair the remaining '?'s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently, especially considering that the order might affect the maximum possible pairs. However, since the problem allows any valid maximum pairing, perhaps we can process greedily.\n\nBut how to track which boots are available.\n\nAlternative approach: For the remaining left and right boots, collect all the left '?'s and right '?'s, and then pair them. Also, pair the specific colors with the opposite side's '?'s.\n\nLet me think of this:\n\nAfter step 1, for the remaining left boots, we can have:\n\n- Left_special: list of left boots with specific colors (not matched yet)\n- Left_question: list of left boots with '?'\n\nSimilarly for Right_special and Right_question.\n\nThen, for each left_special boot (color c), we can pair it with a right_question boot. Similarly for right_special with left_question.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired between themselves.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nBut how to track which boots are available. For example, when pairing left_special with right_question, we need to take as many as possible.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\n- For all left_special (non-?) and right_special (non-?), we have their counts.\n\nFor example, left_special_count = sum over all c (left_counts[c] after step 1)\n\nSimilarly for right_special_count.\n\nNow, the number of possible pairs between left_special and right_question is min(left_special_count, right_question_count). Similarly for right_special and left_question.\n\nWait, but how to pair them. For example, for each left_special boot (color c), it can be paired with any right_question. Similarly for right_special.\n\nSo, for the left_special, we can pair them with right_question. Let's say there are x left_special boots and y right_question boots. Then, the maximum possible pairs is min(x, y). Similarly for the other direction.\n\nBut once we pair them, the remaining left_special and right_special can't be paired with anything except each other (but they are not compatible unless they have the same color, which was already handled in step 1).\n\nWait, but in step 1, we already matched all same-color pairs. So the remaining left_special and right_special have different colors (since otherwise, they would have been matched in step 1). So, they cannot be paired with each other. Hence, the only way to pair them is with the opposite's '?'.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Pair left_special with right_question as much as possible.\n\n- Pair right_special with left_question as much as possible.\n\n- Then, pair the remaining left_question with right_question.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think about how to collect the lists.\n\nBut for the purpose of generating the actual pairs, we need to track which left and right boots are available.\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\nFirst, create for each left boot, a list indicating whether it's used. Same for the right boots.\n\nThen, for step 1, process each color c (from a-z) and pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for each c in a-z:\n\n   For left list and right list of color c, take the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. Mark them as used.\n\nBut how to do this. For example, for each color c:\n\n   left_list = list of indices of left boots with color c that are not yet used.\n\n   right_list = same for right.\n\n   Take the first m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. Pair them. Mark those as used.\n\nOnce that's done, for step 2, collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nThen, for step 2a: collect all left boots that are not used and have color not '?', and collect all right boots that are not used and have color '?'.\n\nPair as many as possible. For example, take the first left_special boot (say, index i) and pair it with the first right_question (index j). Mark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for step 2b: collect all right_special (non-?) and not used, and pair them with left_question (not used).\n\nThen, for step 2c: pair the remaining left_question and right_question. For example, take the first left_question and pair it with the first right_question.\n\nBut how to collect these lists. Let me think about code structure.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 150,000, we need an efficient way to process these steps. Using lists and pointers might be feasible.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used. We can have two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False. Then, for each pair, we mark them as True.\n\nNow, let's outline the code steps.\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as [False] * n.\n\nThen, for step 1: process each color c in a-z (excluding '?').\n\nFor each color c:\n\n   left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n\n   m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(m):\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut this approach is O(n^2) in worst case. For example, if all characters are 'a', and we process each color. However, since we process each color once, and for each color, we loop through the lists once, but in practice, this would be O(n) per color, multiplied by 26 letters. So total O(26n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1.5e5.\n\nBut how to collect left_list and right_list for each color. For example, for each color, we can pre-process the indices.\n\nAlternatively, during step 1, for each color c in a-z, we can iterate through all left boots and collect those with color c and not used. But that would be O(n) per color. Which is 26 * O(n) = O(n) total.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to pre-process for each color, the list of indices. For example, create a dictionary for left and right, where for each color, we have a list of indices. Then, for step 1, we can process each color, and for each, take the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs, and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to manage the order. For example, for each color c, we can have left_list and right_list. Then, for each pair, take the first elements.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can do:\n\nfor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_indices = list of indices where l[i] == c (precomputed)\n\n    right_indices = list of indices where r[i] == c (precomputed)\n\n    then, for each i in 0..min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices)) -1:\n\n        pair left_indices[i] with right_indices[i]\n\n        mark them as used.\n\nBut this would not work because some of the left or right indices may have already been used in previous steps. So this approach would not be correct.\n\nAh, right. So the initial idea of processing each color and collecting the available indices each time is not efficient. Because for each color, we have to check all the indices again, which is O(n) per color.\n\nAlternative approach: for each color, have a pointer indicating which elements in the precomputed list have not been used yet. For example, for left, for each color c, have a list of indices, and a pointer (like a queue). Then, during step 1, for each color c, we take as many as possible from the left and right queues.\n\nBut how to manage that.\n\nLet me think of the following data structures:\n\nFor left, create a dictionary, left_color_map, where for each color c, we have a deque (or list) of indices. Similarly for right.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nfor each color c in a-z:\n\n    while there are elements in left_color_map[c] and right_color_map[c]:\n\n        take the first element from left_color_map[c] and the first from right_color_map[c]\n\n        pair them, and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to track which elements are used. Wait, no, because the deques are built with all the indices for that color. So if we process them in order, and remove them from the deque when paired, that would work.\n\nBut this approach would require that for each color, we process the pairs between left and right. However, this would not account for the fact that some of these indices may have been already used in previous steps. Wait no, because during step 1, we are only processing same-color pairs, and for each color, we process all possible pairs between left and right. So for example, for color 'a', we pair as many as possible between left 'a's and right 'a's. Once that is done, the remaining left 'a's can't be paired with any right 'a's (since they are already processed), but can be paired with right '?'s in step 2.\n\nBut how to build the deques. Let me think.\n\nFor example, for left_color_map, for each color c (including '?'), we have a deque of indices where l[i] == c. Similarly for right.\n\nThen, for step 1, for each color c in a-z (excluding '?'):\n\n    while left_color_map[c] and right_color_map[c] are not empty:\n\n        take left_idx = left_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        take right_idx = right_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        add this pair to the result.\n\nBut this would pair all possible same-color pairs. However, this approach would not work if the same color is processed multiple times. Wait, no, because we process each color once. For example, for color 'a', we process all possible pairs between left and right 'a's. Then, for the next color, 'b', etc.\n\nBut this approach would miss some cases. For example, suppose there are two left 'a's and three right 'a's. Then, after processing color 'a', we pair two pairs, leaving one right 'a' unpaired. But that right 'a' could be paired with a left '?' in step 2. However, since in step 1, we only pair same-color pairs, that's okay.\n\nBut the problem is that the deques for each color are precomputed. So during step 1, we can process each color once, and pair as many as possible between left and right of that color.\n\nThis approach would be O(n) time for building the deques, and O(n) time for processing step 1.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired) are in the deques for their respective colors, including '?'.\n\nNow, moving to step 2: process the remaining left and right boots.\n\nFor step 2a: pair left_special (non-?) with right_question (?), and step 2b: pair right_special (non-?) with left_question (?).\n\nThen, step 2c: pair the remaining left_question and right_question.\n\nHow to do that.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nCollect all left_special (non-?) and not used yet. Similarly for right_special. Also, collect all left_question and right_question.\n\nBut how to collect them. For example, for left_special, it's all indices in left_color_map for colors a-z (excluding '?') that are not empty. But since the deques for those colors are already processed in step 1, but not all elements may have been taken.\n\nWait, no. For example, in step 1, for color 'a', we paired as many as possible between left and right. The remaining left 'a's are in left_color_map['a'], and the remaining right 'a's are in right_color_map['a'].\n\nBut for step 2, we need to process the remaining left_special (non-?) and right_special (non-?).\n\nBut how to get them.\n\nAn alternative idea is to have, for each color, the deques that contain the indices not yet used. So after step 1, for each color, the deques for left and right have the remaining indices.\n\nThen, for step 2a, we can iterate through all colors (except '?') and take their left deques and pair them with right '?' deque.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nFor example, for each color c in a-z (excluding '?'):\n\n    while left_color_map[c] is not empty and right_color_map['?'] is not empty:\n\n        take left_idx from left_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        take right_idx from right_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n        pair them.\n\nSimilarly for right_color_map[c] and left_color_map['?'].\n\nBut this would process all possible pairings between left_special and right_question, and between right_special and left_question.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to pair them. For example, take as many as possible from left_question and right_question.\n\nBut since they are both '?', they can be paired.\n\nSo for step 2c:\n\nwhile left_color_map['?'] and right_color_map['?'] are not empty:\n\n    take left_idx from left_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n    take right_idx from right_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n    pair them.\n\nBut this approach would work, but how to implement it.\n\nBut this approach would require that after step 1, we process the remaining left and right deques for each color.\n\nBut how to collect the left and right deques. Let's think of code steps.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as [False] * n.\n\nCreate left_color_map and right_color_map as defaultdict(deque) or similar.\n\nFor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n    if l[i] != '?', add to left_color_map[l[i]] as a deque (append(i)).\n\n    else, add to left_color_map['?'].\n\nSame for right.\n\nThen, step 1:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    while left_color_map[c] and right_color_map[c] are not empty:\n\n        left_idx = left_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        right_idx = right_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        add (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) to the answer list.\n\n        mark left_used[left_idx] = True\n\n        mark right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nWait, but in this approach, the deques are modified, so that after step 1, the left_color_map and right_color_map have the remaining indices for each color. Then, for step 2, we can process the remaining.\n\nBut this is not entirely correct. Because the left_used and right_used arrays are not being tracked properly. Because, for example, when you popleft from left_color_map[c], that index is now used. However, the code above does not track that, but the deques are modified, so that in the next steps, they are not considered again. But the problem is that the left_used and right_used arrays are not updated. But perhaps we don't need them, because once we take an index from the deque, it's not present in the deques anymore. So, in the next steps, they are not processed again.\n\nWait, but in the code above, after step 1, the deques for each color have the remaining indices. So for example, if a left index was taken from left_color_map[c], it's removed from the deque and not processed again. So the left_used and right_used arrays are not needed. Because the deques are built with all the indices, and once they are popped, they are not available anymore.\n\nBut then, the problem is that the deques for the same color may have multiple entries. However, the code would process all possible same-color pairs in step 1.\n\nBut then, for step 2a and 2b, the code can process the remaining entries in the deques.\n\nSo, for step 2a:\n\nfor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    while left_color_map[c] is not empty and right_color_map['?'] is not empty:\n\n        left_idx = left_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        right_idx = right_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n        add (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) to answer.\n\nSimilarly for right_color_map[c] and left_color_map['?'].\n\nBut then, for each color c in 'a' to 'z', process the left_color_map[c] with right_color_map['?'].\n\nBut this may not be efficient. For example, for each color c, we process all left_color_map[c] entries with the right '?'. However, this could be O(n) in total.\n\nOnce that is done, process the remaining right_color_map[c] with left_color_map['?'].\n\nThen, finally, process the left_color_map['?'] and right_color_map['?'].\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nLet me think of code:\n\nAfter step 1, we have the deques for each color.\n\nThen, step 2a: process left_special (non-?) with right_question:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    while left_color_map[c] and right_color_map['?']:\n\n        left_idx = left_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        right_idx = right_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n        add pair (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\nSimilarly, for step 2b: process right_special (non-?) with left_question:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    while right_color_map[c] and left_color_map['?']:\n\n        right_idx = right_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        left_idx = left_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n        add pair (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\nThen, step 2c: process left_question and right_question:\n\nwhile left_color_map['?'] and right_color_map['?']:\n\n    left_idx = left_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n    add pair (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\nThis approach would pair all possible combinations.\n\nBut is this correct?\n\nLet me think of a test case.\n\nExample:\n\nn=2\n\nl = \"a?\"\n\nr = \"?a\"\n\nStep 1: process same color pairs.\n\nFor color 'a':\n\nleft_color_map['a'] has [0], right_color_map['a'] has [1]. So pair 0 and 1. Now, left_color_map['a'] is empty, right_color_map['a'] is empty.\n\nThen, step 2a: for each color c (a-z), process left_color_map[c] with right '?'. For 'a', left is empty. For '?', left_color_map['?'] has [1] (original l[1] is '?', but after step 1, was it processed? No, because in step 1, we processed 'a' and 'a' pairs. The left_color_map['?'] is for l[i] == '?'. Initially, for l = \"a?\", left_color_map['a'] has [0], left_color_map['?'] has [1]. After step 1, left_color_map['a'] is empty, and left_color_map['?'] still has [1]. Similarly for right.\n\nIn step 2a, for each color c in a-z, process left_color_map[c] with right '?'.\n\nFor c='a', left is empty. For other colors, same. So nothing happens. Then step 2b: process right_color_map[c] with left '?'.\n\nRight_color_map['a'] is empty. right_color_map['?'] has [0]. For each c in a-z, check if right_color_map[c] is not empty and left '?' exists.\n\nFor example, when c is 'a', right_color_map[c] is empty. When c is '?', right_color_map['?'] has [0]. But in the code, for each c in a-z, we process right_color_map[c] with left '?'.\n\nSo for c in a-z, for example, when c is '?', right_color_map['?'] is not empty. But the code is for c in a-z, and for each color c, process right_color_map[c] with left '?'. So for c='?', the code would check if right_color_map['?'] is not empty and left_color_map['?'] is not empty. But in this example, left_color_map['?'] has [1], and right_color_map['?'] has [0]. So during step 2b, when processing c='?', we would check if right_color_map['?'] is not empty and left_color_map['?'] is not empty. But in this case, yes. So:\n\nright_idx = right_color_map['?'].popleft() â†’ 0\n\nleft_idx = left_color_map['?'].popleft() â†’ 1\n\nAdd pair (1+1, 0+1) â†’ (2, 1). But that's a valid pair.\n\nSo the total pairs are (0+1, 1+1) â†’ (1, 2), and (2, 1). But wait, the original l is \"a?\" (indices 0 and 1), and r is \"?a\" (indices 0 and 1). So the first pair is left 0 (a) with right 1 (a). The second pair is left 1 (?) with right 0 (?). That's correct. So the code would generate two pairs. Which is the maximum possible.\n\nAnother example: n=1, l='?', r='?'. Step 1: no same color pairs. Then step 2a: nothing. step 2b: nothing. step 2c: pair them. So output is 1 pair.\n\nAnother example: n=1, l='a', r='?'. Step 1: process color 'a' â†’ left has [0], right has [0] (since r is '?', no. Wait, no. For step 1, we process colors in a-z. For color 'a', left_color_map['a'] has [0], right_color_map['a'] is empty (since r is '?'). So step 1 does nothing. Then step 2a: for color 'a', left has [0], right '?' has [0]. So pair them. So the pair is (0+1, 0+1) â†’ (1, 1). Correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple colors?\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\nl = \"a?b\", r = \"c?d\".\n\nStep 1: for color 'a', left has [0], right has none. for 'b', left has [2], right has none. for 'c', left has none, right has [0]. So step 1 does nothing.\n\nstep 2a: process left_special with right '?'.\n\nleft_special includes 'a' and 'b' (indices 0 and 2). right '?' is index 1.\n\nso for color 'a', process left [0] with right [1]. pair (0+1, 1+1) â†’ (1, 2).\n\nthen, left_special for 'b' is [2], and right '?' is empty. So nothing.\n\nstep 2b: process right_special (c and d) with left '?'.\n\nright_special for 'c' has [0], and left '?' is index 1. So pair (1+1, 0+1) â†’ (2, 1). But that's a pair between left '?' and right 'c' (which is allowed). So now, the pairs are (1,2) and (2,1). But this would use both left and right boots. But in this case, the left index 1 is used in the second pair, and right index 1 is used in the first pair. So no conflict.\n\nBut the problem is that in the code, during step 2a, the right '?' is popped. Then, during step 2b, the right_special (c) is processed with left '?' (which is index 1). So the code would pair them.\n\nThus, this seems correct.\n\nSo the code approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python, handling the deques and the steps.\n\nBut in Python, for efficiency, using deque is better for popping from the front.\n\nBut for the initial setup, for each color, we need to collect the indices.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize left_color_map and right_color_map as defaultdict(deque).\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    c = l[i]\n\n    left_color_map[c].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    c = r[i]\n\n    right_color_map[c].append(i)\n\nThen, process step 1:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    while left_color_map[c] and right_color_map[c]:\n\n        left_idx = left_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        right_idx = right_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        add to answer list: (left_idx +1, right_idx +1)\n\nThen, process step 2a: left_special with right_question.\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    while left_color_map[c] and right_color_map['?']:\n\n        left_idx = left_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        right_idx = right_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n        add to answer list: (left_idx +1, right_idx +1)\n\nThen, process step 2b: right_special with left_question.\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    while right_color_map[c] and left_color_map['?']:\n\n        right_idx = right_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        left_idx = left_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n        add to answer list: (left_idx +1, right_idx +1)\n\nThen, process step 2c: left_question and right_question.\n\nwhile left_color_map['?'] and right_color_map['?']:\n\n    left_idx = left_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n    right_idx = right_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n    add to answer list: (left_idx +1, right_idx +1)\n\nBut wait, the code for step 2a and 2b may have overlapping processing. For example, during step 2a, we process all left_special (non-?) with right '?'. Then, during step 2b, we process all right_special (non-?) with left '?'.\n\nBut what about the case where a left '?' is processed in step 2a? No, because step 2a is for left_special (non-?), so left_color_map[c] for c in a-z (non-?).\n\nSo during step 2a, left_color_map[c] is for non-? colors. Thus, the left '?' is only processed in step 2b and 2c.\n\nThis approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python. However, note that in Python, the default for deque is to be imported from collections.\n\nBut for the code, the code needs to read multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input, the first input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nWait, the sample input seems to be multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains the string l.\n\nThird line contains the string r.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one test case. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but the actual problem expects the code to read from stdin. So the code must read n, then l, then r.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example input is:\n\nInput:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nOutput:\n\n5\n\n...\n\nBut the sample input provided in the problem seems to be a list of multiple test cases, perhaps for multiple examples. However, the code must read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is typically a single test case.\n\nBut the user's note says that the sample input is given as a list, but the actual code should read from stdin. So the code should read n, then l, then r. The code will process that.\n\nSo, in the code, the code reads from stdin:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nl = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nr = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut need to make sure that after reading n, the next two lines are read correctly. However, sometimes, after reading n, the next lines may have leading or trailing spaces. But the problem says that the second line is the string l of length n, and third line is the string r of length n.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed with the code.\n\nNow, the code for the steps:\n\nInitialize left_color_map and right_color_map.\n\nThen process step 1, then step 2a, 2b, 2c.\n\nBut in Python, for the code, the defaultdict(deque) can be used. However, for the initial setup:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(deque)\n\nright_color_map = defaultdict(deque)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    c = l[i]\n\n    left_color_map[c].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    c = r[i]\n\n    right_color_map[c].append(i)\n\nBut for the letters, we need to process all lowercase letters, including 'a' to 'z'.\n\nNow, the code for step 1:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    while left_color_map[c] and right_color_map[c]:\n\n        left_idx = left_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        right_idx = right_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        answer.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\nThen, step 2a:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    while left_color_map[c] and right_color_map['?']:\n\n        left_idx = left_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        right_idx = right_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n        answer.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n\nSimilarly for step 2b:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    while right_color_map[c] and left_color_map['?']:\n\n        right_idx = right_color_map[c].popleft()\n\n        left_idx = left_color_map['?'].popleft()\n\n        answer.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots based on their colors. Each boot can be a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'), which can pair with any other color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Same Color Pairs**: First, we pair boots of the same specific color. For each color from 'a' to 'z', we match as many left boots with the same color as right boots.\n2. **Indefinite Color Pairs**: After handling specific color pairs, we use the remaining indefinite color boots ('?') to pair with any remaining specific color boots. This is done in two steps:\n   - Pair remaining specific color left boots with indefinite right boots.\n   - Pair remaining specific color right boots with indefinite left boots.\n3. **Remaining Indefinite Pairs**: Finally, pair the remaining indefinite left boots with remaining indefinite right boots.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    left_color_map = defaultdict(deque)\n    right_color_map = defaultdict(deque)\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        c = l[i]\n        left_color_map[c].append(i)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        c = r[i]\n        right_color_map[c].append(i)\n    \n    answer = []\n\n    # Step 1: Pair same color\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        while left_color_map[c] and right_color_map[c]:\n            left_idx = left_color_map[c].popleft()\n            right_idx = right_color_map[c].popleft()\n            answer.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n    \n    # Step 2a: Pair left specific with right question\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        while left_color_map[c] and right_color_map['?']:\n            left_idx = left_color_map[c].popleft()\n            right_idx = right_color_map['?'].popleft()\n            answer.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n    \n    # Step 2b: Pair right specific with left question\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        while right_color_map[c] and left_color_map['?']:\n            right_idx = right_color_map[c].popleft()\n            left_idx = left_color_map['?'].popleft()\n            answer.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n    \n    # Step 2c: Pair left question with right question\n    while left_color_map['?'] and right_color_map['?']:\n        left_idx = left_color_map['?'].popleft()\n        right_idx = right_color_map['?'].popleft()\n        answer.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n    \n    print(len(answer))\n    for a, b in answer:\n        print(a, b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Color Mapping**: We use deques to store indices of each color for both left and right boots, allowing efficient popping from the front.\n3. **Pairing Process**:\n   - **Same Color Pairs**: We iterate through each color from 'a' to 'z' and pair as many left and right boots as possible.\n   - **Specific to Indefinite Pairs**: After handling same-color pairs, we use remaining specific color boots to pair with indefinite color boots on the opposite side.\n   - **Indefinite Pairs**: Finally, we pair remaining indefinite color boots with each other.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of compatible pairs efficiently, leveraging deque operations for optimal performance.",
