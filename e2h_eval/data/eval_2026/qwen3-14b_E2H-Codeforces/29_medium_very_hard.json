Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about processing a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. But directly applying each substitution step by step would be computationally expensive, especially since the string can get really long after substitutions. For example, if we have a query that replaces a digit with a long string, and that digit appears many times, the string could become huge. So we need a smarter way to handle this without actually building the entire string.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can track how each original digit contributes to the final value. Wait, no. Because substitutions are applied in the order given. So for example, if there's a query that replaces '2' with '00', and then another query that replaces '0' with '1', then the first substitution would have to be processed before the second. But if we process them in reverse order, maybe we can model the transformations as functions that can be composed.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of thinking about the string as being built up by substitutions, we can model the substitutions as a mapping from each digit to its replacement. However, since substitutions can overwrite previous ones, we need to process them in order, but also track for each digit what it's currently replaced with. But even then, if we have a substitution that replaces a digit with another string that contains digits which may themselves be replaced later, we need to make sure that when we process a substitution, we take into account any prior substitutions that might affect the replacement string.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each query replaces all occurrences of di in the current string with ti. So, for example, if we have a query that replaces '2' with '00', and then a query that replaces '0' with '1', then the first substitution would replace all 2s with 00, and then the second substitution would replace all 0s (including those from the first substitution) with 1s. So the order of processing is important.\n\nBut if we naively process each substitution by replacing all instances of di in the string with ti, then for large strings and multiple substitutions, this approach would be too slow. For example, if the initial string is 1e5 characters long, and each substitution replaces a digit with a longer string, then after a few substitutions, the string could be enormous, making it impossible to process directly.\n\nTherefore, we need a way to represent the substitutions in a way that allows us to compute the final value without building the entire string. How can we do that?\n\nLet me think about the mathematical representation. The final number is the concatenation of various digits, which can be represented as a sum of terms, each term being the contribution of a digit multiplied by a power of 10 based on its position. However, since substitutions can change the structure of the string, perhaps we can model the effect of substitutions using dynamic programming or some kind of memoization.\n\nAnother approach is to model each digit's contribution as a function that can be computed based on the substitutions. For example, for each digit d, we can track what the current replacement is, and how that replacement affects the overall value. But since substitutions can be nested (like replacing d with a string that includes other digits which are later replaced), we need to process substitutions in order, and for each substitution, update the mappings accordingly.\n\nWait, here's a key insight: each substitution replaces a digit with a string. However, when processing a substitution, the replacement string ti may contain digits that have been previously replaced. So, if we have a substitution for digit d, we need to replace all occurrences of d in the current string with ti. However, if ti contains digits that are later replaced, those replacements will happen in subsequent queries. Therefore, when processing a substitution, we need to ensure that the replacement string ti is stored in a way that accounts for future substitutions. Wait, no. Because the substitution is applied immediately. For example, if the first substitution is d -> ti, and ti contains a digit e, then when we apply that substitution, the e's in ti are not replaced unless there's a later substitution for e. Therefore, the replacement strings for each substitution must be stored as they are, and when processing the substitutions, the current state of the mappings is used.\n\nBut again, the problem is that if we have a lot of substitutions, and the string becomes very long, we can't process it directly. So, perhaps we can model the substitutions as a tree or a mapping where each digit maps to a certain expression that represents the substitution chain. Then, when we need to compute the final value, we can traverse this mapping recursively, and compute the value as a modular number.\n\nLet me think about this. Suppose we have a mapping for each digit d, which tells us what string it is replaced with. However, when we process a substitution, say d → t, we need to update the mapping for d. But if t contains other digits, those digits may have their own mappings. However, when we process the substitution, we need to store t as-is, because any further substitutions for the digits in t will be handled in subsequent steps.\n\nWait, but if we process the substitutions in order, then each time we process a substitution, we need to replace all instances of di in the current string with ti. However, if we don't track the actual string, but instead track for each digit what it would expand to, considering all previous substitutions, then perhaps we can model the expansion of each digit as a function.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a mapping called expand, where expand[d] is the string that d would be replaced with. Initially, expand[d] = d for all d. Then, when processing a substitution query \"d → t\", we set expand[d] to t. But wait, that's not correct, because if t contains digits that have their own expansions. For example, if expand['2'] is '00', and then we have a substitution for '0' to '1', then when we expand '2', we need to replace it with '00' and then expand each '0' to '1', resulting in '11'. Therefore, the expand function should not just be the immediate replacement, but the full expansion of the replacement string considering all substitutions up to that point.\n\nAh! Therefore, when processing a substitution query, we need to update the expansion for di to be the current expansion of ti. Wait, no. Because ti is the string that replaces di. But ti itself may contain digits that have their own expansions. However, when the substitution is applied, all instances of di are replaced with ti, and then any further substitutions are applied to the resulting string. Therefore, the expansion of di at the time of the substitution is ti, but when ti is expanded, it's done according to the current state of the expansion mappings. Wait, but when you process a substitution, the ti is fixed as per the current state of the expansion mappings? No, because the substitution is applied immediately. So, for example, if you have a substitution \"d -> t\" where t is a string that contains digits, and then later substitutions for those digits, the substitution for d is fixed as t. Therefore, when you expand d, you need to expand t according to the current mappings at the time of substitution. Wait, no. Because when you process the substitution, you replace all instances of d in the current string with t. However, t is fixed as given in the query. So, if there are later substitutions for digits in t, those substitutions will affect the digits in t. Therefore, the expansion of d must be such that when we expand d, we first replace it with t, and then expand each character in t according to the current mappings.\n\nSo, the expand function for each digit d is the string that results from expanding d according to all substitutions up to that point. However, when we process a substitution, we need to set expand[d] to the current expansion of the replacement string ti. Because ti is given in the query, and when we process the substitution, we need to replace all occurrences of di in the current string with ti. However, ti may contain digits that are later replaced. Therefore, the expansion of di should be ti, but when we expand ti, we need to expand its digits according to the current mappings. Wait, but during substitution processing, when you perform a substitution, you are replacing di with ti, and ti is a string that is fixed at that moment. However, in the future, when ti's digits are substituted, the expansion of di would be ti, and then the ti's digits would be expanded. Therefore, the expand function for di is ti, but when we expand di, we need to expand ti's digits as per the current mappings.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the expansion of each digit as a function that returns the expanded string, taking into account all previous substitutions. So, for example, when we process a substitution for di, we set expand[di] to ti. However, when we need to compute the expansion of di, we need to expand ti's digits recursively. But this seems like it could be computationally heavy if done naively.\n\nBut for the purposes of calculating the final number, we don't need the actual string. Instead, we need the numerical value modulo 1e9+7. So perhaps we can model the expansion of each digit as a pair of values: the value of the expanded string modulo MOD, and the length of the expanded string (since when concatenating digits, the length affects the exponent of 10 used for shifting).\n\nYes! That's a crucial insight. Because when you have a string that represents a number, and you concatenate another string to the right of it, the new number is equal to (original_number * 10^len(new_string) + new_number). So, for each digit d, if we can track two things:\n\n- The value of the expansion of d as a number mod MOD.\n- The length of the expansion of d as a string (i.e., the number of digits).\n\nThen, when a substitution occurs, say replacing d with a string t, we can compute the value and length of t's expansion. But since t can contain digits, which themselves have expansions, we can compute the value and length of t's expansion by combining the expansions of each of its digits.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the value and length of t's expansion? Let's think. For example, suppose t is \"ab\", where a and b are digits. Then the expansion of t would be the expansion of a followed by the expansion of b. So the value of t's expansion is (value_a * 10^length_b + value_b) mod MOD, and the length is length_a + length_b.\n\nSo, for each substitution, when we replace d with t, we can compute the value and length of t's expansion by processing each character in t. However, this requires that when we process the substitution, we have already computed the value and length for each digit in t.\n\nTherefore, we can maintain for each digit d, a value and a length. Let's call them val[d] and len[d]. Initially, for each digit d, val[d] = int(d) mod MOD, and len[d] = 1.\n\nWhen a substitution query comes in, say \"d -> t\", we need to compute the new val and len for d. To compute this, we process each character in t. For each character c in t, we look up val[c] and len[c], and combine them into the overall value and length for the string t.\n\nBut how to combine them? Let's say we have a current accumulated value and length. For example, when building the value of t, we start with 0. Then for each character c in t:\n\ncurrent_value = (current_value * 10^len_c + val_c) mod MOD\ncurrent_length = current_length + len_c\n\nBut computing 10^len_c each time could be expensive if done naively. However, since we can precompute powers of 10 modulo MOD, but since the len_c can be up to ... well, for each substitution, the len of t's expansion can be up to ... depends on previous substitutions. However, since the maximum possible len is not known in advance, but for each substitution, we need to compute the 10^len_c part. Wait, but when combining the current value with a new part, we need to multiply the current value by 10^len_new_part and add the new part's value. So, for example, if we have a string S that expands to value V and length L, and we append a string T that expands to value W and length M, then the combined value is (V * pow(10, M, MOD) + W) mod MOD, and the combined length is L + M.\n\nSo, for each substitution, when we need to compute the value and length of the replacement string t, we can process each character in t, and for each character, we take its current val and len, and compute the cumulative value and length.\n\nBut here's the catch: when processing the substitution, the replacement string t is processed character by character, and each character's val and len are those that are current at the time of processing the substitution. Because the substitution is applied immediately, and any future substitutions will affect the characters in t only if they are processed after this substitution.\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution is processed in order. So, for example, if we have a substitution for d, and t contains a character c which is later substituted, then when we process the substitution for d, the val and len for c are those that were current at the time of processing the substitution for d. However, if a later substitution changes c's val and len, then the substitution for d's t will not be affected. Because the substitution for d is already processed, and the t was expanded based on the current state of val and len for each character in t at that time.\n\nThis makes sense, because when you perform the substitution, you replace all instances of d with t. At that moment, t is fixed as per the current state of the mappings. Any future substitutions for characters in t will affect the t's expansion only if they are processed after the substitution for d. But since the substitution for d has already been applied, the t's expansion was computed based on the current state at that time.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Maintain for each digit d, val[d] and len[d], which represent the value and length of the expansion of d.\n\n- Initially, val[d] = int(d) mod MOD, len[d] = 1.\n\n- For each query, which is a substitution of di with ti:\n\n   - Compute the new val and len for di by processing each character in ti. For each character c in ti:\n\n      - Take the current val[c] and len[c].\n\n      - Combine them into the new_val and new_len for the string ti.\n\n   - Set val[di] to new_val and len[di] to new_len.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, the original string s is processed by expanding each character in s according to their val and len. The final value is computed by combining all the characters' expansions in order.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the final value? Let's think. For example, the original string is s = s_0 s_1 ... s_{n-1}. Each s_i is a digit. The expansion of s is the concatenation of the expansions of each s_i. So, the value of the entire string is computed by combining each s_i's expansion in sequence. So, starting with 0, for each character in s:\n\ncurrent_value = (current_value * 10^len_i + val_i) mod MOD\n\nwhere len_i is the length of the expansion of s_i, and val_i is the value of the expansion of s_i.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nYes. Let's process each character in the original string s, and for each character, compute the contribution to the overall value. Let's say we have a variable total_val, initially 0. For each character c in s:\n\n   total_val = (total_val * pow(10, len[c], MOD) + val[c]) % MOD\n\nBut wait, the pow(10, len[c], MOD) is needed because adding the expansion of c to the end of the current total_val requires shifting the total_val by len[c] digits, which is equivalent to multiplying by 10^len[c].\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\n- Precompute for each substitution, the val and len for each digit.\n\n- Then, process the original string s, and for each character in s, compute the contribution using the val and len of that character, and combine them into the total_val.\n\nHowever, there's a problem here. Because for each step, we need to compute 10^len[c], but len[c] can be up to a very large number. Computing pow(10, len[c], MOD) each time could be expensive if done naively, but we can precompute the exponents on the fly.\n\nWait, but for each step, we can compute the required exponent incrementally. However, for each character in s, we need to calculate 10^len[c] mod MOD. How can we compute that quickly?\n\nBut len[c] can be up to ... Well, for example, if we have substitutions that replace digits with long strings, the len could be very large. However, for each substitution, when we process the replacement string ti, we can compute the len of ti's expansion. So, during the processing of the substitution, for each character in ti, we have their len and val. So, during the substitution processing, when combining the ti's characters, we can compute the len of the ti's expansion, which is the sum of the len of each character in ti. Similarly, the val is computed as the combination of the previous parts.\n\nBut when processing the original string s, for each character c, we need to compute 10^len[c] mod MOD. However, len[c] can be up to O(1e5 * something), but since we are working mod MOD, which is 1e9+7, we can compute this exponent using modular exponentiation. However, for each character in s, doing a pow(10, len[c], MOD) could be O(log len[c)) time. Considering that s can be up to 1e5 characters long, and len[c] can be up to O(1e5) (assuming each substitution adds a lot of digits), this would be O(1e5 * log (1e5)) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute the powers of 10 mod MOD up to the maximum possible len. However, since the maximum len can be up to something like 1e5 * 1e5 (if each substitution replaces a digit with a string of length 1e5, and there are 1e5 substitutions), that's impossible. So precomputing isn't feasible.\n\nTherefore, for each character in the original string, we need to compute pow(10, len[c], MOD) on the fly.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nPython's built-in pow function can compute pow(10, exp, MOD) efficiently, using modular exponentiation. So for each character in s, we can compute this exponent once.\n\nSo, putting this all together:\n\nInitialize for each digit d in 0-9, val[d] = int(d) mod MOD, len[d] = 1.\n\nFor each query:\n\n   di is the digit to replace.\n\n   ti is the replacement string.\n\n   Compute the new_val and new_len for di by processing each character in ti.\n\n   For example, new_val starts at 0, new_len starts at 0.\n\n   For each c in ti:\n\n      current_char_val = val[c]\n\n      current_char_len = len[c]\n\n      new_val = (new_val * pow(10, current_char_len, MOD) + current_char_val) % MOD\n\n      new_len += current_char_len\n\n   Then, set val[di] = new_val, len[di] = new_len.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, process the original string s:\n\nInitialize total_val = 0.\n\nFor each c in s:\n\n   current_char_val = val[c]\n\n   current_char_len = len[c]\n\n   total_val = (total_val * pow(10, current_char_len, MOD) + current_char_val) % MOD\n\nFinally, output total_val.\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros? The problem says that leading zeros are ignored. However, the note says that leading zeros are not removed from the string. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.\"\n\nSo, for example, if the final string is \"000123\", the number is 123. However, if the string is empty, it's considered 0.\n\nBut how does this affect our calculation? Because our current approach computes the value of the string as a number, but leading zeros would contribute to the value as zero. However, the problem says to ignore leading zeros when considering the number. But how can we handle that?\n\nWait, for example, the string \"000\" would be considered as 0. However, according to our method, the val would be 0, which is correct. But what about \"00123\"? According to the problem statement, it's 123. However, our calculation would compute it as 00123, which is 123. But when we compute the value as per the code above, it would be (0 * 10^... + ...) ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think. Let's take the example where the original string is \"00123\".\n\nProcessing each character:\n\nInitially, total_val is 0.\n\nFirst character is '0', which has val 0 and len 1.\n\ntotal_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\nSecond character is '0', same as before. total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\nThird character is '1', val is 1, len 1. total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 1 = 1.\n\nFourth character is '2', val is 2, len 1. total_val = 1 * 10^1 + 2 = 12.\n\nFifth character is '3', val is 3. total_val = 12 * 10^1 + 3 = 123.\n\nWhich is correct. So even though the string has leading zeros, the code correctly computes the value as 123. Because the leading zeros contribute zero to the total_val. So, the code automatically handles leading zeros correctly. Because when you process the first '0', you have 0. Then the next '0' adds nothing. Then the rest adds the digits properly.\n\nBut what about if the entire string is empty? According to the problem statement, the number is considered zero. However, in our code, if the original string is empty, then the loop for processing s would not run, and total_val remains 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the third sample input is '222' with two substitutions: 2->0 and 0->7. The substitutions are processed in order. First, 2 is replaced with '0', then 0 is replaced with '7'. So after the first substitution, val[2] is 0 (val of '0') and len[2] is 1. Then, the substitution for 0 replaces it with '7', so val[0] is 7, len[0] is 1. Now, the original string is '222'. Processing each '2' in the original string:\n\nEach '2' has val 0, len 1. But when processing the first '2', total_val is 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. Then the next '2' gives 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. Then the third '2' gives 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. But according to the sample output, the result is 777. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the sample input:\n\nSample input 3 is:\n\nInput: '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'\n\nSo the initial string is '222'.\n\nQueries:\n\nFirst query: 2 -> 0. So after this substitution, the string becomes '000'.\n\nSecond query: 0 ->7. So the string becomes '777'.\n\nSo the output is 777 mod 1e9+7 = 777.\n\nBut according to our approach:\n\nInitially, val for 2 is 2, len is 1.\n\nAfter first substitution (2->0):\n\nWe process the replacement string '0' for 2. The replacement string is '0', which is processed as follows:\n\nfor each character in '0' (only one character, '0'):\n\ncurrent_char_val = val['0'] = 0, len is 1.\n\nnew_val is (0 * pow(10, 1) + 0) = 0? Wait no, initial new_val is 0, new_len is 0.\n\nWait, when processing the replacement string ti, which is '0', for the substitution of '2' with '0':\n\nWe start with new_val = 0, new_len = 0.\n\nFor each character in ti (which is '0'):\n\ncurrent_char_val = val['0'] = 0 (initially, before any substitution). current_char_len = 1.\n\nnew_val = (0 * 10^current_char_len) + current_char_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\nnew_len = 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo after the first substitution, val['2'] is 0, len['2'] is 1.\n\nThen, the second substitution is 0 -> '7'. So for the replacement string '7', which is a single character. So processing that:\n\nnew_val starts at 0, new_len 0. For '7', val is 7, len is 1. So new_val is 7, new_len is 1. So val['0'] is now 7, len['0'] is 1.\n\nNow, the original string is '222'. Processing each '2' in s:\n\nEach '2' has val 0, len 1. So the total_val is computed as:\n\nStart with 0.\n\nFirst '2': total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\nSecond '2': total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\nThird '2': total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\nWhich would give 0, but the correct answer is 777. What's wrong here?\n\nOh no! There's a mistake in the approach. Because during the substitution processing, when we replace '2' with '0', the replacement string is '0', which is processed according to the current val and len of '0' at the time of substitution. However, at the time of the first substitution, the val['0'] is 0 (original value). But after the second substitution, val['0'] is changed to 7. However, the substitution for '2' was processed before that. So when we process the substitution for '2', the replacement string is '0', which is processed with the val of '0' at that time (which is 0). But after the substitution for '0', the val of '0' is 7. However, the substitution for '2' was already processed. Therefore, when the original string's '2's are expanded, they are expanded to '0's, which are then expanded to 7's. But according to our approach, the val['2'] is 0, len['2'] is 1. However, the expansion of '2' should be '0', which is then expanded to '7', so the val of '2' should be 7 and len 1. But according to our approach, it's not updated.\n\nAh! Here's the problem. Our current approach models the expansion of each digit as a fixed value and length. But when a substitution for a digit is processed, the replacement string's expansion is computed based on the current state of the val and len of the digits in the replacement string. However, if later substitutions change the val and len of those digits, the earlier substitutions are not updated. Therefore, the approach is incorrect.\n\nIn the example above, when the first substitution replaces '2' with '0', the code computes the val of '2' as 0 (the val of '0' at that time). However, later, when '0' is replaced with '7', the val of '0' changes. But the substitution for '2' was already processed, and the val of '2' is still 0. However, the actual expansion of '2' should be '0', which is then replaced with '7', so the val of '2' should be 7. But our approach doesn't track that.\n\nSo the error is that the substitution for '2' is stored as the expansion of the replacement string at the time of substitution. However, if the replacement string contains digits that are later substituted, then the expansion of '2' is not updated. Therefore, the approach is incorrect.\n\nThis is a critical flaw. How can we fix this?\n\nThe problem is that when we process a substitution, we need to capture the expansion of the replacement string ti, considering all future substitutions. But since substitutions are processed in order, and future substitutions can affect the expansion of ti's digits, we need to find a way to represent the expansion of each digit as a function that can be recomputed based on the current state of the substitutions.\n\nBut how can we do that? It seems that the initial approach is insufficient because it only captures the expansion of the replacement string at the time of substitution, not taking into account future substitutions.\n\nAlternative idea: For each substitution, when we process it, we need to replace the current digit's expansion with the replacement string ti, but during this replacement, we need to expand ti's characters based on the current mappings. However, when future substitutions are processed, they may affect the expansion of ti's characters. Therefore, the expansion of the digit di is not fixed but depends on the current state of the mappings.\n\nWait, but that's not possible. Because once a substitution is processed, the expansion of di is fixed as ti's expansion at that time. However, if ti's expansion depends on other digits which are later substituted, then the expansion of di is not updated. Therefore, the approach is wrong.\n\nSo, how to model this correctly?\n\nPerhaps we need to represent the expansion of each digit as a function that can be evaluated dynamically, taking into account all substitutions. However, this would require a way to compute the value and length of each digit's expansion recursively, considering all substitutions.\n\nBut for the purpose of the problem, we need to process the substitutions in order. Each substitution replaces all occurrences of di in the current string with ti. Therefore, during substitution processing, when we replace di with ti, we need to ensure that the ti is expanded according to the current state of the substitutions. But future substitutions will not affect the ti's expansion, because they are applied to the current string, which has already been modified.\n\nWait, no. Because the substitution replaces di with ti. Then, any future substitutions will affect the ti's digits. For example, if we have a substitution di → ti, and then a substitution dj → tj, where dj is in ti. Then, when we process the substitution for dj, it replaces all occurrences of dj in the current string with tj. However, the ti in the previous substitution is already part of the string, and any dj in ti would be replaced by tj.\n\nBut in our approach, the expansion of di is fixed as ti's expansion at the time of substitution. However, the ti may contain dj, which later gets substituted. Therefore, the expansion of di should be ti, and during the processing of the original string, when we expand di, we need to expand ti's digits recursively, considering any substitutions made after the substitution for di.\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach is incorrect. Because when we process the substitution for di, we compute the expansion of ti based on the current state of the mappings, but future substitutions may change the mappings of the digits in ti, which would affect the expansion of di.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because the substitution is applied immediately. For example, if we have:\n\nOriginal string: '2'\n\nSubstitution 1: 2 → '0'\n\nSubstitution 2: 0 → '7'\n\nThe first substitution replaces '2' with '0', resulting in '0'. The second substitution replaces all '0's with '7's, resulting in '7'.\n\nBut in our initial approach, after substitution 1, the val of 2 is 0, len is 1. After substitution 2, the val of 0 is 7, len 1. But the val of 2 is still 0. So when processing the original string '2', the code would compute 0, which is wrong. But the correct value is 7.\n\nSo, the problem is that the substitution for 2 is processed with ti='0', which at that time has val 0. However, after substitution for 0, the val of 0 is 7, which should cause the val of 2 to be 7 as well. But our approach does not update the val of 2.\n\nThus, the initial approach is incorrect. We need a way to track dependencies between substitutions. That is, when a substitution is made for a digit, it depends on the current state of the other digits. But if those digits are later substituted, the previous substitution's expansion should be re-evaluated.\n\nThis seems very complex. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of storing val and len for each digit, we can store for each digit a function that, when evaluated, returns the current val and len based on the substitutions. However, this seems computationally intensive.\n\nAnother idea: When processing substitutions, we can keep track of the current mappings, and whenever a substitution is processed, we update the mappings for the digit being replaced. However, when evaluating the expansion of a digit, we need to recursively evaluate the expansion of the replacement string. For example, when evaluating the expansion of digit d, we look up its current replacement string, and then recursively evaluate the expansion of each character in that string.\n\nBut this would require, for each digit, to know what its replacement string is, and then recursively expand it. This would allow for dynamic evaluation based on the current state of the substitutions.\n\nLet's think about this. Let's maintain for each digit d, a replacement string. Initially, each digit's replacement string is itself. When a substitution query comes in, we update the replacement string for di to be ti. Then, when we want to compute the value of the expansion of a digit d, we recursively expand its replacement string.\n\nFor example, in the sample case:\n\nInitially, replacement for 2 is '2', for 0 is '0'.\n\nAfter substitution 2 → '0', replacement for 2 is '0'.\n\nAfter substitution 0 → '7', replacement for 0 is '7'.\n\nNow, when we want to compute the expansion of 2, we look at its replacement string '0', and then compute the expansion of '0', which is '7'.\n\nSo, the value of 2 is the value of the expansion of '0', which is the value of '7', which is 7.\n\nSimilarly, the length of 2 is the length of the expansion of '0', which is 1.\n\nSo, the problem with the previous approach was that we stored the val and len of the replacement string at the time of substitution, but didn't account for future substitutions. By instead storing the replacement string, and dynamically computing the val and len when needed, we can correctly handle the dependencies.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThe challenge is that for each digit, when we need to compute its val and len, we have to recursively compute the val and len of its replacement string. However, this can lead to exponential time if not memoized.\n\nTo avoid recomputing, we can use memoization. For each digit, we can cache its val and len once computed, and update the cache when substitutions are made.\n\nBut how to manage the cache? Because when a substitution is made for a digit, it may affect the val and len of other digits that depend on it.\n\nThis sounds like a dependency graph. For example, if digit d1's replacement string contains d2, and d2's replacement string contains d3, then changing d3's replacement string would affect d2's val and len, which in turn affects d1's val and len.\n\nThis suggests that we need to manage a dependency graph and invalidate cached values when a substitution is made.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, and each substitution possibly affecting many digits, this could be computationally expensive.\n\nHowever, perhaps we can use dynamic programming with memoization and lazy evaluation.\n\nLet's think of it this way:\n\nFor each digit d, we can have a function get_val(d) and get_len(d), which returns the value and length of the expansion of d. These functions are computed recursively:\n\ndef get_val(d):\n    if d is not in cache:\n        s = replacement[d]\n        val = 0\n        len = 0\n        for c in s:\n            val = (val * 10^get_len(c) + get_val(c)) % MOD\n            len += get_len(c)\n        cache_val[d] = val\n        cache_len[d] = len\n    return cache_val[d]\n\nSimilarly for get_len(d).\n\nBut this approach would work, but with the possibility of recomputing the same values multiple times. However, with memoization, each digit's val and len are computed once and cached. But when a substitution is made, the replacement string for a digit changes, which means that the cached val and len for that digit and any digits that depend on it must be invalidated.\n\nThis leads to the problem of managing the cache when substitutions",
