Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The recycling rate is 'b' — meaning every 'b' used candles can be turned into one new candle. And this new candle can be used again, possibly leading to more recycling. The question is to find the total hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He uses them all, giving 4 hours. Then, those 4 used candles are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are used, so he can make 2/2 = 1 new candle. Use that for 1 hour. Now, after that, he has 1 used candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b=2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's check:\n\nStart with 6: 6 hours. Then 6 used candles → 6/3 = 2 new. Use them, +2 hours. Now, 2 used. Not enough for 3. Wait, but wait. Wait, 2 is less than 3. So total is 6 + 2 = 8? But what about the 2 used candles? Oh, no. Because you need 3 to make a new one. So yes, that's the end. So total is 8.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nThe idea is that each time we use candles, we add to the used pile. Then, whenever the used pile has at least 'b' candles, we can make new ones. Each time we make new ones, we add to the total hours, and then the number of used candles is reduced by 'b' and increased by the number of new candles made (since those new ones will be used later).\n\nWait, but how to model this process?\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps we can think of it as:\n\nInitially, we have 'a' candles. Each time we burn them, they become used. Then, we can collect the used ones to make new ones.\n\nBut the process is:\n\n- Burn all available candles (current_candles) → add current_candles to total_hours.\n\n- Then, collect the used candles (which is current_candles) and convert them into new ones. The number of new candles is (used_candles) // b. But then, the remaining used_candles after conversion is (used_candles % b) + new_candles (since the new ones are now available to be burned again).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the used_candles is the number of used candles. Let me think:\n\nEach time we burn some candles, they become used. So, for example, if I have 'current_candles' number of candles, I burn them all, adding current_candles to total_hours. Then, those current_candles are added to the used_candles pile. Then, we can make new candles from the used_candles.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\nused = 0\n\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current > 0:\n\n    total_hours += current\n\n    used += current\n\n    current = used // b\n\n    used = used % b\n\nWait, that seems like a possible approach. Because, after burning all current candles, we add them to the used pile. Then, we can make new candles from the used pile. The number of new candles is used // b. Then, the remaining used candles after making new ones is used % b. Because, for example, if used is 4 and b is 2, then 4//2=2 new candles, and 4%2=0. So the new current is 2, and used becomes 0. Then, in the next iteration, we burn those 2, add to total, then add to used, etc.\n\nYes. Let's test this logic with the first example.\n\nExample 1: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial current =4, used=0.\n\nLoop:\n\ntotal +=4 → total=4. used becomes 0+4=4.\n\ncurrent = 4//2=2. used is 4",
