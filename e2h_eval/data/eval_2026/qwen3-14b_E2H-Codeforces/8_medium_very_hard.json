Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about directing edges in an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The given flow values for each edge are already determined, and we have to assign directions to them. The constraints are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So, it's a conservation of flow condition.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The resulting directed graph must not have any cycles.\n\nHmm. Also, the original graph is undirected and connected, and the solution exists.\n\nThe output requires that for each edge, we decide whether it's directed as ai→bi (0) or bi→ai (1). \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, the flow conservation for each intermediate node. For each such node v, the total flow going in must equal the total flow going out. So, the net flow at v is zero. \n\nBut since the edges are already assigned their flow values, the direction determines whether the flow contributes to incoming or outgoing. \n\nSo, for each node v (other than 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges directed towards v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed away from v. \n\nBut how do we model this? It feels like a problem where we need to assign directions such that the net flow for each node (except 1 and n) is zero. However, since the flow is already fixed, this is equivalent to choosing directions so that for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v minus the sum of flows directed into v is zero. Which implies that the sum of flows directed out of v equals the sum directed into v. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAnother thought: Since the flow is maximum, the direction assignments must form a valid flow. But perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow is acyclic. \n\nWait, the third condition says that the obtained directed graph must not have cycles. So, the directed graph must be a DAG. \n\nBut how to ensure that? Also, the source has no incoming edges. \n\nSo maybe we can construct a DAG with the source as the root, and assign directions such that all edges point from higher layers to lower layers in some topological order. \n\nBut how does that relate to the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow is a valid maximum flow, and the directions must represent that flow. But since the problem states that the flow volumes are already given, perhaps the direction assignment is possible by building a directed acyclic graph that satisfies the flow conservation conditions. \n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not 1 or n), the total flow entering equals the total leaving. Which means that the sum of all flows on edges incident to v is even? No, because each edge contributes to either incoming or outgoing. Wait, for each edge, the flow is in one direction. So for a node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v (outgoing) minus the sum of flows directed into v (incoming) must equal zero. Which implies that the total of outgoing equals the total incoming. \n\nBut the total of outgoing plus incoming is the sum of all flows on edges incident to v. Because each edge contributes once. So, for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even? Because outgoing equals incoming, so total is 2*incoming (or 2*outgoing). So sum of flows for edges incident to v must be even. \n\nBut the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists. So we don't have to check that. \n\nNow, how to assign directions. \n\nAn idea comes to mind: model this as a directed graph where each node (except 1 and n) has in-degree and out-degree flows balanced, and the graph is a DAG. \n\nBut how to find such a direction assignment? \n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as assigning directions to edges such that for each node (except 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges directed away from it equals the sum directed towards it. Also, the directed graph is acyclic and source has no incoming edges. \n\nThis seems similar to building a DAG where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of flows. \n\nMaybe we can model this as a directed graph with a topological order. Suppose we arrange the nodes in a topological order where the source is first, then other nodes, and the sink is last. Then, all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes. This would ensure the graph is acyclic. \n\nBut then, how to satisfy the flow conservation? \n\nFor example, consider the source (node 1) and the sink (node n). The source's outgoing edges contribute to the flow, and the sink's incoming edges. \n\nBut for the intermediate nodes, the flow in must equal flow out. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of potentials. Suppose we assign a potential to each node, such that for every edge between u and v, the direction is from the node with higher potential to the node with lower potential. This way, the graph is acyclic (assuming potentials are unique). But how to choose potentials such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree structure. But that's probably not general enough. \n\nWait, the problem requires that the directed graph has no cycles. So, the directed graph must be a DAG. Therefore, there exists a topological order of the nodes. Let's imagine that we arrange the nodes in a topological order, say, v_1, v_2, ..., v_n, where v_1 is the source (node 1), and v_n is the sink (node n). Then, all edges go from earlier nodes to later nodes in this order. \n\nIn this case, the direction of each edge is determined by the order. Now, for each node v_i (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges going into it (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows going out (to later nodes). \n\nBut how do we find such an order? \n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model it as a flow network and then perform some kind of traversal. \n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as a directed graph where each node (except 1 and n) has the same total flow in as out. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of flow conservation. For each node v (not 1 or n), the net flow is zero. \n\nBut the net flow is the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum on edges directed towards v. \n\nWhich is equivalent to the sum of (flow) * (direction) for each edge. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nLet me think of each edge as contributing +ci if directed away from v, -ci if directed towards v. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum over all edges incident to v of this value is zero. \n\nSo, for each such node v, the sum of (directions) * ci for its edges is zero. \n\nBut how to assign directions. \n\nThis seems like a system of equations. However, solving this for large n and m is computationally challenging. \n\nAnother thought: Since the graph is connected and we need to direct edges so that the graph is a DAG, perhaps we can perform a DFS traversal and assign directions based on the traversal. But how to ensure flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except 1 and n) has a balance of flows. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: For each node except 1 and n, the sum of flows on edges directed into the node must equal the sum of flows directed out of the node. \n\nThis suggests that for each node v, the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so we don't need to check that. \n\nBut how to assign directions. \n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow is a valid flow. Since the flow is given, perhaps we can model the problem as finding a directed graph that represents the flow. \n\nBut how to do that. \n\nLet me think of the flow as a directed graph. The flow from source to sink must be such that the sum of the flows on edges leaving the source equals the total maximum flow. But since the problem says that the flow is already maximum, perhaps the direction of the edges must form a DAG that represents the flow. \n\nBut again, how to assign directions. \n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can assign directions based on a topological order. Let's imagine that we can arrange the nodes in a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last. Then, for each node in the order, we can process its edges and assign directions accordingly. \n\nBut how to determine the order. \n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the amount of flow coming into it must equal the amount going out. \n\nIf we arrange the nodes in a topological order, then all edges from v go to nodes that come after it. So, for each node v, the incoming edges are from nodes before it in the order, and outgoing edges are to nodes after. \n\nSo, for node v, the sum of flows on edges coming into it (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges going out (to later nodes). \n\nBut how to find such an order. \n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model the nodes as a directed graph with certain constraints and perform a topological sort. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node has a certain \"excess\" of flow. \n\nWait, for the source, all edges are outgoing, so the excess is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. For the sink, all edges are incoming. For other nodes, the excess is zero. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAnother idea: Treat this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow is conserved. This is similar to finding an Eulerian trail, but not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except 1 and n) has equal in-flow and out-flow. \n\nLet me think of the problem as a flow network. For each node v (not 1 or n), the in-flow must equal the out-flow. \n\nSuppose we model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed such that for each node, the net flow is zero. \n\nBut how to assign directions. \n\nAnother approach is to consider the problem as a directed graph with the following properties:\n\n- The directed graph is acyclic.\n- The source (node 1) has no incoming edges.\n- For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum on edges directed out of v.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute for each node v (not 1 or n), the required net flow. But since the net flow is zero, this might not help directly.\n\nWait, for the entire graph, the sum of flows leaving the source must equal the sum of flows entering the sink. But the problem says that the given flow values are part of a maximum flow, so this is already satisfied. \n\nBut how to assign directions. \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of building a directed graph that satisfies the flow conservation and is a DAG. \n\nAn idea: We can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that each node (except 1 and n) has in-degree and out-degree flows balanced. To achieve this, perhaps we can use a modified DFS or BFS approach, processing nodes and directing edges accordingly. \n\nBut how to manage the flow conservation. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree structure. For example, starting from the source, build a tree where each node's edges are directed towards children. However, this may not account for multiple edges and the flow conservation. \n\nAnother thought: Since the graph must be acyclic, we can assign directions based on a topological order. Suppose we have a topological order where node 1 is first, node n is last. For each node in the order, we can direct all edges from the node to later nodes. But then, how to ensure that the flow conservation is met. \n\nLet me think of an example. Take the first sample input:\n\n3 3\nEdges:\n3 2 10\n1 2 10\n3 1 5\n\nThe output is 1, 0, 1. Which corresponds to:\n\nEdge 3-2 is directed as 2→3 (since output is 1, which swaps the original a and b)\nEdge 1-2 is directed as 1→2 (output 0)\nEdge 3-1 is directed as 1→3 (output 1, which is original a=3, b=1, so direction is 1→3).\n\nSo the directed edges are 2→3, 1→2, 1→3. \n\nNow, for node 2 (which is not the source or sink), the incoming flow is 10 (from 1→2) and outgoing is 10 (to 3). So it's balanced. \n\nThe topological order here could be 1, 2, 3. So all edges go from earlier to later. But in this case, the edge between 3 and 2 is directed from 2 to 3, which is allowed in this order. \n\nBut how to find such an order where for each node, the sum of flows on edges going into it (from earlier nodes) equals the sum on edges going out (to later nodes). \n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model the nodes as having a certain \"balance\" of flow. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as building a directed graph with a topological order. For each node, we compute the difference between the sum of flows on edges going into it (from earlier nodes) and the sum on edges going out (to later nodes). This must be zero for all nodes except the source and sink. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. For each node v (except 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. But again, that's already ensured. \n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the nodes as part of a directed graph, and for each node v (not 1 or n), the total flow on edges incident to v is even. Then, for each such node, we can assign directions to edges such that the in-flow equals out-flow. \n\nBut how to do that. \n\nLet me think of the problem as building a directed graph where for each node (except source and sink), the net flow is zero. This is similar to an Eulerian trail problem, where for each node, the in-degree equals the out-degree. But in this case, it's about flow values. \n\nWait, in the Eulerian trail problem, the sum of the in-degrees equals the out-degrees. Here, it's about the sum of flows. \n\nSo perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node has a certain balance. \n\nBut how to assign directions. \n\nLet me think of this as a problem where for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v must equal the sum of flows directed into v. \n\nThis is equivalent to the sum of flows on edges directed out of v minus the sum of flows directed into v equals zero. \n\nWhich can be rewritten as the sum over all edges incident to v of (direction * flow) equals zero, where direction is +1 if the edge is directed away from v, -1 if directed into v. \n\nBut how to find such directions. \n\nThis seems like a system of equations. However, solving such a system for large n and m is impractical. \n\nAlternative approach: Since the graph is connected and the solution exists, maybe we can construct a spanning tree and assign directions based on that. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: Think of the problem as building a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow is a valid flow. Since the flow is already given, the direction of each edge is determined by whether it's part of the forward or reverse direction in the flow. \n\nBut how to find such directions. \n\nWait, the problem says that the given flow values are part of a maximum flow. So perhaps the direction of the edges is determined by the residual capacities. However, the problem doesn't provide the residual capacities, only the flow values. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge has a capacity equal to the flow value, and the direction is such that the flow is feasible. But again, not sure. \n\nLet me think of the problem differently. The directed graph must be acyclic, and for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum on outgoing edges. \n\nLet me think of the nodes as being arranged in a DAG. For each node, the sum of flows on edges going into it from earlier nodes must equal the sum on edges going out to later nodes. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved by dynamic programming or greedy approach. \n\nPerhaps we can process the nodes in a certain order and assign directions to edges as we go. \n\nLet me try to think of the following algorithm:\n\n1. Choose a topological order of the nodes, starting with node 1, ending with node n. \n2. For each node in this order, process its edges. For edges that connect to nodes that come after it in the order, direct them away from the current node. For edges that connect to nodes that come before it, direct them towards the current node. \n3. However, during this process, we need to ensure that for each node (except 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges directed into it equals the sum of flows directed out of it. \n\nBut how to choose the topological order to satisfy this condition. \n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes as being processed in a certain order, and for each node, adjust the direction of its edges to balance the flow. \n\nFor example:\n\nStart with the source node 1. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it (since it has no incoming edges). \n\nThen, for each subsequent node, we can calculate the required flow that must pass through it, and direct edges accordingly. \n\nBut how to calculate that. \n\nLet me think of the flow conservation for each node. For node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. \n\nLet me denote for each node v, the total flow that must leave v as out_flow[v]. For the source, out_flow[1] is the total flow from the source. For the sink, in_flow[n] is the total flow. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that for each node (except source and sink), the inflow equals outflow. \n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding an orientation of edges that makes the graph a directed graph with flow conservation. \n\nBut how to find such an orientation. \n\nAnother idea: For each node v (except source and sink), the total flow on edges incident to v must be even. But since the solution exists, this is guaranteed. \n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nConstruct a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has the sum of flows on incoming edges equal to the sum on outgoing edges. \n\nThis can be achieved by considering the edges as a multigraph and finding an Eulerian trail. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of each edge as contributing to the flow of the nodes. For each node, we need to have the sum of flows on edges directed out of it equal to the sum directed into it. \n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding an orientation of an undirected graph such that the in-degree and out-degree of each node (except source and sink) are balanced. \n\nBut again, how to do that. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. For each node v (not 1 or n), the total flow on edges incident to v is S_v. Since the flow is conserved, we need to split S_v into two equal parts: one for incoming and one for outgoing. \n\nSo for each such node v, the sum of flows on edges directed into v is S_v / 2, and similarly for outgoing. \n\nBut how to assign directions to edges to achieve this. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a flow network itself. For example, for each node v (not 1 or n), we need to have exactly S_v / 2 flow directed out of it. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where for each node v (not 1 or n), the net flow (outgoing - incoming) is zero. \n\nThis is similar to a circulation problem. \n\nBut perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nWe can create a directed graph where each edge has a capacity equal to its flow value. Then, for each node v (not 1 or n), the net flow must be zero. \n\nBut this seems abstract. \n\nAnother Idea:\n\nSince the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. For each node in the order, we can direct edges from it to later nodes. Then, for each node, we can calculate the required flow that must be sent out through its outgoing edges. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Choose a topological order of the nodes. The source is first, the sink is last. \n2. For each node v in the order (excluding the sink), compute the amount of flow that must be sent out from v. For the source, this is the total flow leaving it. For other nodes, this is the amount of flow that must be passed on to later nodes. \n3. For each edge connected to v, if the other end is later in the order, direct the edge from v to that node. If the other end is earlier, then the edge is directed from the other node to v. \n\nBut how to compute the required flow. \n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For a node v in the topological order (not the sink), the amount of flow that enters v must be equal to the amount that leaves v. \n\nThe flow entering v comes from earlier nodes. The flow leaving v goes to later nodes. \n\nSo, for each node v (not sink), the total flow entering v from earlier nodes is equal to the total flow leaving v to later nodes. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using a greedy approach. Let's start with the source. \n\nFor the source, all edges are directed away from it. The amount of flow leaving the source is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it. \n\nThen, for each subsequent node in the topological order, we can calculate the amount of flow that must be passed on. \n\nFor example, suppose we have a node v that is processed after the source. The flow entering v from earlier nodes is the sum of flows on edges directed into v from earlier nodes. This must equal the flow leaving v to later nodes. \n\nBut how to ensure that. \n\nMaybe we can model this as follows:\n\nWe can process the nodes in a topological order. For each node v, we maintain the amount of flow that must be passed out through its outgoing edges. \n\nInitially, for the source, this is the sum of flows on all edges connected to it. \n\nFor each node v (not the sink), when we process it, we look at all edges connected to it that are directed towards later nodes. The sum of these flows must be equal to the amount of flow that entered v from earlier nodes. \n\nBut how to determine the direction of edges. \n\nThis seems like a chicken-and-egg problem. \n\nLet me think of the following example. Suppose we have a node v with edges to u (earlier) and w (later). The flow on the edge between v and u is c. If the edge is directed from u to v, then this contributes c to the inflow of v. If it's directed from v to u, then it contributes to the outflow of v. \n\nBut how to decide this. \n\nPerhaps, during the topological processing, we can adjust the direction of edges to balance the flow. \n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Choose a topological order where node 1 is first and node n is last. \n- For each node v in the order (excluding the sink), compute the amount of flow that must be passed out from v. \n- For all edges connected to v that are not yet directed, decide their direction based on the other node's position in the topological order. \n\nBut how to compute the required flow. \n\nMaybe the following approach works:\n\nFor each node v (not the sink), the total flow that must be passed out is equal to the total flow that entered v from earlier nodes. \n\nLet me define for each node v, inflow[v] as the sum of flows on edges directed into v from earlier nodes. \n\nWhen processing v, for each edge between v and a later node w, we direct it from v to w. This adds the flow of that edge to the outflow of v. \n\nBut what about edges between v and earlier nodes? They must be directed from the earlier node to v, contributing to the inflow of v. \n\nBut during the processing of v, the inflow[v] is already determined by the earlier nodes. \n\nOnce we have processed all earlier nodes, the inflow[v] is known. The outflow from v must be equal to inflow[v]. \n\nBut the outflow from v is the sum of flows on edges directed from v to later nodes. \n\nThus, for each node v, after determining the inflow, we need to select edges directed from v to later nodes such that their total flow equals inflow[v]. \n\nBut how to ensure that this is possible. \n\nThis sounds like a problem of selecting a subset of edges from v to later nodes whose total flow equals inflow[v]. \n\nBut how to do this. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, for each node v, collect all edges to later nodes. Then, select edges in some order, adding their flows until the required total is reached. \n\nHowever, this may not always be possible, but the problem states that a solution exists. \n\nLet me think of an example. \n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nNodes: 1, 2, 3. Topological order is 1, 2, 3. \n\nFor node 1: inflow[1] is zero (since it's the source). The outflow must be sum of flows on edges connected to it. \n\nEdges connected to 1 are (1-2 with 10) and (3-1 with 5). So outflow from 1 is 10 + 5 = 15. \n\nNow, node 2 is processed next. The inflow to node 2 is the flow from edges directed into it from earlier nodes. Earlier nodes are only 1. There is an edge between 1 and 2 with flow 10. So inflow[2] is 10. \n\nThe edges from node 2 to later nodes (node 3) is the edge between 2 and 3 with flow 10. We need to direct this edge from 2 to 3, contributing 10 to the outflow of node 2. Which matches the inflow of 10. \n\nThus, node 2's outflow is 10, matching its inflow. \n\nThen, node 3 (sink) is processed. Its inflow is 10 (from node 2) plus 5 (from node 1), totaling 15. Which is the maximum flow, and since it's the sink, there's no requirement for outflow. \n\nThis works. \n\nAnother example: suppose a node v has inflow of X, and has several edges to later nodes. We need to select a subset of those edges whose total flow equals X. \n\nBut how to ensure this is possible. \n\nBut the problem says that a solution exists. So perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\n- For each node v in the topological order (excluding the sink), after computing inflow[v], we direct edges from v to later nodes in such a way that their sum of flows is equal to inflow[v]. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nThis seems like a problem of selecting edges to direct from v to later nodes to accumulate the required inflow[v]. \n\nBut how to do this. \n\nOne possible approach is to greedily direct edges from v to later nodes, adding their flows to the outflow until we reach the required inflow. \n\nFor example:\n\nInitialize outflow = 0. For each edge from v to a later node w, if adding its flow to outflow would not exceed inflow[v], then direct it from v to w, add its flow to outflow. Once the outflow equals inflow[v], stop. \n\nBut what if there are multiple edges and their total is exactly inflow[v]? \n\nThis seems plausible. \n\nBut how to handle cases where the sum of all edges from v to later nodes is greater than inflow[v]. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, a solution exists, so such cases must be handled. \n\nBut how to ensure that the sum of flows from v to later nodes is at least inflow[v], or that there is a subset that sums to it. \n\nThis seems like a problem that could be solved with a greedy approach, but I'm not sure. \n\nBut let's think of the overall process. \n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. Choose a topological order of the nodes, with source first and sink last. \n\nHow to choose this order? Well, the graph is undirected, but we need to assign directions based on this order. \n\nBut how to choose the order. \n\nMaybe we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal, starting from the source, and assigning nodes to the topological order in the order they are visited. This would ensure that all edges are directed from earlier to later in the order. \n\nBut how to ensure that this order allows the flow conservation to be satisfied. \n\nAlternatively, we can build a directed graph where the edges are directed based on the topological order. \n\nBut how to compute the topological order. \n\nWait, since the graph is undirected, but we need to assign directions based on the topological order, perhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the source, and assign the order as the discovery order. \n\nOnce the order is determined, we can process the nodes in that order. \n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the topological order is 1, 2, 3. \n\nNow, for each node, during processing, we calculate the inflow and direct edges from it to later nodes to match the inflow. \n\nBut how to calculate the inflow. \n\nThe inflow for node v is the sum of flows on edges directed into v from earlier nodes. These are the edges between v and nodes that are earlier in the topological order. \n\nFor example, for node 2, the inflow is the sum of flows on edges directed from earlier nodes (only node 1) to node 2. \n\nSo, during processing of node v, we can calculate the inflow as the sum of flows on edges between v and earlier nodes, directed towards v. \n\nBut how to know which edges are directed towards v. \n\nWait, during the processing of the nodes in the topological order, for each node v, we look at all edges connected to v. For edges that connect to nodes earlier in the order, they are directed towards v (since the other node is earlier). For edges connecting to nodes later in the order, they are directed from v to those nodes. \n\nBut how to compute the inflow for node v. \n\nThe inflow for node v is the sum of flows on edges that are directed into v from earlier nodes. Those edges are exactly the ones between v and earlier nodes. \n\nSo, during the processing of node v, the inflow is the sum of flows on all edges between v and earlier nodes. \n\nBut wait, the direction of these edges is determined by their position in the topological order. For example, if u is earlier than v, then the edge between u and v is directed from u to v. \n\nSo, the inflow for v is the sum of flows on all edges between v and earlier nodes. \n\nOnce we have this inflow, we need to direct edges from v to later nodes such that their sum of flows equals the inflow. \n\nBut how to do this. \n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFor each node v in the topological order (excluding the sink):\n\n- Compute the inflow as the sum of flows on edges between v and earlier nodes. \n- Collect all edges between v and later nodes. \n- Select a subset of these edges whose total flow is equal to the inflow. \n- Direct those edges from v to the later node, and the remaining edges (if any) are directed from the later node to v. \n\nBut how to select the subset. \n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a subset of edges with total flow equal to inflow. \n\nBut since the solution exists, this subset must exist. \n\nBut how to find it efficiently. \n\nA greedy approach: iterate through the edges from v to later nodes, and direct them from v to later node as long as adding their flow does not exceed the inflow. Once the inflow is reached, stop. \n\nBut what if the sum of all such edges is exactly the inflow? Then we direct all of them. \n\nThis seems like a viable approach. \n\nLet me test this with the first sample input. \n\nNode 1 is processed first. inflow is 0. Edges from node 1 to later nodes (nodes 2 and 3). Their flows are 10 and 5. Sum is 15. So we direct both edges from 1 to later nodes. \n\nThen, node 2 is processed. inflow is sum of flows from earlier nodes (node 1) to node 2. That is 10. Edges from node 2 to later nodes (node 3) with flow 10. So we direct this edge from 2 to 3. The sum is 10, which matches the inflow. \n\nThen, node 3 is processed (sink). \n\nThis works. \n\nAnother example: suppose node v has inflow of 15, and edges to later nodes with flows 10 and 5. Then, directing both edges gives sum 15. \n\nAnother case: inflow is 10, and edges have flows 5, 5, 5. We can select any two of them. \n\nBut how to choose which ones. \n\nBut since the problem allows any valid solution, we can choose any. \n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each node v in topological order (excluding sink):\n\n   inflow = sum of flows on edges between v and earlier nodes.\n\n   collect all edges between v and later nodes.\n\n   initialize outflow = 0.\n\n   for each edge in edges between v and later nodes:\n\n       if outflow + edge's flow <= inflow:\n\n           direct this edge from v to later node.\n\n           outflow += edge's flow.\n\n       else:\n\n           direct this edge from later node to v.\n\n   (after processing all edges, outflow should equal inflow, since solution exists)\n\nBut how to ensure that this works. \n\nLet me think of a scenario where the sum of all edges from v to later nodes is exactly inflow. Then, directing all edges from v to later nodes would work. \n\nIf the sum is larger than inflow, then we need to select some subset. \n\nBut the greedy approach would take the edges in some order, adding as much as possible. \n\nBut since the solution exists, the sum of all edges from v to later nodes must be >= inflow. \n\nWhy? Because the inflow is the amount of flow that must be passed on from v. \n\nLet me think of the total flow in the graph. \n\nThe total flow from the source is the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. For each node v (not source or sink), the inflow is the amount that must be passed on. \n\nBut how to prove that the sum of flows from v to later nodes is at least the inflow. \n\nThis requires some reasoning. \n\nLet me consider the entire graph. For the source, the outflow is the total flow. For each node v (not sink), the outflow is equal to the inflow. \n\nThe total flow from the source is equal to the total inflow into the sink. \n\nNow, for any node v, the sum of flows on edges between v and earlier nodes plus the sum of flows on edges between v and later nodes is equal to the sum of all flows on edges incident to v. \n\nBut the inflow for v is the sum of flows on edges between v and earlier nodes. \n\nThe outflow from v is the sum of flows on edges directed from v to later nodes. \n\nSince for v (not sink), the inflow equals the outflow. \n\nBut the sum of flows on edges between v and later nodes is the sum of flows on edges from v to later nodes (directed) plus the sum of flows on edges from later nodes to v (directed). \n\nBut the sum of flows on edges between v and later nodes is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed from v to later nodes plus the sum of flows directed from later nodes to v. \n\nBut the outflow from v is the sum of flows directed from v to later nodes. \n\nBut the inflow is the sum of flows directed into v from earlier nodes. \n\nAnd for v, inflow equals outflow. \n\nBut how does this relate to the sum of flows between",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies the flow conservation conditions, has no cycles, and the source node (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. The solution involves determining a topological order of the nodes and using a greedy approach to direct edges based on this order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Topological Order**: We start by performing a Depth-First Search (DFS) from the source node (vertex 1) to determine a topological order of the nodes.
