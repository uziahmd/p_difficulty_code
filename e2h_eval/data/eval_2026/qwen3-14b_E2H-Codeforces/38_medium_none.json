    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of nodes required for a p-reachable directed graph and then determining the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly a p-reachable graph is. According to the problem statement, a p-reachable graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So, for each such pair, both directions must have paths. But the unidirectional pairs are those where there's a path from u to v but not vice versa. \n\nThe first part of the problem is to find the minimal number of nodes needed so that there are exactly p such mutual reachability pairs. Then, among all such minimal node configurations, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs possible.\n\nLet me think about how mutual reachability pairs can be formed. If two nodes are in the same strongly connected component (SCC), then they are mutually reachable. So, the number of mutual pairs is the sum over each SCC of size k of (k choose 2), since each pair of nodes in the same SCC contributes one such ordered pair (u, v) with u < v. Wait, but the problem says ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v. So for a component of size k, the number of such pairs is C(k, 2) because each unordered pair {u, v} contributes exactly one ordered pair (u, v) where u < v. \n\nSo, the total p is the sum of C(k_i, 2) for each component of size k_i. \n\nOur goal is to find the minimal number of nodes n such that there exists a set of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m (summing to n) where the sum of C(k_i, 2) equals p. And then, among all such possible decompositions of p into these components, find the one that maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nWait, but how does the structure of the graph affect the number of unidirectional pairs? Because unidirectional pairs are those where u can reach v but not vice versa. However, in the case of multiple SCCs, if we arrange them in a DAG structure (each component points to others in a way that there's no cycles between them), then any pair of nodes from different components may have one-way reachability depending on the direction of edges between components. \n\nBut to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, perhaps we need to arrange the components in a way that as many pairs of nodes as possible are in different components and have a directed path in one direction. However, this seems complex. Let's think about the maximum possible number of unidirectional pairs given the component sizes.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nThe total number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v is n*(n-1). From this, we subtract the number of mutual pairs (which is p) and the number of pairs that are not reachable at all. However, the problem defines unidirectional pairs as those where there is a path from u to v but not from v to u. So, the total unidirectional pairs would be (total ordered pairs (u != v)) - 2*p - (number of non-reachable pairs). Wait, no. Because for each pair (u, v) where u != v, there are four possibilities:\n\n- u and v are not reachable from each other: neither can reach the other. These are not counted in any of the categories.\n- They are reachable in both directions: this contributes to the p count (if u < v).\n- Only u can reach v: this is a unidirectional pair.\n- Only v can reach u: this is another unidirectional pair.\n\nBut the problem counts the unidirectional pairs as ordered pairs where u != v, there's a path from u to v, and no path from v to u. So for each unordered pair {u, v}, if they are in different components and there's a directed path from u to v, then (u, v) is a unidirectional pair. If there's a path from v to u, then (v, u) is a unidirectional pair. But if they are in the same component, then they are mutual.\n\nBut how to model this? The maximum number of unidirectional pairs would occur when, between different components, the edges are arranged such that for each pair of components A and B, all nodes in A can reach all nodes in B, or vice versa. But arranging this optimally would require that the components are ordered in a linear chain. For example, if the components are arranged in a DAG where each component points to all components that come after it. In that case, for any two components A and B, if A comes before B, then all nodes in A can reach all nodes in B. Thus, for each pair of nodes u in A and v in B, if A comes before B, then (u, v) is a unidirectional pair. \n\nBut then, the number of unidirectional pairs between components would be the sum for all pairs of components (A, B) where A comes before B of (size of A * size of B). Because each such pair contributes size_A * size_B unidirectional pairs. \n\nWait, but if the components are arranged in a DAG where each component is connected to all subsequent ones, then for any two components A and B, if A is before B, then all nodes in A can reach all nodes in B. So for each such pair, the number of unidirectional pairs between them is size_A * size_B. However, if there are multiple components, say C1, C2, C3, then the total between components would be C1*C2 + C1*C3 + C2*C3. \n\nBut if the components are arranged in a linear order, then the total number of such pairs is the sum_{i<j} (size_i * size_j) * 1. Because for each i < j, the components are ordered such that all nodes in Ci can reach Cj. Therefore, for each pair (u in Ci, v in Cj), (u, v) is a unidirectional pair. \n\nBut in this case, the total number of unidirectional pairs would be:\n\nsum_{i<j} (size_i * size_j) * 1 + sum_{i} (number of unidirectional pairs within Ci?) No, because within a component, all pairs are mutual. So within each component, there are no unidirectional pairs. So the total unidirectional pairs is the sum over all pairs of components (i < j) of (size_i * size_j) multiplied by 1 (since for each pair of components, the direction is from i to j, and thus each u in i and v in j gives a unidirectional pair (u, v)). \n\nBut wait, what if the components are arranged in a DAG where some components have edges to others but not all? For example, if there are three components A, B, C, and A points to B, B points to C, but A doesn't point to C. Then, A can reach C via B. So, the number of unidirectional pairs between A and C would still be size_A * size_C. But in this case, the arrangement of the DAG allows for the same total as if the components were arranged in a linear chain. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is achieved when the components are arranged in a linear order, so that for every pair of components, one is before the other, and all nodes in the earlier component can reach all nodes in the later component. This way, the sum of size_i * size_j for all i < j is maximized. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to, given that the sum of C(k_i, 2) = p, find the decomposition of n into k_1, k_2, ..., k_m (summing to n) such that the sum of (k_i choose 2) equals p, and the minimal n is found. Then, among all such decompositions, find the one that maximizes the sum over all pairs of components (i < j) of (k_i * k_j). \n\nWait, but how to compute this sum? Let me think: sum_{i < j} k_i * k_j. \n\nWe can note that sum_{i < j} k_i * k_j = [ (sum k_i)^2 - sum (k_i^2) ] / 2. Since sum k_i is n, this becomes (n² - sum k_i²)/2. \n\nSo, the problem of maximizing the number of unidirectional pairs is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squares of the component sizes. Because the larger the sum of squares, the smaller the value of (n² - sum squares)/2. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (n² - sum squares)/2. To maximize this value, we need to minimize sum squares. \n\nSo, given that the sum of (k_i choose 2) is fixed as p, we need to arrange the components into sizes k_i such that sum (k_i choose 2) = p, and sum k_i is minimized. Then, among all such decompositions, we need to choose the one that minimizes the sum of squares of k_i. Because that will maximize the (n² - sum squares)/2 term. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that there exists a set of integers k_1, ..., k_m (summing to n) with sum C(k_i, 2) = p.\n\n2. Among all such decompositions, select the one that minimizes sum (k_i^2), which will maximize the unidirectional pairs.\n\nSo the first part is to find the minimal n. How do we find that?\n\nLet me think: For a given n, the maximum possible p is when all nodes are in one component. So that's C(n, 2). So for example, if p is C(n, 2), then minimal n is the smallest n where C(n, 2) >= p. But if p is less than that, perhaps we can split into components.\n\nBut to find the minimal n, perhaps we can model this as follows: the sum of C(k_i, 2) must equal p. We want to find the minimal n such that this is possible.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of representing p as a sum of combinations of numbers. The optimal way to minimize n is to use as large as possible components. Because for a given sum of C(k_i, 2), using larger components would reduce the total number of nodes. For example, suppose we have p=3. C(3,2) is 3, so n=3. Alternatively, if we split into 2 and 1, sum is C(2,2) + C(1,2) = 1 + 0 = 1 < 3. So that's worse. So to get p=3, minimal n is 3.\n\nAnother example: p=4. C(3,2)=3. So to reach 4, we can have a component of 3 and a component of 2 (sum C(3,2) + C(2,2) = 3+1=4). Total nodes is 3+2=5. Alternatively, maybe another decomposition? Like 4 and 1: C(4,2) is 6 which is more than 4. So that's not helpful. Or 2+2: sum is 1 + 1 = 2 <4. So the minimal n is 5. But wait, perhaps there's a better way. For example, maybe 4 can be achieved with a component of 4, but that would give 6. So no. So the minimal n is 5. But wait, what if we have a component of size 3 (C(3,2)=3) and another component of size 2 (C(2,2)=1), total sum 4. So total nodes 3+2=5. So yes.\n\nSo the approach for finding the minimal n is to find the minimal n such that the maximum possible sum of C(k_i, 2) for components adding up to n is at least p. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is determined by the following approach: find the minimal n where the sum of the maximum possible C(k_i, 2) for components adding up to n is >= p. But how to compute this?\n\nWait, but for a given n, the maximum sum of C(k_i, 2) is achieved when we have one component of size n (so sum is C(n, 2)), and the minimal sum is when we split into as many 1s and 2s as possible (since C(1, 2)=0, C(2,2)=1, etc.)\n\nBut for our problem, we need to find the minimal n such that there exists some decomposition of n into components where the sum of C(k_i, 2) equals exactly p.\n\nSo how do we find this n?\n\nAn approach is to think of the problem as trying to find the minimal n such that p is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum (C(n,2)), and there exists a way to split into components so that their sum of C(k_i, 2) is exactly p.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: for each possible n, check if it's possible to have sum C(k_i, 2) = p. The minimal n is the smallest such n.\n\nTo find the minimal n, perhaps we can start by finding the minimal n where C(n, 2) >= p. Let's call this value n0. Then, the minimal n could be n0 or possibly less, but how?\n\nWait, for example, if p is 3, then n0 is 3 (C(3,2) =3). Which is correct. For p=4, n0 is 4 (C(4,2)=6), but the actual minimal n is 5 (as discussed earlier). So in this case, n0 is 4, but the minimal n is higher than that. So this suggests that the minimal n is not always n0. Therefore, the approach of finding n0 and then checking is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the minimal value such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) can be p. How can we compute that?\n\nAnother way to think: the sum of C(k_i, 2) is equal to the total number of mutual pairs. Let's denote that sum as p. For a given decomposition of the nodes into components, each of size k_i, the sum is sum (k_i choose 2). \n\nTo find the minimal n, perhaps we can model it as follows: find the minimal n such that p can be written as sum (k_i choose 2), where sum k_i =n, and each k_i >=1. \n\nThis seems like a problem of integer partitioning. For example, for a given p, find the minimal n where p can be expressed as a sum of combinations of integers (each term is (k_i choose 2)), and the sum of k_i is n.\n\nBut how can we compute that efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think greedily. For the minimal n, we want to use as few components as possible. For example, if we can have a single component of size m where C(m, 2) =p, then n is m. Otherwise, we need to split into multiple components.\n\nBut when p is not exactly a triangular number, we need to split into multiple components. For example, if p is 4, then the closest triangular number is 3 (C(3,2)) and 6 (C(4,2)). So 4 is between them. So we need to take C(3,2) + C(2,2) = 3+1=4, which requires n=3+2=5.\n\nSo the idea is to find the largest possible component (say, m) such that C(m, 2) <= p, subtract that from p, and proceed recursively. However, this approach may not always yield the minimal n. For example, consider p=5. The largest triangular number less than or equal to 5 is 3 (C(3,2)=3). Subtracting 3 gives 2. Then, the next largest is 1 (C(2,2)=1), subtracting leaves 1. Then again 1. So total components are 3, 2, 2. Sum of sizes is 3+2+2=7. However, another decomposition could be 3 (C(3,2)=3) plus 2 (C(2,2)=1) plus 1 (C(1,2)=0) plus 1 (C(1,2)=0) gives 3+1=4, but that's not enough. Wait, maybe another way. Wait, 5 can be written as C(3,2) + C(2,2) + C(1,2) =3+1+0=4. Not enough. Hmm. Wait, what's the minimal n for p=5?\n\nAlternative decomposition: 4 (C(4,2)=6) is too big. So maybe 3 (C(3,2)=3) and then 2 (C(2,2)=1) and 1 (C(1,2)=0) and 1 (C(1,2)=0) gives sum 3+1=4. Not enough. Wait, perhaps another decomposition. What about two components of size 3 and 2? Then sum is 3+1=4. Still not enough. What about a component of size 4 and a component of size 1. Then sum is 6 +0=6>5. So that's not helpful. So perhaps the minimal n is 5. How?\n\nWait, let's think again. What if we have two components: 3 and 2. Sum is 3+1=4. Need 5 more. How? Maybe split the 3 into 2 and 1. Then sum becomes C(2,2) + C(1,2) + C(2,2) =1+0+1=2. No. That's worse. Alternatively, have components of 3 and 3. Sum is 3+3=6>5. No. So perhaps the minimal n is 5. How?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a decomposition of 5 into components where the sum of C(k_i, 2) is 5. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we have components of size 3 and 2: sum is 3+1=4. Not enough. What about components of size 4 and 1: sum is 6+0=6. Too big. What about components of size 3 and 1 and 1: sum is 3+0+0=3. No. What about components of size 2, 2, 2: sum is 1+1+1=3. No. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. What if there's a component of size 5? C(5,2) is 10, which is more than 5. So that's not helpful. What about a component of size 4 and a component of size 2. Then sum is 6 +1=7>5. Still no. So perhaps p=5 cannot be achieved with n=5. Then, maybe n=6?\n\nLet me think. For n=6, what's the maximum sum? C(6,2)=15. So we can have various decompositions. For example, 3+2+1 (sum 3+1+0=4). Not enough. What about 4 and 2. Sum is 6+1=7. Still not 5. What about 3 and 3. Sum is 3+3=6. Close. Hmm. What if we have 3 and 2 and 1. Sum is 3+1+0=4. Still not. Wait, maybe 3 and 2 and 1 and 1. Sum is same. So how can we get 5?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Are there any possible decompositions for p=5? Let me think: 5 can be written as 3 + 1 + 1. But that would be C(3,2) + C(1,2) + C(1,2) = 3 + 0 +0 =3. No. Or 2+2+1: sum is 1+1+0=2. Not enough. What about 4 +1: 6+0=6. No. 5+0: but components must be at least size 1. So maybe p=5 cannot be achieved with any n? That can't be right. Wait, but according to the problem statement, p can be zero. So for p=5, perhaps the minimal n is 5? Or is there a way?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking. How about splitting into components of size 3 and 2 and 1. Wait, sum of their C(k_i, 2) is 3 +1 +0=4. Not enough. What about components of size 3 and 2 and 1 and 1. Still same. What about components of size 4 and 1 and 1. Sum is 6 +0 +0 =6. No. \n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps the minimal n is 6. Let's see. Suppose we have components of size 3 and 3. Sum is 3+3=6. That's more than 5. So how can we get exactly 5? Maybe by splitting one of the components. For example, take a component of size 3 (C(3,2)=3), and split into two components of size 2 and 1. Then, the sum would be 1 (from the 2) + 0 (from 1) + 3 (from the other 3) = 4. Still not 5. Alternatively, take a component of size 4 (C(4,2)=6), and split into a component of size 3 and 1. Then the sum would be 3 (from 3) + 0 (from 1) = 3. Still not enough. \n\nWait, maybe there is no decomposition for p=5? That can't be. Oh, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of another approach. The sum of C(k_i, 2) is equal to the number of mutual pairs. For example, if we have two components, one of size a and one of size b. Then sum is C(a,2) + C(b, 2). So, for example, if a=4 and b=2, sum is 6+1=7. If a=3 and b=3, sum is 3+3=6. If a=3 and b=2, sum is 3+1=4. If a=5, sum is 10. \n\nWait, maybe there is no way to get p=5. Then, perhaps the minimal n is 6. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a way to have three components. Let's say components of 3, 2, and 1. Sum is 3 + 1 + 0 = 4. Not enough. What about components of 3, 1, and 2. Same. What about components of 2, 2, and 2. Sum is 1+1+1=3. No. Components of 4, 1, 1. Sum is 6. No. Components of 4 and 2. Sum is 6+1=7. No. Components of 5 and 1. Sum is 10. No. Components of 3 and 3. Sum is 6. No. How about components of 4 and 1 and 1. Sum is 6. Still no. \n\nWait, maybe p=5 is not possible? Then, how? But according to the problem statement, p can be zero. So for p=5, perhaps the minimal n is 6? Because with n=6, the maximum possible sum is 15. So perhaps there's a way to split into components such that sum of C(k_i, 2) =5. For example, components of 3, 2, and 1. Sum is 3+1+0=4. Not enough. What about components of 3 and 2 and 1 and 1. Same. Hmm. \n\nWait, what if we have a component of size 5 and another of size 1. Sum is C(5,2) + C(1,2) = 10 + 0 = 10. No. What about a component of size 4 and another of size 2. Sum is 6+1=7. Still no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a decomposition with more than two components. For example, 3, 1, 1, 1. Sum is 3. Not enough. 2, 2, 2. Sum is 3. 2, 2, 1, 1. Sum is 2. \n\nWait, I'm stuck. Maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again. How can p=5 be achieved?\n\nAh! Wait, what if there are three components: sizes 3, 2, and 1. Then sum is 3 + 1 + 0 = 4. If I split one of the components further. For example, split the 3 into 2 and 1. Then the components are 2, 2, 1, 1. Sum is 1 +1 +0 +0= 2. Worse. \n\nAlternatively, split the 2 into 1 and 1. Components are 3, 1, 1, 1. Sum is 3. \n\nNo. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a decomposition where there are multiple components. For example, a component of size 4 and a component of size 1. Sum is 6. If I split the 4 into 3 and 1. Then the sum is 3 + 0 + 0 = 3. \n\nNo. \n\nHmm. Maybe there is no way to achieve p=5. But that can't be. Because for example, if we have a component of size 5, then the sum is C(5,2) =10. If we have a component of size 5 and another of size 1, sum is 10. But how to get exactly 5? \n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that for p=5, the minimal n is 6. Because we can have two components: one of size 3 (C(3,2)=3) and another of size 3 (C(3,2)=3). Sum is 3+3=6. Which is larger than 5. Then, perhaps we need to adjust. \n\nWait, but how? Unless there's a way to have components that are not fully connected. Wait, no. Because the sum of C(k_i, 2) is the number of mutual pairs. Each component contributes exactly C(k_i, 2) pairs. So if you have two components of size 3, that's 3+3=6. If you have one component of size 3 and one of size 2, sum is 3+1=4. If you have one component of size 4 and one of size 2, sum is 6+1=7. \n\nSo for p=5, there is no possible decomposition. But that can't be. So perhaps the problem allows for p to be any integer, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says that the graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. \n\nAh! So the sum of C(k_i, 2) for each component must be exactly p. So for p=5, there must be a way to split into components. But according to my previous analysis, it seems impossible. \n\nWait, but maybe I missed some decomposition. Let me think again. Let me think of the components as being of sizes a, b, c, etc. For example, if we have three components of sizes 2, 2, and 2. Sum is 1 +1 +1 =3. If we have two components of sizes 2 and 3. Sum is 1+3=4. If we have one component of 4 and one of 2, sum is 6+1=7. What about components of sizes 3, 2, and 1. Sum is 3+1+0=4. \n\nWait, what if we have components of sizes 5 and 1? Sum is 10. No. \n\nWait, maybe I should think of the problem as trying to find the minimal n such that the sum of C(k_i, 2) = p. For p=5, perhaps the minimal n is 6. How? Let's think of the following decomposition: one component of size 4 (C(4,2)=6), and then subtract 1. But how? Because the components can't be split into smaller parts. Unless we split the component into smaller components. For example, take a component of size 4 (C(4,2)=6) and split it into a component of size 3 and 1. Then, the sum becomes C(3,2) + C(1,2) =3 +0=3. But that's less than 6. \n\nAlternatively, take the component of size 4 and split into two components of size 2 and 2. Sum is 1+1=2. Less than 6. \n\nSo, no. So perhaps for p=5, there is no solution. But that's impossible. Because the problem says that for p=0, the answer is 0 nodes. But for p=0, the minimal n is 0? Or is it 1? Because for n=1, there are no pairs (u, v) with u <v. So p=0 can be achieved with n=1. \n\nBut for p=5, perhaps it's not possible. But that can't be. So I must have made a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again. \n\nWait, what if there are components of size 5 and 1, but then we have some edges between them that make some pairs not reachable? No, because the components are defined as strongly connected components. So the mutual reachability pairs are only within each component. So the way the components are structured doesn't affect the sum of C(k_i, 2). So regardless of how the components are connected, the sum is the same. \n\nSo the sum is fixed once the sizes of the components are chosen. Therefore, the problem is to find the minimal n where there exists a decomposition of n into integers k_1, k_2,... such that sum C(k_i, 2) = p. \n\nIf there is no such decomposition for certain p, then what? But according to the problem statement, the input p is given, and the output must exist. For example, the sample input includes p=0. \n\nSo for p=5, perhaps there is a way. Let me think again. What if there are three components: sizes 3, 2, and 1. Sum is 3+1+0=4. If I split the 3 into 2 and 1, making components of 2, 2, 1, 1. Sum is 1+1+0+0=2. No. \n\nWhat if there are five components of size 2. Sum is 5*1=5. Ah! Yes! Because each component of size 2 contributes 1, and five components would contribute 5. So n would be 5 * 2 = 10. But is there a smaller n? For example, 3 components of size 2 and one component of size 2. Wait, no. Five components of size 2 sum to 5. So n is 10. But is there a smaller n? For example, a component of size 3 (C(3,2)=3) and two components of size 2 (each contributing 1). Total sum is 3 + 1 +1 =5. So n is 3+2+2=7. Which is better. \n\nYes! So for p=5, the decomposition is 3,2,2. Sum of C(k_i, 2) is 3 + 1 +1 =5. So n is 3+2+2=7. So the minimal n for p=5 is 7. \n\nAh, okay, I see. I was missing that possibility. So the idea is to find a way to split into multiple components. \n\nSo the way to find the minimal n is to find a decomposition of p into a sum of C(k_i, 2) for various k_i, such that the sum of k_i is minimized. \n\nSo how can we find this decomposition?\n\nThis seems like a variation of the classic integer partition problem, but with the twist that each part is of the form C(k_i, 2). \n\nBut for large p (up to 2e5), we need an efficient way to compute this.\n\nAn approach is to find the minimal number of nodes by greedily taking the largest possible C(k, 2) that is less than or equal to the remaining p, and then proceed recursively. However, this might not always yield the minimal n. For example, in the case of p=5, taking the largest C(k, 2) less than or equal to 5 is 3 (k=3), then remaining is 2. The largest for 2 is 1 (k=2). Remaining is 1. Again, take 1 (k=2). Total sum of k is 3+2+2=7. Which is the correct minimal. \n\nAnother example: p=4. Largest is 3 (k=3), remaining 1. Take 1 (k=2). Total sum is 3+2=5. Which is correct. \n\nBut what about cases where taking a slightly smaller component allows for a better overall sum? For example, let's say p=6. The largest is 6 (k=4), which uses n=4. Which is better than other decompositions. \n\nAnother example: p=7. Largest is 6 (k=4), remaining 1. Take 1 (k=2). Total n=4+2=6. Alternatively, take 3 (k=3) and 3 (k=3): sum is 3+3=6. No. Wait, no. 3+3 is 6, but p is 7. So need another 1. Take 3+3+1 (k=2). Sum is 3+3+1=7. Total n is 3+3+2=8. Which is worse than the previous option of 6. \n\nSo the greedy approach seems to work. \n\nThus, the algorithm for finding the minimal n is:\n\nInitialize remaining_p = p.\n\nInitialize list of components as empty.\n\nWhile remaining_p > 0:\n\n   Find the largest k such that C(k, 2) ≤ remaining_p.\n\n   Add k to the list of components.\n\n   Subtract C(k, 2) from remaining_p.\n\nOnce this is done, the sum of the components is the minimal n.\n\nBut wait, this is not necessarily correct. For example, let's take p=5. Greedy approach takes 3 (C(3,2)=3), then 2 (C(2,2)=1), then 2 (C(2,2)=1). Sum is 3+2+2=7. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: p=7. Greedy approach takes 4 (C(4,2)=6), then 2 (C(2,2)=1). Total sum is 4+2=6. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: p=8. Greedy approach takes 4 (C(4,2)=6), then 2 (C(2,2)=1), then 2 (C(2,2)=1). Total sum is 4+2+2=8. But alternatively, 3 (C(3,2)=3) + 3 (C(3,2)=3) + 2 (C(2,2)=1) + 2 (C(2,2)=1) = 3+3+1+1=8. Sum of components is 3+3+2+2=10. So the greedy approach gives a better n. \n\nSo the greedy approach of taking the largest possible component each time seems to work. \n\nSo the algorithm for finding the minimal n is to greedily take the largest possible component for each step. \n\nOnce we have the decomposition into components, the next step is to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs. As discussed earlier, this is equivalent to finding the decomposition that minimizes the sum of squares of the component sizes. \n\nBut how to ensure that among all possible decompositions that give the same p and minimal n, we choose the one that minimizes the sum of squares. \n\nFor example, suppose there are multiple ways to decompose p into components with the same minimal n. For instance, for p=5, the decomposition could be 3+2+2 (sum 7) or 2+2+2+2+1 (sum 2*5=10?), but no, the latter would have sum of C(2,2) *4 + C(1,2) = 4*1 +0 =4 ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs among all such graphs with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` and both nodes are mutually reachable. This can be achieved by forming strongly connected components (SCCs) where each component contributes `C(k_i, 2)` pairs, with `k_i` being the size of the component.\n\n2. **Finding Minimum Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we use a greedy approach to decompose `p` into sums of combinations `C(k_i, 2)`. This involves repeatedly selecting the largest possible component that fits into the remaining value of `p`.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum number of nodes is determined, the next step is to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs. This is done by minimizing the sum of squares of component sizes, which allows for more pairs between different components.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    \n    # Find minimal n\n    components = []\n    remaining = p\n    while remaining > 0:\n        # Find the largest k where C(k, 2) <= remaining\n        # C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)//2\n        # Solve k^2 -k - 2*remaining <=0\n        # k = floor((1 + sqrt(1 + 8*remaining))/2)\n        k = int((1 + (8 * remaining)**0.5) / 2)\n        while k*(k-1)//2 > remaining:\n            k -= 1\n        components.append(k)\n        remaining -= k*(k-1)//2\n    \n    n = sum(components)\n    \n    # Now, find the decomposition with minimal sum of squares\n    # We need to adjust the components to have as many equal sizes as possible\n    # Because sum of squares is minimized when the components are as equal as possible\n    # So, for the current components, we need to check if there's a way to split them into more components with smaller sizes but same sum of C(k_i, 2)\n    # However, since the greedy approach gives the minimal n, we need to find the best decomposition for sum of squares\n    \n    # Let's collect all the components and try to make them as equal as possible\n    # For example, if components are [3, 2, 2], sum of squares is 9 +4 +4 =17\n    # If we can replace some components to have more balanced sizes, it might reduce the sum of squares.\n    \n    # But given that the initial decomposition is the one that gives the minimal n, perhaps the optimal way is to have as many components as possible of size 2 or 3.\n    # However, the exact method to find the minimal sum of squares for the given decomposition is not straightforward.\n    # Instead, we can consider that the minimal sum of squares is achieved when the components are as equal as possible.\n    \n    # For the given components, we can process them to make them as equal as possible.\n    # But how?
