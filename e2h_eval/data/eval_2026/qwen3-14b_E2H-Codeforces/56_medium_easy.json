Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. So, each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and all the lines between them don't cross each other.\n\nHmm. First, since R and B are up to 10, maybe we can try all possible perfect matchings and check for each if any of them have non-crossing lines. But how do I check if two line segments cross?\n\nWait, the problem says that any two paths (from a base to its assigned spaceship) must not intersect. So for a given matching, all the line segments between the matched pairs must be non-intersecting. So, for each possible permutation (if R=B), we need to check if all the line segments between the matched pairs are non-crossing.\n\nBut how to generate all possible perfect matchings? Well, since R and B are small (up to 10), but for R=B=10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3.6 million, which is manageable for small N. Wait, but for R=10 and B=10, the number of possible perfect matchings is 10! which is around 3.6 million. For each of those, checking all pairs of line segments for intersection. But for each permutation, the number of pairs is O(N^2), so for N=10, that's 100 per permutation. So total operations would be about 3.6e6 * 100 = 3.6e8 operations. That's a lot. Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges represent non-crossing possibilities. Then, we need to check if there's a perfect matching in this graph. But how to build that graph?\n\nBut for small N, trying all possible matchings might be feasible. Let me think: for each possible permutation (since each spaceship must be matched to exactly one base, and vice versa), we can generate all possible assignments, then check if any of them have no crossing lines.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Generate all possible perfect matchings between the R spaceships and B bases (assuming R=B, else output No immediately).\n- For each matching, check if any pair of line segments cross.\n- If any matching passes, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut first, we need to make sure that R equals B. Because the problem says that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. So if R != B, then it's impossible. So first check if R != B, output No.\n\nSo the first step is to check if R and B are equal. If not, output No.\n\nThen, for the case when R = B, generate all possible permutations of the bases (or spaceships) and check for each permutation if the lines between the i-th spaceship and the i-th base in the permutation do not cross.\n\nWait, but how to generate all possible perfect matchings? Well, for example, if we have R spaceships and B bases (R=B), then each perfect matching is a bijection between the two sets. So for the spaceships, say, list S, and bases list B, each permutation of B corresponds to a possible assignment. So for each permutation of the bases, we can check if the lines between S[i] and perm[i] for all i have no crossings.\n\nBut generating all permutations of B (which is R! possibilities) is feasible when R is up to 10. Let's see:\n\nFor R=10, 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking all pairs of line segments for intersection. For each pair of segments (i,j), check if they cross.\n\nBut how many pairs? For N segments, there are N*(N-1)/2 pairs. For N=10, that's 45 pairs. For each pair, check if they intersect.\n\nSo for each permutation, 45 checks. So for 3.6 million permutations, that's 3.6e6 * 45 = 162 million checks. Each check is a computational geometry problem.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nI remember that there's a standard method for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect. The steps are:\n\n1. Check if the bounding boxes of the two segments overlap. If not, they can't intersect. This is a quick check to avoid unnecessary computation.\n\n2. Check if the orientation of the points (using cross product) determines if the segments intersect. The standard approach is to use the orientation function, and check for the general case and special cases (like colinear overlapping).\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, so we don't have to worry about colinear segments overlapping. Because if two segments are colinear, then their endpoints are colinear, but according to the problem statement, no three points are on the same line. So, any two line segments can't be colinear. Therefore, for two segments AB and CD, if they intersect, they must do so at a single point, which is not an endpoint of either segment (since the endpoints are unique, no two points are same). Wait, but what if AB and CD share an endpoint? Like, if A is connected to C, then the segments would be AC and CD. Wait, but in our problem, each line is between a spaceship and a base. So each line is between a unique pair. So, for two different pairs (say, spaceship i to base j and spaceship k to base l), their segments can't share an endpoint because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship. So, for any two segments in the matching, they can't share endpoints. Thus, any two segments in the matching are distinct and don't share endpoints.\n\nSo, given that, when checking if two segments AB and CD intersect, we can use the standard line segment intersection algorithm, which returns true if they cross each other (not just touching at endpoints).\n\nBut since the problem says that no three points are colinear, we don't have to handle the case where the segments are colinear. So the algorithm can be simplified.\n\nThe standard way to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\n- Check if the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different. If that's the case, then they intersect.\n\nAlternatively, using the cross product approach.\n\nSo, here's the plan for the code:\n\nFirst, read the input. Then, check if R != B. If so, output No.\n\nElse, generate all permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships, assuming that the spaceships are ordered as per their input order). For each permutation, check all pairs of line segments between the i-th spaceship and the i-th base in the permutation. If any pair of segments intersect, reject this permutation. Else, accept and return Yes.\n\nSo, the key part is to generate all permutations of the bases, and for each, check for intersections between all pairs of line segments.\n\nNow, how to implement the line segment intersection check.\n\nLet me think about writing a helper function called segments_intersect(p1, q1, p2, q2) which returns True if the line segments p1q1 and p2q2 intersect.\n\nBut given that no three points are colinear, we can use the orientation-based approach.\n\nThe orientation of three points (p, q, r) can be determined by the cross product of vectors pq and pr. The orientation is:\n\n- 0 if colinear\n- 1 if clockwise\n- 2 if counterclockwise\n\nBut since the problem says that no three points are colinear, we can ignore the 0 case.\n\nThe function orientation(p, q, r) can be computed as follows:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # 1 for clockwise, 2 for counterclockwise\n\nThen, two segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\norientation(A,B,C) != orientation(A,B,D) and orientation(C,D,A) != orientation(C,D,B)\n\nBut wait, this is the case for general position. So, the helper function would be:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case: segments intersect\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: check if endpoints lie on the other segment\n    # But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. So, if any of the orientations is zero, it's not possible. So, the only way that two segments can intersect is if the general case holds.\n\n    # Wait, but in our problem, since the endpoints are all unique and no three points are colinear, the only way two segments can intersect is if the general case holds. Because if one of the endpoints is on the other segment, that would imply that three points are colinear. For example, if point C is on AB. Then, the orientation of A,B,C is zero. But the problem states that no three points are colinear. Therefore, this situation is impossible.\n\n    # Therefore, the helper function can just return whether the general case is true.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, for any two segments, their endpoints are not colinear. Therefore, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other in the middle, not at endpoints. Therefore, the helper function can safely check the general case.\n\nSo, the helper function is as above.\n\nNow, for each permutation of the bases, we have to check all pairs of segments. For example, for the permutation [base_0, base_1, ..., base_n-1], we have for each i, the spaceship i is connected to base_perm[i]. So, for each pair of indices (i,j), check if the segment between spaceship i and base_perm[i] intersects with the segment between spaceship j and base_perm[j]. If any such pair exists, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output 'No'.\n\nElse, read R spaceships, then B bases.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the B bases. For each permutation:\n\n   create a list of segments (spaceship i to base_perm[i], for i from 0 to R-1)\n\n   for all pairs (i,j) where i < j:\n\n      check if the segment between spaceship i and base_perm[i] intersects with the segment between spaceship j and base_perm[j]\n\n      if any intersection is found, break and try next permutation\n\n   if no intersections found, return 'Yes'\n\nIf none of the permutations work, return 'No'\n\nNow, the problem is generating permutations of the bases. However, the bases are given as a list, and each permutation is a rearrangement of that list.\n\nBut for example, for R=3, B=3, the bases are read as a list of 3 points. Then, each permutation of that list is considered as a possible assignment.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Using itertools.permutations.\n\nBut note that the bases are given as a list. So, for example, if the bases are stored in a list called bases, then itertools.permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut in Python, permutations returns tuples, so for each permutation in permutations(bases), we can process it.\n\nBut the problem is that for R=10, generating all permutations may take some time, but given that R is up to 10, and the code is in Python, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nNow, considering the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, spaceships are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nIn the first example, the sample output is 'Yes'. One possible matching is connecting in order: spaceship 0 to base 0, spaceship 1 to base 1, spaceship 2 to base 2.\n\nCheck if any of the segments cross.\n\nSegments:\n\n(0,0) to (-2,1)\n\n(2,0) to (0,3)\n\n(3,1) to (2,2)\n\nDo these cross?\n\nCheck each pair.\n\nFirst pair: (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3). Do they cross?\n\nCompute orientations.\n\nLet me compute for the first pair.\n\na = (0,0), b = (-2,1), c = (2,0), d = (0,3)\n\nCheck if segments ab and cd intersect.\n\no1 = orientation(a, b, c) ?\n\nCompute (b.x - a.x)*(c.y - a.y) - (b.y - a.y)*(c.x - a.x)\n\nb.x -a.x is -2 - 0 = -2. c.y -a.y is 0 - 0 = 0. So first term is -2*0 = 0.\n\nb.y -a.y is 1-0=1. c.x -a.x is 2-0=2. So second term is 1*2=2.\n\nval = 0 - 2 = -2. Which is negative. So orientation is 2 (counterclockwise).\n\nThen o2 is orientation(a,b,d) where d is (0,3).\n\nSame calculation:\n\nb.x -a.x is -2, c.y -a.y is 3-0=3. So first term is -2*3 = -6.\n\nb.y -a.y is 1. d.x -a.x is 0-0=0. Second term is 1*0=0. So val is -6 - 0 = -6. Negative, orientation 2.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are same (both 2). So the condition o1 != o2 is false. So the segments don't cross here.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the orientation function is (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x).\n\nFor orientation(a, b, c):\n\na is (0,0), b is (-2,1), c is (2,0).\n\n(q.x - p.x) is -2 - 0 = -2.\n\n(r.y - p.y) is 0 - 0 = 0.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n(r.x - p.x) is 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nSo the value is (-2)*0 - 1*2 = 0 - 2 = -2. Which is negative. So orientation is 2 (since val < 0).\n\nSimilarly for orientation(a, b, d), where d is (0,3):\n\nr is (0,3). So (r.x - p.x) is 0 - 0 = 0, (r.y - p.y) is 3 - 0 = 3.\n\nSo the value is (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6 - 0 = -6. Also negative. So o1 and o2 are same. So the first condition (o1 != o2) is false, so the segments don't cross.\n\nNow check the other pair of segments. For example, between (2,0)-(0,3) and (3,1)-(2,2).\n\nLet me check if those cross.\n\na is (2,0), b is (0,3), c is (3,1), d is (2,2).\n\nCheck orientation(a, b, c) and orientation(a, b, d).\n\nCompute orientation(a, b, c):\n\nq is (0,3), p is (2,0), r is (3,1).\n\n(q.x - p.x) = 0 - 2 = -2. (r.y - p.y) = 1 - 0 = 1. So first term is -2 * 1 = -2.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 3-0=3. (r.x - p.x) = 3-2=1. So second term is 3 * 1 = 3.\n\nVal = -2 - 3 = -5 < 0 → orientation 2.\n\norientation(a,b,d) where d is (2,2):\n\nr is (2,2). (r.x - p.x) is 0, (r.y - p.y) is 2.\n\nso first term is (-2)*2 = -4.\n\nsecond term: (3) * (0) = 0. Val is -4 - 0 = -4 < 0 → orientation 2 again. So again, same orientation. So no intersection.\n\nThen check the third pair: (0,0)-(-2,1) and (3,1)-(2,2). Do they cross?\n\na=(0,0), b=(-2,1), c=(3,1), d=(2,2).\n\nCheck orientation(a,b,c) and orientation(a,b,d).\n\norientation(a,b,c): (q.x - p.x) = -2, (r.y - p.y) = 1-0=1. So first term is -2 * 1 = -2.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1, (r.x - p.x) = 3-0=3 → second term is 1 * 3 = 3. Val is -2 - 3 = -5 <0 → orientation 2.\n\norientation(a,b,d): (r is (2,2)).\n\n(q.x - p.x) is -2, (r.y - p.y) is 2-0=2. First term is -2 * 2 = -4.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 1, (r.x - p.x) is 2-0=2. Second term is 1*2=2. Val is -4 - 2 = -6 <0. Same orientation. So again, no intersection.\n\nSo this permutation is valid. Hence, output Yes.\n\nSo the code should find this permutation and return yes.\n\nNow, for the second sample input:\n\nInput is ['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, the input is split into two parts? Or perhaps the input is given as two separate test cases. But the user provided an example where the first input is a string that represents the first case, and the second is another case. But for the code, perhaps the code is supposed to read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the first line. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as first line with R and B, then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases. The sample input shows two examples, but perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows that the first example is a list of strings, but perhaps in the actual problem, the code is to read from stdin, and the input is one test case. However, the user's example shows that the code may be given multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe user's example shows two inputs and outputs, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement says that the input is given as per the first line. But the code is supposed to read from stdin and output to stdout. So, perhaps the code needs to handle multiple test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as per the first line. The sample input shows two examples, but perhaps that's for two separate test cases. However, the code needs to read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases. But the problem says nothing about multiple test cases. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers R and B. Then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nSo, the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows two examples. But perhaps the user's code is to be written as a function that processes one input, but in the example, they show two test cases. However, the code for submission is supposed to read from stdin and output to stdout. So, perhaps the code should process one test case. But the user's example shows that in the first input, the output is 'Yes', and in the second input, the output is 'No'.\n\nBut in the code submission, the code should read from stdin, which may have one or more test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\nThe problem statement's sample input shows two test cases, but the actual problem may have multiple test cases. However, the problem description does not mention that. So perhaps the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, the input is given as per the first line. Therefore, the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings, perhaps for two test cases. However, perhaps in the actual problem, the code is supposed to process one test case, and the sample input shows two test cases. But the user's code should read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem, would have one test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read one test case. However, the user's sample input shows that the code may have multiple test cases. But perhaps the user's code is written for multiple test cases. But the problem statement doesn't mention that. Therefore, perhaps the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows two test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of two elements, each being a string representing the input for a test case. The sample output is a list of two elements. So, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the input format is not described as multiple test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input format. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B...\n\nSo the input is for one test case. Therefore, the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, perhaps for the purpose of illustration. But the code is supposed to handle one test case.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from stdin and output to stdout. Therefore, the code should process one test case. However, the user's example shows two test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake, and the code should process one test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read R and B, then read R lines for the spaceships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nNow, moving forward with the code.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nImport itertools.permutations.\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No'.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R spaceships as a list of tuples.\n\nRead B bases as a list of tuples.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   check for all pairs of segments (i,j) whether they intersect.\n\n   if any pair intersects, skip this permutation.\n\n   else, return 'Yes'.\n\nIf after checking all permutations, none are valid, return 'No'.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to read the input?\n\nBut the input is given as per standard input. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is read as R=3, B=3, then 3 lines for spaceships, then 3 lines for bases.\n\nBut in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps read via input() or sys.stdin.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example's input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code is supposed to read from stdin.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 0 if colinear, 1 if clockwise, 2 if counterclockwise\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    # General case\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    R = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    B = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        spaceships.append( (x, y) )\n        ptr += 2\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        ptr += 2\n    # Now generate all permutations of bases\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # For each permutation, check all pairs of segments\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # Check if segment between spaceship i and perm[i] intersects with segment between spaceship j and perm[j]\n                a = spaceships[i]\n                b = perm[i]\n                c = spaceships[j]\n                d = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, the permutations are generated for the bases. However, for each permutation, perm is a tuple of the bases. For example, if the bases are stored as a list, then permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut what about the order of the spaceships? For example, the code assumes that the i-th spaceship is connected to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\nYes. Because the code loops over i in 0..R-1, and for each, connects spaceship[i] to perm[i].\n\nBut what if the permutation is of the bases, and the code is trying all possible assignments between the spaceships and the bases. So, for example, for each permutation, the code is assigning the first spaceship to the first base in the permutation, the second to the second, etc.\n\nThis is correct, because each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships (each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship).\n\nBut the code may have a problem if there are duplicate bases. However, the problem statement says that no two points coincide. So, the bases are all distinct, and the permutations are all unique.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the code would generate all permutations of the bases. One of them is the original order. As discussed earlier, that permutation is valid, so the code returns 'Yes'.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nBut wait, R is 2 and B is 1. So R != B, so output is 'No' immediately. But according to the user's example, the second input is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1', '...'] ?\n\nWait, the user's example shows the second input as:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1', ...], which would be R=2, B=1. So output is 'No' because R != B. Which matches the sample output of 'No'.\n\nSo the code handles that case.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2, with ships and bases arranged in a way that no matching is possible.\n\nBut the code would generate all permutations (two permutations) and check them.\n\nNow, what about the case where two segments cross?\n\nFor example, ships at (0,0) and (2,2), bases at (0,2) and (2,0). The two possible permutations are:\n\nPerm1: bases [ (0,2), (2,0) ] → segments (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These are vertical lines, no crossing.\n\nPerm2: bases [ (2,0), (0,2) ] → segments (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These are horizontal lines, no crossing. So output is Yes.\n\nBut if the ships are (0,0), (2,2) and bases (2,0), (0,2). Then the permutation that connects ship 0 to base (2,0), and ship 1 to base (0,2) gives segments (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These are two lines that cross. So the code would check this permutation and find that the segments cross, thus rejecting it. But the other permutation (connecting ship 0 to (0,2) and ship 1 to (2,0)) gives two lines (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0), which are vertical and don't cross. So the code would output 'Yes'.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the permutation has segments that cross? The code would detect it.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations of the bases. But what if the problem requires considering all possible matchings, including different assignments of ships to bases? For example, if the code is considering the ships as fixed in their order, but the bases are permuted. But since the problem allows any assignment, the code is correct. Because each permutation represents a unique assignment of bases to ships.\n\nBut in the code, the ships are in their original order. For example, the first ship is always matched to the first element in the permutation, etc. However, since permutations of the bases cover all possible assignments, this is correct.\n\nFor example, suppose there are two ships and two bases. The code would check all possible assignments. For example, if the bases are [b1, b2], then the permutations are [b1, b2] and [b2, b1]. The first corresponds to ship 0 → b1, ship 1 → b2. The second corresponds to ship 0 → b2, ship 1 → b1. So all possible matchings are considered.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, for the code, the only thing left is to handle the input correctly.\n\nBut when reading the input, the code uses sys.stdin.read().split(), which splits all the input into tokens. So, for example, the first line is R and B, then the next R lines are the ships' coordinates, then B lines for the bases.\n\nBut in the code, the input is read as a list of strings, split by whitespace. Then, the code processes the tokens sequentially.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTesting the code with the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe input as a list would be:\n\n['3', '3', '0', '0', '2', '0', '3', '1', '-2', '1', '0', '3', '2', '2']\n\nSo, R=3, B=3.\n\nThen, the spaceships are read as:\n\ni=0: 0,0\n\ni=1: 2,0\n\ni=2: 3,1\n\nThen the bases are read as:\n\n-2,1; 0,3; 2,2.\n\nSo, the code proceeds.\n\nNow, the code generates all permutations of the bases. One of them is the original order, which is valid.\n\nThus, the code returns 'Yes'.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Ships at (0,0), (2,2). Bases at (0,2), (2,0). Then, the two permutations are:\n\nperm1: [(0,2), (2,0)] → segments (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). No intersection.\n\nperm2: [(2,0), (0,2)] → segments (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These two lines cross. So the code would check for this permutation. The segments are (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute.\n\na=(0,0), b=(2,0). c=(2,2), d=(0,2).\n\nCheck segments ab and cd.\n\norientation(a,b,c) = (2-0)*(2-0) - (0-0)*(2-0) → (2)*(2) - 0*2 = 4 → positive. So orientation is 1.\n\norientation(a,b,d) = (2-0)*(2-0) - (0-0)*(0-0) → same as before? Wait, no. Let me recompute.\n\nWait, the orientation function is (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x).\n\nFor a=(0,0), b=(2,0), c=(2,2):\n\n(q.x - p.x) is 2-0=2. (r.y - p.y) is 2-0=2. So first term is 2*2=4.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 0-0=0. (r.x - p.x) is 2-0=2. Second term is 0*2=0. So val is 4-0=4>0 → orientation 1.\n\nFor d=(0,2):\n\nr is (0,2). So (r.x - p.x) is 0-0=0. (r.y - p.y) is 2-0=2. First term is 2 * 2 =4.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 0. (r.x - p.x) is 0. Second term is 0 * 0 = 0. Val is 4-0=4>0. So orientation is 1. So o1 and o2 are same. So segments don't cross.\n\nWait, but the two segments are horizontal and vertical lines. They cross at (1,1). But according to the code, they are not detected as intersecting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, this seems like a problem. Because the two segments (from (0,0) to (2,0)) and (from (2,2) to (0,2)) cross each other. But according to the code's segments_intersect function, they are not detected as intersecting. But why?\n\nLet me re-calculate the orientations for the two segments.\n\nSegment ab is from (0,0) to (2,0). Segment cd is from (2,2) to (0,2).\n\nCheck for segment ab and cd.\n\nCompute o1 = orientation(a, b, c) → a=(0,0), b=(2,0), c=(2,2).\n\nAs before, this is 4, so orientation is 1.\n\no2 = orientation(a, b, d) → d=(0,2). So:\n\n(q.x - p.x) is 2, (r.y - p.y) is 2. First term 2*2=4.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 0. (r.x - p.x) is 0. Second term is 0 * 0 = 0. So val is 4-0=4>0 → orientation 1.\n\nThus o1 and o2 are same. So the first condition (o1 != o2) is false.\n\nThen compute o3 and o4.\n\no3 = orientation(c, d, a) → c=(2,2), d=(0,2), a=(0,0).\n\n(q.x - p.x) is 0-2 = -2. (r.y - p.y) is 0-2 = -2. First term is (-2) * (-2) =4.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 2-2=0. (r.x - p.x) is 0-2=-",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting paths intersect. The solution involves checking all possible permutations of assignments between spaceships and bases and verifying if any permutation results in non-intersecting paths.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B). If R is not equal to B, immediately output \"No\" as a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Permutations Generation**: Generate all permutations of the bases to consider every possible assignment of spaceships to bases.\n3. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, check if any pair of paths (segments between a spaceship and its assigned base) intersect using a geometric orientation check.\n4. **Orientation Calculation**: Use the cross product to determine the orientation of three points, which helps in checking if two line segments intersect.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    R = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    B = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    spaceships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        spaceships.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(input[ptr])\n        y = int(input[ptr+1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        ptr += 2\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                a = spaceships[i]\n                b = perm[i]\n                c = spaceships[j]\n                d = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Orientation Calculation**: The `orientation` function calculates the orientation of three points using the cross product. This helps determine if points are clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear.\n- **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the orientation values to check if two line segments intersect by ensuring the orientations of the endpoints of each segment relative to the other segment are different.\n- **Permutations and Validation**: The main function reads input, checks for immediate impossibility (if R ≠ B), generates all permutations of bases, and validates each permutation by checking for intersecting segments. If a valid permutation is found, it prints \"Yes\"; otherwise, it prints \"No\" after all permutations are checked.",
