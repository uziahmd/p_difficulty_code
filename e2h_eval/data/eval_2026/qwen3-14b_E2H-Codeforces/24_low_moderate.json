She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Luba has to close all tabs except those in [l, r]. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required. Let's think about the operations she can perform.\n\nSo, each second she can move left or right, or close tabs on the left or right. Closing tabs is a big operation. So the key is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closes.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The initial state is that all tabs are open. But after closing some, the a and b (the min and max of open tabs) change. But for the problem, we need to end up with only the tabs from l to r. So the final a is l and b is r.\n\nBut how do we get there? Let's think about what needs to be done. The tabs outside [l, r] must be closed. So, for example, if l is 2 and r is 4, then tabs 1 and 5,6 must be closed.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently. The idea is that closing tabs can be done once you are at the right position. For example, if you are at position x, you can close all tabs to the left (so [a, x-1], which would be all tabs left of x) or to the right (x+1 to b).\n\nBut to close all tabs outside [l, r], we need to close the left part (tabs < l) and the right part (tabs > r). So the steps would involve moving to positions where you can close these regions.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r], and the entire [l, r] is already open. Then maybe no steps are needed if l <= pos <= r and the initial tabs are already correct. But the problem says that the initial tabs are all open. So if l=1 and r=n, then nothing needs to be done. But in general, if the [l, r] is already the entire range, then yes, output 0.\n\nBut in other cases, we need to close tabs outside [l, r].\n\nSo first, determine whether the current position is inside the target range [l, r]. If not, then we need to move into it, perhaps.\n\nBut the problem is to find the minimal steps. Let's think about the steps required.\n\nThe main idea is that we need to close the left part (tabs before l) and the right part (tabs after r). To close them, we need to be at certain positions.\n\nFor example, to close all tabs to the left of l, we need to be at position l. Because when you are at l, you can close all tabs to the left (which are from a to l-1). Similarly, to close all tabs to the right of r, you need to be at position r, and then close the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to close both parts with fewer steps. But perhaps the optimal approach is to close the left part first, then the right, or vice versa.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Find the steps required to move to the position where you can close the left part (i.e., l), then close it. Then move to the position where you can close the right part (r) and close it.\n\nOr, maybe the other way around. Also, maybe there's a case where you can close both parts with one operation each, but depending on the initial position.\n\nBut also, there's the possibility that the current position is already in the target range. For example, if the target is [2,4], and pos is 3. Then, perhaps you can close the left (tabs before 2) by moving to 2 and closing left, then move to 4 and close right. Or maybe you can close the left and right in some way.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal steps?\n\nLet me think of the steps required for each scenario.\n\nFirst, check if the current pos is already within [l, r]. If not, then we need to move to the nearest point in the target range. Wait, but maybe moving to l or r is necessary, depending on which side you need to close.\n\nBut perhaps the steps can be broken down into:\n\n1. Moving to the position where you can close the left part (position l). Then, closing it. That takes (distance from current pos to l) steps. Then, moving to the position where you can close the right part (r), which takes (distance from l to r) steps. Then, closing it. So total steps: (distance to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2 (since closing takes 1 second each). But wait, closing is an operation that takes 1 second. So each close is one second. So for each close, you have",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the given range [l, r] while starting from a specific position `pos`. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Target Ranges**: Determine if the current position `pos` is within the target range [l, r]. If it is not, we need to move to the nearest boundary of this range.\n2. **Closing Tabs**: Once within the target range, we need to close all tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r`. This can be done efficiently by moving to the appropriate positions (either `l` or `r`) and performing the close operations.\n3. **Calculate Moves**: Compute the minimal steps required to move the cursor to the necessary positions to perform the close operations and sum these steps with the time taken for the close operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the current segment is already [l, r], no action needed\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Determine if we need to close left and/or right\n    need_close_left = l > 1\n    need_close_right = r < n\n\n    # Calculate steps based on position relative to [l, r]\n    if pos < l:\n        # Need to move to l first\n        steps = (l - pos)  # move to l\n        steps += 1  # close left\n        if need_close_right:\n            steps += (r - l)  # move from l to r\n            steps += 1  # close right\n    elif pos > r:\n        # Need to move to r first\n        steps = (pos - r)  # move to r\n        steps += 1  # close right\n        if need_close_left:\n            steps += (r - l)  # move from r to l\n            steps += 1  # close left\n    else:\n        # pos is inside [l, r]\n        steps = 0\n        if need_close_left:\n            steps += (pos - l)  # move to l\n            steps += 1  # close left\n        if need_close_right:\n            steps += (r - pos)  # move to r\n            steps += 1  # close right\n\n    # Edge case: when only one side needs closing\n    # For example, if l=1 and r=4, then closing right from pos=2 would be sufficient\n    # But in that case, the code above should handle it\n\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Check Initial Position**: If the initial position `pos` is within the target range [l, r], we start from there. Otherwise, we move to the nearest boundary of the target range.\n2. **Move and Close Operations**: Depending on whether we need to close tabs to the left or right, we calculate the steps required to move to the appropriate position and perform the close operation. Each move takes one second, and each close operation also takes one second.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Special handling is included for cases where the target range is the entire set of tabs (no operations needed) or when only one side needs closing.\n\nThis approach ensures that we minimize the number of moves and close operations required to achieve the desired state efficiently.",
