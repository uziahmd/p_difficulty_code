The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake is built in a certain way, and we need to check if such a graph can have exactly n vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the snowflake. Let me re-read the description.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, that initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so those leaves) are connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So, the process is like building layers. \n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's model the construction steps.\n\nLet me consider the example given for k=4. The smallest snowflake would be:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then connect to 4 nodes. Now, each of those 4 is a leaf. Then, each of them must be connected to k new nodes. So after that step, each of the original 4 has 4 new nodes. So total nodes would be 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 +4 +16 = 21? But the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait the sample input includes n=13 as a YES. Let me think about that. How can 13 be achieved?\n\nLet me think of the construction steps. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we have k=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial step: 1 node.\n\nFirst expansion: add k=3 nodes. Now total is 1+3=4. But then, the step of connecting each leaf (those 3 nodes) to k new nodes. So each of those 3 nodes adds 3 new nodes. So total nodes is 1 + 3 + 3*3 = 1+3+9=13. Which matches the sample input where n=13 is YES. So that's the case. So the process is that the initial node is connected to k nodes (first layer), then each of those k nodes is connected to k new nodes (second layer). So the total is 1 + k + k*k = 1 +k +k². For k=3, that's 13. So that's why n=13 is possible.\n\nBut what about other possibilities? Because the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. So, the minimal steps are: first, the initial node plus k nodes (so two layers?), but then you have to do at least one more step. Wait, no. Let me recheck the rules.\n\nThe initial step is: start with one node. Then, connect it to k new nodes. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k new nodes. This step should be done at least once. So the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes), then the second step is adding the next layers. So the minimal case is when you have two layers. Wait, but in the example for k=3, the total is 1 + 3 + 3*3 = 13. So that's two steps: the first step (adding the first layer) and then the second step (adding the second layer). So the process requires that after the initial step, you perform at least one more step. So the minimal number of layers is two steps beyond the initial node. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But wait, what if there are more steps? Like, after adding the second layer, maybe we add another layer. Let's think about that.\n\nFor example, suppose we have three layers. Then, after the first step (initial node connected to k nodes), then the second step (each of those k nodes adds k nodes), then the third step: each of the leaves (which are the nodes added in the second step) are connected to k new nodes. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But in this case, the steps are done twice (the second step and third step). So the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal is adding once. So the snowflake can have different numbers of layers. So the total number of nodes can be 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is at least 1 (since the step is done once). Wait, but how is that structured?\n\nWait, the initial step is creating the first layer. Then, each time you perform the step, you add a new layer. Let me think again:\n\n- The initial vertex is 1 node.\n- Then, add k nodes connected to it. Now, the leaves are those k nodes. That's the first step (the initial expansion).\n- Then, the step is performed once: each leaf (those k nodes) is connected to k new nodes. Now, the leaves are the new nodes added here. So the total nodes is 1 + k + k *k = 1 +k +k².\n- If you perform the step again, then each of the leaves (the k² nodes) are connected to k new nodes. So total nodes becomes 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nSo, the total number of nodes for a snowflake is 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1. Because the step is done at least once. Wait, but the first step is the initial expansion (connecting the initial node to k nodes), then the step (adding new nodes to the leaves) is done once. So for m=1, the sum is 1 + k + k^1? No, wait. Let me think again. The initial node is 1. Then, the first expansion (step) adds k nodes. Then, the second step (the required step) adds k *k nodes. So the sum is 1 + k + k^2. So the formula is 1 + k*(k^m -1)/(k-1) ? Or perhaps the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of steps after the initial expansion. Wait, maybe the total is 1 + k*(k^d -1)/(k-1), where d is the number of times the step is applied. Let me think.\n\nLet me think of the process as follows:\n\nThe initial node is level 0. Then, level 1 consists of k nodes connected to the initial node. Then, each node in level 1 is connected to k nodes (level 2). Each node in level 2 is connected to k nodes (level 3), etc. The step of adding new nodes to leaves is done once for each level beyond the first. So, the process must have at least one such step. So, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1. Because the step is done m times. Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial step (connecting the first node to k nodes) is not part of the 'step' that must be done at least once. The step that must be done at least once is the process of taking all leaves (which are the nodes added in the previous step) and adding k new nodes to each. So the first time that step is done is after the initial expansion. So the minimal case is that the step is done once. So the total number of nodes would be 1 +k +k^2. So for m=2 levels (the initial node, level 1, level 2). So the formula is sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d is the number of levels. Wait, sum from i=0 to d is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). But for the minimal case, d=2 (sum is 1 +k +k²). So the problem is that the snowflake can be constructed as any sum of this form, where the number of levels is at least 2. Because the step must be done at least once. So the sum is S = (k^{m} - 1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 2? Wait no. Let me re-calculate:\n\nIf the snowflake has m layers (including the initial node), then the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}. Because the initial node is level 0, level 1 is k nodes, level 2 is k^2 nodes, etc. For m layers, the sum is (k^m - 1)/(k-1). But the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. Which implies that there must be at least two layers (the initial layer and one more). So m must be ≥ 2. Therefore, the total number of nodes is (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some integer m ≥ 2 and integer k ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me take the example where m=2. Then the sum is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which is 1 +k. But according to the earlier example, for m=2, the sum would be 1 +k (if there's only one step). But earlier, the example for n=13 required m=3 (sum 1 +k +k^2). So I think there's confusion here.\n\nLet me re-express the construction steps properly.\n\nConstruction steps:\n\nStart with 1 node (level 0).\n\nStep 1: connect it to k nodes (level 1). Now, the leaves are the nodes in level 1. This is the first expansion.\n\nThen, the step (which must be done at least once) is: for each leaf (those in level 1), add k new nodes. So each node in level 1 has k children. So level 2 has k *k nodes. Now, the leaves are the nodes in level 2. So this is the first application of the step. So the total nodes now is 1 +k +k². \n\nIf we apply the step again (second time), then each node in level 2 is connected to k new nodes. So level 3 has k^3 nodes. Total nodes is 1 +k +k² +k³. \n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of steps applied. Because the first step (connecting initial node to k) is not counted as a step. The step is done m times, and m ≥1. \n\nSo the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i? No. Let me think again:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\n- After 0 steps (only the initial node): 1 node. But this isn't allowed since the step must be done at least once. \n\n- After 1 step (connect initial to k nodes): total is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the step (of adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So this case is not allowed. Because the step is done once? Or is the initial expansion considered as the first step?\n\nWait the problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh! So the initial expansion (adding the first layer) is part of the construction. Then, the step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the initial expansion is required, and then the step is done once or more.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is:\n\nAfter initial expansion: 1 +k.\n\nThen, for each step (done at least once), we add k * (number of leaves). Each step, the leaves are all the nodes added in the previous step. So for example:\n\nAfter initial expansion, the leaves are k nodes. Then, the first step adds k *k nodes. Now, the leaves are those k² nodes. Then, the second step adds k³ nodes, etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is:\n\nn = 1 +k +k² +k³ + ... +k^m, where m ≥1. Because the step is done m times. Wait, for m=1, the total is 1 +k +k². For m=2, it's 1 +k +k² +k³. So the formula is:\n\nn = 1 +k*(k^m -1)/(k-1), where m ≥1. Because the sum from i=1 to m of k^i is k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). Adding 1 gives 1 + [sum from i=1 to m of k^i] = sum from i=0 to m of k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). \n\nWait, the sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). So for the total number of nodes, n must be equal to this sum for some integers k ≥2 and m ≥1. Because m is the number of steps (the step is done m times). \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), for some integers k ≥2 and m ≥1. \n\nWait, but for m=1, that's (k^2-1)/(k-1) = k+1. So for example, if n is k+1, then yes. But according to the problem's example, when n=13, it is possible. For example, k=3, m=2: (3^3 -1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Yes. So that works. \n\nSo the problem is equivalent to checking whether n can be expressed as (k^{s} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥2 and s ≥2. Because s = m+1, where m ≥1. So s ≥2.\n\nSo the question becomes: given n, check if there exists integers k ≥2 and s ≥2 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nBut how can we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nFirst, note that (k^s -1)/(k-1) is the sum of a geometric series: 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1}.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check if there exists k ≥2 and s ≥2 such that this sum equals n.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for given n, whether such k and s exist.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nFor each test case n, we need to check if there exists s ≥2 and k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^{s-1} k^i = n.\n\nSo for each possible s (starting from 2 up to some maximum), check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check this.\n\nFirst, note that for a fixed s, the sum is a strictly increasing function of k. So for each s, we can binary search for k.\n\nSo for example, for s=2: sum is 1 +k = n → k =n-1. We need k≥2 → n-1 ≥2 → n≥3. So for n ≥3, if s=2 and k =n-1, then it's possible. However, the problem requires that s ≥2 and k ≥2. So for example, for n=3, s=2, k=2: sum is 1+2=3. So yes. But according to the sample input, n=3 outputs NO. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, let me check the sample input.\n\nSample input includes:\n\nTest case 3: input is 3. Output is NO.\n\nBut according to this reasoning, for n=3, s=2 and k=2 would give sum 1+2=3. So why is the output NO?\n\nWait, this suggests that my understanding is incorrect. There's a mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. Let me re-examine the construction steps again.\n\nThe initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes connected to the initial node). Then, the step (adding new nodes to leaves) is done at least once. So, for the case of s=2, which corresponds to the sum 1 +k. Which would be the case where the step is done zero times. Because:\n\nsum for s=2 is 1 +k. Which is the initial node and the first layer. But according to the problem statement, the step must be done at least once. So this case is invalid. Hence, the sum must be for s ≥3? Or perhaps my earlier analysis was wrong.\n\nThis is critical. Let me re-analyze the construction steps.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the step is the process of adding new vertices to the leaves. This must be done at least once. So the initial step (connecting the initial node to k nodes) is part of the construction, but the step (adding new nodes to leaves) is done once or more.\n\nSo for example, in the case where after the initial step (adding k nodes), the step is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Which corresponds to sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So for s=3.\n\nThus, the correct formula is that the sum is (k^s -1)/(k-1) where s ≥3? Or s ≥2? Let me think again.\n\nLet me re-express the steps:\n\nInitial node: 1 node.\n\nStep 1: add k nodes connected to the initial node. Now, the leaves are these k nodes.\n\nStep 2 (must be done at least once): for each leaf (the k nodes), add k new nodes. Now, the leaves are these new nodes. So total nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So s=3.\n\nIf step 2 is done again, then each of the k^2 leaves gets k new nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 = sum_{i=0}^3 k^i = (k^4-1)/(k-1). So s=4.\n\nSo the sum must be (k^s -1)/(k-1), where s ≥3? Because the step is done once (for s=3), twice (s=4), etc. \n\nBut then, in the sample input, n=13 is allowed. Let's compute for s=3 and k=3: (3^3 -1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 = 26/2 =13 → yes. So that's correct.\n\nBut for n=3, which would require s=2, but s must be ≥3. Hence, the sum for s=2 is invalid. Thus, the correct condition is that the sum must be (k^s -1)/(k-1) where s ≥2? Or s ≥3?\n\nWait, let me think again. What is the minimal number of steps?\n\nThe initial step (adding the first layer) is required. Then, the step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is adding one more layer. So the total is 1 +k +k², which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So s=3. So the sum must be (k^s -1)/(k-1) for s ≥3, and k ≥2.\n\nSo that explains why n=3 is not allowed. Because for s=3, (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1. For k=2, that's 4+2+1=7. For k=1, which is invalid. So n=3 can't be represented as such sum. Hence, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether there exists integers k ≥2 and s ≥3 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nSo the correct formula is for s ≥3. Therefore, the approach is: for each n, check if there exists s ≥3 and k ≥2 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how can we check this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about possible values of s. Since for a given s, the minimal value of the sum is when k=2. For example, for s=3, the minimal sum is 2^3-1/(2-1) = 7. For s=3 and k=2, sum is 7. For larger s, the minimal sum increases. For example, s=4, k=2 gives 15. So for n less than 7, the answer is NO.\n\nSo for n <7, the answer is NO. Let's check the sample input:\n\nSample input includes n=1,2,3,6. The outputs for these are NO, NO, NO, NO. For n=6, which is less than 7, answer is NO. For n=7, it would be YES (k=2, s=3).\n\nSo the first step is to check if n is less than 7. If yes, output NO.\n\nNow, for n ≥7, we need to check for possible s and k.\n\nThe possible s values can't be too big. Because for a given s, the minimal value of the sum is 2^s -1/(2-1) = 2^s -1. So for example, if s=60, then the minimal sum is 2^60 -1, which is way larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible s is around 60 (since 2^60 is ~1e18).\n\nSo for each possible s from 3 up to log2(n)+1, we can check if there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nSo for each test case n, we can iterate s from 2 up to say 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18). Wait, but earlier we said that s must be ≥3. So for s from 3 up to max_s.\n\nBut for each s, we need to find if there's a k ≥2 such that (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n. Let's denote this as f(k,s) =n.\n\nBut solving for k in this equation for given s and n is challenging. However, since k is an integer ≥2, and for fixed s, f(k,s) increases with k, we can perform a binary search on k for each s.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- if n <7: return NO\n\nElse:\n\n- for s in 3 to max_s (where max_s is such that 2^s -1 <=n. For example, up to 60):\n\n   - perform binary search on k ≥2 to see if there exists a k such that f(k,s) =n.\n\n   - if found, return YES.\n\n- also, check for s=2? No, because s must be ≥3. Wait, but earlier analysis said s must be ≥3. So no.\n\nBut wait, what about when the step is done once. Which gives sum 1 +k +k². So s is 3 (because the formula is (k^s -1)/(k-1) where s=3). So yes.\n\nSo the code would loop s from 3 up to log2(n) +1.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for s? For example, for n=1e18, the maximum s is such that 2^s -1 ≤n. For example, 2^60 is 1.15e18, so s can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate s from 3 to 60 (or until 2^s exceeds n).\n\nFor each s, perform a binary search on k between 2 and some upper limit. What is the upper limit for k?\n\nFor a given s and n, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} =n. Since each term is positive, the sum is at least 1 +k. So for k, we can have an upper bound. For example, since the sum is at least 1 +k, which is ≥k+1. So for the sum to be n, k ≤n-1. But that's a very loose upper bound.\n\nAlternatively, for the sum (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n. For k ≥2 and s ≥3, this sum is equal to 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} ≤k^{s-1} *s. Because each term is at most k^{s-1} and there are s terms. So k^{s-1} *s ≥n → k ≥ (n/s)^(1/(s-1)).\n\nBut for binary search, perhaps we can use a high upper bound. For example, for each s, the maximum possible k is n^(1/(s-1)), because the sum is at least k^{s-1} (since the last term is k^{s-1} and the rest are smaller). So for the sum to be n, k^{s-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(s-1)}.\n\nBut for binary search, perhaps we can set the upper limit as n. Because even though it's a loose upper bound, for s up to 60, the binary search per s is O(log n) steps, which is manageable for t=1e4.\n\nSo the algorithm for each n is:\n\nCheck if n is less than 7 → NO.\n\nElse:\n\nfor s in 3 to max_s (like 60):\n\n   low = 2, high = some value (like n)\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n      mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n      compute sum_val = 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^{s-1}\n\n      if sum_val ==n → return YES\n\n      elif sum_val <n → low = mid +1\n\n      else → high = mid -1\n\nBut computing sum_val for large s and mid could be problematic due to overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, and s is up to 60, mid^s could be up to (1e18)^(60) which is way beyond what can be stored in Python's integers. Wait, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large. However, calculating the sum directly may be time-consuming and could lead to very large numbers. So perhaps we can compute the sum iteratively, and break early if it exceeds n.\n\nAnother approach is to compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow. For example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, s):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(s):\n\n        total = total *k +1\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return -1\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but how does that work?\n\nLet me think: the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1}.\n\nWe can compute this as follows:\n\nInitialize total =0.\n\nFor each term in 0 to s-1:\n\ntotal = total *k +1 ?\n\nWait, for example, for s=3:\n\nterm 0: 1 → total =1.\n\nterm 1: total *k +1 = 1*k +1 =k +1 → sum of 1 +k.\n\nterm 2: (k+1)*k +1 =k² +k +1 → sum of 1 +k +k². Which is correct.\n\nYes! So this recurrence correctly computes the sum. And during the computation, if at any step the total exceeds n, we can return early (as -1), which indicates that for this k and s, the sum is larger than n.\n\nSo during the binary search for k, for each mid, we can compute the sum using this method, and compare to n.\n\nThis avoids having to compute large exponents directly and allows early termination if the sum exceeds n.\n\nSo, the steps for each s and k are:\n\nCompute the sum as described, and check if it equals n.\n\nSo, for each test case:\n\nif n <7 → NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for s in 3 to max_s:\n\n      low =2, high = something (say, 2e9? but for s=3, the maximum possible k is sqrt(n-1), because for s=3, the sum is 1 +k +k² =n →k² +k +1 =n →k^2 ≈n →k ≈sqrt(n). So for s=3, high can be up to sqrt(n). But for binary search, even if high is set to n, the binary search would still be manageable.\n\n      perform binary search for k in [2, ... ]:\n\n         compute sum_val for k and s.\n\n         if sum_val ==n → YES.\n\n         else adjust low/high accordingly.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k in binary search? Well, for a given s, the sum for k is strictly increasing. So for binary search, the upper bound can be set as n, but for efficiency, perhaps we can compute a better upper bound. However, given that for s up to 60, and per test case, even with high=1e18, the binary search steps would be acceptable.\n\nBut for large s, the upper bound for k is small. For example, for s=60, the minimal sum is 2^60 -1, which is 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, s=60, the minimal sum is already larger than n. So for such cases, the binary search would quickly find that the sum is larger than n and stop.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = input value\n\n    if n <7: print NO\n\n    else:\n\n        found = False\n\n        for s in 3 to 60:\n\n            # compute possible k for this s\n\n            low =2\n\n            high = 2e5 (but better to compute upper bound?)\n\n            # but since for k=2, the sum is 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{s-1} = 2^s -1.\n\n            # So if 2^s -1 >n, then for higher k, sum will be even larger. So for this s, no solution.\n\n            # So perhaps we can compute the upper bound for k as follows:\n\n            # For the minimal k=2, the sum is 2^s -1. If this is larger than n, then no solution for this s.\n\n            # So first check if 2^s -1 >n. If yes, then no need to proceed for this s.\n\n            # else, proceed with binary search.\n\n            # So for each s, first compute the minimal sum (for k=2). If that is larger than n, skip.\n\n            # else, proceed.\n\n            # So:\n\n            min_sum = 2^s -1\n\n            if min_sum >n:\n\n                continue\n\n            else:\n\n                # perform binary search between low=2 and high= ?\n\n                # the maximum possible k for this s is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} =n.\n\n                # since the sum is increasing with k, and for k=2, sum is min_sum, and for larger k, sum increases.\n\n                # So the upper bound for k can be found by considering that the sum is at least k^{s-1} (the last term). So k^{s-1} ≤n → k ≤n^(1/(s-1)).\n\n                # So high can be set to n^(1/(s-1)) +1.\n\n                # but in Python, calculating that is possible via pow(n, 1/(s-1)), but since we need integer, perhaps we can use binary search with high as n.\n\n                # but for the purposes of binary search, even if high is set to n, the binary search steps would be O( log n ) steps, which is acceptable.\n\n                # So proceed with binary search between low=2 and high = n.\n\n                # but for large s, the high can be small.\n\n                # So:\n\n                low =2\n\n                high = n\n\n                while low <= high:\n\n                    mid = (low + high)//2\n\n                    # compute sum for mid and s\n\n                    current_sum = 0\n\n                    for i in range(s):\n\n                        current_sum = current_sum * mid +1\n\n                        if current_sum >n:\n\n                            break\n\n                    if current_sum ==n:\n\n                        found = True\n\n                        break\n\n                    elif current_sum <n:\n\n                        low = mid +1\n\n                    else:\n\n                        high = mid -1\n\n        if found:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in the code above, for each s, we first check if the minimal sum (k=2) is <=n. Otherwise, skip. But for example, if for a given s, the minimal sum is 2^s-1 <=n, but for some larger k, the sum could be equal to n. So the binary search is needed.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal sum? For s, the minimal sum is (2^s -1)/(2-1) = 2^s -1. So for example, for s=3, the minimal sum is 7.\n\nBut for very large s, like s=60, 2^60 is 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, 2^60 is larger than n, so we can skip.\n\nSo during the loop over s, we can compute 2^s and compare to n. However, for s up to 60, 2^s can be computed as a power.\n\nBut in Python, for exponents, even for s=60, 2**s is manageable.\n\nSo the code for checking min_sum would be:\n\nmin_sum = (2**s -1)\n\nif min_sum >n:\n\n    continue\n\nelse:\n\n    proceed with binary search.\n\nBut for s up to 60, 2^s can be up to 2^60 which is about 1.15e18, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the problem is that for each s, the binary search for k may take O(log n) steps, and for each step, the sum is computed in O(s) steps. Since s can be up to 60, and t is 1e4, the total steps would be t * 60 * log(n) * 60. Which is acceptable for Python?\n\nLet me estimate:\n\nt=1e4, for each test case:\n\nfor s up to 60 steps:\n\n   binary search steps: say log2(1e18) is about 60 steps.\n\n   for each binary step, O(s) steps.\n\nSo total operations per test case is 60 * 60 * 60 = 216,000. Multiply by 1e4, that's 2.16e9 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nThat's a problem. So this approach may not be efficient enough for the given constraints.\n\nNeed to optimize.\n\nAlternative idea: for each s, the maximum possible s is up to log2(n) +1, which is up to 60 for n up to 1e18.\n\nBut for each s, the binary search can be optimized. For example, for a given s, the sum function is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1} =n. Let's denote this as f(k) = (k^s -1)/(k-1). So for fixed s, we can find k such that f(k) =n.\n\nBut solving for k is tricky. However, since for fixed s, f(k) increases with k, we can find k via binary search. However, the problem is that for each binary search step, computing f(k) is O(s) steps. Which is expensive for large s.\n\nAlternative approach: precompute for each s, the possible k's. But how?\n\nAnother idea: for each s, the maximum possible k is small. Because for k ≥2 and s ≥3, the sum f(k) is at least 1 +k +k². For example, if n is 1e18, then for s=3, the maximum k is sqrt(n). For s=3, the maximum k is about sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. For",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake graph is constructed in such a way that it starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers of vertices, each connected to `k` new vertices where `k > 1`. The key insight is to check if `n` can be represented as the sum of a geometric series for some integers `k ≥ 2` and `s ≥ 3`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph structure implies that the total number of vertices `n` must be expressible as the sum of a geometric series: $1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{s-1}$ for some integers `k ≥ 2` and `s ≥ 3`.\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible value of `s` (starting from 3 up to a maximum feasible value based on `n`), we check if there exists an integer `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n3. **Binary Search for `k`**: For each `s`, perform a binary search on `k` to determine if the sum of the series matches `n`. This approach efficiently narrows down potential values of `k` for each `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_s = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for s in range(3, max_s + 1):\n        # Compute minimal sum for k=2\n        min_sum = (2 ** s) - 1\n        if min_sum > n:\n            continue\n        low = 2\n        high = n\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            current_sum = 0\n            overflow = False\n            for _ in range(s):\n                current_sum = current_sum * mid + 1\n                if current_sum > n:\n                    overflow = True\n                    break\n            if overflow:\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                if current_sum == n:\n                    return True\n                elif current_sum < n:\n                    low = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initial Check**: If `n` is less than 7, it's immediately determined that no valid snowflake can be formed.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Layers**: For each possible number of layers `s` (from 3 to 60), check if the minimum sum for `k=2` is feasible.\n4. **Binary Search for `k`**: For each `s`, use binary search to find a valid `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`. The binary search ensures efficient checking of potential values of `k`.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all feasible configurations of the snowflake graph structure, ensuring correctness and performance even for very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$.",
