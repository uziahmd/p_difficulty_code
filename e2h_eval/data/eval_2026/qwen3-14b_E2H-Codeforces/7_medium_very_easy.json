The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given number n whether there exists a snowflake graph as defined. Let's break down the problem.\n\nFirst, understanding the structure of the snowflake. The snowflake is built in a certain way. Let me rephrase the construction steps:\n\n- Start with one vertex.\n- Then, connect it to k new vertices (k>1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices.\n- Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the previous step) must be connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. \n\nSo the process is like a tree where each node added in a certain level has exactly k children. But the construction stops after certain steps. Wait, but how does the process work?\n\nLet me think of it as layers. Let's model the growth of the snowflake.\n\nThe initial step is layer 0: 1 node (the root).\n\nThen, layer 1: add k nodes connected to the root. So total nodes so far is 1 + k.\n\nThen, each node in layer 1 (which are leaves) must have k children. So for each of the k nodes in layer 1, we add k children. So layer 2 adds k * k nodes. Total nodes now is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that this step (adding children to leaves) should be done at least once. So the minimal case would be when we do this once. So the minimal snowflake would have 1 + k + k^2 nodes. For example, when k=4, the minimal is 1+4+16=21? But the example given in the problem says that the minimal for k=4 is shown, but the sample input includes n=13 which outputs YES. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the construction steps.\n\nWait the problem says: the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., those added in the first step) is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the second step is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + (k * k) ?\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. The initial step is one node. Then, connect to k new nodes. Now, each of those k nodes is connected to only one other node (the root). So then, each of them must be connected to k new nodes. So for each of the k nodes, adding k new nodes. So that's k * k nodes. So total nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But this is the case when we do the step once. However, the problem says that this step should be done at least once. So the minimal possible snowflake would have 1 + k + k^2 nodes.\n\nBut wait, what if we do the step more than once? Like, after adding the second layer (k^2 nodes), then again, all the leaves (those added in the second step) are connected to k new nodes. So then the total would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. And so on.\n\nSo the snowflake can be constructed in such a way that there are m layers, where m >= 2. Because the first step (adding the first layer) is required, and then the second step (adding the second layer) is done at least once. Wait, the problem says that the step of adding children to leaves is done at least once. So the minimal is two layers (the first step is adding the first layer, then the second step is adding the second layer once). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut the snowflake can also have more layers. For example, if after adding the second layer, we add another layer. So the total would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. Or even more layers.\n\nSo the general formula for the total number of nodes is the sum of a geometric series. Let's think about it. Let's say that the snowflake has m layers. The first layer is the root, then each subsequent layer adds k times the previous layer's count. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. But wait, the first step is adding k nodes (layer 1). Then the second step adds k^2 (layer 2). Then the third step adds k^3 (layer 3), etc. So the total number of nodes after m layers is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. But the problem requires that the second step (adding children to the leaves) is done at least once. Which means that m must be at least 2. Because the first step is adding the first layer (layer 1), then the second step (adding layer 2) is done once. So m is at least 2.\n\nBut wait, the initial step is the root. Then the first step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then the second step is adding the second layer (k^2 nodes). So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. So that's for m=2 layers (layers 0, 1, 2?), perhaps. So the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, but m has to be at least 2. Wait, sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But for the snowflake, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >= 2. Because for m=2, that's 1 +k +k^2. But the problem says that the second step (adding children to leaves) is done at least once. So the minimum is when m=2 (so sum up to k^2). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake can be constructed with any number of layers, but the construction requires that after the initial step (the first layer), there's at least one more step. So the total number of nodes can be written as 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m >= 1. Wait, because the first step is adding the first layer (k nodes) and then the second step (adding the second layer) is done once. So m would be 2 (since layers are 0, 1, 2). So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. But if m is 3, then sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. \n\nSo for the snowflake to exist, there must be some integer m ≥ 2 and integer k ≥ 2 such that n equals the sum 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the step of adding children to leaves is done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first layer) is done once, and then the step of adding children to leaves (which is adding the second layer) is done once. So the sum would be 1 +k +k^2. However, the step could be done more than once. For example, after adding the second layer, you can again add children to the leaves (those in the second layer) by adding k^3 nodes, and so on. \n\nThus, the snowflake's total number of nodes can be represented as S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2. \n\nWait, but m can be 1? No. Because m=1 would mean that the sum is 1 +k. But that would be the case where the step of adding children to leaves (the first step) is not done. Because the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes), and then the step of adding children to leaves (the ones added in the first step) is done at least once. So if m is 1, then the sum is 1 +k, but that would mean that the second step hasn't been done. Therefore, the sum must be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m where m ≥ 2. \n\nBut then, the problem requires that the step of adding children to leaves is done at least once. So for example, the minimal case is when m=2 (sum is 1 +k +k^2). \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥2 and m ≥2. \n\nWait, the sum S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut m must be ≥ 2. So for example, for m=2, S = (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. \n\nSo our problem is to check whether for a given n, there exists integers k ≥2 and m ≥2 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut how to check this efficiently, especially considering that n can be up to 1e18?\n\nThe approach is to find for each n, whether there exists k ≥2 and m ≥2 such that the above equation holds. \n\nBut how can we check this? Let's think of possible approaches.\n\nFirst, note that for each possible m ≥ 2, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nBut since m can be up to log_2(n), because for m+1 steps, the minimal value of k is 2, so the sum is 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. So for m+1 steps, the sum is 2^{m+1} -1. So for a given n, the maximum possible m is such that 2^{m+1} -1 ≤n. So m can be up to log2(n). Since n can be up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is around 60, so m can be up to 60. \n\nSo for each possible m from 2 up to say 60, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to check for each m?\n\nFor a given m, the sum is S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nWe can rearrange this equation to find k. For each m, we can perform a binary search on k. \n\nBut since k ≥2, and for fixed m, the sum increases with k, we can binary search for k. \n\nBut for each m, we need to find if there exists an integer k ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nBut for large m, even k=2 would make the sum very big. So for each m, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible values of the sum. \n\nBut how to compute this for each m?\n\nLet me think of the steps for solving the problem:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n can be expressed as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some k ≥2 and m ≥2.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of possible m values. Since m ≥2, the possible m can be up to log2(n) as discussed. For example, for m=2, the sum is k^2 +k +1. For m=3, the sum is k^3 +k^2 +k +1, etc. \n\nSo for each possible m (from 2 to 60), we can check if there's a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut for each m, how to find k?\n\nLet me take m as fixed. Let me denote t = m+1. Then the sum S is (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nThis is equivalent to k^{t} -1 = n(k-1). \n\nBut solving this equation for k is tricky. However, for a fixed m (and thus fixed t = m+1), we can perform a binary search for k. \n\nBut what is the possible range for k?\n\nFor fixed t, the sum S increases as k increases. For example, for t=3 (m=2), S = k^2 +k +1. For k=2, S=7. For k=3, S=13, etc. \n\nSo for each t (m+1 ≥3), we can binary search k between 2 and upper bound. What is the upper bound for k?\n\nWell, for a given t, the minimal sum for k is when k=2: S = 2^t -1/(2-1) = 2^t -1. So if n < 2^t -1, then there's no solution for this t. Otherwise, the upper bound for k can be found. \n\nBut since for k ≥2, the sum increases with k, for each t, the maximum possible k is such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) ≤n. \n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k? Well, for k ≥2, the sum is (k^t -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}. \n\nBut for k ≥2 and t ≥3, this sum is larger than k^{t-1} (since all terms are positive). So for the sum to be equal to n, we have k^{t-1} ≤n → k ≤n^(1/(t-1)).\n\nSo for a fixed t, the upper bound for k is n^(1/(t-1)). \n\nSo for each t (which is m+1, m ≥2 → t ≥3), we can binary search k in [2, ... , upper_bound].\n\nBut how to compute this for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nBut considering that t can be up to log2(n) +1. For example, for n=1e18, the maximum t would be when k=2. For t steps, the sum is 2^t -1. So 2^t -1 ≤1e18 → t ≤ log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60. So t can be up to 60. \n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate t from 3 to 60 (since m ≥2 implies t = m+1 ≥3). For each t, we perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper bound (like n^(1/(t-1)) +1). \n\nOnce we find for any t and k that the sum equals n, then return YES.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and t? Because for large k and t, the sum can be very large. However, since n is up to 1e18, and t is up to 60, even for k=1e6, the sum would be something like 1e6^60, which is way larger than 1e18. So during the binary search, we need to compute the sum and compare it to n, but we need to avoid overflow. \n\nBut in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not a problem. However, for efficiency, we need to compute the sum correctly and stop early if it exceeds n. \n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n is 1: output NO (since the minimal snowflake is when m=2, k=2, sum is 1+2+4=7, which is 7. So n=1 can't be achieved.)\n\nWait, but according to the sample input, n=1 outputs NO. Let's check the sample input.\n\nSample input includes 1, output is NO. So yes.\n\nBut for other cases:\n\nCheck for all possible t (from 3 up to max_t, which is 60). For each t, perform binary search for k in [2, ... upper_bound], and check if the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and t?\n\nThe sum is (k^t -1)/(k-1). However, for large exponents, calculating k^t may be expensive. But for t up to 60, even for k up to 1e6, k^t would be manageable in Python. However, for very large k, even k^t may be huge. But during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum as 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nLet me think of that. For example, for t=3 (sum is 1 +k +k^2). For t=4, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So for a given k and t, we can compute this sum by iterating from 0 to t-1, adding k^i each time. However, for large t, this might be time-consuming. But since t is up to 60, and per test case, this is acceptable.\n\nBut even better, during the computation of the sum, if at any point the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's too big.\n\nSo here's the approach for checking if for a given k and t, the sum equals n:\n\nInitialize current_sum = 0.\n\nFor i in 0 to t-1:\n\ncurrent_sum += k^i.\n\nIf current_sum >n: break and return that it's larger than n.\n\nAt the end, check if current_sum ==n.\n\nBut computing k^i for each i may be done with exponentiation. However, for k^i, we can compute it incrementally. For example, for i-th term, it's previous_term *k. So:\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (for i=0)\n\ncurrent_sum = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to t-1:\n\ncurrent_sum += current_term\n\ncurrent_term *=k\n\nif current_sum >n: break and return.\n\nThis is O(t) per check, which is acceptable.\n\nSo during the binary search for k, for a given t, we can compute the sum in O(t) time.\n\nNow, for each t (from 3 to max_t):\n\nCompute the possible k's.\n\nBut what's the upper bound for k?\n\nAs mentioned before, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1} ≥k^{t-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{t-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(t-1)}.\n\nSo the upper bound for k is floor(n^(1/(t-1))) +1. But how to compute this in Python?\n\nWe can use binary search for k. For example, for a given t, the lower bound is 2, upper bound can be set to something like n^(1/(t-1)) + 1. But since n can be up to 1e18, and t up to 60, even for t=3, the upper bound is n^(1/2) which is up to 1e9, but binary search over that is feasible.\n\nBut perhaps for each t, we can perform a binary search for k between 2 and some upper limit. Let's think of the steps:\n\nFor each t (from 3 to max_t):\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = ?\n\n   We can set high to something like 2e5, but that's not safe. Alternatively, compute the upper bound as follows:\n\n   For k_max such that k_max^{t-1} <=n → k_max = floor(n ** (1/(t-1))) \n\n   So we can compute this using binary search, but perhaps for simplicity, we can use the math.pow function, but in Python, taking into account that for large exponents, we can compute it with binary search.\n\nBut perhaps even better, for the binary search on k, we can start with low=2 and high=2, and double it until the sum for that k is larger than n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut for the sake of code simplicity, perhaps we can compute an initial upper bound for k as follows:\n\nSince for k ≥2, the sum is at least 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1} ≥k^{t-1}.\n\nSo k^{t-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(t-1)}.\n\nSo in Python, we can compute this upper bound as int(n ** (1/(t-1))) + 2. However, due to floating point inaccuracies, this may not be precise, but for the binary search, it's sufficient to have an upper bound that's larger than the actual k. So even if the upper bound is higher than necessary, the binary search will still work.\n\nOnce we have the upper bound, perform binary search for k between low=2 and high=upper_bound.\n\nFor each candidate k in the binary search, compute the sum for t steps and check if it equals n.\n\nIf for any t and k, the sum equals n, then return YES.\n\nOtherwise, after checking all possibilities, return NO.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nFor example, n=7. Let's see:\n\nt=3 (m=2). The sum is 1 +k +k^2. Let's check for k=2: 1+2+4=7. So YES.\n\nAnother example: n=13. For t=3, solving 1 +k +k^2 =13 → k^2 +k -12=0 → k=( -1 + sqrt(1+48 )) /2 = (-1 +7)/2=3. So k=3. So yes. So the sample input for n=13 outputs YES.\n\nSample input includes n=6. Let's see:\n\nCheck for possible t and k.\n\nt=3: 1 +k +k^2 =6 → k^2 +k -5=0 → roots are negative or non-integer. So no.\n\nt=4: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =6. Let's try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>6. k=1: invalid. So no. So n=6 is not possible. Hence sample output is NO.\n\nAnother example: n=15. Let's see. For t=3, 1 +k +k^2 =15. k^2 +k -14=0 → sqrt(1+56)=sqrt(57) ~ 7.55. So k=( -1 +7.55)/2 ~ 3.27. Not integer. For t=4, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. Let's try k=2: sum is 1+2+4+8=15. So yes. So n=15 is possible. Hence sample output is YES.\n\nSo the code needs to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n is 1 → output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for all t from 3 to max_t (say 60). For each t:\n\n   compute the sum for possible k.\n\nBut how to find max_t?\n\nThe maximum t can be determined by the minimal k=2. For example, the sum for t steps (with k=2) is 2^t -1. So when 2^t -1 <=n → t can be up to log2(n+1). For n up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So max_t can be 60.\n\nSo in code, for each test case n:\n\nfor t in range(3, 61):\n\n   check if there exists a k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i = n.\n\nIf any of these checks returns true, output YES. Else, output NO.\n\nNow, the code for checking for a given t and n:\n\ndef check(n, t):\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = ... ?\n\n   # compute upper bound for k:\n\n   # k_max is such that k_max^{t-1} <=n → k_max = n^(1/(t-1))\n\n   # but in code, perhaps we can compute high as 2, then multiply by 2 until the sum exceeds n.\n\n   # but perhaps for simplicity, use binary search between 2 and n.\n\n   # but for large n and t, this could be slow. However, since t is small (up to 60), and per test case, this is manageable.\n\n   # alternative approach: binary search for k between 2 and upper_bound.\n\n   # compute upper_bound as n^(1/(t-1)) + 2.\n\n   # but in code, we can compute it as:\n\n   # upper_bound = int(n ** (1/(t-1))) + 2\n\n   # but since in Python, exponents with fractional powers can be imprecise, perhaps better to use binary search to find the upper bound.\n\n   # but perhaps for code simplicity, just set high to 2, and double until the sum exceeds n.\n\n   # but for the purpose of binary search, perhaps it's easier to set high to something like 2e5, but that's not safe.\n\n   # Alternatively, for binary search, we can start with low=2, high=2, and while the sum for high is less than n, multiply high by 2. Once we have high such that the sum is larger than n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\n   # Let's implement this.\n\n   # So for a given t, find k in [2, ... ] such that sum equals n.\n\n   # First, find the upper bound for k.\n\n   # Initialize low and high for binary search.\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = 2\n\n   # find a high where the sum is >=n.\n\n   while True:\n\n       s = compute_sum(high, t)\n\n       if s >=n:\n\n           break\n\n       else:\n\n           high *=2\n\n   # Now binary search between low and high.\n\n   while low <= high:\n\n       mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n       s = compute_sum(mid, t)\n\n       if s ==n:\n\n           return True\n\n       elif s <n:\n\n           low = mid +1\n\n       else:\n\n           high = mid -1\n\n   return False\n\nBut what is compute_sum?\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t):\n\n   # compute 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}\n\n   # with early stopping if sum exceeds n.\n\n   total = 0\n\n   current_term = 1\n\n   for _ in range(t):\n\n       total += current_term\n\n       if total >n:\n\n           return float('inf')\n\n       current_term *=k\n\n   return total\n\nBut in Python, this can be implemented.\n\nSo putting this together, for each test case, we loop through t from 3 to 60, and for each t, perform the binary search for k as described.\n\nNow, considering that for some t, the sum for k=2 may already be larger than n. For example, if t is 60, then the sum for k=2 is 2^60 -1, which is way larger than 1e18. So for such t, the code would quickly find that even the minimal k=2 gives a sum larger than n, and thus not proceed further.\n\nBut this approach should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1 → NO\n\n2 → NO\n\n3 → NO\n\n6 → NO\n\n13 → YES (for t=3, k=3: sum is 1+3+9=13)\n\n15 → YES (t=4, k=2: 1+2+4+8=15)\n\n255 → YES (for example, 2^8-1=255. So for t=8, sum is (2^8 -1)/(2-1) =255. So t=8, which is allowed. So yes.)\n\n10101 → YES ?\n\nLet me think. For example, 10101 could be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. For example, for k=10, t=4 (sum is 1+10+100+1000= 1111). Not enough. Maybe for t=3, k= 100 → 1+100 + 10000 = 10101. Yes! So for t=3, k=100. So yes.\n\nAnother example: 1000000000000000000 (1e18). The sample output says NO. Let's see why. For example, for t=3, we have 1 +k +k^2 =n. Let's solve k^2 +k +1 =1e18. So k^2 ~1e18 →k ~1e9. Let's check if there's integer k. For example, k= 999999999: k^2 = ~1e18. Let's compute 1e18 -k^2 -k -1. But perhaps no exact solution. Similarly, for other t's. So the code would check all possibilities and find that none fit.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, handling the case where n=1. Also, note that for n=2, the minimal possible sum is 7 (for t=3, k=2). So n=2 is not possible. Similarly for n=3, 6, etc.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n ==1: print NO.\n\nelse:\n\nloop t from 3 to 60:\n\n   check if there exists a k >=2 such that sum for t steps is n.\n\n   if any of the checks returns True, then answer is YES.\n\nif none found, answer is NO.\n\nBut what about the case where the sum is for m=1 (t=2)? Wait, no. Because the problem requires that the step of adding children to leaves is done at least once. Which corresponds to m ≥2, t= m+1 ≥3. So our code checks for t ≥3.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for the code, the function compute_sum(k, t, n) needs to compute the sum and check if it equals n. Also, during the computation, if the sum exceeds n, return early.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut let's think about the code structure.\n\nImplement a helper function that for given k and t, computes the sum, and returns whether it equals n.\n\nBut for the code, during the binary search steps, for each mid value of k, compute the sum and compare with n.\n\nNow, the code:\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n\n    if n == 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    for t in range(3, 61):  # t ranges from 3 to 60 inclusive\n\n        # For each t, check if there's a k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i =n\n\n        # find the possible k via binary search\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = 2\n\n        # find upper bound\n\n        while True:\n\n            # compute sum for high and t\n\n            s = 0\n\n            current_term = 1\n\n            for _ in range(t):\n\n                s += current_term\n\n                if s > n:\n\n                    break\n\n                current_term *= high\n\n            if s >= n:\n\n                break\n\n            else:\n\n                high *= 2\n\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n\n        left = 2\n\n        right = high\n\n        found = False\n\n        while left <= right:\n\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n            # compute sum for mid and t\n\n            s = 0\n\n            current_term = 1\n\n            overflow = False\n\n            for _ in range(t):\n\n                s += current_term\n\n                if s > n:\n\n                    overflow = True\n\n                    break\n\n                current_term *= mid\n\n            if overflow:\n\n                # sum is larger than n\n\n                right = mid -1\n\n            else:\n\n                if s == n:\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                elif s <n:\n\n                    left = mid +1\n\n                else:\n\n                    right = mid -1\n\n        if found:\n\n            return True\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but this code for checking the sum is duplicated. It would be better to have a helper function.\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps it's better to inline it, but for code clarity, perhaps create a helper function.\n\nBut given that Python is not the fastest, but given the constraints (t up to 1e4, and for each test case, 60 iterations, each with binary search steps), perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can write a helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(t):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut then, for the code:\n\nfor each t in 3..60:\n\n   find if there exists a k >=2 such that compute_sum(k, t, n) ==n.\n\nBut during the binary search steps, the code would call compute_sum.\n\nBut in the code above, during the initial expansion of high, the code recomputes the sum, which is redundant. Perhaps better to use the helper function.\n\nBut regardless, the code structure is as follows.\n\nNow, considering that for very large t and k, the compute_sum function may take O(t) time. But since t is up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case n=13:\n\nt=3:\n\ncompute for k=3:\n\nsum is 1+3+9=13. So returns True.\n\nHence, returns YES.\n\nAnother test case n=6:\n\nfor t=3:\n\nbinary search for k between 2 and ... ?\n\nInitially, high starts at 2. compute_sum(2, 3, 6) is 1+2+4=7>6. So the initial high is 2. Then binary search between 2 and 2. mid is 2, sum is 7>6 → right becomes 1, loop ends. No solution. For other t's, same.\n\nHence returns NO.\n\nSample input for n=15:\n\nt=4, k=2: sum is 1+2+4+8=15. So returns YES.\n\nNow, for n=255:\n\nt=8, k=2: sum is 2^8-1=255. So returns YES.\n\nNow, for n=1e18:\n\nWe need to check for any t from 3 to 60, and any k. For example, for t=3, check if there's k such that k^2 +k +1 =1e18. Solving k^2 +k +1 =1e18 → k^2 ~1e18 →k ~ 1e9. Let's compute for k= 999999999:\n\nk^2 is 999999998000000001. Adding k gives 999999998000000001 + 999999999 = 99999999899999999 +1? Not sure, but the sum would be around 1e18. However, it's possible that there's no exact solution. Similarly for other t's. Hence, returns NO.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nBut what about the case where the snowflake can be formed with m=2 (t=3) and k=2, which gives sum 7. So for n=7, returns YES.\n\nNow, what about n=2? It's impossible. So code returns NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the code's performance. For t up to 60, and for each t, binary search steps. For each binary search step, O(t) operations. For t=60, and for each test case, the code would do O(60 * log(high)) steps. Considering that high can be up to n^(1/(t-1)), which for t=3 is up to sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. So binary search steps for that t would be up to 30 steps. For each step, O(60) operations. So per test case, 60 * 30 * 60 = 108000 operations. For t=1e4 test cases, that's 1e4 * 1e5 = 1e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWait, but 1e4 * 60 * 30 * 60 = 1e4 * 1.08e5 = 1.08e9 operations. That's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid \"snowflake\" graph as defined by the problem constraints. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if there exists any valid configuration of the graph with `n` vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and then adds layers of vertices. Each layer must have at least one more vertex than the previous layer, and each vertex in the previous layer must be connected to `k` new vertices where `k > 1`.\n\n2. **Geometric Series Insight**: The total number of vertices in such a graph can be represented as a geometric series sum: `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m` for some integer `m ≥ 2` and `k ≥ 2`. This sum can be expressed as `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Valid k**: For each possible number of layers `t` (from 3 to 60), we perform a binary search on possible values of `k` to check if the geometric series sum equals `n`.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: We use a helper function to compute the sum incrementally and check against `n` while avoiding overflow by breaking early if the sum exceeds `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(t):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return float('inf')\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    for t in range(3, 61):  # t ranges from 3 to 60 inclusive\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Expand high until compute_sum(high, t, n) >= n\n        while True:\n            s = compute_sum(high, t, n)\n            if s >= n:\n                break\n            else:\n                high *= 2\n        # Binary search between low and high\n        left = 2\n        right = high\n        found = False\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, t, n)\n            if s == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif s < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the large constraints.\n- **is_possible Function**: This function checks if `n` can be represented as a valid geometric series sum for any valid `k` and `t`.\n- **compute_sum Helper Function**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series up to `t` terms, checking for overflow early to avoid unnecessary calculations.\n- **Binary Search**: For each possible number of layers `t`, we use binary search to efficiently determine if there exists a valid `k` that results in the sum being exactly `n`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations using geometric series properties and binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for very large values of `n`.",
