After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one else has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The input starts with two integers n and m, then n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the first student's marks for three subjects.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (columns), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, right. So the steps would be:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines as a list of strings. Each string represents a student's marks.\n- Then, for each column (subject), find the maximum value. For example, for the first sample input:\nStudents are:\n2 2 3\n2 3 2\n1 1 2\nThe subjects are columns 0, 1, 2. For column 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2. Column 1: 2,3,1 → max is 3. Column 2: 3,2,2 → max is 3.\nThen, for each student, check if in any of the columns they have the max value for that column.\n\nSo student 1 has marks [2,2,3]. For column 0, he has 2 which is max. For column 1, 2 which is not max (3). For column 2, 3 which is max. So he has two subjects where he is best. So he's successful.\n\nStudent 2 has [2,3,2]. Column 0: 2 (max), column 1: 3 (max), so he's successful.\n\nStudent 3 has [1,1,2]. None of the columns have max. So not successful. Hence total is 2.\n\nSo the output is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. Let's think about how to get the columns. For example, given the list of students, each as a string, the columns can be extracted by taking each position across all students.\n\nFor example, for the first sample, the students are ['223', '232', '112'].\n\nFor column 0, the values are '2', '2', '1' → converted to integers, which are 2,2,1. Max is 2.\n\nSo for each column, we can find the maximum value.\n\nOnce we have the max for each column, then for each student, check if any of their marks in a column equals the max of that column.\n\nSo, steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. Let's store them as a list of lists, perhaps? Or maybe just keep them as strings, and access each character by index.\n\nFor example, for each student in the list, their marks are in the string. So for student i, subject j, the mark is the j-th character of the string.\n\nSo, for each column j (from 0 to m-1):\n\nFind the maximum value among all students' marks in that column.\n\nOnce we have that, for each student, check if in any column j, their mark in j is equal to the max of that column.\n\nIf yes, then count them.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. Let's store them in a list called grades, where each element is a string.\n\nThen, for each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nCompute the max value in that column. How?\n\nFor each j, iterate through all students, take the j-th character, convert to int, and track the maximum.\n\nOnce we have the max for each column, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max of that column.\n\nSo, for each student in grades:\n\nfor each j in 0..m-1:\n\nif the student's j-th character (as int) is equal to max_columns[j], then mark this student as successful and break.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n, m.\n\ngrades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nmax_columns = []\n\nfor j in range(m",
    "response": "```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Find the maximum for each subject (column)\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        val = int(grades[i][j])\n        if val > max_val:\n            max_val = val\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\n# Check each student if they are successful\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if int(grades[i][j]) == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```",
