    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then determining the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly a p-reachable graph is. Oh right, it's a directed graph where there are exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So for each such pair, both directions must be reachable. Wait no, wait. The definition says that u and v are reachable from each other. So that means there's a path from u to v and also from v to u. So each such pair contributes to the count of p. And the problem wants exactly p such pairs.\n\nThe first part is to find the minimal number of nodes n such that there exists a graph with exactly p such pairs. Then, among all those graphs with minimal n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For the minimal n, perhaps we need to find the smallest n where the maximum possible number of reachable pairs (u < v) is at least p. But how?\n\nWait, but the problem is not about maximizing the number of reachable pairs, but ensuring that exactly p of them exist. So maybe the minimal n is determined by the maximum possible number of such pairs for a given n, and we need to find the smallest n where that maximum is >= p. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given n, the minimal number of reachable pairs is zero (if the graph is a DAG with no cycles) and the maximum is C(n, 2) if all pairs are mutually reachable. Wait, but in that case, for example, if the graph is a complete graph with all edges in both directions, then every pair (u, v) where u != v would be mutually reachable. So the number of such pairs would be n*(n-1)/2, since for each unordered pair {u, v}, there are two ordered pairs (u, v) and (v, u), but the problem counts ordered pairs with u < v. Wait, the problem says that the p is the number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and they are reachable from each other. So for each unordered pair {u, v}, if they are mutually reachable, then exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) is counted (since u < v). So the total number of such ordered pairs is the number of unordered pairs {u, v} where they are mutually reachable. Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (u, v) or (v, u) will have u < v. So the count is the same as the number of unordered pairs that are mutually reachable.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to: find the minimal n such that there exists a directed graph on n nodes with exactly p unordered pairs {u, v} where u and v are mutually reachable. Then, among those graphs with minimal n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the structure of the graph. For the minimal n, perhaps we can arrange the graph in a way that maximizes the number of mutual reachability pairs, but then adjust it to get exactly p.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to find the minimal n such that the maximum number of mutual pairs (which is C(n, 2)) is >= p. But that's not correct because the maximum for a given n is C(n, 2) when all nodes are in a strongly connected component (SCC). However, if the graph is structured in a way that some nodes are in different SCCs, then the mutual reachability pairs would be less. So for the minimal n, perhaps the optimal way is to have as many mutual pairs as possible, and then subtract some. Wait, but the problem requires exactly p. So perhaps the minimal n is determined by the minimal n where C(n, 2) >= p. But wait, for example, in the sample input, p=3. C(3,2) is 3, which matches. So the minimal n is 3. Then, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is zero because all pairs are mutual. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is p=0. Then the minimal n is 0? Wait no. Wait, the problem says that the graph has to have exactly p such pairs. If p is zero, then the graph can be any graph where there are no mutual reachable pairs. For example, a DAG with no cycles. But the minimal number of nodes would be 1? Because with 1 node, there are zero pairs. But the problem says u != v. So for n=1, there are zero pairs. So for p=0, the minimal n is 1. However, looking at the sample input where p=0, the output is '0 0' but the third example in the sample input is 0, and the output is '0 0'? Wait, the sample input includes '0' as an input and the output is '0 0'? Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example input, the third case is input 0, output is '0 0'. But according to the problem statement, the input is p, which can be zero. But for p=0, the minimal number of nodes required is 1? Because with n=1, there are zero pairs. But the sample output for p=0 is 0 0. That suggests that the minimal number of nodes is 0? But that can't be, because a graph with zero nodes has zero pairs, but the problem probably requires the graph to have at least one node. Wait, perhaps the problem allows for n=0, but that seems unlikely. Let me check the note.\n\nIn the sample input, for p=0, the output is '0 0'. Wait, that's strange. How can you have a graph with zero nodes? Maybe the problem allows for n=0, but perhaps the actual answer is different. Wait, perhaps the problem considers that for p=0, the minimal n is 1. But in the sample input, the third example is input 0 and output is '0 0'. That's conflicting. Let me look again.\n\nThe sample input shows that for input 0, the output is '0 0'. So according to that, the minimal number of nodes is 0. But that's impossible. Unless the problem allows for n=0. However, the problem says that the graph is made of nodes. But perhaps the problem defines that for p=0, the minimal n is 0. But that seems odd. However, perhaps the problem considers that for n=0, there are no nodes, hence no pairs, so p=0 is achieved. But that seems like a corner case.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that for p=0, the minimal n is 0. But let's think about that. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, the main problem is to find the minimal n such that there exists a graph with exactly p mutual pairs. Then, for that n, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nLet me think of the approach. For the minimal n, we need to find the smallest n where the maximum possible number of mutual pairs (which is C(n, 2)) is >= p. But that's not entirely correct. Because perhaps there's a way to have n nodes with more than p mutual pairs, but then adjust the graph to reduce the number of mutual pairs to exactly p. However, the minimal n is the smallest n such that the maximum possible mutual pairs (for that n) is >= p. Because if the maximum is less than p, then it's impossible. So for example, if p=3, then n=3 is minimal since C(3,2)=3.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal n? For example, for p=4, the minimal n is 4? Because C(3,2)=3 <4, and C(4,2)=6 >=4. So yes. But then, how do we construct a graph with exactly 4 mutual pairs? Well, perhaps take a complete graph on 4 nodes, which has 6 mutual pairs. Then remove two pairs. But how?\n\nBut the problem says that the graph can be any graph. So perhaps for the minimal n, the minimal n is the smallest integer such that C(n, 2) >= p. Wait, but that's only if we can construct a graph with exactly p mutual pairs. But how?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the graph can be any directed graph. So perhaps the minimal n is determined by the minimal n such that the maximum possible mutual pairs (which is C(n, 2)) is >= p. Then, for that n, we can construct a graph with exactly p mutual pairs by having some structure. For example, if n is such that C(n, 2) >= p, then perhaps the minimal n is the smallest such n.\n\nBut how to confirm that? Let's take the example where p=4. Then the minimal n is 4. Because for n=3, C(3,2)=3 <4. So the minimal n is 4. Now, to get exactly 4 mutual pairs, perhaps we can have a graph that has 4 mutual pairs and the rest not. How?\n\nFor example, consider a graph with four nodes. Suppose three of them form a strongly connected component (so all pairs among them are mutual) and the fourth node is connected in a way that it doesn't add any mutual pairs. Let's see: the three-node SCC has C(3,2)=3 mutual pairs. Then, adding a fourth node that has no edges to others. Then, the mutual pairs are still 3. Not enough. Alternatively, perhaps connect the fourth node to the others in a way that creates one more mutual pair. For example, make the fourth node part of a cycle with one other node. Like, node 4 has edges to node 1 and node 1 has edges to node 4. Then, the mutual pair between 1 and 4 is added. So total mutual pairs is 3 + 1 = 4. That would work. So yes, for p=4, the minimal n is 4.\n\nSo the minimal n is determined by finding the smallest n where C(n, 2) >= p. Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, suppose p=5. Then C(4,2) is 6 >=5. So the minimal n is 4. But can we have a graph with exactly 5 mutual pairs? Yes, by removing one mutual pair from the complete graph. How? Well, perhaps by making two nodes not mutually reachable. For example, in a complete graph, all pairs are mutual. But if we remove the edge from u to v, and the edge from v to u, then the mutual reachability between u and v is broken. However, since all other edges are present, the rest of the pairs remain mutual. So the total mutual pairs would be 6-1=5. So yes, that works.\n\nSo the minimal n is indeed the smallest n such that C(n, 2) >= p. Therefore, the first part of the problem reduces to finding the minimal n where C(n,2) >= p. Once we find that n, then the second part is to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs.\n\nNow, the second part: given that the graph has exactly p mutual pairs (and is using the minimal n), what is the maximum number of unidirectional pairs?\n\nUnidirectional pairs are ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v, there's a path from u to v, but no path from v to u. Also, note that for any pair (u, v), they can be in one of three states:\n\n1. They are mutually reachable (so contribute to the p count).\n2. Only u can reach v (unidirectional pair (u, v)).\n3. Only v can reach u (unidirectional pair (v, u)).\n4. Neither can reach the other (so not counted in any of the above).\n\nBut the unidirectional pairs are those where exactly one direction is reachable.\n\nSo the total number of unidirectional pairs is the sum over all unordered pairs {u, v} of the number of unidirectional ordered pairs in that pair. For each unordered pair {u, v}, if they are not mutually reachable, then either (u, v) is unidirectional, or (v, u) is, or neither. But since the problem counts ordered pairs where u < v, for each unordered pair {u, v} with u < v, if exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) is reachable, then that contributes 1 to the unidirectional count. If neither is reachable, then 0. If both are reachable, then it contributes 0 (since they are mutual).\n\nSo the total unidirectional pairs is equal to the number of unordered pairs {u, v} that are not mutually reachable, and have exactly one direction reachable. But how to maximize this?\n\nGiven that the graph has exactly p mutual pairs, which is the number of unordered pairs that are mutually reachable, the remaining unordered pairs are not mutually reachable. For each such pair, we want to maximize the number of unidirectional ordered pairs. Which would happen if exactly one direction is reachable. So the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is equal to the total number of unordered pairs not in the mutual set multiplied by 1 (since each can contribute 1 if arranged properly).\n\nBut how to calculate this?\n\nLet me think. Let the total number of unordered pairs is C(n, 2). The number of mutual pairs is p. So the number of unordered pairs not in mutual is C(n,2) - p. Each such pair contributes 1 unidirectional pair if we arrange them to have exactly one direction reachable. So the maximum possible is (C(n,2) - p) * 1. But is that possible?\n\nYes. For example, arrange the graph such that for all non-mutual pairs, there is a directed edge in one direction, and no path in the reverse. For example, arrange all non-mutual pairs as a DAG with no cycles. But how?\n\nBut perhaps the way to maximize the unidirectional pairs is to have as many as possible of the non-mutual pairs be unidirectional. So the maximum is (C(n,2) - p) * 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the graph must have exactly p mutual pairs. So for the minimal n, which is the minimal n where C(n, 2) >= p, how can we arrange the graph to have exactly p mutual pairs, and the rest being unidirectional pairs?\n\nSo the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (total unordered pairs) - p. But wait, total unordered pairs is C(n,2). So the maximum is C(n,2) - p. But that can't be right. Because in the first sample input, p=3, n=3. C(3,2) is 3. So the maximum unidirectional pairs would be 3-3=0, which matches the sample output. In the second sample input, the input is 4, and the output is 5 6. Let me check that.\n\nWait the sample input for the second example is input 4, output is '5 6'. Wait, but according to our previous reasoning, for p=4, the minimal n is 4 (since C(4,2) is 6 >=4). Then the maximum unidirectional pairs would be 6-4=2. But the sample output for input 4 is 5 6. Wait, this contradicts our previous reasoning. So clearly, our reasoning is wrong here. Therefore, we need to re-examine the problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me look back at the sample input and output.\n\nSample Input 2: 4\n\nSample Output: 5 6\n\nWait, according to the sample output, for p=4, the minimal number of nodes is 5, and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is 6. But according to our previous logic, the minimal n should be 4. What's wrong here?\n\nThis suggests that our initial assumption about the minimal n was incorrect. So we need to rethink the entire approach.\n\nLet me look at the sample input for p=4. The output is 5 6. So the minimal n is 5. But according to C(4,2) = 6 >=4. So why is the minimal n 5?\n\nThis implies that our initial approach was wrong. Therefore, there's a mistake in our reasoning. Let's try to figure out why.\n\nThe problem says that the graph must have exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So the number of such pairs is equal to the number of unordered pairs {u, v} where u and v are mutually reachable. Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) is counted, depending on which is smaller. So the count is exactly the number of unordered pairs that are mutually reachable.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal n such that there exists a directed graph on n nodes with exactly m = p unordered pairs of mutually reachable nodes. And the first part of the problem is to find the minimal n for which this is possible.\n\nBut why for p=4, the minimal n is 5? According to the sample input, when p=4, the output is 5 6. So that suggests that with n=4, it's not possible to have exactly 4 mutual pairs. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal n is not determined by C(n,2) >= p. Because for example, in n=4, C(4,2) is 6. So if we can have a graph with exactly 4 mutual pairs, then the minimal n would be 4. But the sample says that for p=4, the minimal n is 5. So this implies that it's not possible to have exactly 4 mutual pairs with n=4. So why?\n\nAh, perhaps there's a constraint on how the mutual pairs can be formed. For example, if you have a strongly connected component (SCC) of size k, then all pairs within that SCC are mutually reachable. So the number of mutual pairs contributed by that SCC is C(k, 2). So if you have multiple SCCs, the mutual pairs are the sum of C(k_i, 2) for each SCC of size k_i.\n\nTherefore, the problem becomes: find the minimal n such that there exists a partition of n into integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m, where sum_{i} C(k_i, 2) = p. Because each SCC contributes C(k_i, 2) mutual pairs. And the total number of mutual pairs is the sum of these.\n\nBut this changes everything. Because the number of mutual pairs is not arbitrary. It's constrained by the sum of combinations of the sizes of the SCCs.\n\nSo for example, if we have a graph with two SCCs: one of size 2 (contributing 1 mutual pair) and another of size 2 (contributing 1 mutual pair), then total mutual pairs is 2. But if we have a single SCC of size 3 (contributing 3 mutual pairs), then total is 3.\n\nSo for p=4, what are the possible ways to split into SCCs?\n\nPossible options:\n\nOption 1: One SCC of size 4. C(4,2) =6. Too big.\n\nOption 2: One SCC of size 3 (3 mutual pairs) and one SCC of size 1 (0). Total is 3. Not enough.\n\nOption 3: Two SCCs of size 2 and one of size 1. Total is 1+1=2.\n\nOption 4: One SCC of size 2 (1) and another of size 2 (1), and another of size 1 (0). Total 2.\n\nOption 5: One SCC of size 3 (3) and another of size 1 (0). Total 3.\n\nOption 6: One SCC of size 2 (1) and another of size 1 (0) and another of size 1 (0). Total 1.\n\nBut how to get exactly 4 mutual pairs? Let's think. For example, if we have an SCC of size 3 (3 mutual pairs) and an SCC of size 2 (1 mutual pair). Sum is 3 + 1 =4. So total n is 3 +2 =5. So for n=5, it's possible. Hence, the minimal n for p=4 is 5. Which explains the sample input. Thus, our initial approach was wrong. The minimal n is not determined by the minimal n where C(n, 2) >= p. Instead, it's the minimal n such that there exists a decomposition of p into a sum of C(k_i, 2), where the sum of the k_i is n.\n\nAh! So the problem reduces to finding the minimal n such that p can be expressed as the sum of C(k_i, 2) for some integers k_i ≥ 1, and sum(k_i) =n. And the goal is to find the minimal n for which this is possible.\n\nSo the key is to find the minimal n where p can be written as the sum of C(k_i, 2), and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a configuration.\n\nSo how to find the minimal n for a given p?\n\nThis is similar to a problem where we want to represent p as a sum of terms of the form C(k,2), and minimize the sum of the k's.\n\nFor example, for p=4, the best way is to use C(3,2) + C(2,2) =3+1=4. The sum of k's is 3+2=5. Which is better than using four C(2,2) terms (each contributes 1, so 4 terms gives sum 4*2=8, which is worse). Or using C(4,2) is 6>4, which is not allowed.\n\nThus, the minimal n is determined by decomposing p into the sum of terms C(k_i, 2) such that the sum of k_i is minimized.\n\nSo how to find this decomposition?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of representing p as the sum of triangular numbers (since C(k, 2) is the k-th triangular number minus something?), but with the goal of minimizing the sum of k's.\n\nThe optimal way to minimize the sum of k_i for a given sum of C(k_i, 2) is to use as large as possible C(k, 2) terms. Because larger k_i contribute more per unit of sum. For example, C(k,2) is O(k^2), while the sum of k_i is O(k). So using larger terms reduces the total sum of k_i.\n\nThus, the strategy is to greedily take the largest possible C(k, 2) ≤ current p, subtract it from p, and repeat until p is zero.\n\nBut is this greedy approach always optimal? For example, let's say p=4. Greedy would take C(3,2)=3, then C(2,2)=1. Total sum is 3+2=5. Alternatively, could we take two C(2,2) and two C(1,2) (but C(1,2)=0). No, that's worse. So the greedy approach works here.\n\nAnother example: p=5. Greedy would take C(3,2)=3, then C(2,2)=1, leaving 1. Then take another C(2,2) (but that would be 1, but we already have 3+1+1=5. Sum is 3+2+2=7. Alternatively, can we find a better decomposition? Let's see. For example, C(4,2)=6 is larger than 5. So no. What about C(3,2) + C(2,2) =3+1=4, then 5-4=1. Need to add another C(2,2)=1. Total sum is 3+2+2=7. Or perhaps take C(3,2) + C(1,2) (but that's 3+0=3) and then need 2 more. Take C(2,2)=1 and then another 1, but that's same as before. So the minimal sum is 7. But perhaps there's a better way. What if we take C(3,2) (3) and then two C(1,2) (0 each), but that leaves 2. So no. Alternatively, what if we take C(2,2) five times? 5*1=5, sum of k's is 5*2=10, which is worse than 7. So the greedy approach gives the minimal sum.\n\nAnother example: p=6. Greedy approach would take C(4,2)=6. Sum is 4. Which is better than taking C(3,2)+C(3,2) = 3+3=6, sum is 3+3=6. So greedy gives better sum. Hence, the minimal n is 4.\n\nSo the greedy approach seems to be correct.\n\nSo the algorithm for finding the minimal n is:\n\nInitialize n = 0, current_p = p.\n\nWhile current_p > 0:\n\n   Find the maximum k such that C(k, 2) ≤ current_p.\n\n   Subtract C(k, 2) from current_p.\n\n   Add k to n.\n\nThus, for example, p=4:\n\ncurrent_p=4. Max k with C(k,2) ≤4 is 3 (C(3,2)=3). Subtract 3, current_p=1. Next, max k is 2 (C(2,2)=1). Subtract 1, current_p=0. Sum is 3+2=5.\n\nWhich matches the sample input.\n\nSo for the sample input p=4, the minimal n is 5. Which explains why the output is 5 6.\n\nNow, the next step is to find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such a graph.\n\nOnce we have the decomposition into SCC sizes (k_1, k_2, ..., k_m), the number of mutual pairs is sum C(k_i, 2) = p. The total number of unordered pairs is C(n, 2). The number of unordered pairs not in mutual is C(n, 2) - p. But how to maximize the unidirectional pairs?\n\nIn this scenario, the unidirectional pairs come from pairs of nodes in different SCCs. Because nodes in the same SCC are mutually reachable. For nodes in different SCCs, if there is a directed path from one to the other, but not vice versa.\n\nBut to maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, we need to arrange the SCCs in a way that for any two different SCCs, there is a directed edge from one to the other, but not vice versa. So the SCCs are arranged in a DAG, where each edge between two SCCs is directed from one to the other. This way, for any pair of nodes in different SCCs, there is a directed path from one to the other (depending on the order of the DAG), but not the other way around. So each such pair contributes exactly one unidirectional pair.\n\nBut how many such pairs are there?\n\nThe number of unordered pairs of nodes in different SCCs is total_pairs - sum C(k_i, 2) = C(n, 2) - p. And for each such pair, if the SCCs are arranged in a DAG with a total order, then each pair contributes exactly one unidirectional pair. Hence, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is C(n, 2) - p.\n\nBut in the sample input where p=4, n=5. C(5,2) is 10. 10 -4=6, which matches the sample output's second part (the 6). So this seems correct.\n\nSo the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is C(n, 2) - p.\n\nBut wait, why? Because all pairs between different SCCs can be made to be unidirectional. How?\n\nFor example, suppose we have two SCCs A and B. We arrange all edges from A to B. Then, any node in A can reach any node in B, but not vice versa. So for any pair (a in A, b in B), since a < b or not, but in the count of unidirectional pairs, we consider ordered pairs where u < v and u can reach v but not vice versa. However, regardless of the ordering, each unordered pair between A and B contributes exactly one unidirectional ordered pair (either (a, b) or (b, a), depending on which is smaller). But if we arrange the DAG such that all edges go from earlier SCCs to later ones, then for any pair of nodes in different SCCs, the one in the earlier SCC can reach the one in the later SCC, but not vice versa. Therefore, for each unordered pair between different SCCs, exactly one of the ordered pairs (u, v) or (v, u) is unidirectional, depending on which node is in the earlier SCC. Thus, the total number of unidirectional pairs is exactly the number of unordered pairs between different SCCs, which is C(n,2) - p.\n\nSo the formula for the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (C(n, 2) - p).\n\nBut wait, this assumes that the SCCs are arranged in a DAG with a total order. For example, if there are multiple SCCs, we can order them in a linear sequence, where each SCC points to all subsequent ones. This way, all pairs between different SCCs are unidirectional.\n\nSo the maximum unidirectional pairs is indeed (C(n, 2) - p).\n\nBut what about the case where there are multiple SCCs? For example, if there are three SCCs A, B, C. Arranged in a DAG such that A → B → C, and A → C. Then, any pair between A and B, A and C, B and C will contribute one unidirectional pair each. So yes, the total is the same as the number of unordered pairs between different SCCs.\n\nThus, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (C(n, 2) - p).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to:\n\nFor the given p, find the minimal n as per the decomposition into C(k_i, 2) sum to p, and then compute the maximum unidirectional pairs as C(n, 2) - p.\n\nNow, the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. For the given p, compute the minimal n by decomposing p into sum of C(k_i, 2) with minimal sum of k_i.\n\n2. Compute the maximum unidirectional pairs as C(n, 2) - p.\n\nBut wait, what about p=0? For p=0, the decomposition is sum of zero terms, so n=0? But that's not possible. Wait, the decomposition is sum of C(k_i, 2) = 0. So the only way is to have no SCCs. But the graph can have zero nodes. However, the problem may require the graph to have at least one node. But according to the sample input, when p=0, the output is 0 0. So perhaps the code needs to handle p=0 as a special case.\n\nBut let's think. For p=0, the minimal n is the minimal sum of k_i where sum C(k_i, 2) = 0. Since C(k, 2) is zero only when k=0 or 1. But k_i represents the size of an SCC. An SCC must have at least 1 node. So the only way to have sum C(k_i, 2) =0 is to have all k_i=1. Because C(1, 2) = 0. So the sum of k_i is the number of SCCs multiplied by 1. So for p=0, the minimal n is 1? Because with one SCC of size 1, sum C(1, 2) =0. So n=1. But according to the sample input, for p=0, the output is 0 0. Which contradicts this.\n\nBut the sample input says that for input 0, the output is '0 0'. So perhaps the problem allows for n=0. But then, for n=0, the number of mutual pairs is zero, which matches p=0. So perhaps the code needs to handle p=0 as follows: if p=0, the minimal n is 0. But that's conflicting with the earlier reasoning.\n\nBut according to the sample input, when p=0, the output is 0 0. So for p=0, the minimal n is 0. How can that be? Well, the problem says that the graph must have exactly p ordered pairs. If there are zero nodes, there are zero pairs. So that's acceptable. So perhaps the code should return n=0 for p=0.\n\nBut then, how to handle the decomposition for p=0. Because the code's decomposition algorithm would start with current_p=0, and exit the loop. Thus, n=0. Which is correct.\n\nBut when p=0, the maximum unidirectional pairs is C(0, 2) -0 = 0 -0=0, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code needs to handle p=0 correctly.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor a given p:\n\nIf p=0: the minimal n is 0, and the maximum unidirectional pairs is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the minimal n via the greedy decomposition.\n\nThen compute the maximum unidirectional pairs as (n*(n-1)//2) - p.\n\nSo the problem now is to implement the greedy decomposition for p.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement the decomposition for p.\n\nThe algorithm for decomposition is:\n\nInitialize current_p = p.\n\nn = 0.\n\nWhile current_p >0:\n\n   find the maximum k such that k*(k-1)//2 <= current_p.\n\n   subtract k*(k-1)//2 from current_p.\n\n   add k to n.\n\nBut how to find the maximum k for a given current_p.\n\nWe can solve for k in the equation k(k-1)/2 ≤ current_p.\n\nThis is equivalent to solving for k in the quadratic equation:\n\nk² -k - 2*current_p ≤ 0.\n\nThe roots are [1 ± sqrt(1 + 8*current_p)] / 2.\n\nThe maximum integer k is floor( (1 + sqrt(1 + 8*current_p )) / 2 )\n\nFor example, current_p=4:\n\nsqrt(1 + 32) = sqrt(33) ≈5.744. (1 + 5.744)/2 ≈3.372 → floor is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example, current_p=3:\n\nsqrt(1+24)=sqrt(25)=5 → (1+5)/2=3 → floor 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code can compute k as the floor of (sqrt(8*current_p +1) +1)/2.\n\nOnce we find k, we subtract C(k,2) from current_p, and add k to n.\n\nBut we need to make sure that k is at least 1. For example, when current_p=0, we stop.\n\nSo the code for the decomposition is:\n\ndef minimal_n(p):\n\n    if p ==0:\n\n        return 0\n\n    n =0\n\n    while p>0:\n\n        # find maximum k where k*(k-1)//2 <= p\n\n        k = int( ( (1 + (8*p +1)**0.5 ) ) // 2 )\n\n        # check if k*(k-1)//2 exceeds p?\n\n        # because due to floating point inaccuracies, perhaps k is too big.\n\n        while k*(k-1)//2 > p:\n\n            k -=1\n\n        # now k is the maximum possible.\n\n        p -= k*(k-1)//2\n\n        n +=k\n\n    return n\n\nBut let's test this function for p=4.\n\np=4:\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nk = (1 + sqrt(33))/2 ≈ (1+5.744)/2 ≈ 3.372 → floor is 3. Check 3*2/2=3 ≤4. So yes. Subtract 3, p=1. n=3.\n\nSecond iteration: p=1.\n\nk = (1 + sqrt(9))/2 = (1+3)/2=2. So k=2. 2*1/2=1. Subtract 1, p=0. n=3+2=5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: p=3.\n\nk is (1 + sqrt(25))/2 = (1+5)/2=3. 3*2/2=3. p becomes 0. n=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: p=6. The maximum k is 4 (4*3/2=6). So n=4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: p=5. First k is (1 + sqrt(41))/2 ≈ (1 +6.4)/2 ≈ 3.7 → floor 3. 3*2/2=3. p becomes 2. Then, k for 2 is 2 (2*1/2=1). Subtract 1, p=1. Then again, k=2. Subtract 1. p=0. n=3+2+2=7. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code for minimal_n is correct.\n\nOnce we have the minimal n, then the maximum unidirectional pairs is (n*(n-1)//2) - p.\n\nBut wait, for p=0, n=0. Then n*(n-1)/2 is 0, and 0-0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs. A p-reachable graph is defined as having exactly p ordered pairs of nodes (u, v) where u < v and both u and v are mutually reachable.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Mutual Reachability**: The number of mutual pairs in a graph can be derived from the sum of combinations of sizes of strongly connected components (SCCs). Each SCC of size k contributes C(k, 2) mutual pairs.\n2. **Greedy Decomposition**: To minimize the number of nodes, decompose p into the sum of combinations C(k, 2) using a greedy approach. This involves finding the largest possible k such that C(k, 2) ≤ current p, subtracting it from p, and repeating until p is zero.\n3. **Unidirectional Pairs Calculation**: Once the minimal number of nodes (n) is determined, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is calculated as the total number of unordered pairs minus the mutual pairs, which is given by C(n, 2) - p.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef minimal_n(p):\n    if p == 0:\n        return 0\n    n = 0\n    while p > 0:\n        # Calculate the maximum k such that k*(k-1)/2 <= p\n        sqrt_val = math.sqrt(1 + 8 * p)\n        k = int((1 + sqrt_val) // 2)\n        # Check if k is too big\n        while k * (k - 1) // 2 > p:\n            k -= 1\n        p -= k * (k - 1) // 2\n        n += k\n    return n\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n    n = minimal_n(p)\n    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    unidirectional = total_pairs - p\n    print(f\"{n} {unidirectional}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of a single integer p.\n2. **Special Case Handling**: If p is 0, the output is directly \"0 0\" since no nodes are needed.\n3. **Greedy Decomposition**: The function `minimal_n` computes the minimum number of nodes by iteratively finding the largest k such that C(k, 2) ≤ current p, adjusting p accordingly.\n4. **Unidirectional Calculation**: After determining the minimal number of nodes, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is derived by subtracting p from the total number of unordered pairs of nodes, which is calculated using the combination formula C(n, 2).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal node count and maximize unidirectional pairs using mathematical decomposition and properties of combinations.",
