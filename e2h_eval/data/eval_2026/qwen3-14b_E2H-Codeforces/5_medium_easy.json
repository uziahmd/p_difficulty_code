Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. The problem says that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The task is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what compatible means. Two colors are compatible if they are the same (if both are specific), or if at least one is a question mark. So, for example, a '?' can pair with any other color, including another '?'.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the number of such pairs. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about the steps. Maybe we can process the pairs in a way that first matches the specific colors, then use the question marks.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used as wildcards. So perhaps the optimal strategy is:\n\n1. For each color (other than '?'), match left and right boots of that color. For example, if there are 3 left boots with 'a' and 5 right boots with 'a', we can make 3 pairs here. Then, the remaining 2 right 'a's can't be matched with left 'a's anymore.\n\nBut then, the question marks can be used to cover the remaining ones. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can first pair all the left and right boots that have specific colors and match. Then, use the question marks to pair with whatever remains.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks optimally?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each left boot can be paired with a right boot. The problem is similar to matching two sets with certain constraints.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- First, process all the left boots that have a specific color (not ?) and try to pair them with right boots of the same color. For each color c, count how many lefts and rights have c, and take the minimum of the two counts. Then, subtract those from the available counts.\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which could be either specific colors or ?), pair the remaining ? with whatever is left. But how?\n\nWait, but after the first step, there may be some left boots with specific colors that couldn't be matched because there were not enough right boots. Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut then, the question marks can be used to pair with those. So, for example, if there's a left boot with color 'a' and no right 'a's left, then we can pair it with a right boot that is a '?', or a right boot with some other color? Wait no, because the left boot is 'a' and the right boot's color must be compatible. So the right boot can be 'a' (but there are none left) or a '?'. So the left 'a' can only be paired with a '?' on the right. Similarly, a right boot with color 'b' can be paired with a left '?' or a left 'b'.\n\nSo, perhaps the plan is:\n\n1. Match all possible pairs where both are specific colors (same color). This is straightforward.\n\n2. Then, collect all the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't be matched in step 1). For these, we can use the '?' to pair with others. But how to maximize the count here?\n\nWait, but the '?' can be matched with any other. So, perhaps:\n\nFor the remaining left and right boots, we can pair the left '?' with right '?' first, then pair the left '?' with non-? right boots, and vice versa. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the remaining left boots (after step 1), collect all the left boots with specific colors (say, L) and all left '?' (say, Lq). Similarly for the right boots (R and Rq).\n\nThen, the idea is that:\n\n- For each left boot with specific color, we can pair it with a right '?' (since the right '?' can match any color). Similarly, for each right boot with specific color, pair it with a left '?'.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nLet me think. Suppose after step 1, there are some left boots with specific colors (let's say, l_count[c] for each c) and some right boots with specific colors (r_count[c]).\n\nBut perhaps after step 1, the l_count[c] is the number of left boots of color c that haven't been matched yet. Similarly for r_count[c].\n\nSo, for each color c, the number of left c's that are unpaired is l_remaining[c], and the number of right c's is r_remaining[c]. Then, the total number of left boots that can be paired with right '?' is the sum of l_remaining[c] for all c. Similarly, the total number of right boots that can be paired with left '?' is the sum of r_remaining[c] for all c. Also, there are some left '?' (lq) and right '?' (rq).\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs here is min( (lq + sum(l_remaining)), (rq + sum(r_remaining)) ) ?\n\nWait, not exactly. Because the left '?' can be paired with any right boots (specific or ?), and the right '?' can be paired with any left boots. But how to pair them optimally.\n\nAlternatively, the idea is:\n\nWe can pair the left '?' with the right '?', and then pair the remaining left '?' with right specific, and the remaining right '?' with left specific.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to first pair as many left '?' with right '?' as possible, then pair the remaining left '?' with the right specific (and vice versa).\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nleft_non_q = number of left boots that are not '?', but couldn't be matched (because their corresponding right boots were already used up). For example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, then after step 1, 2 left 'a's are matched, and 1 left 'a' is left. So this is part of left_non_q.\n\nSimilarly, right_non_q = number of right boots that are not '?', but couldn't be matched.\n\nleft_q = number of left '?' boots.\n\nright_q = number of right '?' boots.\n\nNow, the maximum possible pairs here is the minimum between (left_q + left_non_q) and (right_q + right_non_q). But how to distribute them.\n\nWait, but the left_non_q can be paired with right_q (since the right_q can match any color). Similarly, the right_non_q can be paired with left_q.\n\nSo, the total number of possible pairs is:\n\nmin( left_non_q + left_q, right_non_q + right_q )\n\nBut how to arrange that.\n\nLet me think. For example:\n\nSuppose left_non_q is 3 (all specific colors), left_q is 2.\n\nRight_non_q is 1 (specific color), right_q is 4.\n\nThen, the total possible is min(3+2=5, 1+4=5) → 5 pairs.\n\nHow to pair them?\n\nWe can pair the 3 left_non_q with the right_q (3 of them), and then pair the remaining 2 left_q with the 1 right_non_q and 3 right_q. Wait, but that would be 2 + 1 + 3? No, that's more than 5. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to do it is:\n\nPair all left_non_q with right_q. Then, pair the remaining left_q with right_non_q and right_q.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of left_non_q (each can be paired with a right_q) plus the minimum between (left_q and right_non_q + right_q - left_non_q) ?\n\nNot sure. Maybe a better approach is to first pair left_non_q with right_q as much as possible, then pair right_non_q with left_q as much as possible, then pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nWait, but perhaps the best way is to pair the left_non_q with right_q, and right_non_q with left_q, and then pair the remaining q's between themselves.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. Pair left_non_q with right_q. How many? The number is min(left_non_q, right_q). Let's say we pair x = min(left_non_q, right_q). So after this, left_non_q becomes left_non_q - x, right_q becomes right_q - x.\n\n2. Then, pair right_non_q with left_q. How many? min(right_non_q, left_q). Let's say y = min(...). After this, right_non_q -= y, left_q -= y.\n\n3. Then, pair the remaining left_q and right_q. Which is min(remaining left_q, remaining right_q). So z = min(left_q, right_q). \n\nTotal pairs from this phase: x + y + z.\n\nBut is this the optimal way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe pairing left_non_q with right_non_q? But no, because left_non_q is a specific color and right_non_q is a specific color. They are compatible only if they are same. But since in step 1, we already matched all the same color pairs. So after step 1, there are no left_non_q and right_non_q with same color. Because, suppose there was a color c with left count m and right count n. In step 1, we matched min(m,n) pairs. So after step 1, the remaining left and right counts for color c are (m - min(m,n)) and (n - min(m,n)). Which would be (max(m,n) - min(m,n)) for one side, and zero for the other. So for example, if there were more left c's than right c's, then after step 1, there are (left_c - right_c) left c's remaining, and zero right c's. Therefore, those left c's cannot be paired with right c's (as there are none), but can be paired with right '?'.\n\nTherefore, during step 2, the left_non_q and right_non_q can't be paired with each other, because they have different colors (since otherwise they would have been matched in step 1). So the only way to pair them is via the question marks.\n\nSo the steps above (pairing left_non_q with right_q, then right_non_q with left_q, then remaining q's) is the correct approach.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nleft_non_q = sum over all colors c of (number of left boots with color c that are unpaired).\n\nSimilarly for right_non_q.\n\nleft_q is the number of left boots with '?'\n\nright_q is the number of right boots with '?'.\n\nThen, the steps would be:\n\nx = min(left_non_q, right_q)\n\npairs += x\n\nsubtract x from left_non_q and right_q.\n\ny = min(right_non_q, left_q)\n\npairs += y\n\nsubtract y from right_non_q and left_q.\n\nz = min(left_q, right_q)\n\npairs += z\n\nSo total is x + y + z.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut wait, the left_non_q and right_non_q are specific colors, but they can't be paired with each other, but they can be paired with the question marks.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the overall plan is:\n\n- Step 1: Match all same-color pairs (non-?).\n\n- Step 2: Match the remaining non-? left boots with right ?.\n\n- Step 3: Match the remaining non-? right boots with left ?.\n\n- Step 4: Match the remaining ? with ?.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used in each step.\n\nBut the problem also requires to output the actual pairs. So we need to track which left and right boots are used in each step.\n\nSo the challenge is not just to compute the maximum number of pairs, but also to generate the actual pairs.\n\nSo, let's think about how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for step 1:\n\nWe need to pair left and right boots of the same color. For each color c (excluding '?'), we can collect the indices of left boots with color c, and the indices of right boots with color c. Then, for each c, we can pair as many as possible (the minimum of the counts) and record those pairs.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nFor example, for each color c (from 'a' to 'z'), collect all the left indices and right indices. Then, for each c, pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. For example, if there are 3 left and 5 right, then pair the first 3 left with first 3 right.\n\nBut in this case, the order might not matter, as long as we pair them.\n\nOnce we have done this, we can mark those boots as used, so they are not considered again in later steps.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used.\n\nSo, perhaps, we can have two arrays: left_used and right_used, of size n, indicating whether the boot is already used.\n\nSo, for step 1, for each color c (not ?), collect the list of left indices (not used) and right indices (not used). Then pair them as per min(len(left), len(right)), and mark them as used.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left and right boots are those that are not used.\n\nThen, step 2: pair left non-? (i.e., left boots with color not ?, and not used) with right ? (not used).\n\nSimilarly, step 3: pair right non-? (not used) with left ? (not used).\n\nStep 4: pair left ? and right ? (not used).\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nBut for the actual implementation, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can have:\n\n- For each left boot, track its color and whether it's used.\n\nSame for right.\n\nBut for efficiency, given that n can be up to 150000, we need an O(n) approach.\n\nSo, let's think about data structures.\n\nFor step 1:\n\nWe can create dictionaries for left and right boots, grouping by color (excluding ?). For example, left_dict[c] is a list of indices (0-based or 1-based?) of left boots with color c. Similarly for right_dict.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_dict and right_dict, we can pair as many as possible.\n\nBut for that, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c])). For each of these pairs, we can take the first min(...) elements from left and right lists, and pair them.\n\nOnce that is done, we can remove those elements from the lists (or mark them as used).\n\nBut how to track which ones are used. Alternatively, for each color, we can process the left and right lists, and for each pair, add to the result, and mark them as used.\n\nBut perhaps, for the code, we can have two arrays, left_used and right_used, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = list of indices i where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   right_list = list of indices j where r[j] == c and not used.\n\n   take the min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs, and pair them.\n\nBut how to collect those indices. Well, for each color c, we can pre-process the left and right indices. However, for large n, it's better to process them on the fly.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, we can collect all left indices (without checking if they are used yet), and same for right. Then, during step 1, we can iterate through each color, and for each pair, check if they are not used. But that's not efficient. So perhaps the better way is to process the colors in step 1, and for each color, pair the left and right boots, and mark them as used once paired.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as arrays of False.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices with color c (not used yet) into a list.\n\n   collect all right indices with color c (not used yet) into a list.\n\n   take the minimum of the two lengths, say k.\n\n   for i in 0 to k-1:\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut how to collect the left and right indices for each color. For that, perhaps, we can pre-process for each color, a list of indices. For example, for left boots, create a dictionary where for each color, we have a list of indices. Similarly for right.\n\nBut for that, we can loop through the l string once, and for each character, add the index to the corresponding list in the left_dict. Same for the r string.\n\nBut then, during step 1, for each color c, we can process the left and right lists, but we have to make sure that the indices in the lists are not already used. However, since we process the colors in order, and once we pair them, they are marked as used, so subsequent processing of other colors will not use them again.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the same index can be in multiple color lists. For example, if a left boot is color 'a', it's in the left_dict['a'] list. But once paired in step 1, it's marked as used, and thus not considered again.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\npreprocess left_dict and right_dict, which for each color c (including '?') have lists of indices.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nfor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = left_dict.get(c, [])\n\n   right_list = right_dict.get(c, [])\n\n   k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in 0 to k-1:\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut this would miss the cases where the same color is processed multiple times. Wait, no. Because for each color c, the left_list is all the indices with color c. But during step 1, once we process color c, we pair as many as possible, and mark them as used. Then, when processing other colors, those indices are already marked as used and thus not considered again.\n\nBut this approach may not work, because the left_dict and right_dict include all indices for each color, including those that may have been used in previous steps. For example, suppose a color 'a' is processed first, and some pairs are made. Then, when processing color 'b', the left_dict['b'] includes all left boots with color 'b', even if some of them were already used in previous steps (but they can't be, since they are of color 'b', and previous steps would have processed other colors, not 'b' yet). Wait, no. Because for step 1, the code is processing each color once, in order. So for example, if we process color 'a' first, and then process 'b', then the left_list for 'b' would include all left boots of color 'b', including those that may have been used in previous steps (but they can't be, because they are of color 'b', and previous steps would have processed color 'a', not 'b'). So, no, the left_list for 'b' would be all left boots with color 'b', and since they haven't been processed yet (they are of color 'b', and the code is processing 'b' now), so they are not marked as used. Thus, this approach would work.\n\nWait, no. Because during step 1, the code is processing each color once, and for each color, the left_list is the entire list of indices for that color. But during processing, when we pair them, we mark them as used. So for example, if a left boot is color 'a', and during processing color 'a', it is paired with a right boot, and marked as used. Then, when processing other colors, this left boot is already marked as used and not considered again.\n\nThus, this approach would work for step 1.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, the next steps are to process the remaining left and right boots.\n\nNow, for step 2: pair the left non-? (i.e., left boots with color not '?', and not used) with right ? (not used).\n\nSimilarly for step 3: pair right non-? (not used) with left ? (not used).\n\nThen step 4: pair left ? and right ?.\n\nBut how to collect these.\n\nSo, for step 2, we need to collect all left boots that are not used and have color not '?', and all right boots that are not used and have color '?'.\n\nSimilarly for step 3.\n\nBut how to collect them efficiently.\n\nPerhaps, for step 2, collect all left non-? not used into a list, and collect all right ? not used into a list. Then, pair as many as possible.\n\nSame for step 3.\n\nBut how to collect these lists.\n\nFor example, for step 2:\n\nleft_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [j for j in range(n) if not right_used[j] and r[j] == '?']\n\nThen, the number of pairs is min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q)).\n\nFor each pair, take the first element from left_non_q and first from right_q, pair them, and mark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for step 3: collect all right_non_q (not used, r[j] != '?') and left_q (not used, l[i] == '?'), and pair them.\n\nThen, step 4: collect the remaining left_q and right_q (not used), and pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to collect these lists. For each step, we can generate the lists on the fly.\n\nBut for large n, this could be O(n) time for each step. Since the total steps are O(n), it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as arrays of False.\n\nProcess step 1: pair same color.\n\nThen, process step 2: pair left non-? with right ?.\n\nThen, process step 3: pair right non-? with left ?.\n\nThen, process step 4: pair ? with ?.\n\nNow, the code needs to collect the pairs during each step.\n\nBut how to collect the pairs.\n\nLet me think about the code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nn = int(input())\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\nleft_used = [False] * n\nright_used = [False] * n\n\npairs = []\n\n# Step 1: same color pairs\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_dict = defaultdict(list)\nright_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    left_dict[l[i]].append(i)\nfor i in range(n):\n    right_dict[r[i]].append(i)\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_list = left_dict[c]\n    right_list = right_dict[c]\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(k):\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n        if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n            pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n            left_used[left_idx] = True\n            right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nWait, but this code is not correct. Because the left_dict and right_dict contain all the indices for each color. However, during step 1, when we process color 'c', some of the indices in left_list and right_list may have already been used in previous steps. For example, if a color 'a' is processed first, and some of the left and right indices are paired. Then, when processing color 'b', the left_dict['b'] contains all the left indices with color 'b', which are not used yet. However, the code above checks if they are not used before adding them to the pairs. But in reality, since we are processing the colors in order, and the left and right lists are built before any processing, the code may have indices that are already used. So the code above would check for that.\n\nBut this approach would not work. Because the left_dict and right_dict are built before any processing. So, for example, if a left boot is color 'a', and was already paired in step 1 (for color 'a'), then in the code above, when processing color 'a', the code would check if they are not used. But how does the code know that they are already used?\n\nAh, no. The code above loops through each color in the alphabet, and for each color, it takes the list of indices from left_dict and right_dict. But during the processing of the color, the code checks if the indices are not used. However, in this code, the left_dict and right_dict are built once, before any processing. So, for example, if a left boot is color 'a', and was already paired in a previous step (like, if we processed color 'a' earlier?), but in the code above, the code is looping through all colors in order. So, for example, for color 'a', the code would take the list of left indices, and for each, check if they are not used. But if during the processing of color 'a', the code pairs them, then during the same loop, the left_used and right_used are marked as True. So, when processing other colors, the code will not pair those indices again.\n\nBut the problem is that the code above is using left_dict and right_dict, which contain all the indices for each color, regardless of whether they are used. So, for example, during processing color 'a', the code may have already paired some indices. But when processing color 'a' again, perhaps? No, because the code loops through each color once. So for example, the code is processing each color once, in order from 'a' to 'z'.\n\nWait, the code is written as:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\nso for each color in order. So, for each color, the code processes the left and right lists. But during processing, the code checks if the indices are not used. However, the left_dict and right_dict contain all the indices for the color, including those that may have been used in previous steps. For example, if a left boot is color 'a', and was used in step 1 (when processing color 'a'), then during processing color 'a', the code would check if left_used is False. If it is, then pair them. Otherwise, skip.\n\nBut in this code, for the same color, the code is processing all the indices in left_dict[c], which may include some that are already used. So, the code may attempt to pair them again. However, the code checks if they are not used. So, the code would pair them only if they are not used.\n\nBut this approach is not efficient. Because, for example, for color 'a', the left_dict[c] may have 1000 entries, but many of them are already used. So, the code would loop through all of them, and check if they are not used. However, this would be O(n) per color, leading to O(26n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1.5e5.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. However, for the sake of time, perhaps this code is acceptable.\n\nBut the code as written would not work. Because, for example, when processing color 'a', the code would take all the left indices in left_dict['a'], and for each, check if they are not used. But if some of them are already used (from previous steps?), but that's impossible because the code is processing color 'a' for the first time. Wait, no. Because the code is processing each color once. So, for example, during the processing of color 'a', the code is trying to pair left and right boots of color 'a' that are not used. So, the left_dict['a'] contains all the left boots with color 'a', including those that may have been used in previous steps (but no, because previous steps would have processed other colors, not 'a'). So, no, the left_dict['a'] contains all the left boots of color 'a', and during processing of color 'a', the code is checking if they are not used. So, the code would pair as many as possible, and mark them as used. So this seems correct.\n\nBut in the code above, the code is taking the entire list of left and right indices for color c, and for each pair, checking if they are not used. However, this is not efficient. Because, for example, if the left_dict[c] has 1000 entries, but only 10 are not used, the code would process all 1000 entries, checking each one. That's O(n) per color, which is O(26n) total.\n\nBut for n up to 1.5e5, that's 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. However, for now, perhaps proceed with this approach.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, then proceed with steps 2, 3, 4.\n\nFor step 2: collect left_non_q (left not used, color not ?) and right_q (right not used, color ?). Pair them as much as possible.\n\nSimilarly for step 3.\n\nFor step 2:\n\nleft_non_q = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?':\n        left_non_q.append(i)\nright_q = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?':\n        right_q.append(i)\n\nk = min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(k):\n    left_idx = left_non_q[i]\n    right_idx = right_q[i]\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    left_used[left_idx] = True\n    right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for step 3:\n\nright_non_q = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?':\n        right_non_q.append(i)\nleft_q = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?':\n        left_q.append(i)\n\nk = min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(k):\n    right_idx = right_non_q[i]\n    left_idx = left_q[i]\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    left_used[left_idx] = True\n    right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nThen step 4:\n\nleft_q_remaining = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?':\n        left_q_remaining.append(i)\nright_q_remaining = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?':\n        right_q_remaining.append(i)\n\nk = min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining))\nfor i in range(k):\n    left_idx = left_q_remaining[i]\n    right_idx = right_q_remaining[i]\n    pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n    left_used[left_idx] = True\n    right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nThis should collect all possible pairs.\n\nBut there's a problem here. For example, during step 2, when collecting left_non_q and right_q, the code is iterating through all n elements each time. Which is O(n) for each step. So for steps 2,3,4, that's O(n) each. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for large n, this may be slow. However, given that n is up to 1.5e5, and each step is O(n), it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize by precomputing the lists for each step. However, for code clarity, it's easier to proceed as written.\n\nNow, considering the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\ncodeforces\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output is 5 pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly process that.\n\nBut let's think about the first sample.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. But the input is given as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nSecond line contains l.\n\nThird line contains r.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is for one test case. So the code should read n, then l, then r.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first example input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', ... etc.]. But that's probably a mistake. Because in the problem statement, the input is three lines: n, l, r.\n\nSo the code should read:\n\nn = int(input())\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\nThen process.\n\nNow, the code as outlined would generate the pairs, and then output the number of pairs followed by the pairs.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first example's output is 5 pairs, but the code may generate that.\n\nBut what about the order of the pairs? The problem says that any valid answer is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code's approach may have some issues. For example, during step 1, the code uses the left_dict and right_dict, which are built before any processing. So, for example, if a left boot is color 'a', and during step 1, when processing color 'a', the code may pair it with a right boot of color 'a'. However, if the code processes color 'a' first, but there are more left 'a's than right 'a's, then during step 1, the code pairs as many as possible, and the remaining left 'a's are left for step 2.\n\nBut the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother possible issue: during step 1, the code loops through all colors from 'a' to 'z', but the left_dict and right_dict may have entries for '?', but the code ignores them, since the loop is for 'a' to 'z'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code may have an error in the way it builds the left_dict and right_dict. Because, for example, the code loops through all characters in l and adds to left_dict. But for the first step, when processing each color, it's possible that some of the indices are already used. But the code checks if they are not used before pairing.\n\nBut in the code for step 1, the code is:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_list = left_dict[c]\n    right_list = right_dict[c]\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(k):\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n        if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n            pairs.append( ... )\n\nBut this is wrong. Because the code is assuming that all the left_list and right_list entries are not used. However, this is not the case. For example, during processing of color 'a', some of the left_list entries may have been used in previous steps (if the code processed another color before 'a' and somehow the same index was in another color's list. But that's impossible, because the left_dict is built based on the color of the left boot. So, for example, a left boot with color 'a' is in left_dict['a'], not in any other color's list. So during processing of color 'a', the code is only looking at left boots of color 'a', which were not used in previous steps (since previous steps processed colors before 'a', which are different from 'a').\n\nWait, no. The code loops through colors in order from 'a' to 'z'. So, for example, the code first processes 'a', then 'b', etc. So during processing 'a', the code is handling left boots with color 'a', which are not used yet. Because they were not processed in previous steps (since previous steps processed colors before 'a', which are not 'a'). So the left_list for 'a' contains all left boots with color 'a', and none of them have been used yet. Thus, the code can safely assume that they are not used, and not check for that.\n\nWait, but this is not the case. Because during step 1, the code processes all colors in order. For example, during processing of color 'a', the code may pair some left and right boots. Then, when processing color 'b', the code may process left boots of color 'b', which are not used. So, during the processing of color 'a', the code can pair the left and right boots of color 'a', and mark them as used. So during the processing of color 'a', the code can safely pair all the left and right boots of color 'a' in the left_list and right_list, since they are not used yet.\n\nBut the code as written checks if they are not used. However, this is redundant, because the left_list and right_list for color 'c' are built before any processing, and during processing of color 'c', the code hasn't processed any other color that would have used those indices. So, the code can safely pair all the left and right entries in the lists.\n\nBut why is the code checking if they are not used? Because, for example, during processing of color 'a', the code may have already processed some left and right indices. But that's not possible, since the left_list and right_list for color 'a' are all the indices of color 'a', and during processing of color 'a', they are being processed for the first time.\n\nThus",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility is determined by matching specific colors or using question marks as wildcards.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Same Color Matching**: First, we match left and right boots that have the same specific color.
