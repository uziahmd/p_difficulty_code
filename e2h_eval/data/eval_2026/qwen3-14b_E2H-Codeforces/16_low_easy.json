Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. The adjacency is defined by sharing a non-zero length border. So, each step is moving across a road into an adjacent block.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? Well, each block can be considered as a node in a graph, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent. But since there are infinitely many blocks, I can't represent them all directly. So I need another approach.\n\nWait, but maybe I can model the problem using the roads. Since each block is separated by roads, the key is to determine for each block which other blocks it is adjacent to. However, with infinite blocks, that's impossible. So perhaps there's a way to model the problem based on the positions of the home and university relative to the roads.\n\nAnother thought: the problem is similar to BFS, where each state is determined by the position relative to the roads. But how to represent that?\n\nAlternatively, think about the regions divided by the lines. Each line divides the plane into two parts. The home and university are in some regions. Moving from one region to another requires crossing a line (road). The problem is to find the minimal number of crossings needed to get from the home region to the university region.\n\nBut how to model the regions? Well, each region can be represented by a set of signs for each line. For example, for each line, the region is on one side of the line or the other. So for each line, we can compute whether the home is on the positive or negative side of the line. Similarly for the university.\n\nBut since there are n lines, each region can be represented by a binary vector of length n, indicating for each line which side of the line the region is on. However, with n up to 300, this would be 2^300 possible regions, which is impossible to handle directly.\n\nSo that's not feasible. So what else can I do?\n\nWait, but the movement between regions is allowed if they share a common boundary. Which means that two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one line's sign. Because if two regions differ in exactly one line, then they are separated by that line. So moving between them requires crossing that line once. But if they differ in more than one line, then they are not adjacent.\n\nWait, no. Because if two regions differ in two lines, then their boundaries are separated by those two lines. But maybe they share a common boundary? Not sure. But according to the problem statement, the movement is allowed only if the common border has non-zero length. So, perhaps two regions are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one line. Because if you cross that line, you move into the adjacent region.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of line crossings needed to go from the home's region to the university's region. Each crossing changes the sign of exactly one line.\n\nBut how to model this? Let me think.\n\nEach region can be represented by the signs of each line. The home's region has a certain signature (s1, s2, ..., sn), where each si is +1 or -1, depending on which side of the line the home is on. Similarly for the university's region.\n\nThe problem becomes: find the minimal number of steps to change the home's signature into the university's signature, where each step flips exactly one sign (since crossing a line changes the sign of that line's equation).\n\nWait, but flipping one sign would take you to a neighboring region. So the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two signatures. Because each differing bit represents a line that needs to be crossed once. But wait, that's only if the two regions differ in exactly k lines, then the minimal steps would be k. But is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because suppose the home and university regions differ in two lines. Then, you can cross one line, then cross another line. But the path may require two steps. But maybe there's a way to reach the target in fewer steps? No, because each step can only flip one bit. So the minimal steps is the number of differing bits between the two signatures.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose there are two lines, and the home is in a region that is on the positive side of both lines. The university is on the negative side of both lines. The Hamming distance is 2. So the minimal steps would be 2: cross line 1, then cross line 2. But maybe there's a way to cross both lines in one step? No, because each step is crossing a single line. So yes, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance.\n\nBut then why in the sample input, the first case gives output 2?\n\n",
    "response": "To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of steps to move from one block to another in Crazy Town, we can model the problem using the **Hamming distance** between two binary vectors representing the relative positions of the home and university with respect to all roads.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Block Representation**: Each block is uniquely defined by its position relative to each road. For a given road, the block lies on one side or the other of the line. This gives a binary signature for each block (e.g., +1 or -1 for each road).\n   \n2. **Movement Rule**: You can only move from one block to an adjacent one if they share a non-zero boundary segment. This happens when their signatures differ in exactly one road (i.e., you cross that road).\n\n3. **Minimum Steps**: The minimal number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is the **Hamming distance** between the two blocks' signatures. This is because each differing bit represents a road that must be crossed once.\n\n---\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Compute Signature of Home and University**:\n   For each road, determine whether the home and university are on the positive or negative side of the road.\n   - For a road `a * x + b * y + c = 0`, a point `(x, y)` lies on the positive side if `a*x + b*y + c > 0`, and on the negative side otherwise.\n\n2. **Calculate Hamming Distance**:\n   Count how many roads have different signs for the home and university. That count is the minimal number of steps required.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n\n    # Read home and university coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, data[0].split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, data[1].split())\n\n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(data[2])\n\n    # Read each road's coefficients\n    roads = []\n    for i in range(3, len(data)):\n        a, b, c = map(int, data[i].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n\n    # Compute the signature for home and university\n    home_sign = []\n    univ_sign = []\n\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n        # Determine sign (+1 or -1)\n        home_sign.append(1 if val_home > 0 else -1)\n        univ_sign.append(1 if val_univ > 0 else -1)\n\n    # Calculate Hamming distance\n    steps = sum(h != u for h, u in zip(home_sign, univ_sign))\n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Execution:\n\n#### Input:\n```\n1 1\n-1 -1\n2\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n```\n\n#### Output:\n```\n2\n```\n\nThis corresponds to the home being in a region that differs in 2 roads from the university, so it takes **2 steps** to reach the university block.\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity:\n\n- **O(n)**: We process each of the `n` roads once to compute the signs for both points.\n- **Efficient**: Works well even for `n = 300`, which is within the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures correctness and efficiency for the given problem constraints.",
