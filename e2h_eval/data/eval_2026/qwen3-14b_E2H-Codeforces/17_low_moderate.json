He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. But we don't know s. However, there must be at least one possible s that fits the assignments. Our job is to find any valid assignment of P and S to the input strings.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Let's think about what's given. For each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix of s. Also, for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So for example, for n=5, there are 2*5-2 = 8 strings, with two of each length 1,2,3,4.\n\nThe key here is that the original string s must have all the prefixes and suffixes given. But since we don't know s, how can we figure out which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nLet me think: The original string s has a unique prefix of each length (from 1 to n). Similarly for suffixes. But in the input, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings. One of them is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l. Wait, no. Because for each length l, there's exactly two strings. But for the original string s, there's exactly one prefix of length l and exactly one suffix of length l. So the input contains these two strings for each l. But the problem says that the input is all the improper prefixes and suffixes. So for example, for s of length 5, the input includes all prefixes of length 1, 2, 3, 4, and all suffixes of length 1, 2, 3, 4. So total of 4*2=8 strings.\n\nNow, the problem is to assign each of these 8 strings as either a prefix or a suffix. But how?\n\nOne approach: For each possible candidate string s (but that's impossible for n up to 100, since there are too many possibilities). So that's not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For the original string s, the prefix of length l must be a prefix of the prefix of length l+1. Similarly, the suffix of length l must be a suffix of the suffix of length l+1. Also, for each l, the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l must be compatible with the original string. For example, the prefix of length l is the first l characters of s, and the suffix of length l is the last l characters of s. So for the original string s, the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l must agree on overlapping parts if l is such that l + l > n. For example, if l is 3 and n is 5, then the prefix of length 3 is first three characters, and the suffix of length 3 is last three. They overlap in positions 3 and 4 (assuming 1-based?), so the third character of the prefix must be the same as the third character of the suffix (since the prefix is s[0], s[1], s[2], and the suffix is s[2], s[3], s[4]).\n\nBut how do I use this information when I don't know s?\n\nAnother thought: The correct assignment must have that for each length l, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. Also, the prefix of length l must be a prefix of the prefix of length l+1. Similarly for the suffixes.\n\nSo, for example, for the prefixes, there must be a sequence where each prefix of length l is a prefix of the next longer prefix. Similarly for the suffixes.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- For each possible candidate for the full string s, check if all the given strings are prefixes or suffixes of s. But again, for n up to 100, this is not feasible unless we can find a way to generate possible candidates.\n\nBut how can we find s? Well, the original string s must have all the prefixes and suffixes provided. So, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be such that their combination allows for s. Let me think: the original s must be such that the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, combining these two, the s must be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Wait, but the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must have their first n-2 characters overlapping. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`.

So in that case, the two strings are same. But how to handle that?\n                # In that case, both are prefix and suffix. So for the length l, both strings are same, and thus, they can be assigned as one P and one S. But how? Well, the problem allows any assignment as long as there's at least one possible s.\n                # However, for the current approach, if the two strings are same, then both will be counted as prefix and suffix. But for our check, we need that for each length l, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. But if the two strings are same, then both can be considered as prefix and suffix. However, for the code, when checking for count_prefix and count_suffix, we have to make sure that each string is considered once. But since the two strings are same, their checks would count both as prefix and suffix. So the counts would be 2 for both, which is invalid. So this approach may not work in that case.\n                # Therefore, maybe the way to check is that for each length l, there is at least one prefix and one suffix. But since the input is guaranteed to be valid, perhaps the code can proceed by checking if all the strings are either prefix or suffix of s1.\n                # However, the problem requires that for the output, each string is assigned as P or S. So even if two strings are same, they can be assigned as P and S. But how to handle that?\n                # Maybe the code can proceed as follows: for each string, check if it's a prefix or a suffix. If it's both, then it can be assigned either way. But for the purpose of the problem, we just need to find any valid assignment.\n                # However, in the current approach, when trying to build the assignment for s1, we can check for each string in the input if it's a prefix or suffix. If it's both, then we can choose either. But for the code, perhaps the way to proceed is to collect all strings that are prefixes and suffixes, and then check if for each length, there are exactly two strings (but that's already guaranteed).\n                # Alternatively, perhaps the code can proceed to check if all the strings are either a prefix or suffix of s1.
