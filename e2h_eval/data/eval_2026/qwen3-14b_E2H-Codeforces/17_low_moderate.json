He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. And we need to output a string of P's and S's accordingly. The catch is that we don't know s, but we have to find a possible assignment that's consistent with some s.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. The key idea here is that for the correct string s, all the given strings must be either prefixes or suffixes of s. But since we don't know s, we need to find a way to determine which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes such that there exists a string s that satisfies all those conditions.\n\nFirst, let's note that for a string s of length n, the prefixes are s[0..k] for k from 1 to n-1, and similarly suffixes are s[n-k..n] for k from 1 to n-1. Also, the problem says that the input contains exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for each length, there's two entries, one being a prefix and the other a suffix (but we don't know which).\n\nThe challenge is to assign each input string as either a prefix or a suffix such that there's a string s that meets all these conditions.\n\nLet me think: For each possible candidate s, we can check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s. But since n can be up to 100, trying all possibilities for s might not be feasible directly. However, maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, but how do we find s? Well, the original string s must have all the prefixes and suffixes provided. So, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be a prefix of s, and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be a suffix of s. Also, the actual s must be such that all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nBut since the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the correct s can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix. For example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must overlap in such a way that they form the original string. Wait, but how?\n\nLet's take the first example: input strings include 'abab' (length 4), which is the longest prefix (since n=5). Then the longest suffix is 'baba' (length 4). The original string is 'ababa'. So the longest prefix is 'abab' (the first four letters) and the longest suffix is 'baba' (last four letters). The original string is formed by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. But since they both have length n-1, their overlap would be n-2 letters. So the original string is the prefix plus the last character of the suffix. But how do we find that?\n\nAlternatively, the original string s must be such that:\n\n- The longest prefix (length n-1) is a prefix of s. So s starts with that string. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) is a suffix of s. So s ends with that string. Therefore, the original string s must be the combination of the longest prefix and the last character of the longest suffix. But wait, the longest prefix and longest suffix may overlap. For example, if the longest prefix is 'abab' and the longest suffix is 'baba', then the original string is 'ababa' which is the prefix (abab) plus the last character of the suffix (a). But how to find which of the input strings are the longest prefix and the longest suffix?\n\nSo here's an idea: For the input strings, the ones of length n-1 must be either the longest prefix or the longest suffix. There are exactly two such strings. So, for each pair of these two strings, we can try to find a possible s that starts with one and ends with the other. Then check if all the other input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of that s.\n\nBut how do we find which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nFor example, suppose we have two candidates for the longest prefix and suffix. Let's say A and B. Then, the original string s must be such that A is its prefix, B is its suffix. Then, the length of s is n. So, the length of A is n-1. So s is A + [some character]. But B is a suffix of s. So B must be the last n-1 characters of s. Which implies that the last n-2 characters of B must match the last n-2 characters of A. Because s is A + c, so",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves checking possible combinations of the longest prefix and suffix candidates to reconstruct a valid string `s` and then validating all other input strings against this reconstructed string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Candidates**: Extract the two strings of length `n-1` from the input. These are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct String `s`**: For each pair of these candidates, attempt to reconstruct `s` by combining the prefix candidate with the last character of the suffix candidate and vice versa.\n3. **Validation**: Check if the reconstructed string `s` is consistent with all other input strings being either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n4. **Determine Assignment**: Once a valid `s` is found, determine the assignment of 'P' (prefix) and 'S' (suffix) for each input string based on their positions in the input list.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Separate the strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strs = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strs[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Get the two candidates of length n-1\n    max_len = n - 1\n    candidates = len_to_strs[max_len]\n    \n    # Try all possible combinations of the two candidates as prefix and suffix\n    for prefix_candidate in candidates:\n        for suffix_candidate in candidates:\n            if prefix_candidate == suffix_candidate:\n                continue  # skip same candidates\n            # Try to build possible s\n            # Case 1: prefix_candidate is the prefix, suffix_candidate is the suffix\n            # Then s must be prefix_candidate + last_char of suffix_candidate\n            # But also, the suffix_candidate must be the suffix of s\n            # So check if the first (n-1 - 1) characters of suffix_candidate match the last (n-1 -1) of prefix_candidate\n            overlap = n - 2\n            if prefix_candidate[-overlap:] == suffix_candidate[:-1]:\n                s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n                # Now check if all the input strings are either prefix or suffix of s\n                # For each string in the input, check if it's a prefix or suffix of s\n                # We need to assign P/S such that each string is either a prefix or suffix\n                # Let's collect all the strings and check their status\n                assignments = []\n                valid = True\n                for s_in in strings:\n                    is_prefix = s.startswith(s_in)\n                    is_suffix = s.endswith(s_in)\n                    if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                        valid = False\n                        break\n                    # If both are true, we can choose either, but need to make sure that the counts are equal\n                    # However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can just pick one\n                    if is_prefix and is_suffix:\n                        # Choose P or S arbitrarily, but need to ensure that the total counts are correct\n                        # Since the original s has exactly one of each for each length, but here we have two entries per length\n                        # However, since the input is guaranteed to be correct, we can just assign P or S based on some criteria\n                        # For example, prefer P if possible\n                        # But for our purpose, we can assign P if it's a prefix, else S\n                        # But since it's both, we can choose either.
