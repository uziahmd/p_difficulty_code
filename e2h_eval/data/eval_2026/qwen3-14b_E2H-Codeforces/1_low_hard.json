    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nHmm, let me think about how to model each ring. For the i-th ring (starting from 1), the ring is formed by the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we calculate the number of cells in that border?\n\nRight, for any rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3 has perimeter 2*(3+3-2) = 8, which matches the first example where the output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all these perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. The rectangles for each ring must be valid. For example, when i increases, the dimensions decrease by 4 each time. But for each i, the dimensions must be at least 3? Or maybe even less? Because for the next ring, the rectangle is smaller. Let me think: the problem says that k is given such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3 +1)/4 ) = 1. So k can't be more than that. Which ensures that each ring is possible.\n\nSo, for each i from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle with width w_i = w - 4*(i-1), height h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters.\n\nSo the formula for each ring is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Summing over i from 1 to k.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So i=1: w_i = 3, h_i=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So i=1: 7 and 9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. For i=1, perimeter is 28. For i=2, the dimensions are 7-4*(1) = 3, 9-4*(1) = 5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Sum 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the third example. So that works.\n\nSo the approach is to loop from 1 to k, for each i, calculate the current width and height, compute the perimeter, add to total.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nRead w, h, k. Then for each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nsum all perimeters.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. For example, the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ), which ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are at least 3? Let me check.\n\nLet me think for i=1: the min(w, h) is say m. Then for i=1, the dimensions are w and h, which are >=3. For i=2, they are reduced by 4. So for the minimum dimension, m - 4*(i-1) must be >= 3? Well, the k is given as up to floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let me see for example: if m is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can't be more than 1. So for i=1, the dimensions are 3, and for i=2, it would be ",
