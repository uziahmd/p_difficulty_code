The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge. The second is two cells away from the edge. Wait, maybe the way to think about it is that each ring is a border around a smaller rectangle. For example, the first ring is the outermost border. Then the next ring is inside that, but how?\n\nThe formal definition says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, so for each ring, we take a rectangle that's smaller by 4*(i-1) in both dimensions. But how does that translate into the number of cells in the ring?\n\nWait, the ring is the perimeter of that inner rectangle. Because the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because for example, a rectangle of 3x3 has perimeter 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice) → wait, no. Wait, the perimeter in terms of cells would be the number of cells in the border. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H) - 4. Because each side has W or H cells, but the four corners are counted twice. So subtracting 4. For example, 3x3: 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which matches the first example input where output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i, we compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w' × h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for the i-th ring. But wait, the first ring is when i=1. So for i=1, the rectangle is w × h. Then the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. Then for i=2, it's 2*( (w-4*(2-1)) + (h-4*(2-1)) ) -4. Which simplifies to 2*( (w -4) + (h -4) ) -4. But wait, that's for the second ring. But each ring is added inwards. But how do we make sure that the rings are valid? Like, for example, if the original dimensions are 7x9, and k is 2. Let's check the third example input: 7 9 2. The output is 40. Let's see.\n\nFirst ring: perimeter of 7x9. 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Then second ring: the rectangle is (7 - 4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. So total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the third example. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is to compute for each i from 1 to k, the perimeter of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch here. For each i, the rectangle must have at least 3 rows and columns? Or maybe not. Because the problem says that k is given such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w,h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) is 1. So k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3, the first ring is the perimeter. If you try to have a second ring, then the rectangle would be 3-4= -1, which is invalid. So the constraints on k ensure that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't need to check that. So the problem says that the input is valid, so we can proceed.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n",
