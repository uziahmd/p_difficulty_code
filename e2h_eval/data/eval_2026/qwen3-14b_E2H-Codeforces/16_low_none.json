Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there are n lines, each line divides the plane into two regions. The arrangement of these lines creates multiple regions (blocks), and each block can be represented by some kind of identifier based on which side of each line it's on.\n\nWait, right. For each line, a block can be on one side or the other. So for each line, we can determine whether a given point is on one side or the other. Since the home and university are not on any line, they are in some block.\n\nSo, the idea is to model each block as a set of signs (for each line, whether the point is positive or negative when evaluated in the line equation). However, with n lines, there are 2^n possible combinations. But that's way too big for n=300. Wait, but n can be up to 300, which makes 2^300 possibilities. That's impossible to handle directly.\n\nBut maybe there's another approach. Since the movement between blocks is allowed when they share a common border. Which would mean that two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one line. Because if two blocks differ by exactly one line, then they are separated by that line, hence their common border is that line's segment. But if they differ by more than one line, then their adjacency might not be possible.\n\nWait, no. Because two regions that are separated by multiple lines might not be adjacent. But how to model adjacency here?\n\nAlternatively, think of each block as a node in a graph. Two nodes are connected if the corresponding blocks are adjacent. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home's block to the university's block.\n\nBut how to represent the blocks and compute their adjacency efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that with n=300, the number of possible blocks is huge. So enumerating all possible blocks isn't feasible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nAnother idea: since each step moves across a line, changing the sign for exactly one line. So, the adjacency between blocks is determined by flipping exactly one line's sign. Therefore, the graph is similar to a hypercube, but with edges between nodes differing in exactly one bit. However, the actual structure depends on the arrangement of lines. But perhaps, we can model the problem as a BFS where each state is the set of signs (for each line, whether the current block is on the positive or negative side of that line).\n\nBut again, with n=300, storing a bitmask of 300 bits is not feasible. However, maybe we can find a way to compute the distance without explicitly representing all possible states.\n\nWait, but the home and university are specific points. Let's think: for each line, we can compute the sign of the home point and the sign of the university point. Then, the problem is to find the minimal number of lines that need to be crossed to go from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration. Because each step crosses a line, which flips the sign of that line.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the two blocks differ in exactly one line. So, the minimal steps would be the number of lines where the home and university have different signs. But that's not correct. Because for example, if two lines cross, then changing the sign of one line may not directly connect to the other. Or maybe the minimal steps is the number of differing lines divided by something?\n\nNo, that's not correct. Because each step can flip one line's sign. So, the minimal steps would be the number of differing lines between the home and university. Because each step can flip one line's sign. But that's only possible if the lines can be flipped in sequence. However, perhaps there's a case where flipping one line's sign changes multiple differences. Wait, no. Because each step flips exactly one line's sign. So, for example, if the home and university differ in k lines, then the minimal steps would be k. But that seems too simplistic. Let's take an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). The roads are x=0 and y=0. So, the home is in the region where x>0 and y>0. The university is in x<0 and y<0. The two regions differ in both lines. So, the minimal steps would be 2. Which matches the sample output. So that's correct.\n\nAnother sample input: the second example. Home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). The roads",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Block Representation**: Each block can be represented by the sign (positive or negative) of the evaluation of each line equation at a given point. For example, if a point lies on one side of a line defined by $a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0$, it will have a positive value, and on the other side, a negative value.\n\n2. **Sign Configuration**: For both the home and university points, compute their sign configuration with respect to each line. This configuration is a list where each element is either `1` (positive) or `-1` (negative) based on the evaluation of the line equation at the respective point.\n\n3. **Determine Differences**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of lines where the sign configurations of the home and university points differ. Each differing line represents a step needed to cross that line and move to an adjacent block.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    \n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute sign configuration for home and university\n    def get_signs(x, y, roads):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            if val > 0:\n                signs.append(1)\n            else:\n                signs.append(-1)\n        return signs\n    \n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1, roads)\n    univ_signs = get_signs(x2, y2, roads)\n    \n    # Count the number of differing signs\n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, univ_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n    \n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home and university points, along with the equations of the roads.\n- **Sign Configuration Calculation**: For each point (home and university), we determine the sign of the result when substituting the coordinates into each road's equation. This gives us a configuration of signs for each road.\n- **Difference Calculation**: The number of differing signs between the home and university configurations directly gives the minimum number of steps required, as each differing sign indicates a road that needs to be crossed to move from one block to another.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of line equations and their evaluations at specific points, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of input constraints.",
