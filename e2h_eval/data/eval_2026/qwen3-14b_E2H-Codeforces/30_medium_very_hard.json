Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize (S1 + S2) is maximized. Both players take turns picking digits from the front of A, and each makes exactly n moves. The challenge is to choose the order of H and M moves so that the sum of their numbers is as large as possible.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this problem. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. The brute-force approach of checking all possible combinations of H and M moves would be O( (2n choose n) ), which for n=18 is way too big. For example, 36 choose 18 is around 9e10, which is impossible to handle directly with brute force.\n\nSo we need a dynamic programming approach here. Let's think about the state transitions. The key here is that at any step, the number of digits left in A is determined by how many moves have been made so far. Also, the state depends on how many moves Homer and Marge have made so far. Because each player must make exactly n moves, the state can be represented by the number of H moves taken (h) and M moves taken (m). Since each move increases either h or m by 1, and the total moves made so far is h + m, which is equal to the number of digits removed from A. \n\nThe initial state is h=0, m=0. The final state is h=n, m=n. At each step, we can choose to take a digit for Homer or Marge, provided that they haven't taken n moves yet.\n\nBut how do we track the maximum total sum? The problem is that the sum depends on the digits collected by each player. However, since the digits are added to their respective numbers, the value of S1 and S2 depends on the order in which digits are taken. For example, taking a digit earlier contributes more to the number's value than later. For instance, if Homer takes a digit '5' first, it's the first digit of his number, contributing 5 * 10^{n-1} to his total. If he takes it later, say as the second digit, it's multiplied by 10^{n-2}, etc.\n\nWait, but the actual value of S1 and S2 is the number formed by the digits they took in the order they were picked. So for each player, the digits they collect are in the order of their moves. So the first digit they take is the most significant digit in their number. So, for example, if Homer takes digits in the order 1, 2, then his number is 12, which is 1*10^1 + 2*10^0.\n\nTherefore, the contribution of each digit to the total sum depends on when it's taken. For example, when a digit is taken as the k-th move of a player (say, Homer), then its contribution is digit * 10^{(n - k)}. Wait, because if Homer has n moves, the first move contributes 10^{n-1}, the second 10^{n-2}, ..., the nth move contributes 10^0.\n\nBut how can we model this in DP? Because for each decision (whether to take H or M next), we need to know how many moves each has made so far. Let's think: the current state is (h, m), where h is the number of moves Homer has made, m is the number of moves Marge has made. Then, the next move can be H (if h < n) or M (if m < n). \n\nAt each state, we can decide which move to take, and compute the maximum possible total sum. But how do we calculate the contribution of the current digit to the total?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we are at state (h, m). The current A has (2n - (h + m)) digits remaining. The next digit to be taken is the first digit of the current A. Let's call this digit d. If we choose to take it for Homer, then this digit will be the (h+1)-th digit in his number. Therefore, the contribution of this digit to the total sum is d * 10^{n - (h+1)}. Similarly, if it's taken by Marge, the contribution is d * 10^{n - (m+1)}.\n\nBut wait, the total sum is S1 + S2. So each digit contributes to either S1 or S2, depending on who takes it. So the DP state needs to track the current state (h, m) and the maximum total sum achievable from that state onward. \n\nSo the DP recurrence would be something like:\n\ndp[h][m] = max( (take H: d * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp[h+1][m]), (take M: d * 10^{n - m -1} + dp[h][m+1]) )\n\nBut how do we compute this? The base case is when h = n and m = n, which returns 0.\n\nBut the problem is that for n=18, the number of states is (n+1)*(n+1) = 19*19 = 361. Which is manageable. However, for each state, we need to know the current digit that is being considered. Wait, no. Because the state (h, m) corresponds to the number of moves already made. So the number of digits already taken is h + m. Therefore, the current A is the original A with the first (h + m) digits removed. So the next digit to be taken is the (h + m + 1)-th digit of the original A.\n\nSo for example, if the original A is \"1234\" (n=2), then when h=0, m=0, the next digit is the first digit (1). When h=1, m=0, the next digit is the second digit (2), etc.\n\nSo, given the original string A, for a state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m].\n\nSo the DP approach can be memoized with the state (h, m), and for each state, compute the maximum total sum possible from that state onwards, and also track the choices made (H or M) to reconstruct the path.\n\nBut the problem is that for each state, the choice between H and M depends on which option gives a higher total sum. However, since the digits are fixed, the DP can be computed recursively with memoization.\n\nBut how do we compute the value of the digit when choosing H or M? Let's think again. For each state (h, m), the next digit is A[h + m], as explained. If we choose H, then this digit is added to Homer's number as his (h+1)th digit. The contribution to the total sum is digit * 10^{n - (h + 1)}.\n\nSimilarly for M: digit * 10^{n - (m + 1)}.\n\nSo, for the DP, the transition is:\n\nIf we take H (possible if h < n):\n\ncurrent_contribution = digit * pow(10, n - h - 1)\n\nThen add to the result of dp[h+1][m]\n\nSame for taking M.\n\nSo the DP function would be:\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    if h + m == 2n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    if memo has (h, m):\n\n        return memo[(h, m)]\n\n    current_digit = A[h + m]\n\n    option1 = option2 = -infinity\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        contribution = current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1}\n\n        option1 = contribution + dp(h+1, m)\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        contribution = current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1}\n\n        option2 = contribution + dp(h, m+1)\n\n    memo[(h, m)] = max(option1, option2)\n\n    return memo[(h, m)]\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for n=18, the exponent 10^{n - h - 1} can be very large. For example, when h is 0, the exponent is 10^{17}, which is a very big number. However, since Python handles big integers, maybe that's okay. But for memoization, perhaps we can precompute these exponents.\n\nBut even better, since the exponents are the same for certain positions, we can precompute them. Let's think: for each position in the sequence of moves, when the digit is taken as the k-th move for Homer (where k ranges from 1 to n), the exponent is 10^{n -k}. Similarly for Marge.\n\nBut during the DP steps, for each state (h, m), when we take H, the current digit is the (h+1)th move for Homer. So the exponent is 10^{n - (h+1)}. Similarly for M.\n\nSo, to compute the contribution, we need to calculate 10^{n - h - 1} for H and 10^{n - m -1} for M.\n\nBut for n up to 18, the maximum exponent is 10^17. That's manageable in Python, but calculating them on the fly might be slow. So precomputing a power table for 10^i up to 18 would be better.\n\nSo, precompute pow10[i] = 10^i. Then, for a given h and m, the exponents can be retrieved quickly.\n\nBut wait, for example, when h is 0, the exponent is 10^(n - 0 -1) = 10^{n-1}.\n\nSo, precompute pow10 up to 18 digits. For example, for n up to 18, the maximum exponent needed is 10^17 (for when h is 0 and n=18, then 10^{18 - 0 -1} = 10^17).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute pow10 array up to 18 elements (since n can be 18, and exponents can be up to 17).\n\nNow, the DP approach seems feasible. But since the state space is small (n up to 18, so 19*19=361 states), even with memoization, it's manageable.\n\nBut how to handle the path reconstruction? Because for each state, we need to know whether choosing H or M gives the maximum value. So, during the DP computation, we need to track not only the maximum value but also the choice made (H or M) at each state. Then, once the DP is filled, we can start from (0, 0) and follow the choices to build the string.\n\nBut for memoization, perhaps we can use memoization with a cache, and during the DP steps, store the best choice for each state.\n\nSo, the steps for the code would be:\n\n1. Read n and the string A.\n\n2. Precompute the pow10 array. For example, pow10[k] = 10^k. But for exponents up to n-1, since the maximum exponent needed is when h is 0, and n is 18, then 10^(n - h -1) is 10^(18 - 0 -1) = 10^17. So pow10 should be precomputed up to 17, which is 18 elements (from 0 to 17).\n\nWait, pow10[exponent] = 10^exponent. So for exponents from 0 to 17, we can precompute that.\n\nBut how to compute that? Well, pow10[0] = 1, pow10[1] = 10, etc.\n\nOnce that's done, the DP can proceed.\n\nNow, for the DP function, since Python's recursion may not be efficient enough for memoization (but with n=18, it's manageable), perhaps we can implement memoization using memo tables (like a dictionary or a 2D array). However, since the state is (h, m), and h and m can be up to n (which is 18), we can use a memo table as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1).\n\nBut for Python, recursion may not be the best approach. Maybe an iterative DP approach is better, filling the table in reverse order.\n\nLet me think about the DP transitions. The DP state (h, m) depends on (h+1, m) and (h, m+1). So, we can compute the DP table starting from the end (h = n, m = n) and moving backward.\n\nSo, for h from n downto 0, and m from n downto 0.\n\nBut for each state (h, m), the total moves made so far is h + m. The next digit is A[h + m]. But when h + m is equal to 2n, then we have no more digits. But since h and m can't exceed n, the maximum h + m is 2n (when h = n and m = n). So, the base case is when h + m == 2n, which is when h = n and m = n.\n\nSo for the DP table, the value dp[h][m] represents the maximum total sum that can be achieved from the state (h, m) onwards.\n\nSo the iterative approach would be:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1).\n\nFor h from n downto 0:\n\n    for m from n downto 0:\n\n        if h + m == 2n:\n\n            dp[h][m] = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            current_digit = A[h + m]\n\n            option_h = ?\n\n            option_m = ?\n\n            if h < n:\n\n                exponent = n - h - 1\n\n                contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n                option_h = contribution + dp[h+1][m]\n\n            else:\n\n                option_h = -infinity\n\n            if m < n:\n\n                exponent = n - m - 1\n\n                contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n                option_m = contribution + dp[h][m+1]\n\n            else:\n\n                option_m = -infinity\n\n            dp[h][m] = max(option_h, option_m)\n\nBut wait, the current_digit is the (h + m)th character in A. Wait, the original A is a string of 2n digits. The first digit is index 0, then 1, etc. So, when h + m digits have been taken, the next digit is at index h + m.\n\nYes. For example, if h=0, m=0, then the next digit is index 0. After taking it, h becomes 1, m remains 0, and the next digit is index 1, etc.\n\nSo, for each state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m].\n\nBut we need to make sure that h + m is less than 2n. Which is true except when h = n and m = n.\n\nSo, the DP can be filled in this way.\n\nOnce the DP table is filled, we can reconstruct the path by starting at (0, 0) and choosing at each step whether to take H or M, based on which option gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to track which choice was made for each state? Because during the DP calculation, we can track for each (h, m) whether choosing H or M gives the maximum value. So, during the DP filling, we can create another table called 'choice', which for each (h, m) stores 'H' or 'M' indicating which choice was taken.\n\nSo, during the filling of the dp table, for each state (h, m), after computing option_h and option_m, we compare them and set the choice accordingly.\n\nOnce the choice table is built, we can start from (0, 0) and for each step, append the choice (H or M) to the result string, then increment h or m accordingly.\n\nNow, the problem is how to handle the cases where both options are equal. The problem says that if there are multiple solutions, output any of them. So, in such cases, we can choose either option. For example, if option_h equals option_m, we can choose H or M, whichever is easier. But for the purposes of the code, we can choose the one that comes first (like prefer H over M, or vice versa) to get a consistent answer.\n\nBut the problem says that any correct solution is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nFirst, read n and A.\n\nThen, precompute pow10. For exponents from 0 to n-1 (since when h is 0, the exponent is n - 0 -1 = n-1, which for n=18 is 17). So pow10 needs to be precomputed up to exponent 17.\n\nBut how to compute that? For example, pow10[0] = 1, pow10[1] = 10, ..., pow10[k] = 10^k.\n\nIn Python, we can compute this with a list comprehension.\n\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(0, n)] ?\n\nWait, no. For n up to 18, the maximum exponent is n - 1 (for h = 0). So, for example, when n is 18, the maximum exponent is 17. So pow10 needs to have entries for exponents 0 to 17. So the pow10 list can be generated as [10**i for i in range(0, n)] ?\n\nWait, for n=18, the exponents go up to 17, which is n-1. So yes, the pow10 list can be generated with len n elements, from 0 to n-1. Wait, no. The exponents can be up to n - 1. For example, when h is 0, the exponent is n - 0 -1 = n-1. So pow10 needs to have 10^(n-1). So the pow10 list should be generated for exponents up to (n-1). So for exponents from 0 to (n-1), which is a total of n elements. So the list can be generated as [10**i for i in range(n)].\n\nBut for example, for n=2, the exponents needed are 0, 1 (since for h=0, exponent is 2-0-1=1; for h=1, exponent is 2-1-1=0).\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the pow10 list can be precomputed as follows.\n\nOnce that is done, the DP table can be filled.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nImplementing the DP as a 2D array. Since n can be up to 18, the array is 19x19.\n\nBut in Python, for a 2D array, we can use a list of lists. For example, dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)].\n\nThen, for h in range(n, -1, -1):\n\n    for m in range(n, -1, -1):\n\n        if h + m == 2n:\n\n            dp[h][m] = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            ... compute the options ...\n\nBut wait, for h and m, the maximum possible value is n. So the loop would be for h from n downto 0, and for m from n downto 0. However, when h + m exceeds 2n, but since h and m are each up to n, the maximum h + m is 2n (when h = n and m = n). So for all h and m in the loops, h + m can be up to 2n.\n\nBut when h and m are such that h + m is less than 2n, then the next digit exists.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead n, then A.\n\nCompute pow10 as [10**i for i in range(n)].\n\nWait, but for exponents like n - h - 1. For example, if h is 0, then exponent is n - 0 -1 = n-1. Which is the maximum exponent. So pow10 needs to have up to 10^{n-1}.\n\nBut the pow10 list is of length n. For example, pow10[i] is 10^i. So for exponent e = n - h -1, which can be from 0 to n-1 (since h can be from 0 to n-1).\n\nYes. So the pow10 list is correctly generated.\n\nBut in Python, 10**i can be very big, but for n=18, 10^17 is manageable as an integer.\n\nOnce the pow10 is generated, then proceed to fill the DP table.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1).\n\nSimilarly, a choice table (or a 2D array) to track which choice was made.\n\nThen, for h in reversed(range(n+1)):\n\n    for m in reversed(range(n+1)):\n\n        if h + m == 2*n:\n\n            dp[h][m] = 0\n\n            choice[h][m] = ''  # or some dummy value\n\n        else:\n\n            current_digit = int(A[h + m])\n\n            option_h = -infinity\n\n            if h < n:\n\n                exponent = n - h - 1\n\n                contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n                option_h = contribution + dp[h+1][m]\n\n            option_m = -infinity\n\n            if m < n:\n\n                exponent = n - m - 1\n\n                contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n                option_m = contribution + dp[h][m+1]\n\n            if option_h > option_m:\n\n                dp[h][m] = option_h\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'H'\n\n            elif option_m > option_h:\n\n                dp[h][m] = option_m\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'M'\n\n            else:\n\n                # choose either H or M. Let's say prefer H.\n\n                dp[h][m] = option_h\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'H'\n\nBut wait, when both options are equal, the code can choose either. However, the choice made here affects the path reconstruction. For example, if there are multiple optimal paths, the choice of H or M here will determine which path is taken. But the problem allows any of them.\n\nOnce the DP and choice tables are filled, we can reconstruct the path.\n\nReconstruction:\n\nStart with h=0, m=0. The total steps is 2n steps. For each step, we look at choice[h][m], append the character, then increment h or m accordingly.\n\nSo, the code for reconstruction:\n\nresult = []\n\nh = 0\n\nm = 0\n\nfor _ in range(2*n):\n\n    c = choice[h][m]\n\n    result.append(c)\n\n    if c == 'H':\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        m += 1\n\nreturn ''.join(result)\n\nBut how to handle the choice table? The choice table is filled for all (h, m) except when h + m == 2n. But during the loop, when h and m reach n, the loop stops.\n\nNow, the code seems manageable.\n\nBut what about the pow10 list? For example, when n=2, pow10 is [1, 10]. For exponents:\n\nIf n=2, and h=0, exponent is 2 - 0 -1 = 1. pow10[1] is 10^1 = 10. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\nSo the digits are [1,2,3,4].\n\nThe optimal output is 'HHMM'.\n\nLet's see what the code would compute.\n\nLet me try to simulate the DP steps for this example.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think of the choices. For example, the first move is to take H or M.\n\nBut the code should choose the option that leads to the maximum total sum.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nThe pow10 for n=2 is [1, 10].\n\nLet me think about the DP table.\n\nWe need to fill the dp table for h from 2 down to 0, and m from 2 down to 0.\n\nLet's consider the base case: h=2, m=2. dp[2][2] = 0.\n\nNow, for h=2, m=1: h + m = 3 < 4. current_digit is A[3] = 4. But h=2 (max n=2), so can't take H. So only option is M.\n\nexponent for M is n - m -1 = 2 - 1 -1 = 0. contribution is 4 * 1 = 4. dp[2][1] = 4 + dp[2][2] = 4 + 0 = 4. choice is 'M'.\n\nSimilarly, for h=1, m=2: same logic, current digit is A[3] = 4. can't take M (since m=2). So take H. exponent is 2 -1 -1 = 0. contribution 4 * 1 =4. dp[1][2] = 4 + dp[2][2] =4.\n\nFor h=2, m=0: h + m = 2. current digit is A[2] = 3. h is 2 (can't take H). So must take M. exponent is 2 -0 -1 = 1. contribution is 3 * 10^1 = 30. dp[2][0] = 30 + dp[2][1] (which is 4) = 34.\n\nSimilarly, for h=0, m=2: same logic. current digit is A[2] = 3. take H. exponent is 2 -0 -1 =1. 3*10 = 30. dp[0][2] = 30 + dp[1][2] (which is 4) = 34.\n\nNow, let's look at h=1, m=1. current digit is A[2] =3. Possible options: take H or M.\n\nIf take H: exponent is 2 -1 -1 = 0. contribution 3 * 1 =3. Then dp[2][1] is 4. So total is 3 +4=7.\n\nIf take M: exponent is 2 -1 -1 =0. contribution 3 *1 =3. Then dp[1][2] is 4. So total is 3 +4=7. So both options are same. So code would choose 'H'.\n\nSo choice for (1,1) is 'H'.\n\nBut this is just one part of the DP.\n\nBut in the end, the code would generate the optimal path. For the sample input, the correct output is HHMM. Let's see if the code would generate that.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct. Now, the code's main steps are:\n\n- Precompute pow10.\n\n- Fill the DP table with the maximum values.\n\n- Reconstruct the path using the choice table.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python.\n\nBut there's one thing to note: the pow10 array. For example, when n=2, the pow10 is [1, 10], which is 10^0 and 10^1. For exponents up to n-1=1.\n\nAnother thing: the A string is given as input. For example, in the first sample input, A is '1234', so the digits are 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nNow, the code for the DP.\n\nBut in Python, when you have a 2D array, you can use nested loops.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nPotential code steps:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead A from input.\n\nprecompute pow10 as [10**i for i in range(n)].\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D list of (n+1) x (n+1) zeros.\n\nInitialize choice as a 2D list of (n+1) x (n+1) strings.\n\nThen, for h in reversed(range(n+1)):\n\n    for m in reversed(range(n+1)):\n\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n\n            dp[h][m] = 0\n\n            choice[h][m] = ''\n\n        else:\n\n            current_digit = int(A[h + m])\n\n            option_h = -infinity\n\n            if h < n:\n\n                exponent = n - h - 1\n\n                contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n                option_h = contribution + dp[h+1][m]\n\n            option_m = -infinity\n\n            if m < n:\n\n                exponent = n - m - 1\n\n                contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n                option_m = contribution + dp[h][m+1]\n\n            if option_h > option_m:\n\n                dp[h][m] = option_h\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'H'\n\n            elif option_m > option_h:\n\n                dp[h][m] = option_m\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'M'\n\n            else:\n\n                # choose H or M. Let's choose H.\n\n                dp[h][m] = option_h\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'H'\n\nOnce that is done, reconstruct the path.\n\nBut in Python, for reversed(range(n+1)), the code would be:\n\nfor h in range(n, -1, -1):\n\n    for m in range(n, -1, -1):\n\nBut in Python, range(n, -1, -1) would go from n down to 0.\n\nBut for h and m, we need to process them in reverse order.\n\nNow, for the code, the pow10 list is [10^0, 10^1, ..., 10^{n-1}].\n\nBut when n is 18, pow10[exponent] can be 10^17, which is a very big number. However, Python can handle big integers.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: n=2, A=1234.\n\nThe pow10 list is [1, 10].\n\nNow, for the DP steps:\n\nLet me think of the steps for h=0, m=0.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to code and test, but for the purpose of writing the code, proceed.\n\nNow, the code for the choice table.\n\nOnce the choice table is filled, the path is reconstructed by starting at h=0, m=0, and appending choice[h][m], then incrementing h or m.\n\nNow, the code for reconstruction.\n\nOnce that is done, the code outputs the string.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\n- All digits are 0. The output can be any sequence of H and M, since the sum is 0.\n\n- n=1, A is two digits, e.g., '12'. The optimal choice is to take H first, then M. Or M first then H? Which gives higher sum?\n\nFor example, if A is '12', n=1.\n\nIf the sequence is HM: H takes 1, M takes 2. S1 is 1, S2 is 2. Total 3.\n\nIf the sequence is MH: M takes 1, H takes 2. S1 is 2, S2 is 1. Total is 3. So both are same. The code can choose either. So the code's choice would depend on which option is chosen when options are equal. In our code, when options are equal, we choose H.\n\nIn this case, when h=0, m=0, the current digit is 1. option_h is 1 * 10^(1 - 0 -1) = 1 * 10^0 = 1. Then, dp[1][0] is the value when h=1, m=0. At that point, h + m = 1, so next digit is A[1] = 2. Since h is 1 (equal to n=1), can't take H. So must take M. contribution is 2 * 10^(1 - 0 -1) = 2 * 1 = 2. So total for option H is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\noption_m: when taking M first. contribution is 1 * 10^(1 - 0 -1) = 1. Then dp[0][1], which is when h=0, m=1. Next digit is A[1] = 2. Take H. contribution is 2 * 10^(1 - 0 -1) = 2 * 1 = 2. So total is 1 + 2 = 3. So both options are equal. So code chooses H, so the sequence is HM. But according to the code's choice, the choice for (0,0) is H, leading to HM. Which is correct.\n\nBut the code's choice would generate HM. However, the other option is also valid.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. Let's proceed.\n\nBut for the pow10 list, when n is 0? Well, n starts from 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input. Then read A.\n\nBut in the input, the first line is n, the second line is A. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n\nThen, initialize dp as a 2D list of (n+1) x (n+1) elements.\n\nBut in Python, initializing a 2D list can be done with:\n\ndp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nchoice = [['']* (n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nThen, for h in range(n, -1, -1):\n\n    for m in range(n, -1, -1):\n\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n\n            dp[h][m] = 0\n\n            choice[h][m] = ''\n\n        else:\n\n            current_digit = int(A[h + m])\n\n            option_h = -float('inf')\n\n            if h < n:\n\n                exponent = n - h - 1\n\n                contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n                option_h = contribution + dp[h+1][m]\n\n            option_m = -float('inf')\n\n            if m < n:\n\n                exponent = n - m - 1\n\n                contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n                option_m = contribution + dp[h][m+1]\n\n            if option_h > option_m:\n\n                dp[h][m] = option_h\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'H'\n\n            elif option_m > option_h:\n\n                dp[h][m] = option_m\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'M'\n\n            else:\n\n                # choose H\n\n                dp[h][m] = option_h\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'H'\n\nBut wait, when h and m are such that h + m is less than 2n, but h or m is already n. For example, when h =n, then only m can be incremented.\n\nOnce the dp and choice tables are filled, then reconstruct the path.\n\nh = 0\n\nm = 0\n\nresult = []\n\nfor _ in range(2 * n):\n\n    c = choice[h][m]\n\n    result.append(c)\n\n    if c == 'H':\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        m += 1\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n\nBut wait, in the code above, for the choice table, when h and m are such that h + m is 2n, but that's handled in the base case. So during the loop, the code will not reach that state except when h =n and m =n, which is the end of the loop.\n\nBut during the reconstruction, the loop runs exactly 2n times, and for each step, the choice is made.\n\nBut in the code, when h and m are such that h + m = 2n -1, then the next step is to take the last digit.\n\nBut during the reconstruction, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing this code with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\npow10 = [1, 10]\n\nThe code should generate 'HHMM' as the output.\n\nBut let's see. Let's imagine the code's choice table.\n\nBut perhaps the code works correctly.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n9911\n\nOutput: HMHM.\n\nLet's see.\n\nBut perhaps the code can handle that.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat if the pow10 list is not long enough? For example, when n=18, and exponent is n - h -1. For example, when h=0, exponent is 17. pow10 is [10^0, 10^1, ..., 10^17], which is correct.\n\nYes, because pow10 is generated as [10**i for i in range",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize (the sum of their respective numbers) is maximized. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) to efficiently explore all possible move sequences while keeping track of the maximum possible total prize.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a 2D DP table where `dp[h][m]` represents the maximum total prize achievable from the state where Homer has made `h` moves and Marge has made `m` moves.\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: Since each digit's contribution to the total prize depends on its position (most significant digit contributes more), precompute powers of 10 up to `n-1` to quickly calculate contributions.\n3. **State Transitions**: For each state `(h, m)`, decide whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit based on which choice leads to a higher total prize. This decision is stored in a `choice` table to reconstruct the optimal sequence later.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: After filling the DP table, use the `choice` table to trace back from the initial state `(0, 0)` to the final state `(n, n)` to build the optimal sequence of moves.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n    \n    # Initialize DP table and choice table\n    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    choice = [['' for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]\n    \n    for h in range(n, -1, -1):\n        for m in range(n, -1, -1):\n            if h + m == 2 * n:\n                dp[h][m] = 0\n                choice[h][m] = ''\n            else:\n                current_digit = int(A[h + m])\n                option_h = -float('inf')\n                if h < n:\n                    exponent = n - h - 1\n                    contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n                    option_h = contribution + dp[h+1][m]\n                option_m = -float('inf')\n                if m < n:\n                    exponent = n - m - 1\n                    contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n                    option_m = contribution + dp[h][m+1]\n                \n                if option_h > option_m:\n                    dp[h][m] = option_h\n                    choice[h][m] = 'H'\n                elif option_m > option_h:\n                    dp[h][m] = option_m\n                    choice[h][m] = 'M'\n                else:\n                    # Prefer H in case of tie\n                    dp[h][m] = option_h\n                    choice[h][m] = 'H'\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    result = []\n    for _ in range(2 * n):\n        c = choice[h][m]\n        result.append(c)\n        if c == 'H':\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            m += 1\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of length `2n`.\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: This helps in quickly calculating the contribution of each digit based on its position in the number formed by Homer or Marge.\n3. **DP Table Initialization**: The DP table is filled in reverse order (from the end state back to the start state) to ensure that each state's value is computed based on subsequent states.\n4. **Choice Table**: This table keeps track of whether Homer (`H`) or Marge (`M`) should take the next digit at each state to maximize the total prize.\n5. **Path Reconstruction**: Starting from the initial state `(0, 0)`, the optimal sequence of moves is constructed using the `choice` table.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible move sequences using dynamic programming, leading to an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n²), which is feasible even for the upper constraint of `n = 18`.",
