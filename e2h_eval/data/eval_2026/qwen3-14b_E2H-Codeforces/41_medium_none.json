There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about building houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is a^2 where a is its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit under these constraints.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this? Since n, h, m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible. But even with n=50 and h=50, trying all possibilities would be 50^50 possibilities, which is way too big. So brute-force is impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to model this as an optimization problem with constraints. The constraints are that for each restriction, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. And we want to maximize the sum of squares of the heights.\n\nAnother thought: For each position, the maximum allowed height is determined by the restrictions that apply to it. But since a restriction applies to a range, the maximum height of any house in that range can't exceed x_i. However, the restrictions might conflict. For example, if one restriction says that in [1,3], the max is 2, and another says that [2,2] can be up to 3. Then the first restriction would override the second for the [2,2] range, because the max in [1,3] must be <=2, so the house at 2 can't be higher than 2.\n\nSo the problem is to assign heights to each house such that for every restriction, the maximum in its interval is <= x_i. And maximize the sum of squares.\n\nHow can I model this?\n\nOne approach is to find for each position, the minimum maximum allowed height. For example, if a house is part of multiple restrictions, the maximum allowed height for that house is the minimum of all the x_i from restrictions that cover it. Wait, no. Because a restriction applies to a range. For example, if a restriction says that in [1,3], the max is 2, then each house in that range can't be higher than 2. But if another restriction says that in [2,2], the max is 3, then the first restriction is more restrictive. So for the house at position 2, the maximum allowed is 2, because the first restriction applies.\n\nSo, for each position i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i from restrictions where the interval [l_i, r_i] includes i. But wait, not exactly. Because a restriction applies to a range. For example, suppose there's a restriction on [1,2] with x=3, and another on [2,3] with x=2. Then for position 2, the maximum allowed is 2 (since the second restriction applies to [2,3], so the max in that range must be <=2. Therefore, the house at 2 can't be higher than 2. But for position 1, the restriction [1,2] allows up to 3, but there's no other restriction on it. So the maximum allowed is 3.\n\nBut how do I find, for each position, the maximum possible height that it can have, given all the restrictions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each position i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover i in their interval. But that's not correct. Because a restriction may not directly cover i, but if there's a restriction on a larger interval that includes i, then that restriction may impose a limit on i's height. For example, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then each of the positions 1,2,3 can't have a height higher than 2. So for each position, the maximum allowed is the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include that position in their interval. Because any restriction that covers that position requires that the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. Therefore, the house at position i can't be higher than x_i for any restriction that includes i in its interval. So the maximum possible height for position i is the minimum of all x_i from restrictions that include i in their interval. However, there's also the global maximum h. So the actual maximum for each position is min( h, min of x_i from restrictions that include it )\n\nWait, but this seems incorrect. Because suppose there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, and another restriction on [1,1] with x=3. Then the first restriction says that the maximum in [1,3] is 2. Therefore, the house at 1 can't be higher than 2. Even though there is a restriction on [1,1] that allows up to 3. So the restriction on [1,3] overrides that. So the maximum for position 1 is 2.\n\nSo for each position, the maximum allowed is the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include that position in their interval. Because for any restriction that includes that position, the maximum in that interval can't exceed x_i. Therefore, the house at that position can't exceed x_i. So the maximum allowed for that position is the minimum of all x_i from restrictions that cover it. However, if there are no restrictions covering it, then the maximum is h.\n\nSo if I can compute for each position i, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include i in their interval. Then, the optimal solution is to set each house to that maximum allowed value. Because the square function is increasing, so higher values are better. But is this correct?\n\nWait, but what if there are overlapping restrictions. Let's take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3 3\n1 1 1\n2 2 3\n3 3 2\n\nEach position is covered by exactly one restriction. So for position 1, the max is 1. Position 2, 3. Position 3, 2. So the heights are [1,3,2], which gives sum 1+9+4=14. Which matches the sample output. So that seems to work.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is:\n\n4 10 2\n2 3 8\n3 4 7\n\nSo for position 1, no restrictions. So max is 10.\n\nPosition 2: covered by the first restriction (x=8). Also, the second restriction applies to positions 3-4. So for position 2, the max is 8. For position 3, covered by both restrictions. The first restriction has x=8, the second x=7. So the minimum is 7. So position 3 can be up to 7. Position 4 is covered by the second restriction, so up to 7. So the heights would be [10,8,7,7], which gives 100 + 64 +49 +49 = 262. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for the samples. But is this approach correct in general?\n\nWait, let's think of a case where this approach may not work. Suppose there are two restrictions. For example, n=2, h=5, m=2.\n\nRestriction 1: l=1, r=2, x=3.\n\nRestriction 2: l=1, r=1, x=4.\n\nSo according to our approach, for position 1, the minimum of x_i from restrictions covering it. Restriction 1 and 2. The x_i are 3 and 4. So the minimum is 3. So position 1 can be 3. Position 2 is covered by restriction 1, so x=3. So the maximum heights are [3,3]. Sum is 18.\n\nBut what if the restriction 2 was l=1, r=1, x=2. Then the approach would say that position 1 can be 2 (minimum of 2 and 3). But the restriction 1 says that the max in [1,2] must be <=3. So if position 1 is 2, and position 2 is 3, that's allowed. So the sum is 2² +3²= 4+9=13. But if the approach allowed position 1 to be 3, but that would require that the restriction 2 (which says that the max in [1,1] is <=2) is violated. So the approach is correct here.\n\nBut in this case, the approach correctly takes the minimum of all x_i that apply to the position. Because the restriction 2 says that the max in [1,1] must be <=2. So the position 1 can't be higher than 2. Therefore, the approach is correct.\n\nSo the approach is: for each position i, compute the maximum allowed height as the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include i in their interval. Then, set each house to that maximum allowed value. Then, the sum of squares is the answer.\n\nBut wait, why is this correct? Because for any restriction [l_i, r_i], the maximum in that interval is the maximum of the allowed heights of the positions in that interval. Since each position in that interval is allowed to be at most x_i (because that restriction is part of the ones that affect them), then the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. So all restrictions are satisfied.\n\nYes. Because for each restriction, all positions in [l_i, r_i] have their maximum allowed height as min(x_i, ...). So the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. Because for each position in the interval, their allowed height is <= x_i. So the maximum of them is <=x_i.\n\nTherefore, this approach will satisfy all the restrictions. And since each position is set to the maximum possible allowed value, the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each position i, compute the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover i. Then, the maximum allowed for i is min( h, that minimum ). Then, sum the squares of those values.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no restrictions that cover a position? Then the allowed maximum is h.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each position i (from 1 to n), collect all restrictions that include i in their [l_i, r_i] interval.\n\n- For each such restriction, take x_i. Find the minimum x_i among them. Let's call this min_x[i].\n\n- Then, the maximum allowed height for position i is min( h, min_x[i] ), if there are any restrictions. If there are no restrictions that include i, then it's h.\n\nOnce we compute this for all positions, sum their squares.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's think about code steps.\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen read m restrictions. For each restriction, l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nFor each position i in 1..n:\n\n   collect all x_i from restrictions where l_i <= i <= r_i.\n\n   min_x = min of these x_i (if any)\n\n   allowed[i] = min( h, min_x ) if there are any restrictions. Else, h.\n\nBut wait, if there are no restrictions that include i, then allowed[i] is h.\n\nOnce allowed array is computed, sum the squares.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input 1, the allowed array is [1,3,2], which is correct.\n\nIn the second sample, allowed array is [10, 8, 7, 7], which is correct.\n\nBut what about overlapping restrictions?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose n=2, h=5, m=1. Restriction is [1,2], x=3. Then allowed for positions 1 and 2 is 3. So sum is 3^2 +3^2= 18.\n\nAnother example: n=2, h=5, m=2. Restriction 1: [1,1], x=4. Restriction 2: [2,2], x=5. Then allowed for position 1 is 4, position 2 is 5. Sum is 16 +25=41.\n\nAnother example: n=2, h=5, m=2. Restriction 1: [1,2], x=3. Restriction 2: [1,1], x=4. Then for position 1, the restrictions that include it are both. The x's are 3 and 4. The minimum is 3. So allowed is 3. For position 2, only restriction 1 applies, so 3. Sum is 3^2 +3^2= 18.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is correct. Thus, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, for each position i in 1..n:\n\nInitialize min_x for i as h (if there are no restrictions that cover it, then allowed is h).\n\nBut for each restriction, check if i is in [l_i, r_i]. For each such restriction, collect the x_i, and find the minimum among them.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent_min = h (default, if no restrictions apply)\n\nfor each restriction in the list:\n\n   if l_i <= i <= r_i:\n\n      current_min = min(current_min, x_i)\n\nallowed[i] = current_min\n\nWait, but for the case where there are no restrictions that cover i, current_min remains h. So yes.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nrestrictions = list of m tuples (l_i, r_i, x_i)\n\nallowed = [0] * n\n\nfor i in 1..n:\n\n   current_min = h\n\n   for each restriction in restrictions:\n\n      l, r, x = restriction\n\n      if l <= i <= r:\n\n          if x < current_min:\n\n              current_min = x\n\n   allowed[i-1] = current_min\n\nthen sum the squares of allowed.\n\nWait, but in Python, indexes are 0-based. So for i in 1..n, the positions are 1-based.\n\nSo for example, for i from 1 to n:\n\nallowed[i-1] = current_min.\n\nThen sum [a^2 for a in allowed]\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code. Let's test this against the samples.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nrestrictions are:\n\n(1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2).\n\nFor i=1:\n\ncheck each restriction. The first restriction applies. So current_min is 1. Others don't apply. So allowed[0] =1.\n\ni=2: check restrictions. Second restriction applies (x=3). current_min is 3. allowed[1] =3.\n\ni=3: third restriction applies, x=2. allowed[2]=2. sum 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nrestrictions are (2,3,8) and (3,4,7).\n\nFor i=1:\n\nno restrictions apply. current_min is 10. allowed[0] =10.\n\ni=2: check restrictions. first restriction (2<=2<=3: yes. x=8. current_min is 8. second restriction (3<=2? no. So allowed[1] is 8.\n\ni=3: check both restrictions. first restriction (2<=3<=3: yes. x=8. second restriction (3<=3<=4: yes. x=7. current_min is 7. allowed[2] =7.\n\ni=4: check restrictions. second restriction (3<=4<=4: yes. x=7. allowed[3] =7. sum 10^2 +8^2 +7^2 +7^2 = 100+64+49+49= 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when there are multiple restrictions that cover the same position. For example, n=2, m=2, restrictions (1,2,3) and (1,1,2). For position 1, the min is 2. For position 2, the min is 3. So allowed is [2,3]. sum 4+9=13.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, let's code this.\n\nNow, the input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, the problem says that the input is given via stdin. So the code needs to read from stdin.\n\nBut the example shows that the input can be multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then, for the next input, again same structure.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of two examples. For example, the first input is:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nBut in reality, the input is given as multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two examples. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as two separate cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the problem's input format. Wait, looking at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the input is for one test case. However, the sample shows two test cases, but perhaps the actual problem expects to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of two inputs, and the output is a list of two outputs. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per the first line, etc. So perhaps the problem is expecting to process multiple test cases. But the original problem's input format is unclear.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input format is not clear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the first input is:\n\nThe first example's input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nand output is 14.\n\nThe second example's input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\noutput is 262.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. But how?\n\nLooking at the problem's input description again:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must read multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is given as two separate test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn the problem's sample input, the input is given as two separate test cases. For example, the first line is for the first test case, and then the next lines are for the second test case. So the code must read all test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. But the problem statement may not say that. However, the sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output shows two outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input section:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem's sample input:\n\nThe sample input is written as:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nWhich seems like two separate test cases. So the code must process multiple test cases. So the code should read all test cases from the input. But how to read them?\n\nIn programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. For example, the code may have to read until EOF. For example, in the problem's sample input, the code would read two test cases, each with their own n, h, m, etc.\n\nSo the code should read all test cases until there's no more input.\n\nBut how to do that in Python? Well, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups, and process each group as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think.\n\nFor example, for each test case, the first line is n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the code can read all lines, and process them in groups. For example:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. Then, process each test case by taking the first line as n, h, m, then the next m lines as the restrictions. Then, the next line after that is the next test case's first line, and so on.\n\nBut how to do that in Python? Well, the code can read all the input as a list of lines, and process them sequentially.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. Then, process each test case:\n\nInitialize a pointer to 0. While the pointer hasn't reached the end of the lines:\n\n   Read the line at pointer: split into n, h, m.\n\n   Then, read the next m lines for the restrictions.\n\n   Process this test case.\n\n   Increment the pointer by m+1.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case's input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich is 1 + 3 = 4 lines. Then the next test case is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich is 1 + 2 = 3 lines.\n\nSo the code should process each test case accordingly.\n\nBut how to read the input? Well, in Python, the standard way is to read from stdin using sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nptr = 0\n\nwhile ptr < len(lines):\n\n    if not lines[ptr].strip():\n\n        ptr +=1\n\n        continue\n\n    # process a test case\n\n    n, h, m = map(int, lines[ptr].split())\n\n    ptr +=1\n\n    restrictions = []\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        l, r, x = map(int, lines[ptr].split())\n\n        restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\n        ptr +=1\n\n    # process this test case\n\n    # compute allowed array\n\n    allowed = []\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n\n        current_min = h\n\n        for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n            if l <= i <= r:\n\n                if x < current_min:\n\n                    current_min = x\n\n        allowed.append(current_min)\n\n    total = sum( [a*a for a in allowed] )\n\n    print(total)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case's output is 14. Let's see:\n\nallowed for i=1, 2, 3:\n\nallowed[0] = 1, allowed[1] =3, allowed[2]=2. sum 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about if there are multiple test cases?\n\nYes, this code would handle that.\n\nBut what about if the input is given as multiple test cases, each with their own n, h, m, etc.?\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle that.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is \"3 3 3\", then three lines of restrictions, then the next line is \"4 10 2\", then two lines of restrictions. The code would process them correctly.\n\nTesting the second sample:\n\nallowed for i=1: no restrictions, so h=10. i=2: check restrictions. First restriction (2,3,8): 2 is in [2,3], so x=8. current_min is 8. Second restriction (3,4,7): 2 is not in [3,4]. So allowed for i=2 is 8. i=3: check both restrictions. First restriction: 3 is in [2,3], x=8. Second restriction: 3 is in [3,4], x=7. So current_min is 7. i=4: check second restriction, x=7. allowed is 7. So sum is 10^2 + 8^2 +7^2 +7^2 = 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nTest case where there are no restrictions. Then, each position can be set to h. Sum is n * h^2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, h=5, m=1. restriction [1,1, 3]. allowed is 3. sum 9.\n\nAnother case: overlapping restrictions. For example, n=2, m=2. restrictions [1,2, 3], [1,2, 2]. Then for each position, the min x is 2. sum 2^2 + 2^2 = 8.\n\nAnother case: a restriction that covers the entire range. For example, n=3, h=5, m=1. restriction [1,3, 2]. Then allowed for all positions is 2. sum 3*(2^2) = 12.\n\nAnother case: a restriction that is redundant. For example, n=2, m=2. restriction [1,2, 3], and [1,2, 4]. Then the allowed is 3 for both positions.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut note that in the code, for each test case, the code reads the lines properly.\n\nNow, the code must be written to read from stdin and output to stdout. So the code is as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n        line = lines[ptr].strip()\n        if not line:\n            ptr += 1\n            continue\n        n, h, m = map(int, line.split())\n        ptr += 1\n        restrictions = []\n        for _ in range(m):\n            if ptr >= len(lines):\n                break  # should not happen as per problem statement\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[ptr].split())\n            restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n            ptr += 1\n        allowed = []\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            current_min = h\n            for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n                if l <= i <= r:\n                    if x < current_min:\n                        current_min = x\n            allowed.append(current_min)\n        total = sum(a*a for a in allowed)\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if there are empty lines in the input? The code skips them. But according to the problem statement, the input is as described. So probably, the code can assume that there are no empty lines. However, the code handles them just in case.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe code would read the first line as n=3, h=3, m=3. Then read the next 3 lines as restrictions. Then process the allowed array. Output 14. Then, ptr is at 4. Then, process next line (line 4 is '4 10 2') and so on.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=0. Then, allowed is [h], sum h^2.\n\nBut in the code, when m=0, the restrictions list is empty. For each i in 1..n, current_min is h. So correct.\n\nAnother case: m=0. So no restrictions. All allowed is h.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit from building houses on a street with given zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a maximum value h, and each restriction imposes a limit on the tallest house within a specific range. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Restrictions**: Each restriction specifies that the tallest house within a certain range must not exceed a given height. For each house position, we need to determine the minimum height restriction that applies to it.\n2. **Determine Maximum Allowed Heights**: For each house position, the maximum allowed height is the minimum value of all restrictions that cover that position. If no restriction covers a position, the maximum height is simply the global maximum height h.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once we have the maximum allowed height for each position, the profit is calculated as the sum of the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n        line = lines[ptr].strip()\n        if not line:\n            ptr += 1\n            continue\n        n, h, m = map(int, line.split())\n        ptr += 1\n        restrictions = []\n        for _ in range(m):\n            if ptr >= len(lines):\n                break  # should not happen as per problem statement\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[ptr].split())\n            restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n            ptr += 1\n        allowed = []\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            current_min = h\n            for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n                if l <= i <= r:\n                    if x < current_min:\n                        current_min = x\n            allowed.append(current_min)\n        total = sum(a * a for a in allowed)\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing.\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, we read the number of spots (n), maximum height (h), and number of restrictions (m). Then, we read each restriction and store them.\n3. **Determining Maximum Heights**: For each spot from 1 to n, we check all restrictions to find the minimum height restriction that applies to that spot. This minimum height is used as the maximum allowed height for that spot.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: The profit is calculated by summing the squares of the maximum allowed heights for each spot.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the constraints efficiently. The complexity is manageable given the problem constraints (n, h, m ≤ 50), making this approach both effective and efficient.",
