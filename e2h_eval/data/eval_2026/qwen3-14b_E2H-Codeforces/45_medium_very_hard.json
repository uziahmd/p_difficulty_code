There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain rule. The rule says that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, the challenge is to figure out, for a given n (number of players), what's the maximum possible games the winner could have.\n\nLet me think about examples first. For example, when n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, the rule says that when they play, their previous games must differ by no more than one. So when the winner plays the second game, they have 1 game already, and the opponent has 0. That's allowed. So that's why the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play three games? Let's think. Let's say the winner plays three games. That would require that each time, the opponent's number of games is within one. Let's imagine:\n\nFirst, the winner (player 1) plays against player 2. They both have 0 games before, so it's allowed. Then, player 1 has 1 game. Next, he needs to play someone else. Let's say he plays against player 3. Player 3 has 0 games. So the difference is 1, which is allowed. Now, player 1 has 2 games. Now, to play again, he needs an opponent with either 1 or 2 games. But the remaining players are player 4. If he hasn't played yet, he has 0 games. So the difference is 2, which is not allowed. So the winner can't play a third game. Hence, maximum is 2.\n\nBut how do we model this for any n?\n\nHmm. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of games the winner can play, given that each time they play, their opponent's game count is within one of theirs. So the winner's path through the tournament must be such that each opponent in their path has a game count that's either equal to their current count, or one less, or one more. Wait, but since the winner is progressing, each time they play, they have to have a certain number of games.\n\nWait, the winner has to play k games. Each time they play, their opponent must have a number of games that's either equal to the number of games the winner has already played (before this match), or differs by one.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose the winner plays in k games. Let's think about the structure of the tournament.\n\nIn order for the winner to play k games, each of their matches must be against opponents that have a certain number of games. Let's think of the winner's matches as building up a tree. For example, in the first match, the winner has 0 games, and the opponent also has 0. After that, the winner has 1 game. The next match must be against someone who has either 0 or 1 games. Let's say the opponent has 0 games. Then after winning, the winner has 2 games. The next match must be against someone with 1 or 2 games. And so on.\n\nBut how does this relate to the total number of players?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this problem is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for the winner to play k games, the number of players required is something like the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. Wait, let me think. For example, if the winner plays k games, then each time they have to have opponents that are arranged in a way that allows for the maximum steps.\n\nLet me think of the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Let's denote f(k) as the minimal number of players required so that the winner can play k games. Then, the problem becomes: find the maximum k such that f(k) ≤ n.\n\nSo, what is f(k)?\n\nFor k=0, that's impossible, since the winner must play at least one game (if there's at least one other player). Wait, for n=2, the answer is 1. So for k=1, f(1) = 2.\n\nFor k=2, the minimal n is 3. Because, the winner plays two games. First, they play against one player (so 2 players). Then, they need to play another game. The opponent must have 0 or 1 games. So the opponent can be someone who has 0 games (like another player who hasn't played yet). But in that case, the total players would be 3. So f(2)=3.\n\nFor k=3, what's the minimal n? Let's see. To get to 3 games, the winner must have played 2 games already. So the third game must be against someone with 2 or 1 games. Let's think. How can the winner get to that scenario?\n\nSuppose the winner has played 2 games. Let's think of the structure of the tournament. For the third game, the opponent must have either 1 or 2 games. Let's say that the opponent has 1 game. How can that happen?\n\nImagine that the winner's path is such that in the third game, the opponent has already played once. So, for example, the winner's first game is against player A. Then, the winner's second game is against player B. Then, the third game is against player C, who has already played once. How can player C have played once?\n\nThat would require that player C had to win one game before facing the winner. So, for that, there must be another player D that player C defeated. So, in this case, the total players would be 1 (winner) + 1 (A) + 1 (B) + 2 (C and D) = 5? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of players for k=3 is f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. Because, in order for the winner to play their third game, they must have an opponent who has played 1 game (since the winner has played 2 games). That opponent must have come from a subtree where they played 1 game. So, the total players needed is the sum of the players needed for the winner's previous steps and the opponent's steps.\n\nThis seems like the Fibonacci sequence. Let me check:\n\nIf f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2), with base cases f(1) = 2, f(2) = 3. Then:\n\nf(3) = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nf(4) = 5 + 3 = 8.\n\nf(5) = 8 +5 = 13.\n\nSo, for example, for k=3, the minimal n is 5. So, if the input is 5, the answer is 3. If n is 6, then the answer is 3 as well, since 5 <=6 <8.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k such that f(k) ≤n, where f(k) is the Fibonacci sequence starting with f(1)=2, f(2)=3, etc.\n\nWait, let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4. The output is 2. According to the Fibonacci sequence, f(2)=3, f(3)=5. Since 4 is between 3 and 5, the maximum k is 2. Which matches the sample. Similarly, for n=3, output is 2, which is correct. For n=10, the output is 4. Let's see:\n\nf(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, f(4)=8, f(5)=13. So for n=10, the maximum k is 4 (since 8 ≤10 <13). Which matches the sample output of 4. So yes, this seems to fit.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the maximum k where f(k) ≤n, where f(k) is defined as:\n\nf(1) = 2\n\nf(2) = 3\n\nf(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)\n\nSo the approach is to generate this Fibonacci sequence until the value exceeds n, and then take the maximum k where f(k) <=n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to generate these numbers efficiently. Let's think about how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers in a loop, starting from k=1, until the next term exceeds 1e18. Then, for a given n, we can perform a binary search on this list to find the maximum k where f(k) <=n.\n\nBut since the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, the number of terms up to 1e18 is manageable. Let's see:\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence starting from 2,3,5,8,13,21,... Let's see how many terms we need to reach 1e18.\n\nThe 80th Fibonacci number (assuming starting from 1) is around 2.34e16, and the 90th is around 2.88e18. So for the sequence starting with f(1)=2, f(2)=3, etc., the terms will reach 1e18 in about 85 terms. So generating all terms up to 1e18 is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the list of f(k) values, up to the point where they exceed 1e18.\n\n- For a given n, find the largest k such that f(k) <=n.\n\nBut wait, what if n is not exactly a Fibonacci number in this sequence? For example, n=4. The maximum k is 2, since f(3)=5>4.\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the Fibonacci numbers as per the sequence, until the next term exceeds n.\n\nThen, find the maximum k for which f(k) <=n.\n\nBut how to generate the sequence?\n\nInitialize a list, say fibs = [2, 3], then next term is 5, then 8, etc.\n\nBut for n=2, the answer is 1. For n=3, answer is 2. For n=4, answer is 2. For n=5, answer is 3.\n\nSo the code can generate the list of fib numbers, and then for a given n, find the maximum k such that fib[k] <=n.\n\nBut the list is generated as follows:\n\nStart with a list where the first element is 2 (for k=1), second is 3 (k=2), third is 5 (k=3), etc.\n\nSo for example, for n=10, the list would be [2,3,5,8,13]. So the maximum k is 4, since 8<=10 <13.\n\nSo the code can generate the list until the next term exceeds 1e18, then for input n, find the maximum k.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nGenerate the list of Fibonacci numbers as per the sequence.\n\nOnce the list is generated, find the maximum k such that fib[k] <=n.\n\nBut how to generate the list?\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize a list, say fibs = [2, 3].\n\nThen, while the next term is <= 1e18, append it.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, we can generate the list up to the maximum possible term.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nInitialize a list.\n\na = 2 (for k=1)\n\nb = 3 (for k=2)\n\nthen, next term is a + b = 5 (k=3).\n\nThen, the next term is b + 5 = 8 (k=4), etc.\n\nSo, the code can generate the list as follows:\n\nfibs = []\n\na = 2\n\nb = 3\n\nfibs.append(a) # k=1\n\nfibs.append(b) #k=2\n\nthen, while True:\n\nnext_val = a + b\n\nif next_val > 1e18:\n\nbreak\n\nappend to fibs.\n\nthen, a = b, b = next_val.\n\nWait, but for the next step, the next term is a + b, but after appending, the next a and b would be the previous b and next_val.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nInitially, a = 2, b =3.\n\nnext_val = 5. append to fibs. Now, a becomes 3, b becomes 5.\n\nnext_val is 3 +5=8. append. a=5, b=8. etc.\n\nSo the code would generate the list of fib numbers for k=1, 2, 3, etc.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n, we can iterate through the list and find the maximum k where fibs[k-1] <=n.\n\nWait, the index of the list. For example, the list is [2,3,5,8, ...]. The index starts at 0, but for k=1, it's index 0. So for each element in the list, the index is (k-1). So for the list, the maximum k is the index +1.\n\nSo for example, if the list is [2,3,5,8], then for n=8, the maximum k is 4 (since 8 is the fourth element, index 3, so 3+1=4).\n\nSo, the code can generate the list, then find the maximum index where the value is <=n, then return index +1.\n\nBut how to find that index? Well, since the list is sorted in increasing order (since each term is sum of previous two, which are larger than previous terms), we can perform a binary search.\n\nBut for small list size (say, up to 90 elements), even a linear search is acceptable.\n\nSo for example, in code:\n\nOnce the list is generated, loop through the list and find the maximum element that is <=n. Then, the answer is the index +1.\n\nBut for n=1, but according to input constraints, n starts from 2.\n\nWait, the input constraints are n ≥2.\n\nSo, for example, for n=2, the list has 2 as first element, so the answer is 1.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the list of fib numbers as described.\n\nLoop through the list, find the largest element that is <=n. Let's say that element is at position i (0-based). Then the answer is i+1.\n\nBut how to generate the list?\n\nLet me try to code that.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 1e18, but the list is generated up to that value.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, the code could be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfibs = []\na, b = 2, 3\nfibs.append(a)\nfibs.append(b)\nwhile True:\n    next_val = a + b\n    if next_val > 1e18:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n    a, b = b, next_val\n\nThen, find the maximum k.\n\nBut wait, the loop may not generate all the terms. Let me think:\n\nInitially, a is 2, b is 3. Then next_val is 5, added to the list. Then a becomes 3, b becomes 5. Then next_val is 3+5=8, added. Then a=5, b=8. next_val=13, etc. So the list is built correctly.\n\nBut in the code, the initial fibs list is [2,3], and then in the loop, we add next_val, which is 5, then 8, etc. So the list is [2,3,5,8,13,...].\n\nSo for example, for n=3, the list has elements 2,3,5,... So the maximum is 3, which is at index 1. So answer is 1+1=2, which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the loop is:\n\nInitially, a=2, b=3. Then, next_val is 5. Then, append to fibs. Then a becomes 3, b becomes 5. Then next_val is 3+5=8. Append. Then a becomes 5, b becomes 8. Then next_val is 5+8=13. And so on.\n\nSo the list is [2,3,5,8,13,...].\n\nBut in this case, the list is generated as follows: the first two elements are 2 and 3. Then, each subsequent element is the sum of the previous two. So the list is [f(1), f(2), f(3), ...], where f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, etc.\n\nSo for the list, the index i corresponds to k=i+1. So for example, the first element (i=0) is k=1.\n\nSo, once the list is generated, for a given n, we can loop through the list and find the maximum i where fibs[i] <=n. Then, the answer is i+1.\n\nBut what if n is larger than all elements in the list? For example, if n is 1e18 and the last element is less than that. Then, the answer would be the last index +1.\n\nBut the code for generating the list stops when next_val exceeds 1e18. So, for example, if the next_val is 1e18 + something, then we break. So the list contains all the terms up to the maximum that is <= 1e18.\n\nBut for the case when n is larger than the last element in the list, then the maximum k is the last index +1. But wait, the list is generated until next_val exceeds 1e18. So for example, if the last element in the list is x, and the next_val is x + previous term, which is larger than 1e18. So the list contains all terms up to the maximum that is <=1e18.\n\nSo for example, for n=1e18, if the last term in the list is less than or equal to 1e18, then the answer is the index +1. Otherwise, if the next_val is larger than 1e18, but the last term is less than 1e18, then the answer is the index +1.\n\nBut how to handle this in code? Let's think:\n\nOnce the list is generated, for example, the list may have elements up to some value less than 1e18. So, for example, if n is larger than all elements in the list, then the answer is the length of the list (since the last element is the maximum possible for the list). But wait, for example, suppose the list is [2,3,5,8,13], and n is 10. Then the maximum is 8 (index 3) and answer is 4.\n\nSo the code can loop through the list, and for each element, check if it is <=n. Then find the maximum index where that holds.\n\nSo in code, the code can be:\n\nmax_k = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] <=n:\n\n        max_k = i+1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nBut that would not work, because the list is in increasing order. So once we find an element that is larger than n, all the following elements are larger. So we can loop until the first element that is larger than n, and take the previous index.\n\nAlternatively, we can use binary search.\n\nBut for the list size being small (say, up to 90 elements), even a linear search is acceptable.\n\nSo in code:\n\nmax_games = 0\n\nfor val in fibs:\n\n    if val <=n:\n\n        max_games = fibs.index(val) +1\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because, for example, if the list is [2,3,5,8,13], and n=7, then the code would check 2,3,5,8. When it reaches 8, which is >7, then break. So the max_games is 3 (since 5 is the last value <=7, which is index 2, +1 is 3). But how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, loop through all elements, and track the maximum index where the value is <=n.\n\nSo:\n\nmax_index = -1\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] <=n:\n\n        max_index = i\n\n    else:\n\n        break\n\nif max_index == -1:\n\n    # no elements found, but since n >=2, the first element is 2, which is >=2.\n\n    # So this is not possible.\n\nSo the answer is max_index +1.\n\nBut for example, for n=2, the list is [2,3, ...]. So i=0, fibs[0]=2 <=2, so max_index is 0. Answer is 0+1=1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=3. The list is [2,3, ...]. i=0, 2<=3, max_index=0. Then i=1, 3<=3, max_index=1. Answer is 2.\n\nAnother example: n=4. The list is [2,3,5, ...]. i=0: 2<=4. i=1:3<=4. i=2:5>4. So break. max_index is 1. answer is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nOnce the list is generated, loop through each element, and find the maximum index where the value is <=n.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 1:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # generate the fib list\n    fibs = []\n    a, b = 2, 3\n    fibs.append(a)\n    fibs.append(b)\n    while True:\n        next_val = a + b\n        if next_val > 1e18:\n            break\n        fibs.append(next_val)\n        a, b = b, next_val\n\n    max_index = -1\n    for i in range(len(fibs)):\n        if fibs[i] <= n:\n            max_index = i\n        else:\n            break\n    print(max_index + 1)\n\nWait, but for n=2, the first element is 2, which is in the list. So the code would set max_index=0, and print 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 2: n=3. The fibs list is [2,3,5, ...]. The loop checks i=0 (2<=3 → max_index=0), i=1 (3<=3 → max_index=1). Then i=2, 5>3 → break. So answer is 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSample input 4: n=4. The list is [2,3,5, ...]. i=0: 2<=4 → max_index=0. i=1:3 <=4 → max_index=1. i=2:5>4 → break. answer is 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nSample input 10: the list includes 2,3,5,8,13. So for i=0, 2<=10 → yes. i=1:3 yes. i=2:5 yes. i=3:8 yes. i=4:13>10 → break. So max_index=3. answer is 4. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5. The list has 5 as the third element (index 2). So answer is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, the code for generating the fibs list. Let me check how the loop works.\n\nInitially, a=2, b=3. fibs is [2,3]. Then, next_val is 2+3=5. Which is added to fibs. Then a becomes 3, b becomes 5. Then next_val is 3+5=8, added. Then a=5, b=8. next_val=13, added. Then a=8, b=13. next_val=21, added. etc.\n\nSo the list is [2,3,5,8,13,21,...].\n\nSo the code for generating the list is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the loop is:\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = a + b\n\n    if next_val > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\n    a, b = b, next_val\n\nBut what if the next_val is exactly 1e18? It is added. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float. So comparing integers to it may cause issues. For example, if next_val is 10^18, which is an integer, but 1e18 is 1000000000000000000.0. So comparing next_val (integer) to 1e18 (float) may not be precise. For example, if next_val is 10^18, which is exactly equal to 1e18. But in Python, when you write 1e18, it's a float. However, for numbers up to 1e18, the float can represent them exactly as integers. But to avoid any issues, perhaps better to use 10**18 as an integer.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nInstead of 1e18, which is a float, use 10**18 as integer.\n\nSo:\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = a + b\n\n    if next_val > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\n    a, b = b, next_val\n\nBut in Python, for very large integers, this is okay.\n\nBut what about when n is 10^18? The code will generate the fibs up to the maximum that is <=1e18.\n\nSo, the code should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nNow, let's think about the code again.\n\nBut what about when n is less than 2? According to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut in the code, the initial fibs list is [2,3]. Then, in the loop, we generate next_val as a +b. But for the first iteration, a=2, b=3. next_val is 5. So added. Then a becomes 3, b becomes 5. Then next_val is 3+5=8. Added. Etc.\n\nSo the code for generating the list is correct.\n\nNow, let's test for n=5. The fibs list would have 2,3,5,8, etc. The loop for i in range(len(fibs)):\n\ni=0: 2 <=5 → max_index=0.\n\ni=1:3 <=5 → max_index=1.\n\ni=2:5 <=5 → max_index=2. answer is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=8. The answer is 4 (since the fourth element is 8).\n\nSo the code returns 3+1=4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when n is larger than all elements in the list? For example, suppose the list is generated up to a certain value, and n is larger than all elements. For example, let's say the list's last element is 1e18, and n is 1e18. Then, the code will find that element and return the index +1. But if the next_val was larger than 1e18, but the list's last element is less than 1e18, then for n=1e18, the code would find the last element in the list and return its index +1.\n\nBut in the code, the loop for generating the list stops when next_val exceeds 1e18. So, for example, if the next_val is 1e18 + 1, then we break. So the list contains all the elements up to the previous value.\n\nBut for n=1e18, the code would have the last element in the list as the largest possible value that is <=1e18.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about n=1? According to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nSo, the code should be written as:\n\nRead n.\n\nGenerate the fibs list.\n\nLoop through the list to find the maximum index where fibs[i] <=n.\n\nPrint index +1.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, the code will handle it as integers.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code may have a problem when the list is empty. But no, the list starts with [2,3], so len(fibs) is at least 2.\n\nBut for n=2, the code would check the first element (2) and return 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfibs = []\na, b = 2, 3\nfibs.append(a)\nfibs.append(b)\nwhile True:\n    next_val = a + b\n    if next_val > 10**18:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n    a, b = b, next_val\n\nmax_index = -1\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n    if fibs[i] <= n:\n        max_index = i\n    else:\n        break\n\nprint(max_index + 1)\n\nWait, but what if the loop for the fibs is not generating all the terms? For example, in the case when the next_val is exactly 10^18, then it is added to the list. Because the condition is 'if next_val > 1e18, break'. So if next_val is equal to 1e18, it is added. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the code, the initial fibs list is [2,3], then the loop adds next_val as long as it is <= 1e18.\n\nBut let's check for example, when next_val is 1e18.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the code for the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2: 3 → output 2.\n\nSample Input 4: 4 → output 2.\n\nSample Input 10: 10 → output 4.\n\nSample Input 2: 2 → output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=5 → output 3.\n\nAnother test case: n=8 → output 4.\n\nn=13 → output 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about n=1?\n\nBut the problem says n is at least 2.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nBut let's think about when n is 1. Well, the code would have fibs list [2,3, ...], and for i=0, 2>1 → break. So max_index remains -1. Then, print -1 +1=0. But since n is at least 2, this case is not possible.\n\nBut the code is given that n is between 2 and 1e18, so the code is safe.\n\nBut in the code, for n=2, the first element is 2, which is <=2. So max_index is 0. Then, the code returns 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The solution involves leveraging the properties of a Fibonacci sequence to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is recognizing that the maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each subsequent game the winner plays requires opponents who have played a number of games that differs by at most one from the winner's current count of games.\n\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games can be represented using a modified Fibonacci sequence. This sequence starts with 2 players for 1 game and 3 players for 2 games, with each subsequent term being the sum of the previous two terms.\n\n3. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the maximum possible value (10^18) to handle large inputs efficiently.\n\n4. **Determine Maximum Games**: For a given number of players `n`, find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n`. The position of this Fibonacci number in the sequence gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\nfibs = []\na, b = 2, 3\nfibs.append(a)\nfibs.append(b)\nwhile True:\n    next_val = a + b\n    if next_val > 10**18:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n    a, b = b, next_val\n\nmax_index = -1\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n    if fibs[i] <= n:\n        max_index = i\n    else:\n        break\n\nprint(max_index + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: The code generates a list of Fibonacci numbers starting from 2 and 3. Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers until the value exceeds 10^18, which is the upper bound for the input `n`.\n\n2. **Finding Maximum Games**: After generating the Fibonacci sequence, the code iterates through the list to find the largest value that is less than or equal to the input `n`. The index of this value in the list (adjusted by +1) gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles very large values of `n` up to 10^18 by leveraging the exponential growth property of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
