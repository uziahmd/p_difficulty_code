The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to calculate the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 probability), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to find all possible subsets of towns (with towers built) that allow such a configuration. Then, since each subset has probability (1/2)^n, the total probability would be (number of valid subsets) * (1/2)^n.\n\nThe main challenge is figuring out how to count the valid subsets.\n\nLet me think about the constraints for a subset of towers. For each town i (from 1 to n), exactly one tower must cover it. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\nWhat's the condition on the towers? Let's think about the coverage. For a tower at position i with power p, it covers cities from i-p+1 to i+p-1. Wait, the problem says |c - i| < p. So for c to be covered, the distance between c and i must be less than p. Which means p must be at least (distance + 1). For example, if a tower is at i, then to cover city i-1, the power needs to be at least 1 (since |i-1 -i| = 1 < p → p ≥ 2? Wait, no. Wait, |c - i| < p. So if p is 1, then |c - i| must be less than 1, which implies c = i. So a tower with power 1 only covers itself. If p is 2, then |c -i| < 2 → c can be i-1, i, or i+1. So for a tower at i, the coverage area is [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]?\n\nWait, maybe I should think of the coverage as covering cities from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). Because if p is the power, then the maximum distance is p-1. So for example, p=1: distance is 0, so only the city itself. p=2: distance <2 → up to 1 away.\n\nSo for the problem, when assigning the signal powers, each city 1..n must be covered exactly once. And 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nSo, how can we model this? It seems similar to some kind of tiling or interval covering problem. But since the signal powers can be adjusted, perhaps the structure of the tower positions must allow for a certain arrangement where each tower's coverage is exactly the cities between two points.\n\nLet me think of the valid configurations. Suppose there are towers placed in some positions. How can we assign their powers such that each city is covered exactly once, and 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nAn important observation: For each tower, the coverage must be such that it doesn't reach beyond its neighbors. For example, if there's a tower at position i, then its coverage cannot reach 0 or n+1. Also, each city must be covered exactly once.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the coverage as intervals. Each tower's coverage must be an interval that starts and ends at certain points, and these intervals must partition the cities 1..n.\n\nBut since the power can be adjusted, the key is that the tower positions must be arranged in such a way that there's a way to assign intervals that cover exactly each city once, without overlapping, and not covering 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but the intervals can overlap as long as each city is covered exactly once. Wait no, because if two towers cover the same city, that's a problem. So the assignment must be such that every city is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nThis feels like a problem where the tower positions must form a certain structure. Let me think about possible valid tower arrangements.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input n=2, the valid case is when towers are built in both 1 and 2. Then, set their power to 1. Each covers themselves, and nothing else. So 0 is not covered (since tower 1's power is 1, which covers up to 0? Wait no. Wait, tower at 1 with power 1: |c -1| < 1 → c must be 1. So yes, 0 is not covered. Similarly, tower at 2 with power 1 covers only 2. So that works.\n\nAnother example given is for n=5, towers at 2,4,5. Then the power of 2 is 2, which covers 1,2,3. The",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 are not covered, and each town from 1 to n is covered exactly once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Coverage**: Each tower can cover a range of towns based on its signal power. The key constraint is that each town from 1 to n must be covered exactly once, and towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered at all.\n2. **Valid Configurations**: The valid configurations of towers must allow for non-overlapping coverage intervals that exactly cover towns 1 through n without extending to towns 0 or n+1.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: Use dynamic programming to count valid configurations. Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The recurrence relation considers whether the i-th town has a tower or not, ensuring valid coverage intervals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns\n    dp = [0] * (n + 2)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case: no towns, one way (empty)\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at i, then dp[i] += dp[i-1]\n        dp[i] = dp[i-1]\n        # Case 2: there is a tower at i.
