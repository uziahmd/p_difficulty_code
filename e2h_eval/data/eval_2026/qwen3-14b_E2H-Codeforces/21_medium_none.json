The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many even and odd chests there are, and then count how many even and odd keys there are. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. But each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once. So the total is the sum of those two minima.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n   - For each a_i in the chests array, check if it's even or odd. Let's say even_chest_count and odd_chest_count.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Similarly for the keys array, even_key_count and odd_key_count.\n3. The answer is min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) + min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\nn=5, m=4\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11\nLet's see:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So odd_chest_count is 2 (9 and 11), even_chest_count is 3 (14,6,2).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's check their parity. 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_key_count is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key_count is 1 (7).\n\nSo min(even_chest_count (3), odd_key_count (1)) is 1. Then min(odd_chest_count (2), even_key_count (3)) is 2. Sum is 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output of 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example input:\nn=5, m=1\nChests: 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chest_count is 5, odd_chest_count is 0.\nKeys: 5 (odd). So odd_key_count is 1, even_key_count 0.\n\nSo min(5, 1) is 1, and min(0, 0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example's output.\n\nThird example:\nn=1, m=4\nChest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chest_count is 1, odd_chest_count 0. Keys: even_key_count 4, odd_key_count 0. So min(1, 0) is 0, and min(0, 4) is 0. Total 0. Which matches the third example.\n\nSo the logic seems solid. Now, the code needs to compute these counts.\n\nSo the plan for the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i. Count how many are even and odd.\n\nRead the list of b_j. Count how many are even and odd.\n\nCompute the answer as min(even_chest, odd_keys) + min(odd_chest, even_keys).\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple keys and chests? Like, if there are more even chests than odd keys, but also some odd chests and even keys. The code would take the min of each pair.\n\nYes, that's correct. Because each key can be used once, and each chest once. So the maximum possible pairs for even chests is limited by the number of odd keys. Similarly for the other part.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, in Python, how to read the inputs?\n\nThe input comes from stdin. The first line is n and m. Then the second line is n integers, then third line is m integers.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nWait the sample input shows three different test cases. Wait, looking at the input description, the user provided three examples, but the actual problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, no. Wait the original problem says that the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows three different inputs, which probably correspond to three different test cases. But the code is supposed to read a single test case. Wait, perhaps the user provided multiple examples, but the code should handle a single test case. So the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n and m.\n\nSecond line has n integers.\n\nThird line has m integers.\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three different test cases. Wait, perhaps the user provided three separate examples. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich outputs 3.\n\nThen the second example is:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\nOutput 1.\n\nThird example:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nOutput 0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. So the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. However, the code is supposed to handle one test case. So the code should read the input as per the problem's input format.\n\nSo the code will read n and m, then the list of a's, then the list of b's.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as n, m.\n\nThen read the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen read the third line as list of integers.\n\nThen compute even_chest, odd_chest, even_key, odd_key.\n\nThen compute the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut wait, the second line is n integers. So after reading the first line, the second line is split into n elements. Similarly for the third line.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen count even and odd in a:\n\neven_chest = 0\n\nodd_chest = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        even_chest +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        odd_chest +=1\n\nSimilarly for keys:\n\neven_key = 0\n\nodd_key = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n\n    if num %2 ==0:\n\n        even_key +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        odd_key +=1\n\nThen answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nPrint that.\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na is [9,14,6,2,11]. even_chest is 3 (14,6,2). odd_chest is 2 (9,11).\n\nb is [8,4,7,20]. even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7). So min(3,1) is 1, min(2,3) is 2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example: n=5, m=1. a is all even. even_chest=5. odd_chest=0. b is [5], which is odd. So odd_key=1, even_key=0. min(5,1) is 1, min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Correct.\n\nThird example: n=1, m=4. a is [10], even. even_chest=1. odd_chest=0. b is [20,30,40,50], all even. even_key=4, odd_key=0. min(1,0) is 0. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this code works for the examples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase where all chests are even, and all keys are even. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: chests have 1 even and 1 odd. Keys have 1 even and 1 odd. Then min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 1 +1=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are more keys than chests. For example, n=2, m=5. a = [1,3] (both odd). b = [2,4,6,8,10]. So even keys. So for each odd chest, need even key. So min(2,5) is 2. So answer is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when there are more even chests than odd keys. For example, even_chest=5, odd_key=3. Then min(5,3)=3. So that's the contribution from that part.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the code must read from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of n integers.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of m integers.\n\nThen compute even_chest, odd_chest, even_key, odd_key.\n\nThen compute the answer.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = 0\n\nodd_chest = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n\n        even_chest +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        odd_chest +=1\n\neven_key = 0\n\nodd_key = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n\n    if num %2 ==0:\n\n        even_key +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        odd_key +=1\n\nans = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nNow, check for possible edge cases. For example, when n=0 or m=0? But according to the problem statement, n and m are at least 1. So no, since constraints are 1<=n,m<=1e5.\n\nSo the code handles all cases.\n\nAnother possible case: when there are zero even chests. For example, all odd. Then the answer is min(0, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key). Which would be 0 + min(odd_chest, even_key). Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by two possible pairings:\n   - Even chests paired with odd keys.\n   - Odd chests paired with even keys.\n3. **Calculate Result**: The result is the sum of the minimum counts of these two pairings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = 0\nodd_chest = 0\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest += 1\n    else:\n        odd_chest += 1\n\neven_key = 0\nodd_key = 0\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_key += 1\n    else:\n        odd_key += 1\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of chest numbers `a`, and the list of key numbers `b`.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: We iterate through the lists `a` and `b` to count how many even and odd numbers are present in each.\n3. **Calculating Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of pairs is determined by the sum of two minimum values:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys.\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the optimal pairings using simple counting and comparison operations, ensuring an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the size of the input lists.",
