Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem says that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which is a lowercase letter or a question mark. The task is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of a left and a right boot with compatible colors. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair. And then output the pairs.\n\nSo, the key is to match as many as possible. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the compatibility rules: two specific colors are compatible if they are the same. A question mark can match any color, including another question mark. So, for example, a '?' on the left can pair with any right boot, and vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. How can I model this?\n\nI think the approach is to first try to pair specific colors with each other. Then handle the question marks.\n\nLet me think of steps:\n\n1. For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left and right boots. For example, for color 'a', if there are 3 left boots and 5 right boots, we can pair 3 of them. But then, those left boots can't be used again.\n\nBut since the question marks can be used as wildcards, perhaps we should first pair the specific colors, then use the question marks to cover the remaining ones.\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal way is to pair as many specific colors as possible, and then use the question marks to pair the remaining ones. However, there's also the possibility that some question marks can be paired with each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can do the following:\n\n- First, for each color c (not '?'), match left boots of color c with right boots of color c. For each such color, the number of pairs is the minimum of the count of left and right boots for that color. Then, subtract those from the counts.\n\n- Then, collect all the remaining left boots (those that couldn't be matched with their specific color counterparts) and the same for right boots. Then, pair the remaining left and right boots using the question marks. Since a '?' can pair with any, but we have to make sure that each is used once.\n\nBut how to do that optimally? Because after pairing the specific colors, the remaining left and right boots may have some question marks and some specific colors that couldn't be matched. For example, suppose after pairing the specific colors, there are some left boots with 'a' and some right boots with 'b', but they can't be paired. However, if there are question marks, they can be used to pair with these.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Pair all specific colors first. For each color c (not '?'), pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\n2. Then, collect all remaining left boots (including those with '?') and same for right boots.\n\n3. Now, the remaining left boots and right boots can be paired using the question marks. But how?\n\nWait, but the remaining left boots may have specific colors and question marks. Similarly for the right. So, for example, if there is a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with '?', they can be paired. Similarly, a left '?' and a right 'b' can be paired. Also, two question marks can be paired.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the remaining left and right boots. How to maximize this?\n\nLet me think of the remaining left and right boots. Let me collect the counts for each color (excluding '?') on left and right, and also count the number of '?' on left and right.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to collect all the left boots that are not yet paired, and same for right. Then, for each left boot, try to pair with a right boot that can be compatible.\n\nBut since the order of processing can affect the result, perhaps we need to find the optimal way.\n\nBut given that the problem allows any valid maximum pairing, perhaps we can proceed greedily.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\nAfter pairing the specific colors, we have:\n\nLeft_remaining: list of left boots (indices) that are not yet paired. These can be either specific colors or '?'.\n\nSimilarly for Right_remaining.\n\nNow, for the remaining left and right boots, we can pair them as follows:\n\n- First, pair the '?' on the left with the '?' on the right. The number of such pairs is the minimum of the count of left '?' and right '?'.\n\n- Then, pair the left '?' with the right non-? boots. For example, if there are left '?' and right 'a', they can be paired. Similarly, right '?' can be paired with left non-? boots.\n\nBut how to do this optimally.\n\nWait, but after pairing the specific colors, the remaining left and right boots can't be matched with their specific color counterparts.
