Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors must be compatible. The compatibility rules are that two specific colors (letters) must be the same, and a question mark can match any color, including another question mark.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to process the two strings l and r. For each position, we have a left boot and a right boot. But we can't just pair them directly unless their colors are compatible. Also, each boot can be used in at most one pair.\n\nSo, how do I maximize the pairs? Let's think of possible strategies.\n\nOne idea is to first pair the left boots with specific colors with the right boots that have the same color. Then handle the question marks.\n\nBut since question marks can be matched with anything, maybe we need to use them optimally. For example, if there are some left question marks and right question marks, they can be paired together. But also, a left question mark can be paired with a right specific color, and vice versa.\n\nBut how to manage this optimally?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Pair as many specific color matches as possible. For example, for each color c (not '?'), count how many left boots have c and how many right boots have c. The minimum of these counts would be the number of possible direct pairs for that color. Then subtract those from the counts.\n\nWait, but perhaps we should first pair the specific colors first, then use the question marks to cover the remaining.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can first pair left and right boots where both are specific colors. Then, for the remaining, use the question marks.\n\nBut how to track which ones are already used?\n\nAnother approach is to:\n\n- Create two dictionaries: left_counts and right_counts. But maybe not. Because we need to track which positions are already used.\n\nBut given the size of n (up to 150,000), we need an efficient approach.\n\nWait, but the problem requires not only the count but also the actual pairs. So, we need to track which indices are used.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nFirst, for each left boot that is not a '?', try to pair it with a right boot that has the same color and is not yet paired. Similarly for the right boots.\n\nThen, handle the remaining question marks. For example, pair left '?' with right '?' if possible, or with other specific colors if needed.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nStep 1: Pair all specific color matches.\n\nFor each color c (excluding '?'):\n\n- Find all left boots with color c that are not yet paired.\n- Find all right boots with color c that are not yet paired.\n- Pair as many as possible (minimum of the counts). For each such pair, record the indices.\n\nBut how to track which are used? We can have two boolean arrays, left_used and right_used, initialized to False. Then, for each pair, mark them as True.\n\nBut how to efficiently find which left and right boots are available for each color?\n\nAn alternative approach is to:\n\n- For each color c (a-z), collect the list of indices in the left string where the color is c, and similarly for the right string.\n\nThen, for each color c, we can pair the left and right indices for that color. For example, for color 'a', take the first min(len(left_a), len(right_a)) pairs. Then, mark those indices as used.\n\nBut once we do that, we can process the question marks.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks?\n\nOnce we have processed the specific colors, the remaining left and right boots with '?' can be paired among themselves, or with the remaining specific colors.\n\nWait, but after pairing the specific colors, there may be some left boots with specific colors that are not matched (if there were more left than right for that color). Similarly for the right boots. Those can be paired with question marks.\n\nSo the next step is to pair the remaining left specific colors with right question marks, and vice versa.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. First, pair all left and right boots with specific colors (same color).\n\n   For each color c in a-z:\n\n      - Take the left indices with color c (not yet used) and the right indices with color c (not yet used). Pair them up, as many as possible.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left boots (those not yet used) which are either '?' or specific colors, and same for the right boots, we can pair them using the question marks.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: after step 1, we have some left boots and right boots that are not yet paired. Let's separate",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors. The compatibility rules are that specific colors must match exactly, while question marks ('?') can match any color, including other question marks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), pair left boots with the same color as right boots. This ensures we use up as many specific color matches as possible.\n2. **Handle Question Marks**: After pairing specific colors, use the remaining question marks to form pairs with both specific colors and other question marks. This is done by:\n   - Pairing remaining left question marks with right specific colors.\n   - Pairing remaining right question marks with left specific colors.\n   - Pairing remaining question marks with each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    left_used = [False] * n\n    right_used = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n    \n    # Step 1: Pair specific colors\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    left_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n    \n    # Process each color\n    for c in left_color_map:\n        if c in right_color_map:\n            left_list = left_color_map[c]\n            right_list = right_color_map[c]\n            min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n            for i in range(min_len):\n                left_idx = left_list[i]\n                right_idx = right_list[i]\n                if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n                    pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                    left_used[left_idx] = True\n                    right_used[right_idx] = True\n    \n    # Step 2: Pair remaining left '?' with right non-?\n    left_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not left_used[i]:\n            left_q.append(i)\n    \n    right_non_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if r[i] != '?' and not right_used[i]:\n            right_non_q.append(i)\n    \n    # Pair left ? with right non-?\n    for left_idx in left_q:\n        for right_idx in right_non_q:\n            if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n                pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                left_used[left_idx] = True\n                right_used[right_idx] = True\n                break\n    \n    # Step 3: Pair remaining right '?' with left non-?\n    right_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if r[i] == '?' and not right_used[i]:\n            right_q.append(i)\n    \n    left_non_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?' and not left_used[i]:\n            left_non_q.append(i)\n    \n    for right_idx in right_q:\n        for left_idx in left_non_q:\n            if not left_used[left_idx] and not right_used[right_idx]:\n                pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n                left_used[left_idx] = True\n                right_used[right_idx] = True\n                break\n    \n    # Step 4: Pair remaining ? with ?\n    remaining_left_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] == '?' and not left_used[i]:\n            remaining_left_q.append(i)\n    \n    remaining_right_q = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if r[i] == '?' and not right_used[i]:\n            remaining_right_q.append(i)\n    \n    min_len = min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        pairs.append((remaining_left_q[i] + 1, remaining_right_q[i] + 1))\n    \n    print(len(pairs))\n    for a, b in pairs:\n        print(a, b)\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Tracking Used Boots**: Arrays `left_used` and `right_used` track which boots have been paired.\n3. **Color Mapping**: We use dictionaries to map each color to its indices in both the left and right boot strings.\n4. **Pairing Specific Colors**: For each color, we pair the left and right boots if they match and haven't been used yet.\n5. **Handling Question Marks**: After handling specific colors, we pair remaining question marks with specific colors and then with other question marks to maximize the number of valid pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently use all possible compatible pairs, prioritizing specific colors first and then utilizing question marks optimally.",
