In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The answer is the minimum number of draws required.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input is three strings, each representing a tile. For example, '1s', '2m', etc. The output is the minimum number of tiles needed to draw to form a mentsu.\n\nSo, the approach is: check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0. If not, figure out how many more tiles are needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut wait, since after drawing tiles, she can have more than three tiles. But the problem says that she needs to have at least one mentsu in her hand. So the question is, what's the minimum number of tiles to add so that among all the tiles (original plus added), there exists a mentsu.\n\nBut how do I model this? Let's think about possible cases.\n\nFor example, if the original three tiles can form a triplet or sequence, then 0. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal steps to reach such a state.\n\nLet me think about all possibilities for the original three tiles.\n\nCase 1: Already a triplet. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Already a sequence. Answer 0.\n\nElse, need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about possible ways to form a triplet or sequence with the existing tiles plus some added tiles.\n\nFor example, suppose the original tiles are 3p, 9m, 2p. As in the third example. Then, adding 1p gives 3p, 2p, 1p. Which is a sequence. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo the problem is to check all possibilities of forming a triplet or sequence with the given tiles plus any number of added tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, check whether the current tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then check for possible ways to form a mentsu by adding tiles.\n\nLet me think about possible options:\n\nOption 1: Form a triplet. For that, we need three identical tiles. So, for each tile in the original set, check how many copies are present. For example, if there are two of a tile, then adding one more would make a triplet. But if there are only one, then adding two more. But maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, but the original three tiles may have different types. For example, if the original tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, to form a triplet, we need another 1m (so add 1) or 2m (but that's not enough). Wait, no. To form a triplet, you need three of the same. So in this case, the original has two 1m. Adding one more 1m gives a triplet. So that's 1 tile. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to form a sequence. For example, adding 3m would allow a sequence 1m, 2m, 3m. So that's also adding one tile. So in this case, the answer would be 1.\n\nSo the minimal between the options.\n\nSo for each possible way to form a triplet or sequence, calculate the required number of tiles to add, and take the minimum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCheck for all possible mentsu (triplet or sequence) that can be formed with the original tiles plus some added tiles, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how to check all possibilities?\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for all possible ways to form a triplet or sequence, and find the minimal steps required.\n\nFor triplet:\n\nWe need three of the same tile. So for each tile type in the original set, count how many there are. For example, if there are two of a certain tile, then we need 1 more. If there's one, then 2 more. But perhaps there are multiple possibilities. For example, if the original has three different tiles, then for each of them, we need to add 2 more to get a triplet. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut for the triplet possibility, the minimal number of tiles needed is min( (3 - count) for each tile type in the original set).\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to consider adding tiles to form a triplet. For example, if the original tiles are [1m, 2m, 3m], then to form a triplet, you need to add two 1m's (so total 3), but that's 2 tiles. However, maybe there's a better way. But in this case, the original tiles can form a sequence. So the answer is 0. But in this case, the code would first check if there's a mentsu already, which is yes (the sequence), so the answer is 0.\n\nSo for the triplet case, the minimal steps would be the minimal (3 - count) for each tile type. But since the original has three tiles, for example, if there are two of a tile, then 1 step. If there's one, then 2 steps. If there are three, then 0 steps (but that would have been detected in the initial check).\n\nBut wait, the initial check would have already checked if there is a triplet. So for example, if the original tiles are three of the same, then answer is 0. So in the case where the original tiles are not a mentsu, then for triplet, the minimal steps would be the minimal (3 - count) for each tile type. But for example, if the original has two of a tile, then adding one more.\n\nBut maybe there are other possibilities. For example, if the original tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then, the minimal steps for triplet is 1 (adding another 1m). But maybe there's a way to form a sequence with fewer steps. Like adding 3m (so that 1m, 2m, 3m) which is one step. So the minimal steps would be 1, which is the same as the triplet option. So in this case, the minimal is 1.\n\nSo for the triplet and sequence options, we need to check both possibilities.\n\nNow, for the sequence possibility. How to check what's the minimal steps to form a sequence.\n\nA sequence is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for example, 1m, 2m, 3m.\n\nSo the original three tiles may have some possibilities. For example, if they are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, adding 3m would form a sequence. So steps needed is 1.\n\nBut if the original tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. Then, adding 2m and 4m would form a sequence (but that's two steps). Or perhaps, adding 2m and 4m, but maybe there's a way to form a sequence with fewer steps. Wait, but for three tiles, you need to have three consecutive numbers. So the original three tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. How can you form a sequence? Well, for example, adding 2m and 4m gives 1m, 2m, 3m (but that's only three tiles? No, because the original has 1m, 3m, 5m. Adding 2m and 4m would give five tiles. But you can choose any subset of three that forms a sequence. So in this case, adding 2m and 4m would allow sequences like 1m, 2m, 3m (needs 2m) and 3m, 4m, 5m (needs 4m). So to form either, you need to add two tiles. But maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe adding 2m and 3m? Wait, no. The original has 3m. So adding 2m and 4m would allow a sequence.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal steps required for forming a sequence?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think about the original three tiles. For each possible suit, check if all three tiles are in the same suit. If not, then to form a sequence, you need to have all three tiles in the same suit. So for example, if the original tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a sequence, you need to have three tiles in the same suit. So you need to add tiles to get three consecutive numbers in one of the suits. But this requires adding tiles to get three consecutive numbers in a suit.\n\nBut this seems complex. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, check if all three tiles are in the same suit. If not, then to form a sequence, you need to have three tiles in the same suit. So, for example, if the original tiles are in different suits, then you need to add tiles to get three in the same suit. But that might require adding two tiles (if you have one tile in a suit and two in another, but not sure).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best approach is to consider all possible ways to form a sequence, considering that the original tiles may contribute to that.\n\nSo for each possible suit, check if there are any tiles in that suit. Then, for each such suit, collect the numbers present in the original tiles, and determine what's the minimal number of tiles to add to form a sequence.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. So same suit. Then, to form a sequence, we need to add 3m. So one tile. So steps needed is 1.\n\nAnother example: original tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. So same suit. To form a sequence, you could add 2m and 4m (steps 2) to form 1-2-3, or 2-3-4 (needs 2 and 4), or 3-4-5 (needs 4). So the minimal steps here would be adding 2 and 4 (2 steps) or adding 4 (to get 3-4-5, but then you have 3,4,5. So that's only one tile. Wait, the original has 3 and 5. So adding 4 would allow a sequence of 3,4,5. So steps needed is 1. Oh right! Because the original has 3m and 5m. Adding 4m gives a sequence. So steps needed is 1. So why didn't I think of that before. So in this case, the minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo how to find this?\n\nThe approach for sequences is to look for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For each possible suit, collect the numbers present in the original tiles, and see which sequences can be formed by adding some tiles.\n\nSo for each suit, let's collect the numbers present. For example, for suit m, numbers are {1,3,5}.\n\nThen, for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9), check if the original numbers can cover some part of the sequence, and how many tiles need to be added.\n\nFor example, for the sequence 3-4-5: the original has 3 and 5. So need to add 4. So steps is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for the sequence 1-2-3: original has 1 and 3. Need to add 2. Steps is 1.\n\nSo the minimal steps for this case is 1.\n\nSo how to compute that for each suit.\n\nSo for a given suit, collect all the numbers present in the original tiles. Let's call this S. Then, for each possible triplet of consecutive numbers (a, a+1, a+2), check how many of these numbers are already in S. The number of missing numbers is the number of tiles needed to add for that particular sequence.\n\nSo for example, for the triplet 3-4-5, if S contains 3 and 5, then missing is 1 (4). So steps needed is 1.\n\nBut for the same suit, there could be multiple possible sequences. We need to find the minimal steps among all possible sequences in that suit.\n\nOnce we find the minimal steps for each suit, then the overall minimal steps for sequences is the minimum of those.\n\nBut what if the original tiles are not all in the same suit? For example, suppose the original has tiles 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a sequence, we need to have three tiles in the same suit. So, for example, we could choose to add two tiles to the m suit (like 2m and 3m) to form 1m, 2m, 3m. That would require adding two tiles. Or add 1p and 3p to form 1p, 2p, 3p. Also two steps. Or add 2s and 3s to form 2s, 3s, but that's only two tiles. Wait, no. The original has 3s. So adding 1s and 2s would form 1s, 2s, 3s. So two steps. So the minimal steps for sequences would be 2 in this case.\n\nBut in this case, the original tiles are not in the same suit. So the steps required for sequences would be the minimal steps to get three in the same suit, plus steps to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nSo for each suit, the steps needed would be:\n\nnumber of tiles needed to get at least three in that suit (but not sure) plus steps to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nWait, no. Because the original tiles may have some in that suit. For example, if the original has one tile in suit m, then to form a sequence in suit m, you need to add two more tiles. But those two tiles must be consecutive with the existing one.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think again.\n\nFor sequences, the idea is that the three tiles must be in the same suit, and consecutive numbers.\n\nSo, for each suit, let's consider how many tiles are already present. For example, if the original has one tile in suit m, then to form a sequence, you need to add two more tiles. But those two tiles need to be such that the three form a consecutive sequence.\n\nBut how to find the minimal steps for that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can treat each suit separately. For each suit, collect all the numbers present in the original tiles. Then, for that suit, determine the minimal steps required to form a sequence. Then, the overall minimal steps for sequences is the minimum across all suits.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's take an example where the original tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. So for suit m, we have {1}; suit p {2}; suit s {3}.\n\nFor each suit, we need to find the minimal steps to form a sequence in that suit.\n\nFor suit m:\n\nWe have 1m. To form a sequence, we need two more tiles. For example, adding 2m and 3m. Steps needed: 2.\n\nAlternatively, adding 0m and 1m (but 0 is invalid). So the only possible sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4, etc. So for the current tile (1m), the possible sequences that can include it are:\n\n- 1-2-3: need 2 and 3.\n\n- 0-1-2: invalid.\n\nSo the minimal steps for this suit is 2 (add 2 and 3).\n\nFor suit p, same thing. Steps is 2.\n\nFor suit s, same. Steps is 2.\n\nSo the minimal steps for sequences is 2.\n\nBut what if the original tiles have two tiles in the same suit?\n\nFor example, original tiles are 1m, 2m, 3p. So for suit m, there are two tiles (1 and 2). For suit p, one tile (3).\n\nFor suit m, possible sequences:\n\nWe have 1 and 2. To form a sequence, need 3. Steps is 1. So that's a possible sequence. So steps is 1.\n\nFor suit p, steps is 2 (need to add 1 and 2, or 2 and 3, etc.)\n\nSo the minimal steps for sequences is 1.\n\nThus, the overall steps for sequences would be 1.\n\nSo the approach for sequences is:\n\nFor each suit, collect the numbers in the original tiles. Then, for that suit, find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a sequence.\n\nHow to compute that?\n\nFor a given suit, let's say we have a list of numbers present. For example, for the case where the suit has numbers [1,2], we can look for possible sequences that can be formed by adding some tiles.\n\nFor example, the possible sequences that can be formed with [1,2] are:\n\n- 1,2,3: need to add 3 (steps 1)\n\n- 0,1,2: invalid\n\n- 2,3,4: need to add 3 and 4 (steps 2)\n\nSo the minimal steps is 1.\n\nAnother example: numbers [1,3]. Possible sequences:\n\n- 1,2,3: need 2 (steps 1)\n\n- 3,4,5: need 4,5 (steps 2)\n\nSo minimal steps is 1.\n\nAnother example: numbers [1, 2, 4]. Possible sequences:\n\nLooking for sequences that can be formed by adding tiles. For example:\n\n- 1,2,3: add 3 (steps 1)\n\n- 2,3,4: add 3 (steps 1)\n\n- 4,5,6: add 5,6 (steps 2)\n\nSo minimal steps is 1.\n\nSo for a given suit, the minimal steps is the minimal steps required to complete any of the possible sequences.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAn approach is to generate all possible sequences (all a, a+1, a+2 for 1<=a<=7) and for each, compute how many of the numbers are already present in the original suit's numbers, then the steps needed is (3 - count) for that sequence.\n\nBut for each sequence, the steps needed is (3 - count) where count is the number of elements in the original suit's numbers that are in the sequence.\n\nBut we have to find the minimal (3 - count) across all possible sequences.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences?\n\nWell, for each a from 1 to 7, the sequence is a, a+1, a+2. So for each of these, check how many numbers are already present in the original suit's numbers.\n\nFor example, if the original suit's numbers are [1,3], then for a=1, the sequence is [1,2,3]. The count is 2 (1 and 3). So steps needed is 3 - 2 = 1. For a=2, the sequence is [2,3,4]. Count is 1 (3). Steps is 2. For a=3, sequence [3,4,5]. count is 1 (3). steps 2. And so on. So the minimal steps for this suit is 1.\n\nSo the approach for a given suit is:\n\nGenerate all possible sequences (each of the 7 possible a values), for each sequence, calculate how many of the numbers in the sequence are already present in the original suit's numbers. The minimal steps for this suit is the minimal (3 - count) over all sequences.\n\nBut if there are no sequences possible (like if the original suit has no numbers?), but since the original tiles may have some in the suit.\n\nWait, for example, if the original has zero numbers in a suit (but that's not possible, because the original three tiles may have some in that suit. For example, if the original has 1m, 2p, 3s, then for suit m, the numbers are [1], and for suit p [2], etc.)\n\nSo for each suit, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCollect the numbers present in that suit (from the original tiles). Let's call this list S.\n\nIf S is empty, then skip (since we can't form a sequence in that suit).\n\nElse, for each possible sequence (a, a+1, a+2), check how many of the numbers in the sequence are present in S. Then, compute (3 - count) as the steps needed to form that sequence. Take the minimal of all these (3 - count) values for that suit.\n\nThen, the minimal steps for sequences is the minimum of all the minimal steps across all suits.\n\nBut what if there are no sequences possible? For example, if the original has only one tile in a suit, and the numbers are 9. Then, the possible sequences are 7-8-9, 8-9-10 (invalid), etc. So for a=7, the sequence is 7,8,9. The original has 9. So count is 1. Steps needed is 2 (add 7 and 8). Or for a=8, the sequence is 8,9,10 (invalid). So that's not allowed. So only sequences up to a=7.\n\nSo the code can generate all a from 1 to 7, and for each, check if the sequence is valid (i.e., a+2 <=9).\n\nSo, the code for processing sequences would be:\n\nfor each suit in m, p, s:\n\n    collect the numbers in the original tiles for that suit (could be empty)\n\n    if the suit has less than 1 number, skip (since can't form a sequence)\n\n    else:\n\n        min_steps_for_suit = infinity\n\n        for a in 1..7:\n\n            sequence = [a, a+1, a+2]\n\n            count = number of elements in sequence that are present in the suit's numbers\n\n            steps_needed = 3 - count\n\n            if steps_needed < min_steps_for_suit:\n\n                min_steps_for_suit = steps_needed\n\n        if min_steps_for_suit is not infinity:\n\n            overall_min_sequence = min(overall_min_sequence, min_steps_for_suit)\n\nOnce we have the overall_min_sequence, then compare it with the minimal steps for forming a triplet.\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum between the minimal steps for triplet and the minimal steps for sequence.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal steps for triplet.\n\nFor the triplet, we need to have three of the same tile. So for each tile type (like 1m, 2p, etc.), count how many are present in the original tiles. Then, for each tile type, the steps needed to form a triplet is (3 - count). The minimal steps for triplet is the minimum of these (3 - count) across all tile types.\n\nBut note that if there are multiple tile types with counts, for example, if the original has two 1m and one 2p, then for triplet, the minimal steps would be min(3-2=1, 3-1=2) => 1.\n\nBut what if there are no tile types with count >=1? Well, since the original has three tiles, there must be at least one tile type with count >=1. So no problem.\n\nSo for the triplet steps, compute min(3 - count for each tile type in the original).\n\nSo the overall steps for the problem is:\n\nCheck if the original tiles already form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute the minimal steps for triplet (triplet_steps) and minimal steps for sequence (sequence_steps). The answer is the minimum between triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nBut how to check if the original tiles already form a mentsu?\n\nSo, for checking if the original three tiles form a mentsu:\n\nCheck if they form a triplet (all three same) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in same suit).\n\nSo, for triplet check:\n\nall three tiles are same.\n\nFor sequence check:\n\nthey are in same suit, and their numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3m → yes.\n\nOr 3m, 2m, 1m → same.\n\nOr 5p, 6p, 7p → yes.\n\nSo, the code for checking existing mentsu is:\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if all(t == tiles[0] for t in tiles):\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    # check same suit\n\n    if len(set(t[1] for t in tiles)) != 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    # extract numbers\n\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n\n    # check if consecutive\n\n    return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1\n\nSo, if this returns True, then answer is 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if they already form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nThe answer is the minimum between triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nNow, how to compute triplet_steps.\n\nCollect the counts of each tile type.\n\nFor example, the original tiles are ['1s', '2s', '3s'] → counts for each tile type: 1s:1, 2s:1, 3s:1. So for each tile type, 3 - count is 2, 2, 2. So triplet_steps is 2. But in this case, the original tiles form a sequence, so the code would have already returned 0.\n\nBut in other cases, like original tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m → counts for 1m is 2, 2m is 1. So triplet_steps is min(3-2=1, 3-1=2) → 1.\n\nSo, triplet_steps is the minimum of (3 - count) for all tile types in the original.\n\nSo, code for triplet_steps:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ncounts = defaultdict(int)\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    counts[t] += 1\n\ntriplet_steps = min(3 - count for count in counts.values())\n\nBut wait, counts.values() is the counts for each tile. For example, if the original tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m → counts would be {'1m':2, '2m':1} → the triplet_steps is min(3-2=1, 3-1=2) → 1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for sequence_steps:\n\nAs discussed earlier.\n\nSo, for each suit, collect the numbers present in the original tiles.\n\nFor example, for the original tiles, group by suit.\n\nsuits = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor t in tiles:\n\n    suit = t[1]\n\n    num = int(t[0])\n\n    suits[suit].append(num)\n\nThen, for each suit in suits:\n\nnumbers_in_suit = sorted(suits[suit])\n\nThen, for each possible sequence (a, a+1, a+2), compute how many of the numbers_in_suit are in that sequence.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nFor example, numbers_in_suit is [1, 2, 4].\n\nFor a=1: sequence is 1,2,3 → count is 2 (1 and 2)\n\nFor a=2: sequence is 2,3,4 → count is 2 (2 and 4)\n\nFor a=3: sequence is 3,4,5 → count is 1 (4)\n\netc.\n\nSo, for each a in 1..7:\n\nsequence = [a, a+1, a+2]\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor num in numbers_in_suit:\n\n    if num in sequence:\n\n        count +=1\n\nsteps_needed = 3 - count.\n\nThen, find the minimal steps_needed across all sequences for this suit.\n\nThen, the overall sequence_steps is the minimal of all these across all suits.\n\nSo, for each suit, we can compute this.\n\nSo, code for sequence_steps:\n\nsequence_steps = infinity\n\nfor suit in suits:\n\n    numbers_in_suit = suits[suit]\n\n    # for this suit, compute min steps to form a sequence\n\n    min_suit_steps = infinity\n\n    for a in range(1, 8):  # a can be 1 to 7, since a+2 can be up to 9\n\n        seq = {a, a+1, a+2}\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for num in numbers_in_suit:\n\n            if num in seq:\n\n                count +=1\n\n        steps_needed = 3 - count\n\n        if steps_needed < min_suit_steps:\n\n            min_suit_steps = steps_needed\n\n    if min_suit_steps < sequence_steps:\n\n        sequence_steps = min_suit_steps\n\nBut wait, what if the suit has less than 1 number? Well, in the code above, suits is built from the original tiles, so for each suit in suits, there is at least one number.\n\nSo, after computing the sequence_steps, the answer is min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps).\n\nBut what if there are no possible sequences? For example, when the original tiles are in different suits, and for each suit, the numbers_in_suit are not enough to form any sequence with adding steps. But that's impossible, because for any suit with at least one tile, there is some sequence that can be formed.\n\nFor example, if a suit has one tile, say 5m. Then, the sequence could be 4,5,6 (needs adding 4 and 6 → steps 2). Or 5,6,7 (needs adding 6 and 7 → steps 2). So the min_suit_steps would be 2.\n\nSo, in that case, the sequence_steps would be 2.\n\nSo, the code for sequence_steps is correct.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead the input: three strings.\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a single line with three strings. For example, in the sample input, the input is given as ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'] but that's probably not the actual input format. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For example, in the sample input, it's written as ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'], but that's probably a mistake. The actual input is three strings separated by spaces, e.g., \"1s 2s 3s\" is one test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSo, for example, the input would be something like:\n\n1s 2s 3s\n\nWhich represents three tiles. But in the sample input, it's written as ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'], but that's probably for the three test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is one line with three strings. So, for example, the first sample input is \"1s 2s 3s\", and the output is 0.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided three examples, which are three separate test cases. So, for the code, the input is three tiles, which are read as a single line split into three parts.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three strings. So the input is a single line with three strings, separated by spaces.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, the first input is '1s 2s 3s' (as a single line), which would be split into three strings. But in the sample input given, the user shows that the input is a list of three strings. But in reality, the code should read a single line, split into three parts.\n\nSo, the code should read the input as:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nBut that would split the input into three strings. For example, if the input is \"1s 2s 3s\", then tiles becomes [\"1s\", \"2s\", \"3s\"].\n\nSo, the code can proceed with that.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if they form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, compute triplet_steps and sequence_steps.\n\nThen, the answer is min(triplet_steps, sequence_steps).\n\nBut wait, what about cases where forming a sequence requires adding more tiles than forming a triplet?\n\nFor example, original tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Triplet steps is 1 (add one more 1m). Sequence steps: for suit m, numbers_in_suit is [1,1,2]. For possible sequences:\n\na=1: sequence 1,2,3. The count is 2 (two 1s and one 2). So steps needed is 3 - 2 = 1. So the sequence steps is 1. So min(1,1) → 1. So answer is 1. But in this case, you can choose either to add a 1m (triplet) or add a 3m (sequence). Either way, one step.\n\nSo the code would return 1.\n\nBut what if the original tiles are 1m, 1m, 3m. Then, triplet steps is 1 (add another 1m). For sequence steps, for suit m, numbers_in_suit is [1,1,3]. For possible sequences:\n\na=1: sequence 1,2,3. count is 2 (two 1s and one 3). steps needed 1 (add 2m). So sequence steps is 1. So answer is 1.\n\nSo the code would return 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All three tiles are same. So triplet, answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Three tiles in same suit, but not consecutive. Like 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, sequence steps is 1 (add 3m). Triplet steps is 2 (add two more 1m, or 2m, or 4m). So answer is 1.\n\nCase 3: Three tiles in different suits. For example, 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, sequence steps would be 2 (for each suit, you need to add two tiles). Triplet steps would be 2 (for each tile, need to add two more). So answer is 2.\n\nBut what if the original tiles are 1m, 1m, 1p. Then, triplet steps is min(3-2=1 (for 1m), 3-1=2 (for 1p)) → 1. For sequence steps, for suit m, numbers are [1,1]. For sequences:\n\na=1: sequence 1,2,3. count is 2 (two 1s). steps needed 1. So sequence steps is 1. So answer is min(1,1) → 1. So the answer is 1. Which is correct: adding 2m would form a sequence of 1, 1, 2? No. Wait, no. A sequence requires three consecutive numbers. So adding 2m and 3m would form 1, 2, 3. But that's two steps. Or adding 2m and 1m (but already have two 1m). Wait, but the original tiles are 1m, 1m, 1p. So for the suit m, numbers are [1,1]. So the code for sequence steps would check for a=1: sequence is 1,2,3. count is 2 (two 1s). steps needed 1 (add 2m). But then, the tiles would be 1m, 1m, 2m. Which is not a sequence. Because the three tiles are 1,1,2. Not consecutive. So the code is wrong here.\n\nWait, this is a problem. The code for the sequence steps is assuming that if you have two of the numbers in the sequence, adding one tile will form a sequence. But that's not the case.\n\nAh, here's a mistake in the logic. The code for the sequence steps computes steps_needed as 3 - count, but that's only if the count is the number of elements in the sequence that are present in the original. However, even if you have 3 - count tiles to add, you have to ensure that the added tiles can complete the sequence.\n\nFor example, in the case where the original numbers_in_suit is [1,1], and the sequence is 1,2,3. The count is 2 (two 1s). steps_needed is 1. But adding 2 would give [1,1,2]. But that's not a sequence. Because a sequence requires three consecutive numbers, each appearing once. So the code's approach is wrong here.\n\nOh no! This is a big mistake. So the previous logic is incorrect. Because the code assumes that adding (3 - count) tiles would be sufficient, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nSo what's the problem here",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw in order to form a valid meld (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Meld**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid meld (triplet or sequence).
