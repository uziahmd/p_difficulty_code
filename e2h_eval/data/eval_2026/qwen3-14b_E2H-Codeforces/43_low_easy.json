He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all 'a's, and there's at least one 'a' here.\n2. B appends some number of 'b's. So after this step, the string has 'a's followed by 'b's. Also, there's at least one 'b' here. So the string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' at this point.\n3. Then C appends some number of 'c's. The number of 'c's must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before adding the 'c's. Also, it's possible that the count of 'c's equals both, but that's okay.\n\nSo, the final string must consist of a bunch of 'a's, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. For example, if there's a 'c' before some 'b's, that's impossible.\n\nSo first, I need to check the order of the string. The string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So any deviation from that order would automatically make it invalid.\n\nFor example, the second example input is 'bbacc'. Let's see: the order is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. So there's an 'a' after 'b's, which is invalid. Hence the output is 'NO'.\n\nSo the first step is to check that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So all a's come first, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then we need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts. Let's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nBut according to the process:\n\nAfter step 1 (A's string), there are count_a_initial = count_a (since B appends b's, and C appends c's. So the original count of a's is count_a. Then B appends some number of b's. Let's say the number of b's added is count_b_initial. Then C appends count_c = either count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nWait, but the count of a's in the string before adding the c's is count_a_initial. Because B added only b's. So when C appends the c's, the count of a's is count_a_initial. The count of b's is count_b_initial. So the number of c's added must be equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nBut in the final string, the count of c's is exactly the number added by C. So count_c must be equal to count_a_initial (which is the original count of a's) or count_b_initial (original count of b's). However, in the final string, count_a_initial is the same as the total count of a's in the string (since no a's were added after step 1). Similarly for count_b_initial.\n\nSo, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. But wait, because count_a is count_a_initial, and count_b is count_b_initial. Because the count of a's and b's in the final string is the same as before adding the c's.\n\nSo the condition is that count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b. But also, the count of a's must be at least 1, count of b's must be at least 1, and count of c's must be at least 1? Or not?\n\nWait, the problem says that after B appends the b's, there is at least one a and one b. So the original count of a's is at least 1 (from A's initial string), and B appends some number of b's, which is at least 1. So count_b_initial is >=1. So in the final string, count_a is the same as the initial count from A, which is >=1. count_b is the same as the count added by B, which is >=1. And count_c is the count added by C, which must be >=1? Because C appends some number of c's. Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. But what if that number is zero? No, because the problem says that the number of letters 'c' he appends is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. The string must be in the form of a sequence of 'a's followed by 'b's, then 'c's, and the number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must be composed of all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Validation**: After ensuring the correct order, we check if the count of 'c's is equal to the count of 'a's or the count of 'b's. Additionally, the counts of 'a's and 'b's must each be at least 1 since they are required to be present after the respective append operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check the order: all a's first, then all b's, then all c's\n    # Iterate through the string and ensure that once a character changes, it doesn't go back to a previous type\n    prev_char = ''\n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if prev_char in ['b', 'c']:\n                return False\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if prev_char == 'c':\n                return False\n        # else char is 'c', no restriction on previous characters\n        prev_char = char\n    \n    # Count the number of a's, b's, c's\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if there is at least one a and one b\n    if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1:\n        return False\n    \n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    if is_valid_string(s):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The function `is_valid_string` first checks if the string follows the order of 'a's followed by 'b's followed by 'c's. If any 'a' or 'b' appears after 'c', the string is invalid.\n2. **Count Check**: After confirming the order, the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are determined. The counts of 'a' and 'b' must be at least 1. The count of 'c' must match either the count of 'a' or 'b'.\n\nThis approach ensures that the string adheres to the constraints specified in the problem, providing an efficient and correct solution.",
