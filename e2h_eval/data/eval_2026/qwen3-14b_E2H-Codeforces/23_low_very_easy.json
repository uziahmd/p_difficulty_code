In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and we have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible cases. For the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, then answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimum number of tiles needed to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n2. If not, find the minimal number of tiles to add to make either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how do I check if the current three tiles form a mentsu?\n\nFor a triplet (koutsu), all three must be the same tile. So for example, 9m,9m,9m. So checking if all three are same.\n\nFor a sequence (shuntsu), they must be three consecutive numbers in the same suit. Like 1s,2s,3s. But the order doesn't matter. So the three tiles must have same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo first step: check if the three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add. Let's think about the possibilities.\n\nLet me consider each case.\n\nCase 1: The three tiles can be part of a triplet. For example, if two tiles are same, then adding one more would form a triplet. So for example, if the current tiles are 1s,1s,2s. Then adding another 1s would make a triplet. So in that case, the answer is 1.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Also, maybe forming a sequence requires fewer tiles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tiles can be part of a sequence. For example, if the three tiles are 1s,2s,3s, then it's already a sequence. So answer 0. If they are 1s,2s,4s, then adding 3s would make a sequence. So answer 1.\n\nSo the approach is: for the given three tiles, check all possibilities of how they can be extended to form a triplet or sequence, and find the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, for the three tiles, check all possible ways to form a triplet or sequence by adding tiles.\n\nFor example, for triplet:\n\nCheck if there are two tiles of the same type. Then adding one more would form a triplet. So if there are two same tiles, then the required draws is 1.\n\nOr, if there is one tile of a certain type, then adding two more would make a triplet. But that would require 2 draws. However, maybe there's a better way.\n\nBut for the minimal case, perhaps the best is to look for the possibility of forming a triplet with minimal additions.\n\nSimilarly for sequences.\n\nBut perhaps the approach is to generate all possible candidates for triplet and sequences, and compute the required number of tiles to reach them.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nFirst, check if current three tiles form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, for the three tiles, check for possible ways to form a triplet or sequence, and find the minimal required draws.\n\nLet me think about the triplet first.\n\nFor triplet:\n\nWe need three identical tiles. Let's count the frequency of each tile.\n\nSuppose the three tiles are A, B, C. For example, if two are same, like A, A, B. Then to form a triplet, we need to add one more A. So required is 1.\n\nIf there's only one of a tile, say A, B, C. Then to form a triplet, we need to add two more of any of them. But that would require 2 draws. However, perhaps there's a better option in terms of sequences.\n\nSo for triplet, the minimal required is based on the maximum count of any tile.\n\nFor example, if the counts are:\n\ncount of tile X is 2, then need 1 more.\n\ncount of tile X is 1, then need 2 more.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to form a triplet with less draws. For example, if there are two different tiles, but maybe adding two tiles of one of them.\n\nBut regardless, the minimal for triplet is 3 - max_count, where max_count is the maximum number of same tiles in the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid mentsu. This can be done by checking if they form a triplet (all three tiles are identical) or a sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit).\n2. **Triplet Check**: If the tiles do not form a valid mentsu, determine the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet. This involves counting the occurrences of each tile and calculating how many more tiles are needed to form a triplet.\n3. **Sequence Check**: Similarly, check for the possibility of forming a sequence by considering all possible sequences that can be formed with the given tiles and calculating the minimum additional tiles required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    tiles = input.split()\n    \n    from collections import Counter\n\n    # Function to check if current tiles form a mentsu\n    def is_mentsu(tiles):\n        # Check for triplet\n        if len(set(tiles)) == 1:\n            return True\n        # Check for sequence\n        # All same suit?\n        suits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n        if len(set(suits)) != 1:\n            return False\n        # Extract numbers and sort\n        nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n        if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    if is_mentsu(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # If not mentsu, calculate minimal draws\n    # Count frequency of each tile\n    cnt = Counter(tiles)\n    max_freq = max(cnt.values())\n    # For triplet, need 3 -
