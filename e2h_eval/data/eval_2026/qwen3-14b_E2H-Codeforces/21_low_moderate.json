The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. Conversely, a chest with an odd a_i needs a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many even and odd chests there are, and then matching them with the available even and odd keys. But how?\n\nLet me break it down. Let's say:\n\n- EvenChests: number of chests with even a_i.\n- OddChests: number of chests with odd a_i.\n\nSimilarly for keys:\n\n- EvenKeys: number of keys with even b_j.\n- OddKeys: number of keys with odd b_j.\n\nNow, for each even chest, we need an odd key. The number of such possible pairs is the minimum between EvenChests and OddKeys. Similarly, for each odd chest, we need an even key. The number here is the minimum between OddChests and EvenKeys. \n\nSo the total maximum chests opened would be min(EvenChests, OddKeys) + min(OddChests, EvenKeys). \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each even chest can be matched with an odd key, but only up to the number of available keys. Similarly for the other case.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity.\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see their parity. 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7).\n\nSo min(3, 1) is 1 (for even chests paired with odd keys). Then min(2, 3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3, which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nChests: 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests =5, odd_chests=0.\n\nKeys: 5 (odd). So even_keys=0, odd_keys=1.\n\nSo min(5, 1) is 1. And min(0, 0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests=1, odd_chests=0. Keys even_keys=4, odd_keys=0. So min(1, 0) is 0, and min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this logic seems to work. \n\nSo the steps are straightforward. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i. Count even and odd.\n\nRead the list of b_j. Count even and odd.\n\nCompute the answer as min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd? For each number in a list, check if it's even or odd. For example, for a_i, even if a_i % 2 == 0.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the a list. Then count even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0), odd_chest = n - even_chest.\n\nSame for the keys: even_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0), odd_key = m - even_key.\n\nThen answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test for the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. The key condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. This means that an even chest number must be paired with an odd key number and vice versa.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chest numbers and the list of key numbers.\n2. **Match Pairs**: Use the counts to determine the maximum possible pairs:\n   - Even chests can be opened by odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be opened by even keys.\n3. **Calculate Result**: The result is the sum of the minimum values between even chests and odd keys, and between odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    res = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Parity Counting**: We count how many chest numbers are even and how many are odd. Similarly, we count the even and odd key numbers.\n3. **Matching Logic**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of two minimum values:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys.\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently match the available keys to the chests based on their parity, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the input size.",
