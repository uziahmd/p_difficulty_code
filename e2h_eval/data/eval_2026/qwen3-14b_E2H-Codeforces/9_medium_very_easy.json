Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, right. So, the classic knapsack problem, but with weights limited to 1, 2, 3. That must be a clue for an efficient solution.\n\nWait, because if all items had arbitrary weights, the standard knapsack approach would be O(nm), which for n=1e5 and m=3e5 would be way too slow. But since the weights are only 1, 2, 3, maybe we can find a way to process each weight group separately.\n\nLet me think. For each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, the problem becomes how to choose how many items of each weight to take, such that their total weight doesn't exceed m, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\n- Separate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n- Sort each group in descending order of cost. Then compute prefix sums for each group.\n- Then, for each possible number of items taken from the weight 1 group, and similarly for weight 2 and 3, find the combination that fits within the total weight m and gives the maximum cost.\n\nBut trying all combinations would be O(n^3), which isn't feasible. Wait, but maybe we can iterate through the possible counts of one group and compute the best for the others.\n\nAlternatively, since the weights are small, perhaps we can use a dynamic programming approach optimized for these weights.\n\nAlternatively, here's another approach. Let's think of it as follows:\n\nWe can take some number of items from each weight group. Let's denote:\n\nFor weight 1: take x items (each contributing 1 to weight, and their cost is prefix1[x])\nFor weight 2: take y items (each contributing 2 to weight, cost prefix2[y])\nFor weight 3: take z items (each contributing 3 to weight, cost prefix3[z])\n\nWe need to maximize prefix1[x] + prefix2[y] + prefix3[z], subject to x + 2y + 3z ≤ m.\n\nBut how do we find x, y, z efficiently?\n\nThe problem is that even with this, iterating through all possible x, y, z is O(n^3) which is not feasible. However, since the maximum m is 3e5, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible z (number of weight 3 items), we can compute the maximum possible for the remaining weight (m - 3z) by considering the weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nSimilarly, for each possible z, we can compute the best combination of x and y where x + 2y ≤ (m - 3z). How can we compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about that. For each z, the remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*z. If rem <0, skip. Then, for this rem, we need to select x and y such that x + 2y ≤ rem. How to find the max sum of prefix1[x] + prefix2[y].\n\nBut again, for each rem, how to find the best x and y. Since rem can be up to 3e5, but for each rem, we can process it in O(rem) time? That might be too slow. Alternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can precompute for all possible capacities up to m, the maximum value possible using those items.\n\nWait, but that's similar to the 0-1 knapsack problem, but with items of weight 1 and 2. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps there's a way to compute this quickly.\n\nLet me think: For the weight 1 items, we have a sorted list. So taking as many as possible of the highest cost items is optimal. Similarly for weight 2.\n\nBut when combining them, it's not straightforward. For example, if I have a capacity of 5, taking 3 weight 1 items (total weight 3) and 1 weight 2 item (weight 2) gives total weight 5. But maybe taking 5 weight 1 items would be better if they have higher total cost. So the problem is that for a given capacity, we need to find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For each possible number of weight 2 items (y), the maximum number of weight 1 items is (rem - 2y). So for a given rem, we can iterate over possible y values, and compute the maximum possible sum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[ (rem - 2y) ].\n\nBut what's the maximum possible y for a given rem? It's min( len(prefix2), rem//2 ). So for each rem, the number of possible y is up to rem//2, which could be up to 1.5e5. And since for each z, rem can be up to m, which is 3e5, this would be O(m * m) in worst case, which is way too slow.\n\nBut wait, perhaps for each possible rem, we can precompute the best combination of x and y. Let's think about the weight 1 and 2 items. How can we find the maximum value for a given capacity?\n\nLet me consider that for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find a way to compute this quickly.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea. For the weight 1 items, we can take as many as possible. For the weight 2 items, same. But when combining, for a given capacity, we can take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items. However, since the weight 2 items are sorted, perhaps for each possible number of weight 2 items, we can compute the best possible.\n\nBut how to find the optimal y for a given capacity?\n\nLet me think: For a given capacity 'c', the maximum value is max{ prefix2[y] + prefix1[ c - 2y ] }, where y ranges from 0 to min( len2, c//2 ), and c - 2y >=0.\n\nBut for each 'c', how can we find the optimal y quickly?\n\nIf we can precompute the prefix arrays for weight 1 and 2, then for each 'c', we can iterate y from 0 to min(len2, c//2), and calculate the corresponding value. But for large c (like 3e5), this would be O(c) per 'c', which is too slow.\n\nBut given that the maximum m is 3e5, and for each z, we have to process up to m, this would be O(m^2) in total, which is 9e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps for each capacity, we can find the optimal y in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nLet me think: For a given capacity c, the maximum number of weight 2 items is y_max = min( len2, c//2 )\n\nWe can try to find the optimal y between 0 and y_max. However, how to find the best y here?\n\nLet me think of it as a function f(y) = prefix2[y] + prefix1[ c - 2y ]\n\nBut since prefix1 is non-decreasing (since we sorted the items in descending order and took prefix sums), as y increases, 2y increases, so c - 2y decreases. Therefore, for each y, the term prefix1[...] decreases as y increases. However, prefix2[y] increases as y increases. So the function f(y) is not necessarily monotonic. Hence, we cannot just take the maximum at the ends.\n\nBut perhaps we can find the optimal y by considering that for a certain y, adding more weight 2 items may be better than taking some weight 1 items.\n\nAlternatively, for a given capacity c, the optimal choice is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, but maybe not all. Because sometimes, taking fewer weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items gives a better total.\n\nBut how to find the optimal y?\n\nAnother idea: For each capacity c, the maximum possible value is the maximum between taking some number of weight 2 items and filling the rest with weight 1 items. Let's suppose that for each possible y, the number of weight 1 items is (c - 2y), but since we can't take more than the available items, we have to take min( (c - 2y), len1 ) items of weight 1.\n\nBut even then, how to find the best y?\n\nAlternatively, for each capacity c, the optimal y is either floor( (c)/2 ), or floor( (c)/2 ) -1, etc. But this seems not helpful.\n\nWait, but perhaps for the weight 2 items, since they are sorted, the prefix2 array is non-decreasing. Similarly for prefix1. So, for a fixed capacity c, the maximum value of f(y) can be found by considering that for each y, the value is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(c - 2y, len1) ].\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly.\n\nLet me think about the following: For each possible capacity c, the optimal number of weight 2 items is between max(0, (c - len1) // 2 ) and min( len2, c//2 ). Because if you take y weight 2 items, then the remaining capacity is c - 2y, which can be filled with up to (c - 2y) weight 1 items. However, if (c - 2y) exceeds the number of weight 1 items available, then we take all of them.\n\nBut even so, for a given c, how do we find the best y?\n\nAlternatively, here's a trick: For each possible c, we can take all possible y up to min(len2, c//2), but since len2 can be up to 1e5, and for each z (for weight 3 items), this could be expensive.\n\nBut given that the weight 3 items are handled in a loop, and for each possible z, the rem is m - 3*z, which could be up to m, and for each such rem, we have to find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items. So perhaps the overall approach is:\n\n- Preprocess the weight 1, 2, 3 items into sorted lists and prefix sums.\n\nThen, for each possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), compute rem = m - 3*z. If rem is negative, skip. Then, for rem, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items. Then, add the prefix3[z] to that value. Keep track of the maximum overall.\n\nNow, the key is how to compute the maximum value for the weight 1 and 2 items given a capacity rem.\n\nBut how to compute that quickly.\n\nLet me think about the following: For each possible rem, the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items can be found by considering all possible numbers of weight 2 items (y) up to min(len2, rem//2), and then taking the maximum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(rem - 2*y, len1) ].\n\nBut even if this is O(k) for each rem, where k is the number of weight 2 items, then for each z, the time is O(k), and with z up to len3 (which can be up to 1e5), this would be O(1e5 * 1e5) = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm, that's not feasible. So we need a better way.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the weight 1 and 2 items. Let's say we have two arrays: a sorted list of weight 1 items (sorted descending), and similarly for weight 2.\n\nFor the weight 1 items, the prefix sum is s1, where s1[k] is the sum of the first k items. Similarly for s2 for weight 2.\n\nNow, for a given capacity c, the maximum value is the maximum of s2[y] + s1[x], where x + 2y ≤ c. But x can be up to min( (c - 2y), len1 ), and y can be up to min( (c//2), len2 )\n\nBut how to find this maximum efficiently.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For a given capacity c, the maximum value is the maximum between taking as many weight 2 items as possible and filling the rest with weight 1, or taking one less weight 2 item and filling the rest, etc. But perhaps we can find the optimal y by checking around the point where 2y is as large as possible.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given capacity c, the optimal number of weight 2 items is either floor((c)/2), or floor((c)/2) - 1, etc., but this is not necessarily true.\n\nAnother approach is to note that for the weight 2 items, since they are sorted, taking the first y items gives the maximum possible sum. Similarly for weight 1. So for a given c, the best combination would be to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find the best y?\n\nLet me think of the following: For each possible y, the maximum number of weight 1 items is (c - 2y). But since we can't take more than len1 items, the actual number is min( len1, c - 2y ). So for each possible y, we can calculate the value s2[y] + s1[ min( len1, c - 2y ) ].\n\nBut how can we find the maximum of this expression over all valid y?\n\nLet me consider that for y in [0, y_max], where y_max is min( len2, c//2 )\n\nBut for each c, the maximum of this expression can be found by considering that for y in this range, the term s2[y] increases, while the term s1[...] decreases. So the function may have a single peak, and we can perform ternary search on y to find the maximum.\n\nBut is the function unimodal?\n\nWell, s2[y] increases as y increases, and s1[...] decreases as y increases. The sum could be unimodal, but not necessarily. For example, imagine that adding a weight 2 item gives a small increase in s2[y], but allows us to take many more weight 1 items. Or the opposite. So it's not clear.\n\nHowever, given that the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, and the same for weight 2, perhaps the function is unimodal. For example, when you increase y by 1, the gain in s2 is the next weight 2 item's cost, and the loss in s1 is the cost of the weight 1 items that you can no longer take (since you have 2 more weight units taken by the weight 2 item). But since the weight 2 items are more expensive than the weight 1 items (or not?), it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that for a given capacity c, the optimal y is the one where 2y is as close as possible to c - k, where k is the number of weight 1 items taken. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think of another way.\n\nSince the weight of the items is small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can model this as a dynamic programming problem with states based on the weight.\n\nLet me think of the standard knapsack approach. For each item, we can decide to take it or not. But for n=1e5 and m=3e5, the standard DP approach is O(nm) which is 3e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nBut since the weights are limited to 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can optimize the DP.\n\nLet me think of the standard 0-1 knapsack DP:\n\ndp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - w_i] + c_i)\n\nBut for each weight w_i, we can process it in a way that optimizes for the small weights.\n\nBut even then, with n=1e5 and m=3e5, this is O(nm) which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to group items by their weight and process them in batches.\n\nFor example, for all items of weight 1, we can process them in a way that for each possible count of items, we can compute the maximum value. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think again about the initial idea of grouping the items by weight and taking as many as possible from each group.\n\nSuppose we have for weight 1 items sorted in descending order, and for weight 2 items sorted similarly. Then, for a given capacity, the optimal selection would be to take as many of the highest value items as possible.\n\nBut when combining different weights, this isn't straightforward.\n\nAnother idea: For each weight group, compute the prefix sums. Then, for each possible number of weight 1 items (x), we can compute the maximum number of weight 2 items (y) that can fit with x, and vice versa. But again, this seems like it would be O(n^2) time.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is small, maybe we can use a greedy approach. For example, take the items with the highest value per unit weight. But since the weight can be 1, 2, or 3, this might not work. For example, a weight 2 item with value 3 (1.5 per unit) is better than a weight 1 item with value 1 (1 per unit). But if you have a capacity of 2, taking the weight 2 item is better. However, if there are multiple items, it's possible that taking two weight 1 items with value 1 each (total 2) is better than one weight 2 item with value 3. So the greedy approach of taking the highest value per unit weight may not work.\n\nThus, the problem requires an exact solution, not a greedy approximation.\n\nBack to the previous approach of handling the three weight groups separately. Let's think again about the following steps:\n\n1. Preprocess the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3. Sort each group in descending order of cost. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n2. Iterate over the possible number of weight 3 items (z) that can be taken. For each z, compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*z. If rem is negative, skip. Then, for this rem, find the maximum value from the weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nThe question is how to find the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items for a given rem.\n\nLet me think about this. For rem, the maximum value can be found by considering all possible combinations of x and y where x + 2y ≤ rem. How to find this maximum quickly?\n\nHere's an alternative idea: For a given rem, we can take up to min(len1, rem) items of weight 1. Let's call this x_max = min(len1, rem). The corresponding value is s1[x_max]. Then, for each possible y from 0 to min(len2, rem//2), we can take y items of weight 2, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (x = min(rem - 2y, len1)), and see if that gives a better value.\n\nBut even this approach would require O(len2) operations per rem. However, len2 can be up to 1e5, and for each z, the rem can be up to m. So with z up to len3 (up to 1e5), this would be O(1e5 * 1e5) = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible for the given constraints.\n\nHmm. What else can I do? Let me think again about the problem. Since the weight is limited to 1, 2, 3, maybe there's a way to model this with a DP that uses the fact that the weights are small.\n\nLet me think about the standard knapsack DP, but optimized for small weights.\n\nLet me consider that for each item, we can process it in O(1) time per weight. But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, that would be O(n * 3) = 3e5 operations, which is acceptable. Wait, that can't be right. How?\n\nWait, the standard knapsack approach for 0-1 knapsack is O(nm), but when the items are grouped by weight, perhaps we can find a way to compute the DP more efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, here's a different approach. Since the items have weights 1, 2, or 3, we can process them in groups.\n\nFor example, for items of weight 1, since they are sorted in descending order, we can compute the best way to take some of them. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following: Let's create a DP array where dp[w] represents the maximum value achievable with total weight exactly w. Then, for each item, we can update the DP array. However, with m up to 3e5, this would be O(nm), which is too slow for n=1e5.\n\nBut since the items are grouped by weight, maybe we can process them in bulk. For example, for all items of weight 1, we can compute the best way to include them into the DP.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the weight 1 items. They are sorted in descending order. For each possible number of items taken (from 0 to len1), the cost is the prefix sum. For each possible weight w, the maximum value is the maximum between the current dp[w] and dp[w - k] + s1[k], where k is the number of items taken (each of weight 1). But how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut since the weight is 1, taking k items contributes k weight and s1[k] value. For a given weight w, the maximum value would be the maximum of dp[w -k] + s1[k] for all k from 0 to min(w, len1). But this is O(w) per weight, which again is not feasible.\n\nBut here's a trick: For weight 1 items, the optimal way to take them is to take as many as possible. Because each item has higher cost than the ones after. So for any capacity, taking the first k items (sorted in descending order) gives the best possible value for that number of items. Thus, for weight 1 items, the best way to include them is to take as many as possible, given the capacity.\n\nWait, but how does that help? Because when combined with other items, it's not obvious.\n\nBut perhaps, for the entire problem, we can precompute for each possible weight, the maximum value achievable using only weight 1 and 2 items. Then, for the weight 3 items, we can process them similarly.\n\nAlternatively, here's another idea inspired by the fact that the weights are small. Let's precompute for each possible weight up to m, the maximum value achievable using only items of weight 1 and 2. Then, for each possible number of weight 3 items, we can subtract their weight from m and look up the precomputed maximum for the remaining weight.\n\nBut how to compute this precomputed array.\n\nLet me think: Let's call this array dp. dp[w] is the maximum value for weight exactly w, using items of weight 1 and 2. But how to compute this.\n\nWait, but even if we have items of weight 1 and 2, the standard knapsack approach would be O(m * (len1 + len2)), which is again too slow.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nFor example, for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted, we can take as many as possible. For a given weight w, the maximum value from weight 1 items is s1[min(w, len1)]. Similarly for weight 2 items, the maximum value from them is s2[min(w//2, len2)].\n\nBut combining them is not straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps for each possible capacity w, the best way is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items. So for each w, the maximum is max over y (s2[y] + s1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ]) for y from 0 to min( len2, w//2 )\n\nThis brings us back to the same problem as before. But how to compute this for all w up to m efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following: For all possible w, we can iterate through the possible y values for weight 2 items and compute the corresponding x for weight 1 items. However, this would be O(m * len2) time, which for m=3e5 and len2=1e5 is 3e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nBut what if we precompute for each possible y, the contribution to various w's?\n\nAlternatively, here's an observation: For the weight 1 and 2 items, the maximum value for capacity w can be computed by considering all possible combinations of taking x items of weight 1 and y items of weight 2, such that x + 2y ≤ w. Since x can be up to min(w, len1), and y up to min(w//2, len2).\n\nBut again, this seems like the same problem.\n\nLet me try to think of it differently. For a given capacity w, the maximum number of weight 2 items is y_max = min(len2, w//2). For each y in 0 to y_max, the remaining capacity is w - 2y. The maximum number of weight 1 items is x = min(w - 2y, len1). So the total value is s2[y] + s1[x].\n\nBut what if we precompute for each possible y, the maximum x for all possible w?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted, and the weight 1 items are also sorted, perhaps for each possible y, the best w for which this y contributes to is when 2y + x is as large as possible. But this doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible y, we can compute the contribution to all w >= 2y. For example, for a fixed y, the maximum contribution to any w >= 2y is s2[y] + s1[ min( w - 2y, len1) ].\n\nBut how to compute this for all w.\n\nFor example, for a fixed y, the contribution to w is s2[y] + s1[ min( w - 2y, len1) ].\n\nThis is equivalent to, for each w >= 2y, we can add this value to the dp[w], but we need to find the maximum over all possible y.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the following: For all possible w, the maximum value for weight 1 and 2 items is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking no weight 2 items: s1[ min(w, len1) ]\n\n- Taking one weight 2 item: s2[1] + s1[ min(w - 2, len1) ]\n\n- Taking two weight 2 items: s2[2] + s1[ min(w -4, len1) ]\n\n...\n\nUp to y_max.\n\nBut how to compute this for all w in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nWait, for a given w, the optimal y is the one that maximizes s2[y] + s1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ].\n\nLet me think of this as follows: For each w, the optimal y is the one that makes 2y as close as possible to w - x, where x is the number of weight 1 items. But I'm stuck.\n\nPerhaps we can precompute for each possible y, the maximum contribution to all w >= 2y. For example, for a fixed y, the contribution is s2[y] + s1[ min( (w - 2y), len1) ].\n\nBut since s1 is a non-decreasing array (because we added items in descending order), for a fixed y, as w increases, the contribution increases. So for each y, the contribution for w >= 2y is s2[y] + s1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ].\n\nNow, for each w, the maximum over all y is the maximum of these contributions.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of it as for each possible w, we want to find the maximum value of s2[y] + s1[ min( (w - 2y), len1) ] for all y such that 2y <= w.\n\nLet me define k = w - 2y. Then, y = (w -k)/2. But this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, for a given w, the term (w - 2y) is the remaining capacity for weight 1 items. Let me call this r = w - 2y. So r >= 0, and y can be up to min(w//2, len2).\n\nSo for each w, the maximum value is the maximum of s2[y] + s1[ min(r, len1) ] where r = w - 2y, and y ranges from 0 to y_max.\n\nBut how to find this maximum.\n\nLet me consider that for a given w, r can vary from w (when y=0) down to w - 2*y_max (when y=y_max). But since s1 is non-decreasing, for a fixed r, the maximum is achieved by taking as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nWait, but r is determined by y. For each y, r is w - 2y. So for each y, the value is s2[y] + s1[ min(r, len1) ].\n\nNow, for a given w, let's imagine that we can iterate over all possible y and calculate this. But again, this is O(y_max) per w.\n\nBut what if we precompute for all possible w, the maximum of s2[y] + s1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ] for y in 0 to y_max.\n\nBut how to do this quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each possible y, we can contribute to the range of w from 2y to 2y + (len1). For example, for a fixed y, the contribution is s2[y] + s1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ].\n\nBut since s1 is non-decreasing, for a fixed y, the contribution for w >= 2y is s2[y] + s1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ].\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For each y, the contribution for w is s2[y] + s1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ].\n\nNow, for each w, the maximum contribution is the maximum over all y such that 2y <= w of this expression.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nMaybe for each w, the optimal y is the one that maximizes s2[y] + s1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ].\n\nBut how to find this y quickly.\n\nLet me consider that for a given w, the optimal y is around (w - k)/2, where k is the number of weight 1 items. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since s1 is non-decreasing and s2 is non-decreasing, perhaps for a given w, the optimal y is either the floor((w - x)/2), where x is the number of weight 1 items. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me think of the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo n=2, m=2.\n\nThe items are:\n\nItem 1: weight 1, cost 3\n\nItem 2: weight 2, cost 2.\n\nThe best is to take the first item, total cost 3.\n\nBut according to the sample output, it's 3.\n\nIn this case, for the rem=2, we can take y=1 (weight 2 item, cost 2) or y=0 and x=2 (but there's only 1 item of weight 1, so x=1, cost 3). So the maximum is 3.\n\nSo for this case, the optimal y is 0.\n\nAnother example: suppose we have weight 1 items with high cost. For example, if there are 5 items of weight 1 with cost 10 each, and a weight 2 item with cost 19. For capacity 2, taking the weight 2 item gives 19, which is better than taking two weight 1 items (20). So in this case, it's better to take the weight 2 item.\n\nBut how to find this automatically.\n\nMaybe the optimal y is around (w - x)/2, but without knowing x, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: For a given w, the optimal y is either floor(w/2), floor(w/2) -1, ..., up to some small number of possibilities. For example, check up to 100 possibilities around the maximum possible y. This would be O(1) per w.\n\nBut how to choose how many possibilities to check.\n\nIf the number of possibilities is small (like 200), then for each w, this would be O(200) operations, which for m=3e5 would be 6e7 operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut why would this work? Well, if the optimal y is near the maximum possible y, or near the point where the weight 2 items' value is balanced with the weight 1 items' value.\n\nLet me think: For a given w, the maximum possible y is y_max = min(len2, w//2). Let's say we try y_max, y_max-1, ..., y_max - k, and also y_max + ... ? No, since y can't exceed y_max.\n\nSo for each w, we can try y in the range from max(0, y_max - 100) to y_max, and compute the corresponding value. This would give us a good approximation, assuming that the optimal y is within this range.\n\nBut this is a heuristic, and may not work for all cases. However, given the time constraints, this might be the only feasible way to proceed.\n\nLet me think about this. For example, in the earlier case where taking y=0 gives a better result than y=1, but y_max is 1 (w=2), then checking y=1 and y=0 would capture the optimal.\n\nIn the case where the optimal y is somewhere in the middle, this approach would miss it. But given that the time is limited, perhaps this is the best way to proceed.\n\nBut how to determine the number of candidates to check. For example, checking up to 200 candidates for each w.\n\nLet me try to implement this approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess the weight 1, 2, 3 items into sorted lists and prefix sums.\n\n- For each possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), compute rem = m - 3*z. If rem < 0, skip.\n\n- For this rem, compute the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nTo compute this, for the given rem, we compute y_max = min(len2, rem // 2). Then, we try y in the range from max(0, y_max - 200) to y_max. For each y in this range, compute x = min(rem - 2*y, len1), and calculate s2[y] + s1[x]. Also, we should also consider y=0, and possibly other nearby values.\n\nBut why 200? Well, it's a guess, but it's a way to cover enough possibilities to find the optimal value.\n\nThis is a heuristic, but given that the time is tight, perhaps this is the only way to proceed.\n\nLet me test this approach on the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 1 1\n\nItem: weight 2, cost 1.\n\nSo, m=1. The maximum weight is 1. So no items can be taken. Output is 0.\n\nExample 2:\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\nItems are weight 1 (cost 3), weight 2 (cost 2). For rem=2, y_max is 1. So check y=1 and y=0.\n\nFor y=1: 2*1 = 2, rem - 2y = 0 → x=0. Total is 2 + 0 = 2.\n\nFor y=0: x=2, but len1 is 1. So x=1, total is 0 + 3 = 3. So maximum is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: if there are two weight 2 items with cost 19 and 18, and rem=2. y_max is 1. So check y=1 and y=0. y=1 gives cost 19, y=",
