Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with the examples given. For instance, the input 'ababa' has substrings like 'aba' which appears starting at index 0 and 2. So the length here is 3. The output for that case is 3. For 'zzz', the longest substring that appears at least twice is 'zz' (since 'zzz' occurs once, but 'zz' occurs twice, overlapping). So the output is 2.\n\nThe challenge is to find all possible substrings, check their occurrences, and find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nHmm. How do I efficiently check all possible substrings?\n\nAn initial thought: For each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. Because we want the maximum possible.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths L from the maximum possible (which is len(s)//2, since a substring longer than that can't appear twice) down to 1.\n\nWait, no. For example, in a string of length 5, like 'aaaaa', the maximum possible L is 4, since 'aaaa' occurs twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1. But for the substring to appear at least twice, the maximum possible length is len(s) - 1, but only if the first len(s)-1 characters are same as the last len(s)-1. But for the general case, perhaps checking all possible lengths from len(s) down to 1, but for each length, check if any substring of that length occurs at least twice.\n\nBut for each L, how do I check if there's a substring of length L that occurs at least twice?\n\nFor each L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears more than once.\n\nBut generating all substrings for each L and checking their counts. However, for small strings (like up to 100 characters), this approach is feasible.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n- For the given string s, iterate possible L from len(s) down to 1.\n\n- For each L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\n- The first L where this is true is the answer.\n\n- If none found, return 0.\n\nBut wait, for example, for the input 'abcd', the maximum possible L is 4, but there's only one substring of length 4. So no duplicates. Then check L=3: substrings are 'abc', 'bcd' — no duplicates. Then L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — no duplicates. Then L=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' — each occurs once. So answer is 0.\n\nWhich matches the first example.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, for each possible L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n   For each start index i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n      substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n      check if this substring appears again in the string.\n\nBut how to check if it appears again? For each substring, we can collect all the substrings of length L and see if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, collect all substrings of length L into a set, and check if any substring appears more than once.\n\nWait, but for example, if the same substring occurs multiple times, then the count would be more than once. So for each L, we can create a set of substrings, but track their occurrences. But maybe using a dictionary to count frequencies.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking existence, perhaps for each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears more than once.\n\nSo for each L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if there's a duplicate.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nFor example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So when we collect them, 'aba' appears twice. So for this L, we return True.\n\nSo for each L, we can generate all substrings of length L, and check if there's at least one duplicate.\n\nSo the steps for each L:\n\n- Generate all substrings of length L, and store them in a list.\n\n- Check if the length of the list is not equal to the length of the set created from the list.
