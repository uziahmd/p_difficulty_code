Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending 0s and 1s. After each append, we need to calculate the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. But there are some invalid Morse codes that don't correspond to any letters. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the substrings translate into valid letters. Each valid Morse code is a string of length 1-4, made of 0s and 1s, except those four specific ones. So, for every substring of S that is of length between 1 and 4, we check if it's a valid Morse code. If it is, then it represents a letter. Then, the problem counts all possible sequences of these letters that can be formed from substrings. Wait, but the question says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". Oh right, so each such sequence is a concatenation of one or more letters, where each letter's Morse code is a substring of S. But how do the substrings relate? Because each letter's Morse code is a substring of S. However, the same substring can be part of multiple sequences. \n\nWait no, perhaps the problem is not about sequences of letters, but about the number of possible distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by breaking the string S into parts where each part is a valid Morse code. For example, if S is \"111\", then possible sequences are:\n\n- \"T\" (from first '1')\n- \"M\" (from first two '1's)\n- \"O\" (from all three '1's)\n- \"TT\" (from first '1' and second '1')\n- \"TM\" (from first '1' and next two '1's)\n- \"MT\" (from first two '1's and third '1')\n- \"TTT\" (from three '1's as three T's)\nBut wait, the note says that for the sample input \"111\", the answer is 7. Which matches the count given. So the problem is counting all possible ways to split the string S into valid Morse code letters, considering different splits as different sequences. \n\nBut how does that work for the entire string S? Because for each position in the string, we can split it into valid letters. So the total number of sequences would be the sum over all possible splits of the string into valid Morse code letters. However, the problem statement says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nAh! The problem says that each such sequence is represented by some substring of S. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. Wait, perhaps each such sequence is a sequence of letters, where each letter's Morse code is a substring of S. But that seems vague. Or maybe it's the number of possible sequences that can be formed by taking substrings of S (each of which is a valid Morse code) and concatenating them. But that would be the same as the number of ways to split the string into valid Morse code letters, considering all possible splits. However, the sample input shows that for S = \"111\", the answer is 7. Let's see:\n\nThe possible splits are:\n\n- [1] → T\n- [11] → M\n- [111] → O\n- [1,1] → TT\n- [1,11] → TM\n- [11,1] → MT\n- [1,1,1] → TTT\n\nThat's 7 possibilities. So the answer counts all possible ways to split the entire string into valid Morse codes. But wait, the problem says \"some substring of S\". So perhaps the problem isn't about splitting the entire string, but considering all possible substrings of S that are valid Morse codes, and then counting all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by combining these substrings. But that would be a lot more than the sample. For example, in the sample S is \"111\", the valid substrings are:\n\nLength 1: positions 1, 2, 3 → \"1\", \"1\", \"1\" → each valid.\n\nLength 2: \"11\" (positions 1-2), \"11\" (positions 2-3) → valid.\n\nLength 3: \"111\" → valid.\n\nSo there are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 substrings. But the sample answer is 7. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is counting all possible sequences of letters where each letter's Morse code is a substring of S. For example, each individual valid substring is a single-letter sequence, and combinations of such substrings (non-overlapping, but not necessarily covering the entire string) would be counted as sequences. But that would be an enormous number, and the sample doesn't fit. For example, in the sample, the answer is 7, but with the substrings, there are 6 valid substrings. Each of them can be considered as a single-letter sequence. Then sequences like \"T\" (from first 1), \"T\" (from second 1), etc. But since they are different substrings, but same letter, but the problem says \"sequences of English letters\"—so the sequence is the same if the letters are same, but the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". Wait, but the problem says \"represented with some substring of S\". So for example, if the same letter's Morse code appears multiple times as substrings, each occurrence is considered as a separate possibility. But that's not how the sample works. Because in the sample, the answer is 7, which includes the 3 single letters (each T, M, O?), but also the combinations. Wait, the sample explanation lists 7 possibilities. So perhaps the problem is not about splitting the entire string into valid Morse code letters, but about all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by choosing any collection of non-overlapping substrings (but not necessarily covering the entire string) that are valid Morse code. However, that seems very complex and the sample doesn't match. \n\nWait, the problem's note says that in the first sample, after S is \"111\", the answer is 7. The explanation lists 7 sequences. These sequences are the different ways to split the entire string into valid Morse codes. So the answer is the number of ways to split the entire string into valid Morse code letters. But then, how does that work for other cases?\n\nFor example, if S is \"1\", then the answer is 1 (only one way). If S is \"11\", then the answer is 2: either split into two 1's (two Ts) or one 11 (M). So the answer would be 2. But according to the first sample input, when m=3 and the input is 1,1,1, the outputs are 1,3,7. Let's see:\n\nAfter first step, S is \"1\". The answer is 1.\n\nAfter second step, S is \"11\". The possible splits are:\n\nSplit into [1,1] → 2 letters (TT), or [11] → 1 letter (M). So total of 2 possibilities. But according to the sample output for the first input, after the second step, the answer is 3. Wait that contradicts. Wait the first sample input is:\n\nSample Input 1: 3\\n1\\n1\\n1\n\nSample Output: 1\\n3\\n7.\n\nWait after the second step, the answer is 3. Hmm. So that suggests that my previous understanding is wrong.\n\nLet me think again. What's the correct approach here?\n\nThe problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code. \n\nSo for example, each valid Morse code substring corresponds to a letter. So for each valid substring, that's a single-letter sequence. Then, any combination of these substrings (non-overlapping, but possibly overlapping in the string) that form a sequence. Wait, but how? Because sequences can be formed by any collection of valid substrings, as long as they are in order. However, this seems to be an exponentially large number. \n\nBut the sample input after the second step (S is \"11\") would have:\n\nValid substrings are:\n\n\"1\" (positions 1), \"1\" (position 2), \"11\" (positions 1-2).\n\nEach of these is a valid code. So the sequences would be:\n\n- [1] (from first 1)\n- [1] (from second 1)\n- [11]\n- [1,1]\n- [1,11] (but wait, the first 1 and then the 11 would overlap. But the problem says that the sequences are represented with some substring. So perhaps the substrings can be overlapping. But the sequences are sequences of letters, each of which is represented by some substring. So the sequences are just any ordered list of letters where each letter's Morse code is a substring of S. But this would be infinite if the same letter is used multiple times. But the problem says \"non-empty sequences\", and the answer for the first sample after two steps is 3. Let's see:\n\nIn the sample after two steps, S is \"11\".\n\nThe valid Morse codes are:\n\n\"1\", \"1\", \"11\".\n\nEach of these is a valid code. So the possible sequences are:\n\n- [T] (from first \"1\")\n- [T] (from second \"1\")\n- [M] (from \"11\")\n- [T, T] (from first and second \"1\")\n- [T, M] (from first \"1\" and \"11\"? But the \"11\" starts at position 1. So the first \"1\" is position 1, and the \"11\" is positions 1-2. But if you take the first \"1\" and then the \"11\", they overlap. So is that allowed? The problem says that the sequences are represented by some substring of S. So each letter's code must be a substring. But the substrings can be overlapping. So the sequence [T, M] would correspond to taking the first \"1\" (substring 1) and the \"11\" (substring 1-2). But the substrings can overlap. So that would be allowed. \n\nBut then, the number of sequences would be the sum over all possible combinations of valid substrings (non-empty) that can be ordered in a way that their positions in the string are in order. But that's a lot. How do we count that?\n\nThis seems very complex. However, the sample after two steps gives an answer of 3. Let's think again. For the sample input after two steps (S is \"11\"):\n\nThe possible sequences are:\n\nEach individual valid substring is a single-letter sequence. There are three of them.\n\nThen, sequences of two letters: each pair of valid substrings that can be ordered in sequence. For example, the first \"1\" and the second \"1\" (positions 1 and 2). The first \"1\" and the \"11\" (positions 1 and 1-2). The second \"1\" and the \"11\" (positions 2 and 1-2? No, because the \"11\" starts at position 1. So the second \"1\" is at position 2, and the \"11\" is from 1 to 2. So the sequence could be [second \"1\", \"11\"]? But that would imply that the first element is the substring at position 2 (length 1) and the second is the substring 1-2 (length 2). But the first substring ends at position 2, and the second starts at position 1. That would overlap. But the problem allows that? \n\nBut according to the sample, after two steps, the answer is 3. Which suggests that there are only three sequences. But according to the above reasoning, there are more than three. So clearly, my understanding is incorrect. \n\nLet me re-examine the note. In the first sample, after appending three 1s, S is \"111\". The answer is 7. The note lists the seven sequences as:\n\n- T (from \"1\")\n- M (from \"11\")\n- O (from \"111\")\n- TT (from two \"1\"s)\n- TM (from \"1\" and \"11\")\n- MT (from \"11\" and \"1\")\n- TTT (from three \"1\"s)\n\nSo the sequences are formed by splitting the entire string into valid Morse code letters. So the count is the number of ways to split the entire string into valid Morse code letters. So for example, in the case of S being \"11\", the possible splits are:\n\n- Split into two \"1\"s → TT\n- Split into one \"11\" → M\n\nSo that's two possibilities. But according to the first sample's second step, the answer is 3. Which contradicts this. So what's going on here?\n\nWait, the first sample input is:\n\nInput is 3 steps, appending 1, then 1, then 1. The outputs are 1, 3, 7.\n\nAfter the first step (S is \"1\"), answer is 1 → makes sense (split into one part).\n\nAfter the second step (S is \"11\"), answer is 3. So according to this, there are three sequences. What are they?\n\nPossibly:\n\n- [T] (from first 1)\n- [T] (from second 1)\n- [M] (from the entire 11)\n- [TT] (split into two Ts)\n\nWait, but that's four possibilities. But the answer is 3. So perhaps the problem counts sequences of letters, but each sequence is considered as a unique sequence regardless of which substrings they come from. For example, [T] (from first 1) and [T] (from second 1) are considered the same sequence. But in that case, the answer would be 3: [T], [M], [TT]. Which would explain the sample answer of 3. But how does that fit with the note's explanation?\n\nIn the note's example, the sequences are different based on how they are split. Like, \"TT\" is from splitting into two Ts, but the same as two Ts. However, the note counts them as different sequences. Wait, no. The note says that the sequences are \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". So each of these is a unique sequence of letters. So for example, \"TT\" is a sequence of two Ts, and \"TM\" is a sequence of T followed by M. So the count is based on the actual sequences of letters, not the splits. So the problem is to count all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting the entire string into valid Morse code letters. So the answer is the number of ways to split the entire string into valid Morse code letters, where each split corresponds to a unique sequence of letters. \n\nBut then, for the second step (S is \"11\"), the answer should be 2: either split into two Ts or one M. But the sample says the answer is 3. So something is wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about splitting the entire string, but about all possible ways to split any substring of S into valid Morse code letters. For example, for S being \"11\", the substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (positions 1)\n- \"1\" (positions 2)\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2)\n\nEach of these substrings can be split into valid Morse code letters. For each of these substrings, the number of ways to split them into valid letters. Then, the total answer is the sum over all possible substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters. \n\nIn the first sample, after the second step (S is \"11\"), the substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (positions 1): 1 way → T\n- \"1\" (positions 2): 1 way → T\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2): 2 ways (split into two Ts or one M)\nTotal is 1+1+2 = 4. But the sample output is 3. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Let me look back at the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nSo for each possible substring of S (which is a valid Morse code), that corresponds to a single letter. So each such substring contributes 1 to the count. Additionally, sequences of letters that are formed by combining multiple substrings. But how?\n\nFor example, if S is \"11\", then the substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (positions 1) → T\n- \"1\" (positions 2) → T\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2) → M\n\nSo the non-empty sequences are:\n\n- T (from the first \"1\")\n- T (from the second \"1\")\n- M (from the \"11\")\n- TT (from combining the first and second \"1\")\n- TM (from first \"1\" and \"11\")\n- MT (from \"11\" and second \"1\")\n- TTT (from combining three \"1\"s? No, but S is \"11\", so that's not possible.)\n\nWait, but how can you combine the first \"1\" and the \"11\"? The first \"1\" is the first character, and the \"11\" is the entire string. So they overlap. But the problem says that the sequences are represented by some substring of S. So each letter's Morse code is a substring of S. But the sequence is a sequence of letters, each of which has a Morse code that is a substring of S. However, the substrings can be overlapping. So the sequence [T, M] is allowed, because T's code is \"1\" (a substring) and M's code is \"11\" (another substring). So the total number of sequences would be all possible combinations of letters where each letter's code is a substring of S, and the sequence is non-empty. \n\nBut this is a huge number. For example, if S is \"11\", then the number of sequences would be:\n\nEach individual letter: 3 (the two Ts and one M).\n\nThen sequences of two letters: each pair of letters where their codes are substrings of S. For example, T followed by T (since both codes exist), T followed by M (since both codes exist), M followed by T (same as above), T followed by T again (if there are multiple Ts), etc. But since the same code can be used multiple times (as different substrings), this seems to lead to infinite possibilities unless we consider that each occurrence is counted as a separate possibility. \n\nBut this seems impossible given the sample input. For example, in the first sample after two steps, the answer is 3. But according to this reasoning, it should be larger than 3. \n\nThis suggests that my initial understanding of the problem is incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem says: \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nAh! Maybe the key here is that each sequence is represented by a single substring of S. So the entire sequence's Morse code is a single substring of S. For example, a sequence of two letters would require that the concatenation of their Morse codes is a substring of S. But this is not the case. For example, in the note's example, the sequence \"TM\" is represented by the substring \"11\" (the Morse code of T is \"1\", and of M is \"11\", but concatenated they would be \"111\", which is not a substring of S. But according to the note, \"TM\" is considered a valid sequence. Therefore, this interpretation is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that each letter in the sequence is represented by a substring of S, but these substrings can be any, not necessarily contiguous. So the sequence is a list of letters, each of which has a Morse code that is a substring of S. So the count is the number of such sequences. But how is this possible? Because for S being \"11\", the number of sequences would be infinite (for example, T, T, T, ... as many as you want). But the sample shows finite numbers, so this must not be the case.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me look back at the note's explanation. It says that for S = \"111\", the answer is 7. The explanation lists the sequences as:\n\n- T (from \"1\")\n- M (from \"11\")\n- O (from \"111\")\n- TT (from two \"1\"s)\n- TM (from \"1\" and \"11\")\n- MT (from \"11\" and \"1\")\n- TTT (from three \"1\"s)\n\nSo the sequences are formed by splitting the entire string into valid Morse codes. Thus, the answer is the number of ways to split the entire string into valid Morse codes. \n\nSo for the first sample, after the second step (S is \"11\"), the answer would be 2: splitting into two Ts or one M. But according to the sample output, the answer is 3. So why is that?\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nInput is 3 steps, appending 1, then 1, then 1. The outputs are 1, 3, 7.\n\nAfter the first step: S is \"1\", answer is 1 → correct.\n\nAfter the second step: S is \"11\", answer is 3. According to the previous reasoning, it should be 2. So what's the discrepancy here?\n\nLet me think again. Perhaps the problem is not about splitting the entire string, but about all possible ways to split any prefix of the string into valid Morse codes. For example, after the second step (S is \"11\"), the possible ways to split prefixes are:\n\n- The first character: 1 way.\n- The first two characters: 2 ways (split into two 1s or one 11).\nTotal is 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the sample's second output of 3. \n\nAh! That makes sense. So the problem is to count the number of ways to split the entire string into valid Morse codes, and for each step, the string is the current S, and we have to compute the number of ways to split the entire current string into valid Morse codes. \n\nWait, but then for the first sample after the second step, the answer is 3. Which would be the sum of the number of ways to split the entire string into valid Morse codes, plus the number of ways to split prefixes? No, the sample output for the first step is 1, which would be the number of ways to split the entire string (which is length 1, so 1 way). For the second step, the entire string is length 2. The number of ways to split it is 2 (as discussed earlier), but the sample says 3. So this doesn't fit. \n\nWait, but if the answer is the number of ways to split any prefix of the string into valid Morse codes. For example, after the second step, the string is \"11\". The possible prefixes are:\n\n- Prefix of length 1: \"1\" → 1 way.\n- Prefix of length 2: \"11\" → 2 ways.\n\nTotal is 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the sample's second output. Similarly, after the third step, the string is \"111\". The prefixes are:\n\n- Length 1: 1 way.\n- Length 2: 2 ways.\n- Length 3: 3 ways (split into 1+1+1, 1+11, 11+1, 111? Wait, how many ways are there to split \"111\"?\n\nLet me think. The valid Morse codes are of length 1-4. For \"111\", possible splits:\n\n- Take first 1 → then split the remaining \"11\" which has 2 ways. So total 2 ways.\n- Take first 2 1s → \"11\" → then split the remaining \"1\" → 1 way. Total 1.\n- Take first 3 1s → \"111\" → 1 way. \nSo total 2 + 1 + 1 = 4? Or am I missing something?\n\nWait, the number of ways to split the entire string is computed using dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to split the first i characters of S into valid Morse codes. Then:\n\ndp[0] = 1 (empty string, base case)\nFor i >= 1, dp[i] = sum of dp[i - len] for all len in 1-4, if the substring ending at i of length len is valid.\n\nSo for S = \"111\":\n\ndp[0] = 1\ndp[1] = dp[0] = 1 (since the first character is valid)\ndp[2] = dp[1] (if substring of length 1 is valid) + dp[0] (if substring of length 2 is valid). Both are valid, so dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2.\ndp[3] = dp[2] (if substring of length 1 is valid) + dp[1] (if substring of length 2 is valid) + dp[0] (if substring of length 3 is valid). All are valid. So dp[3] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. But according to the sample, the answer after 3 steps is 7. So this suggests that the answer is not dp[n], but the sum of dp[i] for i from 1 to n. \n\nBecause in the first sample after 3 steps, the sum would be dp[1] + dp[2] + dp[3] = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7, which matches the sample output. And after the second step, the sum is 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the sample's second output. After the first step, it's 1, which matches. \n\nYes! That makes sense. So the answer after each modification is the sum of dp[i] for i from 1 to current length of S. \n\nSo the problem reduces to, after each step, maintaining the current string S, and for each position i (from 1 to len(S)), compute the number of ways to split the first i characters into valid Morse codes, and sum all these values. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each step, build the string S incrementally.\n- Maintain a dynamic programming array dp, where dp[i] is the number of ways to split the first i characters into valid Morse codes.\n- For each new character added to S, update the dp array up to the new length.\n- The answer after each step is the sum of dp[1..len(S)].\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute dp efficiently, considering that the string S can be up to 3000 characters long (since m is up to 3000). \n\nLet's think about the DP transitions. For each position i (starting from 1), dp[i] = sum of dp[i - l] for l in 1..4, if the substring ending at i of length l is a valid Morse code. \n\nBut for each i, we need to check all possible l (1-4) such that i - l >= 0. For each l, we check if the substring S[i-l ... i-1] (assuming 0-based indices) is a valid Morse code. \n\nBut how to check if a particular substring is valid? We need to know whether that string is in the set of valid Morse codes. \n\nThe valid Morse codes are all strings of length 1-4 consisting of 0s and 1s, except the four invalid ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". \n\nSo for any given substring, we can check its length. If it's longer than 4, it's invalid. But since our l is at most 4, we don't have to worry about that. So for each possible substring of length l (1-4), we check if it's one of the four invalid strings. If not, then it's valid. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the set of invalid strings: {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}.\n\n2. For each new character added to S, we update the dp array. \n\nLet's formalize this. \n\nLet’s assume S is built incrementally. After each step, the length of S is k. For each k, we compute dp[k], which depends on the previous dp values. \n\nInitially, dp[0] = 1. \n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\ndp[i] = sum of dp[i - l] for l in 1..4 if the substring of length l ending at i is valid.\n\nSo, for example, when adding a new character to S, say the new length is m. For each i from 1 to m, we need to calculate dp[i]. However, since the previous steps have already computed dp[1..m-1], we can compute dp[m] based on the previous values. \n\nWait, but for i up to m, when adding the m-th character, we need to compute dp[m]. But for the sum of dp[1..m], we need all dp[i] up to m. However, the problem requires that after each step, we output the sum of dp[1] + dp[2] + ... + dp[m], where m is the current length of S. \n\nSo for each step, after appending the new character, we compute the new dp[m], and add it to the previous total sum. \n\nBut how to manage this efficiently? \n\nLet's think of maintaining a dp array and a running total. \n\nInitialize:\n\ndp[0] = 1\n\nsum_ans = 0\n\nFor each step, after appending a character, the new length is current_len = previous_len + 1.\n\nWe need to compute dp[current_len] based on the previous dp values. Then, sum_ans += dp[current_len], and output sum_ans.\n\nBut wait, no. Because when the string grows, for example, from length 2 to 3, the dp[3] depends on the previous dp values (dp[2], dp[1], dp[0], etc.), but for the sum_ans, we need to sum all dp[1] to dp[3]. However, in previous steps, we had sum_ans as the sum up to dp[previous_len], and now we add dp[previous_len + 1] to get the new sum. \n\nBut this is only true if the dp[i] for i up to previous_len are already computed. \n\nYes. Because for each new character added, we compute dp for the new length (current_len), and the previous dp values for 1..current_len-1 are already computed. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize dp as a list where dp[0] = 1, and others are 0.\n\nsum_ans = 0\n\nfor each step:\n\n    append the new character to S\n\n    current_len = len(S)\n\n    for i in range(current_len, current_len + 1):\n\n        # compute dp[i]\n\n        dp_i = 0\n\n        for l in 1..4:\n\n            if i - l >= 0:\n\n                substr = S[i - l : i]\n\n                if substr is valid:\n\n                    dp_i += dp[i - l]\n\n        dp[i] = dp_i % MOD\n\n    sum_ans += dp[current_len]\n\n    print sum_ans % MOD\n\nWait, but for current_len, we need to compute dp[current_len], but for i = current_len, we need to check all l in 1..4, and see if the substring of length l ending at i is valid. \n\nBut for example, when current_len is 3, we compute dp[3] based on l=1, 2, 3, 4. But for l=4, i-l = 3-4 = -1, which is invalid. So for l in 1 to min(4, i).\n\nSo the loop for l is from 1 to 4, but only if i - l >= 0. \n\nBut for the current_len, which is the new length, we need to compute dp[current_len], which depends on the previous dp values. \n\nBut for each step, when the string grows by one character, we need to compute dp for the new current_len. \n\nBut what about previous dp values? For example, when the string was shorter, say of length 2, and now it's length 3. The dp[1], dp[2] are already computed. So when we compute dp[3], we can use the previous dp values. \n\nThus, the approach is correct. \n\nBut how to handle the substrings? For example, when the current_len is 3, and we want to check substrings of length 1, 2, 3. \n\nSo for each l in 1..4, check if l <= current_len. \n\nSo for each new character added, we compute dp for the new current_len, and then sum_ans is the sum of dp[1] to dp[current_len]. \n\nBut wait, no. Because when the string is length m, the sum_ans is the sum of dp[1] + ... + dp[m]. But when we add a new character, the sum_ans increases by dp[m], since before adding the new character, the sum was up to dp[m-1]. \n\nBut this is only true if the previous steps have already computed dp[1] to dp[m-1]. \n\nYes. Because during each step, we compute dp for the new current_len, and the previous steps have already computed the dp for all lengths up to current_len-1. \n\nSo the initial sum_ans starts at 0. \n\nFor example, first step:\n\ncurrent_len is 1. Compute dp[1] = sum of dp[0] if the substring of length 1 is valid. Then sum_ans becomes 0 + dp[1]. \n\nSecond step: current_len is 2. Compute dp[2] based on dp[1], dp[0], etc. sum_ans is previous sum_ans (dp[1]) + dp[2]. \n\nThird step: current_len is 3. Compute dp[3], sum_ans is previous sum_ans (dp[1] + dp[2]) + dp[3]. \n\nThus, the sum_ans is maintained as the cumulative sum of dp[1] to dp[current_len]. \n\nThis seems correct. \n\nNow, the key is to precompute the invalid strings and check for each substring of length 1-4 whether it is valid. \n\nSo, for each new character added, when computing dp[i], we need to generate the substring of length l (1-4) ending at i, and check if it's in the invalid set. \n\nBut since the string is built incrementally, and for each i, we can generate the substring. \n\nBut for example, when i is 3 and l is 3, the substring is S[0:3], assuming 0-based. \n\nBut in Python, S is a string. So for current_len = i, and l in 1..4, the substring is S[i - l : i]. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\n- Predefine the invalid set: invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\n- Initialize dp as a list. Since m can be up to 3000, the maximum length of S is 3000. So we can have dp as a list of size 3001 (since indices go from 0 to 3000). \n\n- Initialize dp[0] = 1. \n\n- sum_ans = 0. \n\n- For each of the m steps:\n\n   - Append the new character (0 or 1) to S. \n\n   - current_len = len(S) \n\n   - compute dp[current_len] as follows:\n\n      - Initialize temp = 0\n\n      - for l in 1 to 4:\n\n          if current_len - l >= 0:\n\n              substr = S[current_len - l : current_len]\n\n              if substr not in invalid:\n\n                  temp += dp[current_len - l]\n\n      - dp[current_len] = temp % MOD\n\n   - sum_ans += dp[current_len]\n\n   - print sum_ans % MOD\n\nWait, but this is not correct. Because for each step, the current_len is increasing by 1. So for example, after the first step, current_len is 1. Then, when processing that step, we compute dp[1], which is based on l=1. \n\nBut what about the sum_ans? Initially, sum_ans is 0. After the first step, sum_ans becomes 0 + dp[1]. \n\nBut for the second step, current_len is 2. We compute dp[2], and sum_ans += dp[2]. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what about previous dp values? For example, when the current_len is 3, and we compute dp[3], which depends on dp[2], dp[1], dp[0], etc. \n\nBut the dp array is updated incrementally. So for each new current_len, we compute dp[current_len] based on previous values. \n\nYes. \n\nSo",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string in Morse code. Each modification to the string appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1'), and after each modification, we must compute the result modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to split the first `i` characters of the string into valid Morse code sequences.\n2. **Invalid Morse Codes**: Predefine the set of invalid Morse codes which do not correspond to any English letter: {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}.\n3. **String Construction**: Incrementally build the string as each character is appended.\n4. **DP Transition**: For each new character added to the string, update the DP array by checking all possible valid Morse code substrings ending at the current position.\n5. **Summation**: Maintain a running total of valid sequences for the current length of the string to efficiently compute the result after each modification.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    commands = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    # Initialize dp array\n    max_len = 3000\n    dp = [0] * (max_len + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case\n    \n    s = []\n    sum_ans = 0\n    \n    for cmd in commands:\n        s.append(cmd)\n        current_len = len(s)\n        \n        # Compute dp[current_len]\n        temp = 0\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if current_len - l >= 0:\n                substr = ''.join(s[current_len - l : current_len])\n                if substr not in invalid:\n                    temp += dp[current_len - l]\n        dp[current_len] = temp % MOD\n        \n        sum_ans = (sum_ans + dp[current_len]) % MOD\n        print(sum_ans)\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` to handle the base case of an empty string.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input is read and processed to extract the number of modifications and the sequence of commands.\n3. **Dynamic String Building**: As each command (either '0' or '1') is processed, it is appended to the string `s`.\n4. **DP Array Update**: For each new character added, the DP value at the new length is computed by checking all valid substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at the current position. If a substring is valid (not in the invalid set), the corresponding DP value is accumulated.\n5. **Running Total**: The result after each modification is maintained as a running total (`sum_ans`), which is printed after each step.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation using dynamic programming and handles the constraints effectively, providing results in linear time relative to the number of modifications.",
