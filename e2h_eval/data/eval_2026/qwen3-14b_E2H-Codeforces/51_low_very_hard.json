Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the pile should contain exactly all the letters from both names combined, no more, no less. Any extra letters or missing letters would make the answer \"NO\".\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the combined letters of the guest and host names match exactly with the letters in the pile. How to do that?\n\nHmm. One way is to count the frequency of each character in the guest and host names combined, and compare it with the frequency of characters in the pile. If they are the same, then output YES, else NO.\n\nRight. So the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the three input lines: guest, host, pile.\n2. Concatenate guest and host into a single string.\n3. Check if the concatenated string has the same character counts as the pile string.\n4. If yes, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, we can use the collections.Counter class for this. Counter will count the occurrences of each character. So, for the combined guest and host string, create a Counter, and for the pile string, create another Counter. Then compare the two Counters.\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, Counter objects can be compared directly with == operator. So if the counts of all characters are the same, then the Counters are equal.\n\nYes. So the plan is:\n\n- Combine guest and host into one string, say combined = guest + host.\n- Create Counter for combined and Counter for pile.\n- Compare the two Counters. If equal, output YES else NO.\n\nBut what about cases where the lengths are different? Like, if the combined length is not equal to the pile's length. For example, if the combined length is 5 and pile is 6 letters. Then obviously, they can't be equal. So checking the lengths first could be an optimization. But even if the lengths are same, the counts might differ. But comparing the Counters would take care of that automatically.\n\nBut for efficiency, maybe checking the lengths first would save some time. Because if the lengths are different, we can immediately return NO. Otherwise, proceed to compare the counts.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nCheck if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if the Counter of (guest + host) equals Counter of pile.\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, output YES, else NO.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All three strings are empty? But according to the input description, all lines are not empty. So no need to handle that.\n\nEdge case 2: All characters are same. Like guest is \"AAA\", host is \"AAA\", pile is \"AAAAAA\". Then it's YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES. If pile is \"BA\", same thing. But if pile is \"AA\", then no.\n\nAnother case: pile has extra letters. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"ABX\" → len is 3, combined is 2 → no.\n\nSo the code needs to handle these.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nRead three lines from input. But how? The input is given as three lines. So in Python, perhaps read via input().strip() three times.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, the input may have trailing newlines or other whitespace? The problem says that all lines consist of uppercase letters and are not empty. So, perhaps read each line using input().strip() to remove any leading/trailing whitespace (though the problem says that the lines don't have any, but better safe than sorry).\n\nWait, but the problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. So, the input lines are correct. So, perhaps read them as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, print NO.\n\nElse, check if Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile). If yes, print YES else NO.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in Python, the Counter is from collections. So need to import that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nif len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    combined = guest + host\n\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the combined names of the guest and the host. The solution involves checking if the characters in the pile exactly match the combined characters of the guest and host names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Length Check**: First, check if the total length of the guest and host names combined is equal to the length of the pile. If not, immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Character Frequency Comparison**: Use a character frequency counter to compare the characters in the combined guest and host names with those in the pile. If the frequency of each character matches exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined_length = len(guest) + len(host)\n    pile_length = len(pile)\n    \n    if combined_length != pile_length:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure compatibility with standard input handling.\n- **Length Check**: Before performing any detailed checks, we first compare the lengths of the combined guest and host names with the pile. This is an efficient initial check to quickly eliminate cases where the lengths do not match.\n- **Character Frequency Counting**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile. If these counts match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, hence the answer is \"YES\". Otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently verify the required condition using both length checks and character frequency counting, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
