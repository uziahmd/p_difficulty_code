And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all those sums. The output needs to be precise with at least 6 decimal digits.\n\nSo, the input is n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output is the average of all the sums of consecutive k-day periods.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this efficiently.\n\nFirst, the straightforward way would be to compute the sum for each window of size k and then take the average. However, if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach with O(n*k) time complexity would be too slow. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 2e5, then the number of windows is 1, but for each window, summing takes O(k) time, which is O(2e5) operations. But in the worst case, when k is 1, there are n windows, each taking O(1) time. But for k=2e5, it's O(1) as well. Wait, but for k=1e5 and n=2e5, the number of windows is 1e5+1, and each sum would take O(1e5) time, leading to O(1e10) operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo, we need a more efficient approach. The standard approach for sliding window sums is to use a prefix sum array. Let me think.\n\nYes. Let's compute the prefix sums. Let prefix[i] be the sum of the first i elements. Then, the sum of the elements from position j to j+k-1 (assuming 1-based) is prefix[j + k - 1] - prefix[j-1]. \n\nOnce we have all these sums, we can compute their average by adding them all together and dividing by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1).\n\nBut how do we compute the total sum of all the window sums?\n\nLet me think: each element a[i] contributes to exactly k windows. Wait, no. Wait, for each element a[i], how many windows include it?\n\nFor example, if the window size is k, then the first element is included in the first window, the second in the first and second, etc. Wait, no. Let me think again. For a given element at position i (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), how many windows include it?\n\nIf the array is 0-based, then for the element at index i, the earliest window that includes it starts at i - (k-1) ... no. Let me think of the window starting at position s, and ending at s + k - 1. So for a given element at position i, the windows that include it are those where s ≤ i ≤ s + k - 1. Which implies s ≤ i and s ≥ i - k + 1. Also, since s has to be ≥0 and s + k -1 <n.\n\nBut perhaps the number of windows that include a[i] is min(i + 1, n -k +1) - max(0, i -k +1) + 1? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, for each element, the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of possible starting positions such that the window includes it. Let me think of the starting positions. For a window of size k, the starting positions can be from 0 to (n -k) (assuming 0-based). For a given element at position i, the earliest starting position that includes it is max(0, i -k +1). Wait, no. Let's say the window starts at s. The window includes positions s, s+1, ..., s +k -1. So, for a position i to be in the window, s ≤ i ≤ s +k -1. Rearranged, s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. Also, s must be ≥0 and ≤n -k.\n\nSo the possible s values are from max(0, i -k +1) to min(n -k, i). So the count is min(n -k, i) - max(0, i -k +1) + 1. But maybe there's a simpler way. For example, for each element a[i], the number of windows that include it is equal to the number of windows that start at s where s ranges from max(0, i -k +1) to min(n -k, i). But perhaps this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the total sum of all window sums is the sum for each element a[i] multiplied by the number of windows that include it. So if we can compute for each a[i], how many times it's included in the windows, then multiply by a[i] and sum all those, then divide by the number of windows (which is (n -k +1)).\n\nBut how to compute the count for each a[i]?\n\nLet me think of the number of windows that include a[i]. For example, the first element (i=0) is included in exactly 1 window (the first window). The second element (i=1) is included in 2 windows if k is 2, etc. Wait, more generally, for a given i, the number of windows that include it is the number of possible starting positions s such that s ≤ i ≤ s +k -1. Which can be rewritten as s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. Also, since s must be between 0 and (n -k). So the number of windows that include a[i] is the number of valid s in that range.\n\nBut perhaps there's a formula here. Let me think of the earliest possible window that includes a[i] is when the window starts at s = max(0, i -k +1). The latest possible window that includes a[i] is when the window starts at s = min(i, n -k). Because the window ends at s +k -1. For example, if i is the last element in the array, then the window that includes it must start at s = n -k (since s +k -1 = n -k +k -1 = n-1, which is the last element). So the number of windows that include a[i] is (min(i, n -k) - max(0, i -k +1) + 1). \n\nBut maybe there's a simpler formula. For example, if the window is of size k, then each element a[i] is included in exactly min(i +1, n -k +1) windows? No, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the first window starts at 0, and ends at k-1. The next starts at 1, ends at k. So for each position i, the number of windows that include it is the number of windows that start at s where s ≤ i and s +k -1 ≥ i. Which simplifies to s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. But s must also be between 0 and n -k.\n\nSo the number of valid s is the number of integers in the interval [s_min, s_max], where s_min = max(0, i -k +1), and s_max = min(n -k, i). The count is s_max - s_min + 1.\n\nBut for this, let's see for example:\n\nTake n=3, k=2. So the possible s values are 0 and 1 (since n-k is 1). For i=0, s_min = max(0, 0 -2 +1) = max(0,-1) = 0. s_max = min(1, 0) = 0. So count is 0-0+1=1. Correct, as the first element is in one window (s=0). For i=1, s_min = max(0, 1-2+1)=max(0,0)=0. s_max = min(1, 1) =1. So count is 1-0+1=2. Which is correct: the first window (s=0) and the second (s=1). For i=2, s_min = max(0, 2-2+1)=1. s_max is min(1, 2) =1. So count is 1-1+1=1. Which is correct, as only the second window (s=1) includes it. So the total sum of window sums would be (a0 + a1) + (a1 + a2) = a0 + 2*a1 + a2. Which is the same as the sum of each a[i] multiplied by their count.\n\nSo, the approach would be to compute for each element a[i], the number of times it appears in the windows, multiply by a[i], sum all those, then divide by the number of windows (which is (n -k +1)).\n\nBut how to compute the count for each element?\n\nLet me think of the formula for the count. For each element at index i (0-based), the count is the number of windows that include it, which is:\n\ncount_i = min(i, n -k) - max(0, i -k +1) + 1 ?\n\nWait, no. Because the s ranges from s_min to s_max, which is [max(0, i -k +1), min(n -k, i)]. So the number of s is (s_max - s_min +1) if s_max >= s_min. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how can we compute this for each i?\n\nAlternatively, for each i, the number of windows that include it is the number of windows that start between (i -k +1) and i, but adjusted to the valid range of s (0 <= s <= n -k).\n\nAnother way: the number of windows that include a[i] is equal to the number of possible starting positions s where s can be from (i - (k-1)) to i, but s must be >=0 and <= (n -k). So the possible range is from s_start = max(0, i -k +1) to s_end = min(n -k, i). The count is s_end - s_start + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each element, the count is:\n\nif i < k-1: then the number of windows that include it is i+1. Because the first i+1 windows (starting at 0 to i) would include it. But wait, no. For example, if i is 0, and k=2, then the first window (s=0) includes it. But the window s=1 would end at 1+1=2, which is beyond i=0. So no. So for i=0, the count is 1. Which is i+1 (0+1=1). For i=1 and k=2, the count is 2 (s=0 and s=1). Which is i+1 (1+1=2). But if i is 2, and k=2, then the count is 1 (s=1). Which is i+1 - (i -k +1) ?\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me think for the general case.\n\nThe number of windows that include a[i] is equal to the number of possible starting positions s such that s ≤ i and s + k -1 ≥ i. Which is equivalent to s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. But s must be between 0 and n -k.\n\nBut for the entire array, if the window is allowed to start anywhere, then the number of s is min(i, n -k) - max(0, i -k +1) +1.\n\nBut for the case where the window is allowed to start anywhere (i.e., the array is large enough), then the number of windows that include a[i] is k. Because for each element, there are exactly k windows that include it. Wait, no. That's not correct. For example, if the array is longer than k, then the first element is included in only 1 window (the first one). The middle elements are included in k windows. The last element is included in 1 window.\n\nSo, the number of windows that include a[i] depends on the position of i. For example, if the array is long enough, the count is min(i +1, n -k +1, ...) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count is the minimum between (i +1) and (n -k +1) and (k). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the number of windows that include a[i] as the number of windows that start at s such that s can be from (i - (k-1)) to i, but adjusted to the boundaries.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let me think of the total sum of all window sums. Let's say we have a prefix sum array. The total sum of all window sums is sum_{s=0}^{n-k} (sum_{j=s}^{s +k -1} a_j) ) = sum_{s=0}^{n-k} (prefix[s +k] - prefix[s]) ), assuming prefix is 0-based and prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], etc. So the total sum is sum_{s=0}^{n-k} (prefix[s +k] - prefix[s]).\n\nBut this can be rewritten as sum_{s=0}^{n-k} prefix[s +k] - sum_{s=0}^{n-k} prefix[s} \n\nThe first sum is sum_{s=0}^{n-k} prefix[s +k] = sum_{m=k}^{n} prefix[m} where m = s +k. Since s ranges from 0 to (n -k), m ranges from k to n.\n\nThe second sum is sum_{s=0}^{n -k} prefix[s} = sum_{m=0}^{n -k} prefix[m}.\n\nSo the total sum of all window sums is [sum_{m=k}^n prefix[m}] - [sum_{m=0}^{n -k} prefix[m} ].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nWell, we can precompute the prefix sums, then compute the sum of prefix from k to n, subtract the sum of prefix from 0 to n -k.\n\nBut this approach would allow us to compute the total sum of all window sums in O(n) time, which is efficient.\n\nLet me test this with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nprefix array (assuming 0-based with prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = 3, prefix[2] = 7, prefix[3] = 14.\n\nsum_{m=2}^3 prefix[m} = prefix[2] + prefix[3] = 7 +14 =21.\n\nsum_{m=0}^{3-2} = sum from 0 to 1: prefix[0] + prefix[1] = 0 +3 =3.\n\nTotal sum is 21 -3 =18. Then the number of windows is 3-2+1=2. Average is 18/2=9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes! So this approach works.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array.\n\n2. Compute the total sum of all window sums using the formula above.\n\n3. Divide by the number of windows (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nThis approach is O(n) time and space.\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then read the array a. Then compute the prefix sum array. Then compute the two sums: sum from m=k to n of prefix[m], and sum from m=0 to (n -k) of prefix[m]. Then subtract the two and divide by (n -k +1).\n\nBut how to compute the prefix sum array? Let's think.\n\nIn Python, for a list a of length n, the prefix sum can be computed as follows:\n\nprefix = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, the sum from index s to e (exclusive?) Well, the sum from a[0] to a[i-1] is prefix[i].\n\nSo, for example, the sum of a[s] to a[s +k -1] is prefix[s +k] - prefix[s].\n\nSo the code for the total sum of all window sums is:\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor s in 0 ... (n -k):\n\n    total += prefix[s +k] - prefix[s]\n\nBut this is O(n) time. But we can compute this using the prefix sum of prefix array.\n\nLet me think: the sum of prefix[m] for m from k to n is sum_prefix_part1 = sum(prefix[k ... n]).\n\nSimilarly, sum_prefix_part2 = sum(prefix[0 ... (n -k)]).\n\nSo total_sum = sum_prefix_part1 - sum_prefix_part2.\n\nBut how to compute these sums?\n\nWe can compute the prefix sum array of the prefix array. But that would be O(n) time. Alternatively, we can compute the sum using a loop.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, even O(n) is acceptable.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nCompute prefix array of length n+1.\n\nCompute sum_part1 = sum(prefix[k : n+1]) --> because m ranges from k to n (inclusive). Because prefix has indexes 0 to n.\n\nsum_part2 = sum(prefix[0 : (n -k +1)]) --> because m ranges from 0 to (n -k). Because the upper limit for s is (n -k), so the sum is from 0 to (n -k) inclusive.\n\nWait, for example, if n=3, k=2, then n -k is 1. So sum_part2 is sum(prefix[0 ... 1]).\n\nYes.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nsum_part1 = sum( prefix[k : n+1] )\n\nsum_part2 = sum( prefix[0 : (n -k +1)] )\n\ntotal_sum = sum_part1 - sum_part2\n\nThen, average = total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nBut let's check with sample input 1:\n\nprefix = [0, 3, 7, 14]\n\nsum_part1 is sum(prefix[2:4]) = prefix[2] + prefix[3] = 7 +14 =21.\n\nsum_part2 is sum(prefix[0:2]) (since n -k +1 is 3-2 +1 = 2. So 0 to 2-1=1? Wait, in Python, the slice is up to but not including the end index. So for the sum of prefix[0 ... (n -k)] (inclusive), the slice is prefix[0 : (n -k +1)].\n\nBecause for example, n -k is 1. So the slice is prefix[0:2], which includes indices 0 and 1.\n\nYes. So sum_part2 is sum(prefix[0: (n -k +1)]).\n\nSo in sample input 1, sum_part2 is sum(prefix[0:2]) = 0 +3 =3.\n\nSo total_sum is 21 -3 =18. Divided by 2 gives 9. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\nInput is 1 1, and a is [10]. Then n=1, k=1. The number of windows is 1. The sum_part1 is sum(prefix[1: 1+1]) = sum(prefix[1:2]) = prefix[1] =10. sum_part2 is sum(prefix[0: 1 -1 +1 ]) = sum(prefix[0:1]) = prefix[0] =0. total_sum is 10-0=10. average is 10/1=10. Correct.\n\nThird example input:\n\nInput is 8 2, array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nn=8, k=2. Number of windows is 8-2+1=7.\n\nLet me compute the sum_part1 and sum_part2.\n\nprefix array is:\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1] =1\n\nprefix[2] =1+2=3\n\nprefix[3] =3+4=7\n\nprefix[4] =7 +100000 = 100007\n\nprefix[5] =100007 + 123 = 100130\n\nprefix[6] = 100130 + 456 = 100586\n\nprefix[7] = 100586 + 789 = 101375\n\nprefix[8] = 101375 +1 = 101376\n\nsum_part1 is sum(prefix[2:8+1]) = sum(prefix[2:9]) = sum of prefix[2] to prefix[8].\n\nWhich is 3 +7 +100007 +100130 +100586 +101375 +101376 ?\n\nWait, let me compute that.\n\nBut perhaps I should trust the code.\n\nsum_part1 is sum of prefix[k ... n], which is k=2, n=8. So sum from prefix[2] to prefix[8].\n\nsum_part2 is sum(prefix[0 ... (n -k)] ) = sum(prefix[0 ... 8-2=6] ), which is sum from prefix[0] to prefix[6].\n\nSo sum_part1 - sum_part2 is the total of all window sums.\n\nBut regardless, the code will handle that.\n\nOnce that's calculated, the average is divided by 7.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the third example's output is 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code should compute that correctly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement this approach.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\nRead input: multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input given in the example is:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, there are three examples, like:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut that seems to be a list of test cases. However, the actual problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement. So, perhaps the user is supposed to read a single test case. But looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that the input is given as per the first input description. So, the code must read from stdin, which for programming competition problems usually is a single test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases, but perhaps that's part of the example for the problem. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is written as a list of inputs, but the actual problem says that the input is given as per the first input description. So the code should read one test case.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ... \n\nSo the code should read one test case. However, the sample shows multiple lines, perhaps as multiple test cases. But that's probably part of the example to show different test cases. So the code should read one test case.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, it's given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Because in the actual programming competition problem, the input is a single test case. However, the sample outputs are given for these three test cases. But perhaps the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement says that the input is given as per the first input description, which is two lines per test case. So perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code needs to process one test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from standard input and print to standard output. So the code must read a single test case. So the sample input is perhaps a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one.\n\nTherefore, the code should read n and k from the first line, then the array from the second line.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and k.\n\nRead the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen compute the prefix sums.\n\nThen compute sum_part1 and sum_part2.\n\nThen compute the average.\n\nBut how to handle large numbers? Well, Python handles big integers well.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and k:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nCompute prefix:\n\nprefix = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n\nThen compute sum_part1 and sum_part2:\n\nsum_part1 = sum(prefix[k: n+1])\n\nsum_part2 = sum(prefix[0 : (n -k +1)])\n\ntotal = sum_part1 - sum_part2\n\naverage = total / (n -k +1)\n\nThen, print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in Python, how to format it properly?\n\nThe output requires that the answer is printed with at least 6 decimal digits. So, for example, in the first sample, the output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo, we can format the output with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo, print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average)) ?\n\nBut what about floating point precision issues?\n\nBut since the sum is computed as an integer (because all a[i] are integers, and the sum of sums is an integer), and then divided by (n -k +1), which may be a divisor that leads to a fractional value.\n\nBut in Python, division is done as floating point, which should be precise enough for the problem's constraints.\n\nBut for very large numbers, perhaps using floating points could lead to inaccuracies. However, since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-6, using floating points should be sufficient.\n\nBut how to handle the division? For example, if the sum is a very large integer and divided by a large denominator, but in Python, the division is handled as a float.\n\nBut with Python's floating point precision (double-precision), which has about 15-17 decimal digits of precision, so for the required 6 decimal digits, it's safe.\n\nBut let's test the third sample input:\n\nThe third sample input is:\n\nn=8, k=2, array [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nThe number of windows is 7.\n\nThe sum of all window sums is:\n\nEach window is 2 days. Let's compute the sum of each window:\n\nwindow 0: 1 +2 =3\n\nwindow1: 2+4=6\n\nwindow2:4+100000=100004\n\nwindow3:100000 +123=100123\n\nwindow4:123 +456=579\n\nwindow5:456 +789=1245\n\nwindow6:789 +1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = let's compute:\n\n3+6=9; +100004=100013; +100123=200136; +579=200715; +1245=201,960; +790=202,750.\n\nThen average is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... which is the sample output.\n\nBut according to the code's calculation:\n\nsum_part1 is sum(prefix[2: 8+1]) = sum(prefix[2..8]).\n\nprefix is:\n\nprefix[0] =0\n\nprefix[1]=1\n\nprefix[2] =1+2=3\n\nprefix[3] =3+4=7\n\nprefix[4] =7 +100000= 100007\n\nprefix[5] =100007 + 123 = 100130\n\nprefix[6] =100130 + 456 = 100586\n\nprefix[7] =100586 + 789 = 101375\n\nprefix[8] =101375 + 1 = 101376\n\nsum_part1 is prefix[2] + prefix[3] + prefix[4] + prefix[5] + prefix[6] + prefix[7] + prefix[8] ?\n\nBecause for n=8, k=2, the sum_part1 is sum(prefix[k : n+1]) which is sum(prefix[2:9]) (since n+1 is 8+1=9). So the slice is from 2 to 9, which in Python is indices 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes.\n\nsum_part1 = 3 +7 +100007 +100130 +100586 +101375 +101376 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n3 +7 =10\n\n+100007 = 100017\n\n+100130 = 200147\n\n+100586 = 300733\n\n+101375 = 402108\n\n+101376 = 503484.\n\nsum_part1 is 503484.\n\nsum_part2 is sum(prefix[0 : (n -k +1)] ) = sum(prefix[0: (8-2 +1)] ) = sum(prefix[0:7]).\n\nprefix[0] to prefix[6] (since 0:7 is up to index 6).\n\nprefix[0] =0, prefix[1]=1, prefix[2]=3, prefix[3]=7, prefix[4]=100007, prefix[5]=100130, prefix[6]=100586.\n\nsum_part2 is 0 +1 +3 +7 +100007 +100130 +100586 = \n\nLet's compute:\n\n0+1=1; +3=4; +7=11; +100007=100018; +100130=200148; +100586=300734.\n\nsum_part1 - sum_part2 = 503484 - 300734 = 202750. Which matches the manual calculation. Divided by 7 gives 28964.2857142857..., which is correct.\n\nSo the code works for this example.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for large n (up to 2e5), sum(prefix[k: n+1]) could be O(n) time. However, in Python, slicing and summing is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nBut for n=2e5, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the prefix sum array, we can compute it as follows.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    sum_part1 = sum(prefix[k : n+1])\n    sum_part2 = sum(prefix[0 : (n - k + 1)])\n    total = sum_part1 - sum_part2\n    average = total / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, for the case when n -k +1 is zero? But according to the constraints, k <=n. So n -k +1 >=1. So no division by zero.\n\nTesting for n=1, k=1: n -k +1 =1. So okay.\n\nBut what about when k=0? But the constraints say 1<=k<=n. So no.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, check for the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput: 9.0000000000\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOutput: 10.0000000000\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nOutput: 28964.2857142857\n\nWhich is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich when printed with 10 decimals, is as per the sample.\n\nBut in Python, when you print with .10f, it will show 10 decimal digits. For example, 9.0 becomes 9.0000000000.\n\nBut in Python, when the number is an integer, like 9.0, the format will show the decimal digits.\n\nBut what about floating point precision? For example, when the actual value is exactly 9, but due to floating point representation, it might be stored as something like 9.000000000000001 or similar. However, since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-6, and the code uses exact integer arithmetic for the sum, then the division would be precise enough.\n\nBut in Python, when you divide integers, it returns a float. However, for large numbers, it's possible that the division is not precise. However, given that the problem allows for 1e-6 error, and the code uses double-precision floating points, which have about 15-17 decimal digits of precision, this should be acceptable.\n\nAnother approach is to compute the average as a floating point number, but perhaps using the decimal module for higher precision. However, that would complicate the code and is unnecessary here.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=k=1.\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n5\n\nOutput: 5.0000000000.\n\nWhich the code would compute as sum_part1 = prefix[1] =5. sum_part2 = sum(prefix[0:1]) =0. total=5-0=5. average is 5/1=5.0.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, k=2. Array [1, 2]. Output is (1+2)/1 =3.0.\n\nsum_part1 = prefix[2] =3. sum_part2 = sum(prefix[0: 2-2 +1] = sum(prefix[0:1]) =0. total 3-0=3. average 3/1=3. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=5, k=3. Array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The number of windows is 5-3+1=3.\n\nThe windows are [1,2,3], sum 6; [2,3,4], sum 9; [3,4,5], sum 12. Total sum is 6+9+12=27. Average is 9.0.\n\nThe code:\n\nprefix array is [0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15]\n\nsum_part1 is sum(prefix[3:5+1]) = sum(prefix[3], prefix[4], prefix[5]) =6 +10 +15 =31.\n\nsum_part2 is sum(prefix[0: (5-3 +1)] ) = sum(prefix[0:3]) =0 +1 +3 =4.\n\ntotal =31-4=27. average is 27/3=9. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day periods (weeks) from a given list of daily sleep times. The solution must be efficient to handle large input sizes up to 200,000 days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: We use a prefix sum array to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray in constant time. This helps in reducing the time complexity of summing each window from O(n*k) to O(n).\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum of all possible k-day windows. This is done by leveraging the difference between prefix sums at appropriate indices.\n3. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: By calculating the total sum of all window sums using the prefix sum array and then dividing by the number of valid windows, we achieve an efficient solution with linear time complexity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    prefix = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]\n    sum_part1 = sum(prefix[k : n+1])\n    sum_part2 = sum(prefix[0 : (n - k + 1)])\n    total = sum_part1 - sum_part2\n    average = total / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the length of each week `k`, and the list of daily sleep times.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We construct a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n3. **Sum of All Windows**: Using the prefix sum array, we compute the sum of all valid k-day windows. This is done by summing the relevant segments of the prefix array and adjusting for overlapping sums.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of valid windows (which is `n - k + 1`) to get the average sleep time. The result is formatted to ensure at least 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required values in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints.",
