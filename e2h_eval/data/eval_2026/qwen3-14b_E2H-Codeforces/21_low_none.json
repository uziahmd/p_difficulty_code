The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, it needs a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Similarly, count the number of keys that are even and odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. So the total is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys). \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd numbers in the chests array.\n2. Count the number of even and odd numbers in the keys array.\n3. Compute the sum of min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) and min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count).\n\nThat's the key idea. Let me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parities:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3, odd_keys = 1.\n\nSo min(3, 1) is 1 (even chests paired with odd keys). Then min(2, 3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example input: chests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So even_keys=0, odd_keys=1. So min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_keys=4, odd_keys=0. So min(1,0) is 0, and min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this logic works. Now, the code needs to compute these counts.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the list of a_i, count how many are even (even_chest) and odd (odd_chest).\n- Read the list of b_j, count even_keys and odd_keys.\n- The answer is min(even_chest, odd_keys) + min(odd_chest, even_keys).\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first line shows that the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows three test cases. For example, the first input line is '5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', then '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', then '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50'.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the problem's input format. Wait, the original problem's input is for a single test case. However, the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input section says that the first line contains n and m. Then the second line has the a_i, third line has the b_j. So each test case is three lines. But the sample input shows three separate test cases. So the actual input is multiple test cases. Wait, but how does that work? Like, the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: For each test case, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Determine Pairings**: \n   - Even chests can only be opened by odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can only be opened by even keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the sum of two minimum values:\n   - The minimum of the number of even chests and the number of odd keys.\n   - The minimum of the number of odd chests and the number of even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, m = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        b = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        even_chest = 0\n        odd_chest = 0\n        for num in a:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_chest += 1\n            else:\n                odd_chest += 1\n        \n        even_key = 0\n        odd_key = 0\n        for num in b:\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n                even_key += 1\n            else:\n                odd_key += 1\n        \n        res = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n- **Parity Counting**: For each test case, we count how many numbers are even and odd in both the chests and keys lists.\n- **Pairing Calculation**: Using the counts of even and odd numbers, we determine the maximum possible pairs by considering the constraints that even chests require odd keys and vice versa.\n- **Efficiency**: This approach ensures that we efficiently count and compute the required values in linear time relative to the size of the input lists, making it suitable for large inputs up to the constraint limits.",
