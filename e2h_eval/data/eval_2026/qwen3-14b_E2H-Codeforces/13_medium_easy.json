For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to determine whether a given triad (three notes) is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12 notes. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart. So, the distance between two notes is the number of semitones when moving from the lower to the higher note. For example, C to E is 4 semitones. But if it's E to C, since we need to go the other way around, but according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones along the scale from X to Y. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. But between E and C, it's 8 semitones because you go the other way around. Oh right, because the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. Wait, but how do you determine which is lower? Because the notes are cyclic. So perhaps the distance between two notes is calculated as the minimal number of semitones when moving forward? No, no. Wait the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured as the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. So for example, if X is C and Y is E, then the distance is 4 semitones. But if X is E and Y is C, then the distance is 8 semitones because you have to go E -> F -> ... -> H -> C. Which is 8 steps. So the distance is not symmetric. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that the order matters. Wait, maybe the distance is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper, perhaps the actual calculation is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). Or maybe the distance is (Y - X) mod 12, but in the problem's context, when you have two notes, the distance is the number of semitones when you move from X to Y in the upward direction. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. Because moving upwards from E to C would require going through all the notes until you reach C again, which is 8 steps.\n\nSo, first, I need to map each note to its position in the sequence. Let me think about the order. The problem lists the notes as: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, the note after A is B, then H? Or maybe there's a typo here. Wait, in the problem statement, the list is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right, so H is the last note, and after H comes C again. So the order is:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nSo for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Because E is at index 4, C is 0. So 4-0 =4. So that's correct. Now, if we have E and C, the distance is (0 -4 + 12) = 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (y_pos - x_pos) if y_pos >=x_pos, else (y_pos -x_pos +12). Or more simply, (y_pos -x_pos) mod 12, but since the problem defines the distance as from X to Y, which is the number of semitones when moving up from X to Y. So for example, if X is E (4), Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 -4 + 12) = 8 semitones.\n\nSo the first step is to create a mapping from note names to their positions. Let me create a list of the notes in order, then for each note, get its index.\n\nOnce I have the three notes, I need to check all possible permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nFor a major triad, there must be an ordering X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. For a minor triad, the same but with 3 and 4 semitones respectively.\n\nSo for each permutation of the three notes, check if the distances between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3. If any permutation satisfies that, then it's a major chord. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, I need to check all possible orderings. However, since there are three elements, there are 3! =6 permutations. But perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for a major chord, the three notes must be X, Y, Z where X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3. So the total from X to Z is 7 semitones. But since the order can be any, perhaps we can check for all possible pairs of notes as X and Y, then check if the distance between X and Y is 4, then check if there exists a Z such that the distance between Y and Z is 3. But since the three notes are given, perhaps it's easier to generate all permutations and check.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations? Well, for three elements, there are six permutations. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4, second to third is 3 (for major) or first to second is 3, second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the three notes.\n\n- For each of the six permutations of the three notes:\n\n   - Check if the distance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3. If any permutation satisfies this, then it's a major chord.\n\n   - Check if the distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4. If any permutation satisfies this, then it's a minor chord.\n\nIf neither is found, then output 'strange'.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nFirst, create a dictionary that maps note names to their positions. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let's see:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So yes. So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo for each note, we can get its index. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, etc.\n\nNow, for a given pair of notes (note1, note2), compute the distance from note1 to note2 as (pos2 - pos1) if pos2 >= pos1, else (pos2 - pos1 + 12). Or, equivalently, (pos2 - pos1) % 12? Wait, no. Because if pos2 is less than pos1, then (pos2 - pos1) is negative. For example, if pos1 is 0 (C), pos2 is 11 (H), then (11 - 0) is 11, which is correct. If pos1 is 4 (E) and pos2 is 0 (C), then (0-4) is -4. But the distance is 8 semitones. So (pos2 - pos1 + 12) % 12? Let me compute that. For example, 0 -4 is -4. Adding 12 gives 8. Mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between note1 and note2 is (pos2 - pos1) % 12. Wait, no. Because (pos2 - pos1) mod 12 would give the same as (distance in semitones when moving forward from note1 to note2). For example, if note1 is E (4), note2 is C (0): (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance is (pos2 - pos1) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper. So for example, if note1 is C and note2 is E, the distance is 4. Which is (4 - 0) mod 12 =4. Correct. If note1 is E and note2 is C, the distance is 8, which is (0-4) mod 12 = 8. So yes, the distance between note1 and note2 is (pos2 - pos1) mod 12. But wait, that's only if we take the mod 12. But (pos2 - pos1) can be negative. So for example, if note1 is E (4), note2 is C (0): (0-4) is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between note1 and note2 is (pos2 - pos1) % 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lowest to the upper. So for example, if note1 is lower than note2, then the distance is (pos2 - pos1). But if note1 is higher than note2, then the distance is (12 - (pos1 - pos2))? Or (pos2 - pos1 + 12) ?\n\nBut regardless, the formula (pos2 - pos1) mod 12 gives the correct value. Because for example, if note1 is C (0) and note2 is E (4), then (4-0) mod 12 is 4. If note1 is E (4) and note2 is C (0), (0-4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo that's how to compute the distance between two notes.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nFirst, create a dictionary that maps each note to its index. Let's create that.\n\nThen, for the three input notes, generate all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\nCheck if the distance between X and Y is 4 and between Y and Z is 3. If any permutation satisfies this, then it's a major chord.\n\nSimilarly, check if any permutation has distance between X and Y is 3 and between Y and Z is 4. Then it's a minor chord.\n\nSo, how to generate permutations? Well, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, permutations(notes, 3) will generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut since the input is three notes, the permutations will be all 6 possible orderings.\n\nSo, for each permutation in permutations(notes, 3):\n\n   check for major condition: distance between first and second is 4, and between second and third is 3.\n\n   check for minor condition: distance between first and second is 3, and between second and third is 4.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies the major condition, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, then 'strange'.\n\nBut how to handle the permutations? Let's think.\n\nLet me code this step by step.\n\nFirst, the code needs to read the input. The input is three space-separated notes. For example, in the sample input, it's ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] — but the actual input is a single line with three notes, like for example, the first case is 'C E G'.\n\nWait, the input is given as a single line with three notes. So for example, the input could be something like 'C E G' and the output is 'major'.\n\nSo, the code will read a line, split into three parts. For example:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, for those three notes, check all permutations.\n\nSo, first, create a mapping of note names to their positions. Let's make a list:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, the position can be found by note_order.index(note). However, since the note names may have #, like 'C#', which is in the list. So, for example, for note 'C#', the index is 1.\n\nBut using the index() function could be slow if the list is large, but since the list is fixed and small (size 12), it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a dictionary once:\n\nnote_to_pos = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nBut how to handle the note names? For example, the note 'B' is in the list, and 'H' is also in the list. So the code should use the exact names as given in the problem statement.\n\nNow, for each note in the input, we can get its position from this dictionary.\n\nOnce we have the three positions, we can generate all permutations of the three notes (as their positions?), but perhaps we can work directly with the note names. Wait, no. For the permutations, the actual note names are needed, because the positions are determined by them.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is ['C', 'E', 'G'], then the permutations would be all possible orderings of these three notes.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    # compute distance between x and y\n    x_pos = note_to_pos[x]\n    y_pos = note_to_pos[y]\n    dist_xy = (y_pos - x_pos) % 12\n    # compute distance between y and z\n    y_pos_z = note_to_pos[z]\n    dist_yz = (z_pos - y_pos) % 12 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the distance between y and z is (z's position - y's position) mod 12.\n\nWait, for example, if y is E (4) and z is G (7), then distance is 3 semitones. Which is (7-4) mod 12 =3. Correct.\n\nSo for the major condition, we need dist_xy ==4 and dist_yz ==3.\n\nSo, for each permutation, check if the first two notes have a distance of 4, and the next two have a distance of 3. If any permutation meets this, then it's a major chord.\n\nSimilarly, check for minor: dist_xy ==3 and dist_yz ==4.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can loop through all permutations of the three notes. For each permutation, check the two conditions.\n\nOnce any permutation satisfies the major condition, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nCheck all permutations for major and minor.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_to_pos = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nis_major = False\nis_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    # compute distance between x and y\n    x_p = note_to_pos[x]\n    y_p = note_to_pos[y]\n    dist_xy = (y_p - x_p) % 12\n    # compute distance between y and z\n    y_p_z = note_to_pos[z]\n    dist_yz = (y_p_z - y_p) % 12\n    # check major\n    if dist_xy ==4 and dist_yz ==3:\n        is_major = True\n    # check minor\n    if dist_xy ==3 and dist_yz ==4:\n        is_minor = True\n\nif is_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif is_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple permutations that satisfy the condition? For example, if two permutations satisfy the major condition. But since we just need to know if any permutation satisfies, once any is found, we can set is_major to True. However, in the code above, even if one permutation is found, the code will check all permutations. But since the code is for a small number of permutations (6), it's acceptable.\n\nBut in the code above, for each permutation, it checks if it meets the major or minor condition. So, for example, if any permutation meets the major condition, then is_major becomes True. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So, there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So, once we check all permutations, if is_major is True, then output 'major'; else, if is_minor is True, output 'minor'; else 'strange'.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input: 'C E G'\n\nThe permutations would include (C, E, G). For this permutation:\n\ndistance between C and E is (4-0) mod 12 =4. Then between E and G: (7-4)=3 mod 12 is 3. So this meets the major condition. So is_major becomes True.\n\nAnother permutation might be (E, G, C). Let's see: distance between E and G is (7-4) =3. Then between G and C: (0-7) mod 12 is 5? Wait, (0-7) is -7 mod 12 is 5? Because 12-7=5. So that's 5. So that's not 3 or 4. So this permutation would not contribute.\n\nBut for the major condition, the code would find the first permutation and set is_major to True. So the output is 'major'.\n\nAnother sample input is 'C# B F' — the code should check permutations. Let's see:\n\nThe correct permutation is B, C#, F. Let's check:\n\nB is note 'B' which is position 10. C# is position 1. F is position 5.\n\ndistance between B and C#: (1 - 10) mod 12 → (1 -10) is -9 mod 12 is 3. So yes, 3. Then between C# and F: 5 -1 =4. So yes. So this permutation would trigger the minor condition. So the code would set is_minor to True.\n\nAnother example: 'A B H' — let's see. The notes are A (9), B (10), H (11). Let's check all permutations.\n\nTake permutation (A, B, H). Distance between A and B is 10-9=1. Then between B and H is 11-10=1. Not 3 or 4. Another permutation: (A, H, B). Distance between A and H: 11-9=2. Then H to B: 10-11 mod 12 is (10-11) = -1 mod 12 is 11. Not 3 or 4. Another permutation: B, A, H. Distance between B and A is (9-10) mod 12 → -1 mod 12 = 11. Not 3 or 4. Another permutation: B, H, A. Distance between B and H is 11-10=1. Then H to A is 9-11 mod 12 → (9-11) is -2 mod 12 is 10. Not 3 or 4. Another permutation: H, A, B. Distance between H and A is (9-11) mod 12 → -2 mod 12 is 10. Then A to B is 1. Not matching. Another permutation: H, B, A. Distance H to B is 10-11 mod 12 → (10-11) is -1 mod 12 is 11. Then B to A is 9-10 mod 12 → -1 mod 12 is 11. So none of the permutations would meet the major or minor conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work. But let's think about some edge cases.\n\nWhat if the three notes are C, E, G. Which is a major chord. But another permutation could be E, G, C. Let's check:\n\ndistance between E and G is 3. Then between G and C is (0 -7) mod 12 → 5. So that's not 3 or 4. So the code would still find the first permutation.\n\nAnother case: for a minor chord. Let's say the notes are B, C#, F. The code would check permutations, and one of them would be B, C#, F. The distance between B and C# is 3, between C# and F is 4. So that's minor.\n\nAnother case: what if the three notes are C, E, G#. Let's see. For major, the first two steps would be 4 and 3? Let's check. C to E is 4. E to G# is 8-4=4? Wait, E is position 4. G# is position 8. So 8-4=4. So the distance between E and G# is 4. So the first permutation (C, E, G#) would have dist_xy=4, dist_yz=4. Not 3. So no. So this is not a major. What about minor? For example, if there's a permutation where the first two steps are 3 and 4. Let's see. Suppose the notes are C, E, G#. Let's check all permutations. For example, C, G#, E. Distance between C and G# is 8-0=8. No. Another permutation: E, C, G#. Distance between E and C is (0-4) mod 12 = 8. Not 3. Another permutation: E, G#, C. Distance between E and G# is 4. Then between G# and C is (0-8) mod 12 is 4. So no. So this would be strange.\n\nAnother case: what about a minor chord. For example, C#, B, F. Which is the sample input. Let's check.\n\nNotes are C#, B, F. Permutation B, C#, F. B is 10, C# is 1. So distance between B and C# is (1 -10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5) is 5-1=4. So yes, minor.\n\nSo the code would detect that.\n\nAnother edge case: what if the three notes are the same? But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. But the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, the input is three notes. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. However, the code would check permutations. For example, if all three are C. Then for each permutation, the distance between first and second is 0. So no condition is met. So output is strange.\n\nAnother case: what if the three notes are C, E, B. Let's see. Let's check permutations. For example, C, E, B. Distance between C and E is 4. Then between E and B: B is position 10. So 10-4=6. So 6. Not 3. Another permutation: E, B, C. Distance between E (4) and B (10) is 6. Then between B and C (0) is (0-10) mod 12 = 2. Not 3 or 4. Another permutation: B, C, E. Distance between B and C is (0 -10) mod 12 = 2. Then between C and E is 4. So 2 and 4. Not matching. So no. So output strange.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the order of checking? For example, in the code, for each permutation, it checks for major and minor. So if a permutation satisfies both? Well, according to the problem statement, it's impossible. Because for a permutation, if dist_xy is 4 and dist_yz is 3, then the total distance from X to Z is 7. But for the same permutation, can it also satisfy dist_xy=3 and dist_yz=4? No. Because 4+3=7 and 3+4=7. But for the same permutation, the first part is 4 and the second is 3. So no. So the code can safely check for major and minor in all permutations.\n\nBut the code will check for both conditions in all permutations. For example, if a permutation satisfies both, but according to the problem statement, it's impossible.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, so the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations. However, permutations returns all possible orderings. So for three elements, 6 permutations.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way. For example, for each possible pair of notes as X and Y, check if the distance is 4, then check if there's a Z such that distance between Y and Z is 3. But since there are three notes, perhaps it's easier to generate all possible combinations.\n\nBut for three elements, the code is manageable.\n\nNow, the code uses the note_to_pos dictionary. But what if the input has a note that is not in the dictionary? According to the problem statement, the input is three notes in the given notation, so it's safe to assume that they are valid.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input: 'C E G' → code returns 'major'.\n\nSample input: 'C# B F' → code returns 'minor'.\n\nSample input: 'A B H' → code returns 'strange'.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# B F' → the code would generate permutations. One of them is B, C#, F. Which gives distance between B and C# is 3, and between C# and F is 4. So is_minor becomes True.\n\nAnother test case: 'B C# F' → same as above.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the permutations function returns tuples. So for the code, the line:\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\nEach perm is a tuple of three elements. So x, y, z = perm is okay.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, note that the input is read as a single line. For example, in the sample input, the input is given as a list of three strings, but in reality, the input is a single line with three notes separated by spaces. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nC E G\n\nWhich would be read as ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the note_to_pos dictionary, read the three notes, check permutations, etc.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    note_to_pos = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    notes = input().split()\n    is_major = False\n    is_minor = False\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_p = note_to_pos[x]\n        y_p = note_to_pos[y]\n        dist_xy = (y_p - x_p) % 12\n        y_p_z = note_to_pos[z]\n        dist_yz = (y_p_z - y_p) % 12\n        if dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3:\n            is_major = True\n        if dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4:\n            is_minor = True\n    if is_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what about the case where the same note is present multiple times? For example, if the input is C C C. Then, all permutations will have x, y, z as C. So the distance between x and y is 0, and between y and z is 0. So no conditions are met. So output is strange. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is C, E, G. Which is major.\n\nAnother case: input is C, E, G#. Let's see. For any permutation, does any meet the major or minor?\n\nFor example, C, E, G#. Distance between C and E is 4. Between E and G# is 8-4=4? Wait, G# is position 8. E is 4. So 8-4 =4. So dist_yz is 4. So 4 and 4. Not 4 and 3. So no. So the code returns strange.\n\nAnother case: input is C, E, B. Let's check. Let's see.\n\nFor permutation C, E, B. Dist_xy is 4. Dist_yz: B is position 10. E is 4. So 10-4=6. So 6. Not 3. So no. Another permutation: E, B, C. Dist_xy between E and B: 10-4=6. Then B to C is 0-10 mod 12 = 2. No. Another permutation: B, C, E. Dist_xy between B and C is 0-10 mod 12 → (0-10) = -10 mod 12 is 2. No. So no. So output strange.\n\nSo code works.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor chord based on the semitone distances between the notes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Positions**: First, we map each note to its corresponding position in the cyclic sequence of 12 musical notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between any two notes.\n2. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three input notes, we check if the distances between consecutive notes in the permutation meet the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using their positions in the cyclic sequence. The distance from note X to note Y is computed as `(position of Y - position of X) % 12`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    note_to_pos = {\n        'C': 0,\n        'C#': 1,\n        'D': 2,\n        'D#': 3,\n        'E': 4,\n        'F': 5,\n        'F#': 6,\n        'G': 7,\n        'G#': 8,\n        'A': 9,\n        'B': 10,\n        'H': 11\n    }\n    notes = input().split()\n    is_major = False\n    is_minor = False\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_p = note_to_pos[x]\n        y_p = note_to_pos[y]\n        dist_xy = (y_p - x_p) % 12\n        z_p = note_to_pos[z]\n        dist_yz = (z_p - y_p) % 12\n        if dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3:\n            is_major = True\n        if dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4:\n            is_minor = True\n    if is_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif is_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_pos` dictionary maps each note to its position in the cyclic sequence of 12 notes.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three space-separated notes which are read and stored in a list.\n3. **Checking Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the semitone distances between consecutive notes are calculated.\n4. **Major and Minor Check**: For each permutation, we check if the distances between the first and second note is 4 semitones and between the second and third note is 3 semitones (indicating a major chord), or if the distances are 3 and 4 semitones respectively (indicating a minor chord).\n5. **Result Determination**: Based on the checks, the result is printed as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\" depending on whether the conditions for major or minor chords are met.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the given notes to determine their chord type, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
