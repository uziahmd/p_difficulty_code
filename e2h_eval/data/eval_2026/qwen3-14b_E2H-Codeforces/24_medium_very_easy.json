She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. The problem says that each second she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. So the goal is to figure out the optimal steps.\n\nFirst, let's think about the initial setup. The current position is pos. The tabs that need to stay open are from l to r. So any tabs outside this range need to be closed. But how?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The key is to determine which tabs need to be closed. For example, if the current l and r include all tabs, then nothing needs to be done. Like the third example where l=1 and r=5 and n=5, so output is 0.\n\nOtherwise, we need to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. But how to do that efficiently.\n\nThe closing operations can be done by moving the cursor to the correct position and then closing. For example, to close tabs to the left of l, she needs to be at position l, then close all to the left. Similarly for closing tabs to the right of r, she needs to be at position r, then close all to the right.\n\nBut what if the current pos is already in the [l, r] range? Then maybe she can just close the left and right parts with minimal steps.\n\nWait, but the initial position may not be in the [l, r] range. For example, if pos is less than l, then she needs to move to l first, then close the left. Or maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me think about the steps required.\n\nCase 1: The current pos is already within [l, r]. Then, she can close the tabs to the left (if any) and to the right (if any). But how?\n\nFor example, if l=2 and r=4, and pos is 3. Then, she can close all tabs to the left (which would be tabs 1) by moving to 2 (but wait, the current position is 3. To close the left, she needs to be at position l (2), then close left. So she needs to move from 3 to 2 (takes 1 second), then close left (1 second). Then, she needs to move to r (4) and close right. But in this case, the right is 4, so she can move from 2 to 4 (two steps?), then close right (another second). But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can first close the left and then the right, or vice versa. But the order might affect the steps.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal approach is to first close the left part, then the right part, or the other way around. Let's think about the steps required for each scenario.\n\nSo, the general approach is:\n\n- Determine whether we need to close tabs on the left (i.e., l > 1) and/or on the right (r < n).\n\nThen, for each of those, we need to calculate the steps required to reach the position where we can close them.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the steps as follows:\n\nIf we need to close tabs to the left of l, then we need to move to l, then close them. Similarly, if we need to close tabs to the right of r, we need to move to r, then close them.\n\nBut moving to l and r depends on the current position and the positions of l and r.\n\nBut what's the minimal steps needed to reach l and r?\n\nWait, but after closing the left, the a and b values change. For example, when you close the left, the new a is l. So, when you close the left, you can do that once you are at l. Then, after that, when you need to close the right, you can be at r, but the a and b would have changed. However, since the problem requires that only the tabs in [l, r] remain, once you close the left and right, you're done.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nIf the current position is already in [l, r], then:\n\n- If there are tabs to the left (i.e., l > 1), then you need to move to l, then close left. The time for that is (distance from current pos to l) + 1 (for the close operation).\n\n- Similarly, if there are tabs to the right (r < n), then you need to move to r, then close right. The time for that is (distance from current pos to r) + 1.\n\nBut wait, after closing the left, the a and b change. However, when you close the left, you can do that once you are at l. Then, when you close the right, you need to be at r. But after closing the left, the a is l, and the b is n (until you close the right). But when you close the right, you have to be at r, which is within the current a and b (since r is in the original [l, r] range). So that's okay.\n\nBut how do you move from the position after closing the left to the position r? Because after closing the left, the a is l, and the current position is l. Then, moving to r would take (r - l) steps. Then, closing the right takes 1 second. So total steps would be (distance to l) + 1 (close left) + (distance from l to r) + 1 (close right). But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can close left and right in one go. For example, if you are at l, you can close left, and then move to r and close right. Or, if you are at r, you can close right first, then move to l and close left. Which is better?\n\nBut the problem is that the order of closing left and right may affect the steps. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose l=2, r=4, pos=3. So the initial position is in the [l, r] range.\n\nIf we want to close left first:\n\nMove from 3 to 2 (1 step). Close left (1 sec). Now, the a is 2, and the current position is 2. Then, move from 2 to 4 (2 steps). Close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1+1 + 2+1 = 5 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, close right first: move from 3 to 4 (1 step). Close right (1 sec). Then move from 4 to 2 (2 steps). Close left (1 sec). Total steps 1+1 + 2+1 = 5. Same.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. What if you don't move to l and r, but do something else?\n\nBut I think that the minimal steps are required to reach l and r, then perform the close operations. So for the case where the initial position is inside [l, r], the steps required are:\n\ntime_to_l = |pos - l| steps to move to l. Then 1 sec to close left.\n\ntime_to_r = |pos - r| steps to move to r. Then 1 sec to close right.\n\nBut if you have to do both, then the total steps would be (time_to_l + 1) + (time_to_r + 1) - ... but wait, because after closing left, you have to move from l to r, which takes (r - l) steps. So the total steps would be:\n\nIf you first close left, then close right:\n\nsteps = (distance from pos to l) + 1 (close left) + (distance from l to r) + 1 (close right).\n\nWhich equals (pos - l) + 1 + (r - l) + 1 = (pos - l + r - l) + 2 = ?\n\nAlternatively, if you first close right, then close left:\n\nsteps = (distance from pos to r) + 1 + (distance from r to l) + 1.\n\nWhich would be (r - pos) + 1 + (r - l) + 1.\n\nBut which is better? It depends on the position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. For example, if you can close both left and right in one movement. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because the close operations can only be done once you are at a certain position. For example, to close the left, you need to be at l, and to close the right, you need to be at r.\n\nBut perhaps, after moving to l and closing the left, you can move to r directly. But the movement is done step by step.\n\nBut regardless, the total steps would be the sum of the movement steps plus two closing steps (since each closing takes one second).\n\nBut maybe there's a way to combine these steps. For example, if you can move from pos to l, then close left, then move to r (which is to the right of l) and close right. Or move from pos to r, close right, then move to l and close left.\n\nSo the total steps for both would be:\n\nOption 1: (distance from pos to l) + 1 + (distance from l to r) + 1.\n\nOption 2: (distance from pos to r) + 1 + (distance from r to l) + 1.\n\nWe need to choose the minimum between option 1 and option 2.\n\nBut what if the initial position is such that it's better to do one or the other?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, if you can reach both l and r in a way that minimizes the steps. But I think the above options are the only possibilities.\n\nBut let's take the example given in the first input:\n\nInput is 6 3 2 4.\n\nSo n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nSo the initial position is 3, which is inside [2,4]. So need to close tabs to the left (tabs 1) and to the right (tabs 5 and 6).\n\nSo the steps according to the example are:\n\nMove to 2 (1 step), close left (1 sec). Then move to 3 (1 step?), then to 4 (another step?), then close right (1 sec). Wait, but the example says that the steps are 5. Let me check.\n\nIn the example explanation, the steps are:\n\nShift to tab 2 (from 3: 1 step), close left (1 sec). Then shift to 3 (1 step?), then to 4 (another step?), then close right (1 sec). So total steps: 1 (move) + 1 (close) + 1 (move) + 1 (move) + 1 (close) = 5 steps. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut according to our previous calculation, option 1 would be (distance from pos to l) is 1 (3 to 2), then 1 sec. Then distance from l to r is 2 (from 2 to 4), so steps would be 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which is exactly the same. So that's the same as option 1.\n\nSo in that case, the total steps are (distance to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way. For example, if you can move to r first, then close right, then move to l and close left. Let's see:\n\ndistance from pos (3) to r (4) is 1 step. Close right (1 sec). Then move from 4 to 2 (distance 2 steps). Close left (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Same as before.\n\nSo in this case, either way gives the same steps. So the minimal steps is 5.\n\nSo for the case where the initial position is inside the [l, r] range, and both left and right need to be closed, the steps would be (distance to l + distance from l to r + 2) or (distance to r + distance from r to l + 2). Which is the same as (distance to l + distance to r + 2) since distance from l to r is (r - l) and distance from r to l is (r - l) as well. Wait, no. If you are at l, moving to r is (r - l) steps. If you are at r, moving to l is (r - l) steps. So the sum of the two options is (distance to l) + (r - l) + 2 and (distance to r) + (r - l) + 2. So the minimal between the two is min( (distance to l) + (r - l) + 2, (distance to r) + (r - l) + 2 ). Which is equivalent to (r - l) + 2 + min( distance to l, distance to r ). \n\nBut distance to l is |pos - l|, distance to r is |pos - r|. So the minimal steps for this case would be (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) ?\n\nWait, no. Because in the example, (r - l) is 2 (4-2=2). min(|3-2|, |3-4|) is 1. So adding 2 + 1 + 2? Wait no. Wait the formula I thought was (r-l) + 2 + min(...). But in the example, (r-l) is 2, min is 1. So 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. Which matches.\n\nYes, because the steps are:\n\nmin( (distance to l) + (r - l) + 2, (distance to r) + (r - l) + 2 )\n\nWhich is (r - l) + 2 + min( distance to l, distance to r )\n\nSo that's the formula for when both left and right need to be closed.\n\nNow, what if only left needs to be closed (r == n)? For example, if l=2, r=6 (n=6). Then, after closing left, there's nothing to close on the right. So steps would be (distance to l) + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if only the right needs to be closed (l=1), then steps are (distance to r) + 1.\n\nBut what if the initial position is not in the [l, r] range?\n\nFor example, pos is less than l. So, suppose l=2, r=4, pos=1. Then, the current position is outside the desired range. So Luba needs to move to l (2), close left (which is tabs 1, since a was 1 initially, but after closing, the a becomes l=2). But how?\n\nBut the initial position is pos=1, which is outside the [l, r] range. So to close the left tabs (which are tabs to the left of l=2, i.e., tab 1), she must first move to l=2, then close left. But how to get there?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nMove from pos=1 to l=2 (1 step). Close left (1 sec). Then, need to close the right (tabs 5 and 6, assuming n=6). So then, move from 2 to r=4 (2 steps), close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5 steps. Which is same as before.\n\nBut what if the initial position is to the left of l? Then, to reach l, the movement steps is (l - pos) steps. Then close left.\n\nBut in this case, the initial position is outside the [l, r] range. So, the steps required to reach l is (l - pos) steps. Then, close left (1 sec). Then, the same as before for closing the right.\n\nBut what if the initial position is to the right of r? For example, pos=5, l=2, r=4, n=6. Then, need to close the right (tabs 5 and 6). So move to r=4 (1 step), close right (1 sec). Then, move to l=2 (2 steps), close left (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5 steps again.\n\nBut what about the case where the initial position is to the left of l, and there's no need to close the left? For example, l=1, r=4, pos=0 (but pos is 1-based, so pos can't be zero. So maybe another example: l=1, r=4, pos=1. Then, no need to close left. Only need to close right. So steps would be moving from pos=1 to r=4 (3 steps) and then close right (1 sec). Total 4 steps.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nFirst, check whether l is 1. If not, then need to close the left part. Similarly, check if r is n. If not, need to close the right part.\n\nBut how to compute the steps required for each scenario.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nCase 1: The desired segment [l, r] includes all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n). Then, answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to consider whether we need to close the left (left_close = (l > 1)) and whether we need to close the right (right_close = (r < n)).\n\nNow, depending on the current position, and whether the current position is inside [l, r], we have different scenarios.\n\nSo:\n\nIf the current pos is inside [l, r]:\n\nThen, if both left and right need to be closed, then the steps are (steps to reach l or r) + ... as discussed earlier.\n\nIf only left needs to be closed, then steps are (distance from pos to l) + 1.\n\nIf only right needs to be closed, steps are (distance from pos to r) + 1.\n\nIf neither left nor right need to be closed, then steps is 0.\n\nBut if the current pos is not inside [l, r], then we need to move to the [l, r] range first, then proceed.\n\nFor example, if pos is to the left of l. Then, we need to move to l (steps: l - pos). Then, close left (if needed). Then, proceed to close right (if needed).\n\nBut wait, if pos is to the left of l, then the left part (tabs to the left of l) includes pos. So, when we close the left, we need to be at l. So steps to reach l (l - pos steps), then close left (1 sec). Then, the same steps as before for closing right.\n\nSimilarly, if pos is to the right of r, then steps to reach r (pos - r steps), then close right (1 sec). Then, steps to close left (if needed).\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\nCalculate the steps required for closing left and right, considering the current position and whether it's inside [l, r].\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nIf left needs to be closed (l > 1):\n\n- We need to reach l. The steps to reach l depends on whether the current pos is to the left, inside, or to the right of l.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps to reach l is |pos - l| steps. Because even if the current pos is to the right of l (but inside [l, r]), moving to l takes |pos - l| steps.\n\nOnce at l, close left (1 sec).\n\nSimilarly for closing right: steps to reach r is |pos - r| steps, then close right (1 sec).\n\nBut if the current pos is not inside [l, r], then after moving to l (or r), we have to then proceed to close the other side.\n\nSo, combining all possibilities, perhaps the minimal steps is:\n\ntotal_steps = 0\n\nif left needs to be closed:\n\n   steps_to_reach_l = abs(pos - l)\n\n   total_steps += steps_to_reach_l + 1\n\nif right needs to be closed:\n\n   steps_to_reach_r = abs(pos - r)\n\n   total_steps += steps_to_reach_r + 1\n\nBut this is not correct. Because if the current position is inside [l, r], then after moving to l (steps_to_reach_l), then moving to r would take (r - l) steps. So the steps_to_reach_r is (r - l) steps, not |pos - r| steps. Because after moving to l, then moving to r takes (r - l) steps. But in this approach, the steps_to_reach_r would be |pos - r|, which is (r - pos). But if the pos is in [l, r], then |pos - r| is (r - pos), but after moving to l, the steps to reach r is (r - l). So the total steps would be steps_to_reach_l (pos to l) + 1 (close left) + steps_to_reach_r (l to r) + 1 (close right). Which is (pos - l) + (r - l) + 2, if pos is in [l, r] and l <= pos <= r.\n\nBut according to the previous approach, steps_to_reach_l is |pos - l|, steps_to_reach_r is |pos - r|. So the total steps would be (pos - l) + 1 + (r - pos) + 1 = (r - l) + 2. Which is less than the actual steps needed. So this approach is wrong.\n\nAh, here's the problem. The steps_to_reach_r in the previous approach is based on the initial position, but after moving to l, the steps to reach r is different.\n\nSo, the previous approach is incorrect. Therefore, we need to model the steps correctly.\n\nSo, the problem arises when both left and right need to be closed. Because the steps to reach r depends on where you are after closing the left.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nIf both left and right need to be closed:\n\n   The minimal steps would be:\n\n   min( (steps to reach l) + (steps from l to r) + 2, (steps to reach r) + (steps from r to l) + 2 )\n\nBut steps from l to r is (r - l), steps from r to l is (r - l) as well.\n\nSo, the total steps would be min( (steps to reach l) + (r - l) + 2, (steps to reach r) + (r - l) + 2 )\n\nWhich simplifies to (r - l) + 2 + min(steps_to_reach_l, steps_to_reach_r)\n\nBut steps_to_reach_l is |pos - l|, steps_to_reach_r is |pos - r|.\n\nSo, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the steps are (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut what if the current position is outside [l, r]? For example, pos is to the left of l. Then steps_to_reach_l is (l - pos), steps_to_reach_r is (r - pos) (since pos is left of l, and r is to the right of l). So the min between (l - pos) and (r - pos) is (l - pos), so the steps would be (r - l) + 2 + (l - pos) = r - l + 2 + l - pos = r - pos + 2.\n\nWhich is (r - pos) + 2. But how?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose l=2, r=4, pos=1. Then, steps_to_reach_l is 1 (from 1 to 2). steps_to_reach_r is 3 (from 1 to 4). So min is 1. So the total steps is (4-2) + 2 + 1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which is the same as (steps to reach l) + (steps from l to r) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which is correct. Alternatively, if we had chosen to reach r first, steps_to_reach_r is 3 steps (from pos=1 to r=4), then steps from r to l is 2 steps (from 4 to 2). So total steps is 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. Which is worse than 5. So the formula works.\n\nSo, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the steps are (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut how to handle all cases?\n\nLet me think of all possibilities:\n\nCase 1: No need to close left or right (l=1 and r=n). Steps is 0.\n\nCase 2: Need to close left (l>1) and right (r <n):\n\n   steps = (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nCase 3: Need to close left only (l>1, r =n):\n\n   steps = steps to reach l (|pos - l|) + 1\n\nCase 4: Need to close right only (r <n, l=1):\n\n   steps = steps to reach r (|pos - r|) + 1\n\nBut wait, what if the current pos is not in [l, r]?\n\nFor example, in case 3, if l=2, r=6 (n=6), and pos is 1 (outside [l, r]). Then steps to reach l is 1 (from 1 to 2), then close left (1 sec). So total steps is 1 + 1 = 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the current pos is to the right of r (like in case 3, but pos=7, but n=6, so pos can't be 7). So, pos can be in [1, n].\n\nAnother example: l=2, r=6 (n=6). pos=5 (inside [l, r]). steps to reach l is 3 (5-2=3 steps). Then close left (1 sec). So total steps 3+1=4. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if pos is to the right of r? Well, in case 3, r is n, so pos can't be to the right of r.\n\nSo the formula for case 3 and 4 seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what about when the current pos is already in [l, r]?\n\nFor example, case 3: l=2, r=6 (n=6), pos=3 (inside [l, r]). steps to reach l is 1 (3 to 2), then close left (1 sec). So total steps 1 + 1 = 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo, yes, the formula for case 3 and 4 holds.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nWe need to check:\n\nleft_close = (l > 1)\n\nright_close = (r < n)\n\nif not left_close and not right_close:\n\n    answer is 0\n\nelif left_close and right_close:\n\n    answer is (r - l) + 2 + min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\nelif left_close:\n\n    answer is abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelse: # right_close\n\n    answer is abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. left_close (2>1 → yes), right_close (4<6 → yes). So (4-2) is 2, +2 → 4, plus min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 → min is 1. Total 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 → which matches the sample.\n\nSecond example: input 6 3 1 3. l=1, r=3. left_close is 1>1? No. right_close is 3 <6 → yes. So answer is abs(3 - 3) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches sample.\n\nThird example: input 5 2 1 5. l=1, r=5. left and right are not closed. answer 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 2 1 3. So l=1, r=3. right_close is 3 <5 → yes. So answer is abs(2-3) +1 → 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, but what's the actual steps? The current pos is 2 (inside [1,3]). Need to close right (tabs 4 and 5). So move to 3 (1 step), close right (1 sec). Total 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: pos is outside [l, r]. Let's say n=6, pos=1, l=2, r=4. left_close and right_close. So (4-2) is 2. min( |1-2|=1, |1-4|=3) → 1. So 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 steps. Which is correct as discussed earlier.\n\nAnother example: pos is to the right of r. Let's say n=6, pos=5, l=2, r=4. So left_close and right_close. (4-2) is 2. min( |5-2|=3, |5-4|=1) → 1. So 2 + 2 +1 =5 steps. Which would be steps: move to r (4) in 1 step, close right (1 sec). Then move to l (2) (distance 2 steps), close left (1 sec). Total 1+1+2+1=5. Correct.\n\nSo this formula seems to work.\n\nSo now, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nleft_close = l > 1\n\nright_close = r < n\n\nif left_close and right_close:\n\n    ans = (r - l) + 2 + min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\nelif left_close:\n\n    ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_close:\n\n    ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    ans = 0\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r <n? Then, left_close is false (since l=1), and right_close is true. So ans is abs(pos - r) + 1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the current pos is already in the [l, r] range? For example, when l=2 and r=4, pos=3. Then, the formula for left and right close is (r - l) + 2 + min(...). Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the current pos is outside [l, r]?\n\nLike, l=2, r=4, pos=1. Then, the formula gives (4-2) + 2 + min(1, 3) → 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nWait, but let's think of a case where the pos is not in [l, r], but only one side needs to be closed.\n\nFor example: l=2, r=4 (n=6). pos=5. So need to close right (r=4 <6). So ans is abs(5 -4) +1 = 1 +1 =2 steps. Which is correct: move from 5 to 4 (1 step), close right (1 sec). Total 2 steps.\n\nAnother example: pos=5, l=2, r=6. So right_close is false (r=6 ==n). left_close is true (l=2>1). So ans is (abs(5-2) +1) = 3+1=4 steps. Which would be moving from 5 to 2 (3 steps), close left (1 sec). So total 4 steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: pos is 1, l=2, r=6 (so only left needs to be closed). So steps is abs(1-2) +1 = 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this formula seems to cover all cases.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_close = l > 1\n\n    right_close = r < n\n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n\n        ans = (r - l) + 2 + min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) )\n\n    elif left_close:\n\n        ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_close:\n\n        ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        ans = 0\n\n    print(ans)\n\nWait, but what about when l=1 and r <n? For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. So left_close is false, right_close is true. So ans is abs(pos - r) +1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the pos is already in [l, r]?\n\nLike, pos=2, l=1, r=3. So ans is abs(2 -3) +1 = 1+1=2 steps. Which is correct (move to 3, close right).\n\nBut what if pos is already at r? Then, steps is 0 +1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the current pos is to the left of l, but l=1? For example, l=1, r=3, pos=0 (invalid, but pos is between 1 and n). So no such case.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. left and right close. (r-l) = 2. min(3-2=1, 3-4=1) → 1. So 2+2+1=5 → correct.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. right_close (3 <6). ans is abs(3-3) +1 → 0+1=1 → correct.\n\nSample 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. So output 0 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 2 1 5 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: input 5 5 1 5 → output 0.\n\nAnother case: input 5 5 1 4 → l=1, r=4. right_close is 4 <5 → yes. ans is abs(5-4) +1 = 1+1=2 steps.\n\nWhich is correct: move from 5 to 4 (1 step), close right (1 sec).\n\nAnother case: input 5 1 2 4 → l=2, r=4. left_close (2>1), right_close (4<5). So (4-2) =2 + 2 + min(1-2=1, 1-4=3 → 1). So 2+2+1=5 steps. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as four integers.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as a single line of input. Wait, the sample input shows three lines, but the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nWait, the sample input shows three lines, but that's probably for multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo the input is a single line with four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines. But that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Because in the sample input, the user provided three test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So the code should read a single line of input, split into four integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the problem may have multiple test cases, but the problem statement says that the input is a single line. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, no.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves calculating the optimal steps to move the cursor and close the tabs efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` (i.e., `l > 1`) and/or to the right of `r` (i.e., `r < n`).\n2. **Calculate Movement Steps**: Depending on whether tabs need to be closed on the left, right, or both sides, compute the necessary movements and closing operations:\n   - If both sides need closing, calculate the minimum steps required to reach either end of the segment and then close both sides.\n   - If only one side needs closing, compute the steps required to move to that side and close it.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Directly return 0 if the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_close = l > 1\n    right_close = r < n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n        ans = (r - l) + 2 + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))\n    elif left_close:\n        ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_close:\n        ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        ans = 0\n    print(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Identify Tabs to Close**: The variables `left_close` and `right_close` check if there are tabs to close on the left and right sides respectively.\n- **Movement and Closing Steps**:\n  - If both sides need closing, the formula `(r - l) + 2 + min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))` calculates the minimal steps by considering the shortest path to either end of the segment and then closing both sides.\n  - If only one side needs closing, the steps are calculated based on the distance from the current position to the respective end of the segment plus one second to close the tabs.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If the segment [l, r] already includes all tabs, no actions are needed, hence the result is 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps required by considering both movement and closing operations optimally.",
