After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column in the gradebook), find the maximum value.\n2. For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many students meet this condition.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, input handling. The input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line is a string of digits. So for example, if the input is '223', that's the first student's marks for 3 subjects.\n\nSo, I need to read the input, parse it into a 2D array. Let's think: for each student, their marks are a list of integers. Then, for each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n\nOnce I have the maximums for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the maximum of that subject. If yes, then the student is successful.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines as a list of strings.\n- Convert each string into a list of integers. So, for example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n- Then, for each subject (column index j from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum value among all students' marks in that column.\n- Once we have these max values for each subject, iterate through each student and check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max of that subject. If at least one exists, count the student.\n\nNow, how to compute the max for each subject?\n\nFor each column j, iterate through all students' marks in that column. For example, for j=0, collect all the first elements of each student's marks list, then take max.\n\nOnce I have the max for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max of that subject.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. Let's say I have a list of lists: marks = [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]] for the first example. Then for each column j, compute max.\n\nFor j=0, the column is [2,2,1] → max is 2. For j=1, [2,3,1] → max 3. For j=2, [3,2,2] → max 3.\n\nThen for each student:\n\nStudent 0: has marks 2,2,3. Check for each subject:\n\nSubject 0: 2 == max (2) → yes. So this student is successful.\n\nStudent 1: marks 2,3,2. Subject 1 has 3 which is max. So yes.\n\nStudent 2: marks 1,1,2. None of them are equal to the max of their respective subjects. So no.\n\nHence total successful is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read input. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut in the input example given, the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, when reading from stdin, the input is read as lines. But for code submission, the code must read from stdin.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read n lines, each line being a string. Then convert each string into a list of integers.\n\nThen, for each column j (from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum value.\n\nOnce we have the max for each column, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max of that column. If yes, count them.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\nlines = ['223', '232', '112']\n\nThen, convert each line into a list of integers. So:\n\nmarks = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\nThen, for each column j in",
