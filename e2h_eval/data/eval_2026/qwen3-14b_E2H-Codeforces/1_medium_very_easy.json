The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of gilded cells for each ring. The problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do I find the number of cells in that ring?\n\nHmm, right. The perimeter of a rectangle. Oh right, but for a grid. Let me think. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the perimeter would be 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows contribute W each, and the left and right columns contribute (H-2) each (since the corners are already counted). Alternatively, it's 2*(W + H) - 4. Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width), but since each cell is a unit, maybe that's the way. Wait, for example, a 3x3 rectangle. The perimeter would be 3*4 - 4 = 8? Which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1 and output is 8. Yes. So the formula for each ring is 2*(width + height) - 4. But wait, the width and height here are the dimensions of the rectangle for that particular ring.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w', h') where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but what if the rectangle becomes too small? Like, for example, if i is such that w' or h' becomes less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. The problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions w' and h' must be at least 3? Or maybe not. Let me think. For example, if the original w and h are 3, then for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3, and for i=2, it would be 3-4*(1) = -1? But that's impossible. But the input constraints for k are such that it's valid. So the problem says that k is given as up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ), which ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So for each i, the w' and h' are at least 3? Or maybe not. Let me check with the example.\n\nTake the third example input: 7 9 2. Let's see for i=1: w' is 7, h' is 9. The perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16-4=28. For i=2, w' is 7 -4*(1) = 3, h' is 9-4*(1) =5. Then perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12? Wait, but 2*(3+5) is 16, minus 4 gives 12. So adding 28 + 12 = 40, which matches the third example's output of 40. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1), h -4*(i-1)), sum all those perimeters.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nadd to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, let me check for the first example input: 3 3 1. So current_w =3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the first output.\n\nAnother example: input 7 9 1. Then perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16-4=28. Which matches the second example's output of 28.\n\nYes. So this formula works.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k.\n\nThen loop from 1 to k, compute for each i, the current_w and current_h, compute perimeter and sum.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be something like:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? But according to the problem statement, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. Because the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me check for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, current_w is 3-0=3, current_h is same. So okay.\n\nAnother example: if w and h are 7 and 9, then min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2. So floor(2) is 2. So k can be up to 2. For i=2, current_w is 7 -4*(1) = 3, current_h is 9-4*(1)=5. Both are >=3. So okay.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nLet me test the third example: 7 9 2. The first iteration i=1: perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 28. Second iteration i=2: 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's take w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5) -4 = 16. Which is 16. If k=2, then current_w is 5-4*(1) =1, current_h is same. Then perimeter would be 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. Wait, but that's a problem. But according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). For w=h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code will not have such cases.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the Python code is straightforward. Read the three integers, loop for each i from 1 to k, compute current_w and current_h, compute perimeter, add to total. Then print the total.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
