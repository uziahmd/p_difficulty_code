The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of gilded cells for each ring. The problem says that each ring is formed by the bordering cells of an inner rectangle. For the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do I calculate the number of cells in each ring?\n\nHmm, right. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle's perimeter would be 2*(3+3-2) = 8, which matches the first example where the output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), I need to compute this perimeter. But wait, the i-th ring is based on the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), right? So for each ring, the width and height decrease by 4*(i-1) each time. Wait, no, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1))? Let me think. For the first ring, i=1, it's the original dimensions. Then the second ring is 2 cells away from the edge, which would mean that the rectangle is (w - 4*(1)) and (h - 4*(1))? Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next rectangle is 4 less in both dimensions. So yes, for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), but wait, for the second ring, i=2, so it's 4*(2-1) = 4*1 = 4. So the rectangle is w-4, h-4. But then the perimeter for that ring would be 2*( (w-4) + (h-4) - 2 ) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the perimeter formula for a rectangle of size W x H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side has length W or H, but the four corners are counted twice. So for example, a 3x3 rectangle: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait, maybe another way: the perimeter is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because each side contributes width and height, but the four corners are counted twice. So 2*(width + height) - 4. Which is same as 2*(width + height - 2). So yes.\n\nSo for each ring i, the number of cells is 2*( (current_width + current_height) - 2 ), where current_width is w - 4*(i-1), current_height is h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for the first ring, i=1, current_width is w, current_height is h. So the perimeter is 2*(w + h - 2). Then for the next ring, i=2, current_width is w-4*(1) = w-4, current_height is h-4. So the perimeter is 2*( (w-4) + (h-4) - 2 ) = 2*(w + h - 4 - 2) = 2*(w + h - 6). Wait, but that's for the second ring.\n\nSo the total number of cells is the sum of perimeters for each ring from i=1 to k.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that for each ring, the current_width and current_height are at least 3? Because the problem says that the input k is such that it's valid. So for example, for the given constraints, the k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for each i from 1 to k, the current_width and current_height must be at least 3. Because for the i-th ring, the dimensions are w - 4*(i-1) and h - 4*(i-1). Let's see for the maximum possible i. Let's say min(w, h) is m. Then the maximum k is floor( (m + 1)/4 ). Let's take m=3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So for k=1, the first ring is 3x3, which is okay. For m=7, (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be 2. For i=2, the dimensions would be 7-4*(1) = 3, and same for h. So 3x3 again. So that's valid.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the current rectangle, and sum them all.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor i in 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nadd perimeter to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, but let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*(4) = 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. So current_w is 7, current_h is 9. perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. First ring is 7x9: 28. Second ring: i=2, current_w = 7 -4*(1) =3, current_h = 9 -4*(1) =5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the third example. So yes.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, the code in Python: read the input line as three integers. Then loop for each i from 1 to k, compute current_w and current_h, then add 2*(current_w + current_h - 2) to the total.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's valid. So for example, the input k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are >= 3. Because for i-th step, the minimum dimension is min(w, h) - 4*(i-1). Let's see for i= k. Let m = min(w, h). Then k is at most floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's check for i=k, the min dimension is m - 4*(k-1). Since k is at most floor( (m +1)/4 ), then 4*(k-1) <= (m +1) -4. So m - 4*(k-1) >= m - (m +1 -4) = 3. So yes, the min dimension is at least 3. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say, w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7: perimeter 2*(7+7-2)=2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter 2*(3+3-2) = 8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nAnother example: w=5, h=5, k=1. Perimeter is 2*(5+5-2)= 16. Which would be the outer ring. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input as three integers. The input is given as a single line, split into three parts. So in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the sum as explained.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let's write it.\n",
