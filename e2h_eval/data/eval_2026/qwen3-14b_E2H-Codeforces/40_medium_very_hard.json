The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the inversion count of p is greater than that of q. And then return this count modulo mod. The constraints are up to n=500, which is pretty big. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For each pair of permutations (p, q), we need to check two conditions: p < q lexicographically, and inv(p) > inv(q). The answer is the total number of such pairs.\n\nBut considering that the number of permutations is n! for each, the total possible pairs would be (n!)^2 / 2, but only for those where p < q. Wait, because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of pairs where p < q is (total permutations choose 2) = (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. But we need to find among these pairs how many satisfy inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nHmm. Let me think. Let's denote for all pairs (p, q) with p != q, exactly half of them have p < q. But maybe not, since the lex order isn't directly related to inversion counts. However, the problem is to count for all p < q, how many have inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this using some combinatorial properties. Let me think about inversion counts. For a permutation, the number of inversions can vary from 0 (sorted) to max (n*(n-1)/2) (reverse sorted).\n\nLet me denote for each permutation p, its inversion count as inv_p. Then for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, we want to count the number of pairs where inv_p > inv_q.\n\nBut how can I compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the total number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv_p > inv_q. Let's denote this as the answer. Let's denote the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q as T. Then, T is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But perhaps there's a symmetry here. If for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, exactly half of them have inv_p > inv_q and half have inv_p < inv_q, except when inv_p = inv_q. But that's probably not true. However, if we can find for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv_p > inv_q is equal to the number of pairs where inv_p < inv_q, then the answer would be (T - same_pairs)/2, where same_pairs is the number of pairs where inv_p = inv_q. But wait, because for each pair where p != q, either inv_p > inv_q or inv_p < inv_q. So the total number of such pairs is T = (number of pairs with p < q) + (number of pairs with q < p). But since the total number of unordered pairs is (n! choose 2), which equals T. So for the entire set of unordered pairs, the number of pairs where inv_p > inv_q is equal to the number of pairs where inv_p < inv_q, plus the number of pairs where inv_p = inv_q. So, if we can compute the number of pairs with inv_p = inv_q, then the number of pairs with inv_p > inv_q is (total_pairs - same_pairs) / 2. But how does that relate to our problem?\n\nOur problem requires that p < q and inv_p > inv_q. So, if we can compute the total number of pairs (p, q) where inv_p > inv_q, regardless of their lex order, then subtract those where q < p, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number of pairs where p < q and inv_p > inv_q is equal to (total_pairs_with_inv_p_greater - same_pairs)/something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Suppose that for the unordered pair {p, q}, inv_p > inv_q. Then exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) will be counted in the answer. So, if we can find the total number of unordered pairs where inv_p > inv_q, then the answer would be equal to the number of such unordered pairs where p < q. But how?\n\nLet me think again. Let's say that for an unordered pair {p, q} where inv_p > inv_q, then exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set where p < q. So the number of such pairs where p < q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p > inv_q. Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the two ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) satisfies p < q. Therefore, if we can compute the number of unordered pairs where inv_p > inv_q, then that's exactly the answer.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p > inv_q, and then that's the answer. Because for each such pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is in the condition p < q. So the answer is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p > inv_q.\n\nWait, but that's only true if for all unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p != inv_q, exactly one of inv_p > inv_q or inv_p < inv_q holds. Which is obviously true. So, the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p > inv_q is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p < inv_q. And the total number of unordered pairs where inv_p != inv_q is equal to total_pairs - same_pairs, where same_pairs is the number of unordered pairs where inv_p = inv_q. Therefore, the number of unordered pairs with inv_p > inv_q is (total_pairs - same_pairs) / 2.\n\nThus, the answer to the problem is (total_pairs - same_pairs) / 2.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to the original problem? Because the original problem is to count the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv_p > inv_q. Which is exactly equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p > inv_q. Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) satisfies p < q. So if inv_p > inv_q, then exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) contributes to the answer. Thus, the answer is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p > inv_q, which is (total_pairs - same_pairs)/2.\n\nBut what is total_pairs here? It's the total number of unordered pairs of distinct permutations. Which is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Wait, no. The total number of unordered pairs of distinct permutations is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2? No, because the number of unordered pairs is C(n! , 2) = (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. So yes.\n\nSo the answer is (C(n! , 2) - same_pairs) / 2, where same_pairs is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p == inv_q.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that p is lex smaller than q. So for each unordered pair {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of the two ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) has p < q. Therefore, if we have the number of unordered pairs where inv_p > inv_q, then that's exactly the answer. Because each such unordered pair contributes exactly one ordered pair (p, q) where p < q and inv_p > inv_q.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (total_pairs - same_pairs) / 2.\n\nBut wait, total_pairs here is C(n! , 2), which is the total number of unordered pairs. So the answer is (C(n! , 2) - same_pairs) / 2. But how do I compute same_pairs?\n\nsame_pairs is the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv_p == inv_q. For each possible inversion count k, if there are c_k permutations with inversion count k, then the number of unordered pairs for that k is C(c_k, 2). So same_pairs is the sum over all k of (c_k choose 2).\n\nTherefore, the answer is [ (total_pairs) - sum( c_k * (c_k -1 ) / 2 ) ] / 2 ?\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nThe total number of unordered pairs where inv_p != inv_q is total_pairs - same_pairs. And the number of unordered pairs where inv_p > inv_q is (total_pairs - same_pairs) / 2. Hence, the answer is that value.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing:\n\nanswer = [ ( (n! * (n! - 1 )) // 2 ) - same_pairs ] // 2 \n\nBut wait, because (total_pairs - same_pairs) is the number of unordered pairs where inv_p != inv_q, and each of those contributes exactly once to either inv_p > inv_q or inv_p < inv_q. So the number of pairs where inv_p > inv_q is exactly (total_pairs - same_pairs) / 2.\n\nSo that's the formula.\n\nNow, the problem becomes:\n\nCompute:\n\nans = ( (total_pairs) - same_pairs ) // 2 \n\nwhere total_pairs is (n! * (n! - 1 )) // 2 \n\nand same_pairs is sum_{k} (c_k choose 2 )\n\nSo the main challenge is to compute c_k for all k, i.e., the number of permutations of size n with exactly k inversions.\n\nOnce we have c_k for all k, we can compute same_pairs as sum (c_k * (c_k - 1) // 2 )\n\nThen, compute the answer as (total_pairs - same_pairs) // 2, mod mod.\n\nBut for n up to 500, how can we compute the inversion counts for all permutations?\n\nThe standard approach for counting the number of permutations with exactly k inversions is using dynamic programming. Let's recall that.\n\nLet dp[n][k] be the number of permutations of size n with exactly k inversions.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\ndp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(k, n-1)} dp[n-1][k - i]\n\nBecause when adding the nth element (which is n) into a permutation of size n-1, inserting it at position i (from 0 to n-1) adds i inversions. So for each permutation of size n-1 with m inversions, inserting the new element in position i will contribute i inversions, leading to m + i inversions. So the total number of permutations for n elements with k inversions is the sum over i from 0 to min(k, n-1) of dp[n-1][k - i].\n\nBut for n up to 500, the maximum number of inversions is 500*499/2 = 124750. So for dp[n][k], the maximum k is 124750. So for n=500, the maximum k is around 125,000. So the DP table would be of size 500 x 125000. Which is manageable? Well, 500 * 125,000 is 62,500,000 entries. Each entry is a number that can be very large, but since we need to compute the sum for same_pairs, which is sum (c_k choose 2 ), which can be up to (n! )^2, but since we have to compute it modulo mod, but mod can be arbitrary. Wait, but the problem says that mod may not be prime, so we can't use modular inverses. However, in our case, the answer is computed as (total_pairs - same_pairs) // 2. But how can we compute this when the numbers are huge?\n\nBut for n up to 500, the numbers involved in c_k can be very large. For example, n! is 500! which is way beyond anything we can store as integers in Python. But since Python supports big integers, perhaps we can compute the DP table with big integers, and then compute same_pairs as sum (c_k * (c_k - 1) // 2 ), and then compute the answer.\n\nBut even for n=500, the maximum possible k is 500*499/2 = 124750. So the DP table for n=500 would have 124750+1 entries per n. So for 500 n's, that's 500 * 124750 entries. Which is about 62 million entries. However, for each entry, the value can be up to (n! ), which is way too big to handle. But in Python, big integers are allowed, but the computation time might be a problem.\n\nBut perhaps we can compute the DP table with the counts, and for each step, compute the values mod something? Wait, but no. Because same_pairs is sum (c_k choose 2 ), which is (sum c_k^2 - sum c_k ) / 2. And sum c_k is n! (since each permutation has exactly one inversion count). So sum c_k = n!.\n\nSo same_pairs = (sum c_k^2 - n! ) / 2.\n\nBut how do I compute sum c_k^2?\n\nWell, sum c_k^2 is the sum over all permutations p and q of [1 if inv(p) = inv(q), else 0]. Which is the same as the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = inv(q). Which is same_pairs * 2 + ... no, same_pairs is the number of unordered pairs. Wait, no. The sum c_k^2 is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where inv(p) = inv(q). So same_pairs (the unordered pairs) is sum (c_k choose 2 ), which is (sum c_k^2 - sum c_k ) / 2. Because sum (c_k choose 2 ) = sum [c_k (c_k -1 ) / 2 ] = (sum c_k^2 - sum c_k ) / 2.\n\nSo, if I can compute sum c_k^2, then same_pairs can be calculated as (sum_c_k_squared - n! ) // 2.\n\nBut how can I compute sum c_k^2?\n\nWell, sum c_k^2 is the square of the number of permutations, but no. It's the sum of squares of the counts of each inversion count. Which is different.\n\nBut perhaps there's a generating function approach. The generating function for the inversion counts of permutations of size n is P_n(x) = sum_{k} dp[n][k] * x^k. Then sum c_k^2 is the coefficient of x^0 in P_n(x) * P_n(x^{-1}) evaluated at x=1? Or perhaps it's the value of P_n(1) * P_n(1) minus something? No, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of squares of the coefficients of P_n(x) is equal to the value of P_n(1) * P_n(1) if all terms are multiplied by x^k. Wait, no. The sum of squares of coefficients of a polynomial P(x) is equal to the inner product of P(x) with itself, which is the coefficient of x^0 in P(x) * P(1/x). But that's complicated.\n\nBut for our purposes, maybe we can compute sum c_k^2 by using a dynamic programming approach. Let's think about the recurrence for the sum of squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the DP computation, we can track for each n, the sum of squares of the counts. But how?\n\nLet me think. For each n, the generating function is P_n(x) = sum_{k} dp[n][k] x^k. Then, P_n(x) = P_{n-1}(x) * (1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^{n-1} } ). Because inserting the nth element into a permutation of size n-1 can add 0 to n-1 inversions. So the generating function for the nth step is the convolution of the previous generating function with the polynomial (1 + x + ... + x^{n-1}).\n\nBut for sum c_k^2, which is the sum of squares of the coefficients of P_n(x), perhaps there's a recurrence for that. Let me denote S(n) = sum_{k} (dp[n][k])^2.\n\nThen, how can we compute S(n) based on S(n-1)?\n\nWell, since P_n(x) = P_{n-1}(x) * Q(x), where Q(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + ... + x^{n-1} }, then the coefficients of P_n(x) are the convolution of the coefficients of P_{n-1}(x) and Q(x).\n\nSo, the square of the coefficients of P_n(x) would be the sum over all pairs (i,j) where the coefficient of x^k in P_n(x) is the sum_{m} a_m * b_{k - m}, where a_m is the coefficient of x^m in P_{n-1}(x), and b_{k - m} is the coefficient of x^{k - m} in Q(x). But this seems complex for summing squares.\n\nAlternatively, S(n) = sum_{k} (sum_{i} a_i * b_{k - i})^2, where a_i is the coefficients of P_{n-1}(x), and b_j is the coefficients of Q(x). This seems computationally intensive, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, note that S(n) is the inner product of P_n(x) with itself, which is the same as P_n(1) * P_n(1) if the coefficients are multiplied in a certain way. But that's not helpful. Wait, P_n(1) is the sum of the coefficients of P_n(x), which is n! (since it's the number of permutations of size n). So P_n(1) = n!.\n\nBut the sum of squares of coefficients is not directly related to P_n(1). So maybe this approach is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the DP process, for each n and k, we can track not only the count of permutations with k inversions, but also the sum of squares. However, I don't see an obvious recurrence for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each n, we can compute the sum of squares as follows: when building dp[n][k], the sum of squares for n is the sum over all possible ways to insert the nth element into permutations of size n-1. For each permutation of size n-1 with m inversions, inserting the new element in position i (adding i inversions) gives a permutation of size n with m+i inversions. The sum of squares for n would be sum_{m} sum_{i} (number of ways to reach m+i) squared. But that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the convolution. Let me denote that for n, the sum of squares is the sum_{a} (sum_{b} A[b] * B[a - b})^2, where A is the array of counts for n-1, and B is the array of counts for the new insertion (which is 1 for 0..n-1 inversions). But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of squares can be computed using the recurrence:\n\nS(n) = sum_{k} (dp[n][k])^2 = sum_{k} [ (sum_{i=0}^{min(k, n-1)} dp[n-1][k - i} ) ]^2 \n\nWhich is O(k^2) per n, which would be too slow for n=500 and k up to 1e5.\n\nBut given that n is up to 500 and k up to 1e5, this seems computationally challenging. However, for the problem, perhaps we can precompute the dp[n][k] table, and then compute sum_c_k_squared as sum( (dp[n][k])^2 for all k ), once we have the dp table filled.\n\nBut for n=500, and k up to 124750, the dp table would take O(n^2) space. Let's see:\n\nFor each n, the maximum inversion count is (n)(n-1)/2. So for n=500, the maximum inversion count is 500*499/2 = 124750. So the dp array for n=500 would need to hold up to 124750 entries. So the dp table can be represented as a 2D array where dp[n][k] is the number of permutations of size n with k inversions.\n\nNow, the initial condition is dp[1][0] = 1. For n=1, there's only one permutation, with 0 inversions.\n\nThen for each n from 2 to 500, and for each possible inversion count k, we compute dp[n][k] as the sum of dp[n-1][k - i] for i from 0 to min(n-1, k).\n\nBut for each n, the maximum k is (n)(n-1)/2. So for each n, the dp[n] array can be built up from dp[n-1].\n\nBut with n up to 500, and k up to 124750, this would require a lot of computation. However, in Python, with optimized loops, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's think about the steps:\n\nInitialize a 2D array (or two 1D arrays, since for each step, we only need the previous step's data). For example, we can have a current array for n, and a previous array for n-1.\n\nFor n=1, the array is [1] (for k=0).\n\nFor n=2, the maximum inversion count is 1. The possible k values are 0 and 1. For each k in 0..1:\n\ndp[2][k] = sum_{i=0}^min(1, k) dp[1][k - i} \n\nFor k=0: i can be 0. dp[1][0] = 1 → dp[2][0] = 1.\n\nFor k=1: i can be 0 or 1. But dp[1][1 - 0] is dp[1][1], which is 0. dp[1][1 - 1] = dp[1][0] = 1. So sum is 1. So dp[2][1] = 1.\n\nWhich makes sense: permutations [1,2] (0 inversions) and [2,1] (1 inversion).\n\nSo for each step, we can compute the new dp array based on the previous one.\n\nBut for n=500, and for each n, for each k up to (n)(n-1)/2, this could be O(n^3) time. For n=500, that would be O(500^3) = 125,000,000 operations. Which might be acceptable in Python if optimized properly, but perhaps not. Let's think about the actual steps.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible k for each n. For n, the max k is m = n*(n-1)/2. For each n, when building the dp[n] array, for each k from 0 to m, we need to compute dp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(n-1, k)} dp_prev[k - i}.\n\nBut for each k, the sum is over i from 0 to min(n-1, k). So for each k, the upper limit is min(n-1, k). However, since for the previous step, dp_prev has entries up to (n-1)(n-2)/2. So when we compute dp[n][k], for k up to m = n(n-1)/2, we need to make sure that k - i is within the range of the previous dp_prev array.\n\nBut for each k, the sum is over i from 0 to min(n-1, k), and for each i, the term is dp_prev[k - i], but if k - i is less than zero, then that term is zero. However, since k ranges from 0 to m, and i ranges from 0 to min(n-1, k), then k - i ranges from k - min(n-1, k) to k. For example, if k >= n-1, then i can be up to n-1, so k - i can be as low as k - (n-1). Since k can be up to m = n(n-1)/2, and n-1 is up to 500, this seems manageable.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently. For each n, and for each k, the sum for dp[n][k] is the sum of dp_prev[k - i] for i in 0 to min(n-1, k). Which is equivalent to the sum of dp_prev[j] for j from (k - min(n-1, k)) to k, but j must be >=0. Alternatively, it's the sum of dp_prev[j] where j ranges from max(0, k - (n-1)) to k, but since i can be 0 to min(n-1, k), then j = k - i ranges from k - min(n-1, k) to k. But since i can be up to n-1, then j can be as low as k - (n-1). However, for j to be >=0, we have to take max(0, k - (n-1)).\n\nBut this is equivalent to taking the sum of dp_prev[j] for j from max(0, k - (n-1)) to k. However, for each k, the number of terms in the sum is min(n-1, k+1). For example, if k is large enough (>=n-1), then the sum is over n terms (from k - (n-1) to k). Otherwise, it's k+1 terms.\n\nThis seems like a sliding window sum. For each n, we can compute the dp[n] array by using a prefix sum array of the previous dp_prev array.\n\nYes! Because for each k, the sum is a range of the previous dp_prev array. So if we precompute the prefix sums of dp_prev, then for each k, the sum is prefix_sum[k] - prefix_sum[ max(0, k - (n-1) - 1) ].\n\nWait, the prefix sum array for dp_prev is pre_sum where pre_sum[i] = sum_{j=0}^i dp_prev[j}.\n\nThen, the sum from j = a to j = b is pre_sum[b] - pre_sum[a-1], assuming a>0. If a is 0, then it's pre_sum[b].\n\nSo, for each k, the sum is sum_{j = max(0, k - (n-1))}^k dp_prev[j}.\n\nBut since the maximum i is n-1, the minimum j is k - (n-1). So the sum is from j = max(0, k - (n-1)) to j = k. So the length of this interval is (k - max(0, k - (n-1)) + 1) terms.\n\nSo for each n, and for each k, we can compute this sum in O(1) time using the prefix sum array of dp_prev. This reduces the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2 * m), where m is the maximum inversion count per n. But since m is O(n^2), the overall time complexity is O(n^3), which for n=500 is 500^3 = 125 million operations. Which should be manageable in Python with some optimizations.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute dp[n][k], for all n from 1 to 500, and for all k up to max_inversion_count for that n.\n\nBut since for each n, the maximum inversion count is m = n*(n-1)/2, we can represent the dp as a list of lists, where dp[n] is a list of size m+1.\n\nBut for space efficiency, since for each n, we only need the previous dp_prev array, we can use two 1D arrays: prev_dp and curr_dp. For each n, compute curr_dp based on prev_dp.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize prev_dp as [1] (for n=1, k=0).\n\nFor n from 2 to 500:\n\n   max_prev_k = (n-1)*(n-2)//2\n\n   max_curr_k = n*(n-1)//2\n\n   curr_dp is initialized as a list of zeros of size max_curr_k + 1.\n\n   compute the prefix sums of prev_dp.\n\n   for each k in 0 to max_curr_k:\n\n       lower = max(0, k - (n-1))\n\n       upper = k\n\n       if lower == 0:\n\n           sum_val = pre_sum[upper]\n\n       else:\n\n           sum_val = pre_sum[upper] - pre_sum[lower - 1]\n\n       curr_dp[k] = sum_val\n\n   prev_dp = curr_dp.copy()\n\nOnce this is done, after processing n=500, prev_dp contains the counts of inversions for permutations of size 500. Then, sum_c_k_squared is sum( x*x for x in prev_dp )\n\nOnce we have sum_c_k_squared, then same_pairs = (sum_c_k_squared - fact) // 2, where fact = n! (since sum c_k = n! )\n\nThen, total_pairs = (fact * (fact - 1 )) // 2 \n\nans = (total_pairs - same_pairs ) // 2 \n\nBut wait, ans is (total_pairs - same_pairs) // 2 ?\n\nYes, because:\n\ntotal_pairs is the number of unordered pairs of permutations. same_pairs is the number of unordered pairs with same inversion count. Then (total_pairs - same_pairs) is the number of unordered pairs with different inversion counts. Each of those contributes exactly once to either inv_p > inv_q or inv_p < inv_q. So the number of unordered pairs with inv_p > inv_q is (total_pairs - same_pairs) // 2.\n\nBut how to compute fact (n!)? For n up to 500, we can compute it with a loop.\n\nNow, the problem is that for n=500, the numbers involved in prev_dp can be extremely large. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so this shouldn't be a problem. However, the sum_c_k_squared could be up to (n! )^2, which for n=500 is a gigantic number, but Python can handle it.\n\nBut for the problem, we need to compute the answer modulo mod. However, the formula involves divisions by 2, which may not be straightforward. Let me think about the steps again.\n\nThe answer is:\n\nans = (total_pairs - same_pairs) // 2 \n\nBut total_pairs is (fact * (fact -1 )) // 2 \n\nsame_pairs is (sum_c_k_squared - fact ) // 2 \n\nSo substituting:\n\nans = [ ( (fact * (fact -1 )) // 2 ) - ( (sum_c_k_squared - fact ) // 2 ) ] // 2 \n\nBut this can be simplified:\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\ntotal_pairs - same_pairs = [ fact*(fact-1)/2 ] - [ (sum_c_k_squared - fact ) / 2 ] \n\n= [ fact(fact-1) - sum_c_k_squared + fact ] / 2 \n\n= [ fact(fact -1 + 1 ) - sum_c_k_squared ] / 2 \n\n= [ fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared ] / 2 \n\nThen ans = [ (fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared ) / 2 ] / 2 \n\n= (fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared ) / 4 \n\nSo ans = (fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared ) // 4 \n\nWait, this is a much simpler formula!\n\nSo the answer can be computed as (fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared) divided by 4.\n\nBut why? Let me recheck:\n\noriginal ans was (total_pairs - same_pairs) // 2 \n\ntotal_pairs is C(fact, 2) = fact*(fact - 1)/2 \n\nsame_pairs is (sum_c_k_squared - fact ) / 2 \n\nso total_pairs - same_pairs = [ fact*(fact-1)/2 ] - [ (sum_c_k_squared - fact)/2 ] \n\n= [ fact(fact-1) - sum_c_k_squared + fact ] / 2 \n\n= [ fact^2 - fact + fact - sum_c_k_squared ] / 2 \n\n= [ fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared ] / 2 \n\nthen divide by 2 again:\n\nans = [ fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared ] / 4 \n\nSo the answer is (fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared) divided by 4.\n\nThis is a crucial simplification. Therefore, the problem reduces to computing sum_c_k_squared, then compute (fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared) // 4 modulo mod.\n\nThis is a significant simplification. Now, the problem becomes:\n\nCompute sum_c_k_squared = sum (dp[n][k]^2 for all k)\n\nCompute fact = n!\n\nCompute numerator = (fact * fact - sum_c_k_squared )\n\nans = numerator // 4 \n\nBut since mod can be arbitrary, and division by 4 is required, we need to ensure that numerator is divisible by 4. Is that always the case?\n\nWell, let's think. For the original problem, the answer must be an integer. Because the answer is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv_p > inv_q. So the formula (fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared) must be divisible by 4.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause:\n\nfact^2 is (n! )^2 \n\nsum_c_k_squared is the sum of squares of the counts of inversion counts.\n\nBut according to the previous reasoning, the answer is (fact^2 - sum_c_k_squared) / 4.\n\nBut how to ensure that this is an integer?\n\nWell, since the original problem requires that the answer is an integer, and the formula comes from the derivation, it must be correct. So we can proceed under the assumption that this division is exact.\n\nBut how to compute this modulo mod?\n\nBut since mod may not be a prime, we can't compute modular inverses. However, the formula is (A - B) / 4 mod mod, where A is fact^2 and B is sum_c_k_squared.\n\nBut how to compute this division by 4 modulo mod?\n\nWe need to compute (A - B) divided by 4, and then take modulo mod. However, since division in modular arithmetic requires that 4 and mod are coprime, but mod can be arbitrary, including even numbers. So we need to find a way to compute this.\n\nBut since (A - B) must be divisible by 4, we can compute (A - B) as a number, then divide by 4, and then take mod mod.\n\nBut for very large numbers, even in Python, this could be problematic. However, since Python handles big integers, we can compute (A - B) as a Python integer, then divide by 4, and then take modulo mod.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute fact = n! \n\nCompute sum_c_k_squared = sum( (dp[n][k])^2 for all k )\n\nCompute numerator = fact * fact - sum_c_k_squared \n\nans = numerator // 4 \n\nreturn ans mod mod \n\nThus, the problem is now reduced to:\n\nImplementing the DP to compute dp[n][k] for n=500, then compute sum_c_k_squared, and then compute the formula.\n\nNow, the next challenge is to implement the DP efficiently in Python, considering the size of the data.\n\nLet's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, compute the factorial of n. That's straightforward.\n\nThen, compute the dp tables.\n\nBut for the DP part, we can use two arrays: previous and current. For each n, the previous array holds the counts for permutations of size n-1, and the current array is built for permutations of size n.\n\nBut for each n, the maximum inversion count is m = n*(n-1)//2. For example, for n=500, m is 500*499//2 = 124750.\n\nSo for each n from 1 to 500, we need to build the dp array.\n\nBut for n=1, the max inversion count is 0. For n=2, it's 1, etc.\n\nLet me outline the code steps:\n\nInitialize prev_dp as [1] (for n=1, inversion count 0).\n\nFor n from 2 to N (where N is input n):\n\n   max_prev_k = (n-1)*(n-2)//2 \n\n   max_curr_k = n*(",
