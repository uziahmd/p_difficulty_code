Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. Each takes turns, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the total sum of their numbers S1 and S2. We need to find the sequence of H and M moves that gives this maximum total.\n\nHmm. So the input is a number A with 2n digits, and we have to output a string of 2n characters, H and M, such that each has exactly n moves. The key is to choose which player takes which digit at each step to maximize the sum.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of possible sequences is C(2n, n), which for n=18 is 2n choose n = 2*18 choose 18 = 167960, which is manageable? Wait, 18*2=36 digits. So 36 choose 18 is around 9e10. That's way too big for brute force. So we need a dynamic programming approach here.\n\nWait, but n is up to 18, and 2n is 36. So for a DP approach, what's the state? Let's think: At any point, the number of digits taken by Homer and Marge so far. For example, after k steps, Homer has taken h steps and Marge has taken m steps, with h + m = k. But since each must take exactly n steps, the state could be (h, m) where h is the number of steps Homer has taken, and m is the number of steps Marge has taken. The total steps is h + m. At each step, the next player can be either Homer or Marge, depending on which one hasn't taken their n steps yet.\n\nBut how do we track the current state? The state would be (h, m), and the current position in the string A. Wait, because the digits are being taken from the left. So, for example, if we have taken k digits already, then the next digit is at position k of the original string. So the state can be represented by how many digits have been taken so far. Let me think: the original A is a string of length 2n. At any moment, the next digit to take is the (current_length)th digit. For example, if we have taken k digits, the next is the (k)th index (assuming zero-based or one-based? Well, the initial A is given as a string, so for example, if we have taken 0 digits, the first digit is A[0]. Then, after taking one digit, the next is A[1], etc.)\n\nSo the state can be represented by the number of digits taken so far (let's say k). Then, the number of H and M steps taken so far can be determined. Because, since each step is either H or M, the total steps taken is k. Let's say that Homer has taken h steps and Marge has taken m steps. Then h + m = k. Also, since each must take exactly n steps, h can be from 0 to n, and m can be from 0 to n. However, for the state, since h + m = k, we can represent the state as (h, m) or (k, h), since m = k - h. Alternatively, since h can be up to n, and m can be up to n, but h + m = k. So for each state, the number of digits taken is k = h + m. And since the next digit is at position k, the state can be represented by (h, m) or equivalently (h, k). But perhaps it's easier to track h and m, since the number of steps each has taken.\n\nThe problem is to find the sequence of choices (H or M) that leads to maximum total sum. The DP approach would be to memoize the maximum sum possible from a given state (h, m), considering the remaining digits. But how do we compute the sum? Well, each time a player takes a digit, that digit contributes to their own number. But since the sum is the total of S1 and S2, each digit taken by Homer contributes to S1, and each digit taken by Marge contributes to S2. But the actual value of S1 and S2 depends on the order of digits. For example, if Homer takes digits d1, d2, ..., dn, then S1 is the number formed by d1 followed by d2, etc. So the value is d1 * 10^{n-1} + d2 * 10^{n-2} + ... + dn * 10^0. Similarly for Marge",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a given number A, with each player taking exactly n turns. The challenge is to choose the order of moves (Homer or Marge) that results in the highest possible sum of their respective numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach where we track the state based on the number of moves each player has made so far. The state is represented by `(h, m)`, where `h` is the number of moves Homer has made and `m` is the number of moves Marge has made.\n2. **Recursive State Evaluation**: For each state `(h, m)`, we evaluate the maximum possible total prize money by considering both possible moves (Homer or Marge) and recursively solving for the resulting states.\n3. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we memoize the results of subproblems using a dictionary.\n4. **Greedy Choice**: At each step, we choose the move (Homer or Marge) that leads to the higher total prize money, considering the current digit and the remaining digits.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    length = 2 * n\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == length:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        # current position is h + m\n        pos = h + m\n        digit = int(A[pos])\n        # options: next is H or M\n        # but need to check if possible\n        max_total = -1\n        best_move = ''\n        if h < n:\n            # Homer takes the digit\n            new_h = h + 1\n            total, rest = dp(new_h, m)\n            total += digit * (10 ** (n - new_h))\n            if total > max_total:\n                max_total = total\n                best_move = 'H' + rest\n        if m < n:\n            # Marge takes the digit\n            new_m = m + 1\n            total, rest = dp(h, new_m)\n            total += digit * (10 ** (n - new_m))\n            if total > max_total:\n                max_total = total\n                best_move = 'M' + rest\n        return (max_total, best_move)\n\n    _, result = dp(0, 0)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of moves `n` and the string `A`.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function uses memoization to store results of subproblems. It takes the current counts of moves made by Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`) and returns the maximum total prize money and the corresponding sequence of moves.\n3. **State Evaluation**: For each state `(h, m)`, the function checks the possible moves (Homer or Marge) and calculates the resulting total prize money by considering the contribution of the current digit to either Homer's or Marge's number.\n4. **Recursive Calculation**: The function recursively evaluates the next states and chooses the move that maximizes the total prize money, ensuring each player makes exactly `n` moves.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible sequences of moves while leveraging memoization to avoid redundant calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of `n = 18`.",
