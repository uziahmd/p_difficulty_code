При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s due to an error. The merging happens by overlapping the end of the first s with the start of the second s. The overlap must be a positive number of characters, but less than the length of s. Also, the case where the two messages are completely overlapping (so t is exactly s) or just concatenated without overlapping (like s + s) are not considered errors. So, for example, if t is \"abcd\", it's considered as no error. Similarly, \"abcabc\" is considered as no error because it's just two s's concatenated without overlapping.\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if there exists some string s such that t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s with some positive overlap (but not full overlap or zero). If yes, output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key is to find a possible s such that when two copies of s are merged with some overlap, we get t. Let's think about the structure of t.\n\nLet me think about the possible lengths of s. Let's denote len(t) as n. Since the original two messages are merged with some overlap, the length of t would be 2*len(s) - k, where k is the overlap length. And since k is between 1 and len(s)-1, inclusive.\n\nSo for t's length n, we have:\n\nn = 2L - k, where L is len(s), and 1 ≤ k ≤ L-1.\n\nBut since k can be any value in that range, we can rearrange:\n\nn = 2L - k → k = 2L - n.\n\nBut since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - n ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities for L.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L -n ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ n+1 → L ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L -n ≤ L-1 → 2L -n ≤ L-1 → L ≤ n-1.\n\nSo combining these two, L must be between ceil((n+1)/2) and n-1, inclusive.\n\nWait, but L is the length of s. Also, since the original two s's are merged with overlap k, which is positive and less than L. So the possible values for L must satisfy that 2L -n is between 1 and L-1.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible L (possible length of s), we can check if there exists a k such that 2L -n equals k, and 1 ≤ k ≤ L-1.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let me think: For each possible L (length of s), the possible k is 2L -n. And this k must be between 1 and L-1. So:\n\nFor a given n (the length of t), possible L's are those for which 2L -n is between 1 and L-1. Let's substitute:\n\n1 ≤ 2L -n ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me solve for L:\n\nFirst part: 2L -n ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ n + 1 → L ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond part: 2L -n ≤ L-1 → 2L -n ≤ L-1 → subtract L from both sides: L -n ≤ -1 → L ≤ n-1.\n\nSo L must be in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1]. Since L must be an integer, the possible L's are integers from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1.\n\nFor example, if n is 6, then (n+1)/2 is 3.5 → ceil is 4. So L ranges from 4 to 5 (since n-1 is 5). For each L in this range, check if 2L -n is between 1 and L-1.\n\nWait, but for each L in that range, 2L -n is k. Let's check for L=4, n=6: k = 8 -6 = 2. Then 1 ≤ 2 ≤ 3 (since L-1 is 3). So yes. For L=5, k=10-6=4. L-1 is 4. So 4 is allowed. So yes.\n\nSo for each L in that range, we can compute k=2L -n. Then, check whether k is between 1 and L-1. Which it should be, given that L is in that range. Because for L in [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1], then 2L -n is between 1 and L-1.\n\nSo, the possible L's are all integers in [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1].\n\nNow, for each possible L in this range, we need to check if there exists a string s of length L such that when you merge two copies of s with an overlap of k=2L -n, you get t.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nThe merging process is: take the first s, and the second s, and overlap them by k characters. So the merged string would be s[0..L-k-1] + s[k..L-1] + s[L-k..L-1] ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Suppose the first s is s1 and the second is s2. The overlapping is done by matching the last k characters of s1 with the first k characters of s2. So the merged string would be s1 concatenated with s2, but overlapping the last k of s1 with the first k of s2. So the total length is L + L -k = 2L -k.\n\nWhich equals n, the length of t.\n\nSo, for the merged string t to be formed by two s's overlapping by k characters, the following must hold:\n\nThe first L -k characters of t must be equal to the first L -k characters of s (since the first s contributes up to L -k characters, and the next k characters are overlapped with the second s's first k characters).\n\nThen, the next part of t (from position L -k onwards) must be equal to the entire s. Because after overlapping, the second s's part is added.\n\nWait, perhaps another way: the merged string is s + s[k:], but with the overlapping part. Wait, no. Let me think of the merged string as:\n\ns1 (length L) and s2 (length L). Overlap of k characters. So the merged string is s1[0 ... L -k -1] + s2[0 ... L -1]. But since the last k characters of s1 must equal the first k of s2. So the merged string is s1[:L -k] + s2. But since s2 is s, then the merged string would be s[:L -k] + s. But the length of this is (L -k) + L = 2L -k = n. So the entire t must be equal to s[:L -k] + s.\n\nBut also, since the overlapping part requires that s[-k:] == s[:k], because the end of s1 (the first s) overlaps with the beginning of s2 (the second s).\n\nTherefore, for a given L, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute k = 2L - n. Check that 1 ≤ k ≤ L-1.\n\n   Well, since L is in the range that ensures this, but perhaps in code, we can check.\n\n2. Check if the first L -k characters of t plus the entire s (which is the first L characters of t?) Wait, no. How can we find s?\n\nWait, the merged string t is s[:L -k] + s. So the entire t must be equal to s[:L -k] + s. Therefore, the length of t is (L -k) + L = 2L -k = n. Which matches.\n\nBut since s is of length L, then the first L -k characters of t is s's prefix, and the rest of the t (from position L -k onwards) is s. So the entire t must be equal to s[:L -k] + s.\n\nBut since the part from position L -k onwards is s, then the entire s is equal to t[L -k : ].\n\nSo for example, if we take s_candidate = t[L -k : ].\n\nBut then we need to check that the first L -k characters of t are equal to the first L -k characters of s_candidate. Because s_candidate is s. So the first L -k characters of t must be equal to s_candidate[:L -k], which is s[:L -k].\n\nBut since s_candidate is s, then the first L -k characters of t must be equal to the first L -k characters of s_candidate. Which is the same as the first L -k characters of t being equal to the first L -k characters of s_candidate. But since s_candidate is t[L -k : ], which is of length L.\n\nSo for example, the s_candidate is t[L -k : ].\n\nBut then, the first L -k characters of t must be equal to the first L -k characters of s_candidate. Which is the same as checking that t[0 : L -k] == s_candidate[0 : L -k]. But s_candidate is of length L, so s_candidate[0 : L -k] is the first L -k characters of s_candidate.\n\nBut since s_candidate is s, then the first L -k characters of s_candidate is s[:L -k], and the first L -k characters of t is supposed to be s[:L -k], so the check is t[0 : L -k] == s_candidate[0 : L -k]. But since s_candidate is s, which is supposed to be the original message, then this would imply that the first part of t matches the first part of s_candidate.\n\nBut how do I check that?\n\nAlternatively, since the merged string is s[:L -k] + s, then the entire t must be equal to that. So, the first L -k characters of t must be equal to the first L -k characters of s, and the rest of t must be equal to s. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to s[:L -k] + s. But since s is of length L, then the part after the first L -k characters is s. Therefore, the entire t must be s[:L -k] + s. So the entire t is s[:L -k] + s. Which implies that s is the substring of t starting at position L -k, and of length L. So s_candidate = t[L -k : L -k + L] = t[L -k : ] (since L -k + L = 2L -k = n, which is the length of t). So s_candidate is t[L -k : ].\n\nOnce we have this candidate s_candidate, we can check if the first part of t (the first L -k characters) equals the first L -k characters of s_candidate. Because s_candidate is s, and the first L -k characters of t is supposed to be s[:L -k].\n\nSo the check is:\n\nt[0 : L -k] == s_candidate[0 : L -k]\n\nBut since s_candidate is of length L, and L -k is equal to (L - (2L -n)) = n - L.\n\nWait, because k = 2L -n. So L -k = L - (2L -n) = n - L.\n\nSo for example, the length of the first part is n - L.\n\nSo for each possible L in the range, we can compute k = 2L -n. Then, check that the first part of t (n-L characters) is equal to the first n-L characters of s_candidate (which is t[L -k : ]). Then, also check that the overlapping part is correct, i.e., that the last k characters of s_candidate (which is s) match the first k characters of s_candidate (since the overlapping part is the end of the first s and the start of the second s).\n\nWait, because the overlapping part requires that the last k characters of the first s (which is s_candidate) is equal to the first k characters of the second s (also s_candidate). So the check is that s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k].\n\nSo putting it all together, for each possible L in the valid range:\n\nCompute k = 2L -n.\n\nCheck that k is between 1 and L-1 (but according to earlier logic, since L is in the valid range, this should be true).\n\nThen:\n\ns_candidate = t[ (L -k) : ] → since L -k = n - L.\n\nBecause L -k = L - (2L -n) = n - L.\n\nSo the starting index is n - L. The length of s_candidate is L, so the substring is from n - L to n - L + L = n, which is the end of the string.\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, check:\n\n1. The first part of t (t[0 : n-L]) equals the first part of s_candidate (s_candidate[0 : n-L]).\n\n   Because the first part of t is s[:n-L], and the s_candidate is s, so the first n-L characters of t should be the same as the first n-L of s_candidate.\n\n2. The overlapping part: the last k characters of s_candidate (which is s) must equal the first k characters of s_candidate (since the overlapping is between the end of the first s and the start of the second s).\n\nIf both conditions are met, then this s_candidate is a valid s.\n\nSo, the steps for the code would be:\n\nFor the input string t:\n\n- Compute n = len(t)\n\n- Iterate over possible L values from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1, inclusive.\n\n   For each L in that range:\n\n      k = 2L -n\n\n      if k is not between 1 and L-1, skip (though according to previous logic, this shouldn't happen)\n\n      compute start = n - L\n\n      s_candidate = t[start : start + L] → which is t[start:] since start + L = n - L + L = n.\n\n      check if the first part of t (t[0 : start]) equals s_candidate[0 : start], because start = n - L, and the length of the first part is start.\n\n      Also check if s_candidate ends with the same k characters as it starts with (i.e., s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k])\n\n      if both checks pass, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the L's work, return NO.\n\nBut wait, why do we need to check both conditions? Let me think:\n\nThe first condition ensures that the first part of t (before the overlapping) matches the s_candidate's first part. The second condition ensures that the overlapping part is correct.\n\nBut since the merged string is s_candidate[:start] + s_candidate, and start = n-L, which is L -k. Because:\n\nstart = n-L = L -k → since k = 2L -n → n = 2L -k → n - L = L -k → yes.\n\nSo the merged string would be s_candidate[:start] + s_candidate. Which is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Which is supposed to be the merged string. But since the merged string is t, then t must be equal to this. So the first part of t (t[0: start]) must be equal to s_candidate[:start], and the rest of t (from start onwards) must be equal to s_candidate. Which is already ensured by s_candidate being t[start:].\n\nSo, the first check is that t[0:start] == s_candidate[0:start]. But since s_candidate is t[start:], the s_candidate[0:start] is the first start characters of t[start:]. But wait, the s_candidate is of length L. So the start is n - L. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (from the first sample input). Let's say n is 19. Let me see what possible L's are.\n\nFor example, the correct answer is s = 'abrakadabra', which has length 11. Let's check if this L=11 is in the valid range.\n\nn is 19. The valid L's are from ceil( (19+1)/2 ) = 10 to 18.\n\nSo 10 <= L <= 18. L=11 is in that range.\n\nk = 2*11 -19 = 22-19=3. Which is between 1 and 10 (L-1=10). So yes.\n\nstart = n - L = 19 -11 = 8.\n\ns_candidate is t[8: ] → which is 'abrakadabra' (assuming the original t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → which is the first sample input. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → length is 19? Let's count:\n\nabrakadabra is 11 letters. Then the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → which is 11 + 11 - 1 = 21? Wait maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1 is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is the merged string. The correct s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). The merged string is formed by overlapping 1 character (k=1?), but according to the example explanation, in the first case, the overlap was 1 character. But according to the calculation for L=11, k=2*11 -n. Let me compute n for the first sample input.\n\nThe first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'. Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nOriginal s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). Merged with overlap of 1 character. So the merged string is 11 + 11 -1 = 21 letters. So n is 21. So for L=11, k=2*11 -21 = 22-21=1, which is correct. Then start = n - L = 21 -11 = 10. So s_candidate is t[10:], which is from index 10 onwards. Let's see: the original t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nAssuming the first s is 'abrakadabra' (indices 0-10), then the second s is overlapped by 1 character. So the merged string is 'abrakadabra' (first s) + 'brakadabra' (second s's part after overlapping). So the merged string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 21). So t[10:] would be 'abrakadabra' (the second s). So s_candidate is correct. Then the first part of t (t[0:10]) is 'abrakadabr' (the first 10 characters). The s_candidate is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). So s_candidate[0:10] is 'abrakadabr', which matches t[0:10]. Then the overlapping check: s_candidate[-k:] is the last 1 character of s_candidate, which is 'a', and the first k=1 character is 'a'. So they match. Thus, this would pass.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nAnother example: sample input 2 is 'acacacaca' which outputs 'acaca'. Let's see.\n\nn is 9. Possible L's are ceil( (9+1)/2 ) = 5 to 8.\n\nSo L can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nLet's try L=5. Then k = 2*5 -9 = 1. Which is between 1 and 4.\n\nstart = 9-5 =4. s_candidate is t[4:] → which is 'caca' (no, wait t is 'acacacaca' (length 9). Let's index:\n\nIndices 0-8.\n\nt[4:] is positions 4 to 8: 'cacaca'? Wait, let me write the string:\n\nOriginal string: a c a c a c a c a → indexes 0-8.\n\nFor L=5, start = 9-5=4. t[4:] is from index 4 (a) to end: 'acaca' (positions 4,5,6,7,8: a, c, a, c, a → 'acaca').\n\ns_candidate is 'acaca' (length 5). Now check:\n\nt[0:start] is t[0:4], which is 'acac'.\n\ns_candidate[0:4] is 'acac' → matches.\n\nThen check if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]. k=1. s_candidate[-1:] is 'a', and s_candidate[:1] is 'a' → matches. So yes. Therefore, this is a valid s_candidate. So the answer is YES and 'acaca'.\n\nWhich matches the sample. So this approach works.\n\nAnother sample is 'abcabc' → output is NO. Let's see.\n\nn is 6. Possible L is ceil( (6+1)/2 ) = 4 (since (6+1)/2 is 3.5, ceil is 4). So L ranges from 4 to 5.\n\nFor L=4: k=2*4 -6 = 2. Check if 1<=2<=3 → yes.\n\nstart = 6-4=2. s_candidate is t[2:] → 'cabc' (assuming t is 'abcabc').\n\nCheck t[0:2] is 'ab' and s_candidate[0:2] is 'ca' → not equal. So invalid.\n\nNext, L=5. k=2*5-6=4. Check if 1<=4 <=4 (since L-1=4). Yes.\n\nstart = 6-5=1. s_candidate is t[1:] → 'bcabc' (length 5). Check t[0:1] is 'a' and s_candidate[0:1] is 'b' → not equal. So invalid. Thus, no solution. So output is NO, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample is 'abababab' → output is 'ababab'.\n\nn is 8. Possible L ranges from ceil( (8+1)/2 ) = 5 (since 9/2=4.5) to 7.\n\nCheck L=5,6,7.\n\nLet's try L=6. Then k=2*6 -8 = 4. Check 1<=4 <=5 → yes.\n\nstart = 8-6=2. s_candidate is t[2:] → 'ababab' (length 6). Check t[0:2] is 'ab' and s_candidate[0:2] is 'ab' → matches. Then check s_candidate[-4:] == s_candidate[:4]. s_candidate is 'ababab'.\n\ns_candidate[-4:] is 'baba' (positions 2-5?), wait:\n\nWait, s_candidate is 'ababab' (positions 0-5). The last 4 characters are positions 2-5: 'abab'? Or wait, for length 6, the last 4 characters are positions 2 to 5 (inclusive), which is 'abab'? Let me see:\n\ns_candidate is a b a b a b.\n\ns_candidate[-4:] is the last four characters: positions 2,3,4,5 → 'a b a b' → 'abab'.\n\ns_candidate[:4] is 'abab' → same. So yes. So this passes. So the s_candidate is 'ababab', which is the correct answer. So output is YES and 'ababab'.\n\nSo the algorithm works here.\n\nSo now, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nCompute n = len(t).\n\nLoop L from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1 inclusive.\n\nFor each L:\n\n   k = 2L - n.\n\n   if k <1 or k >= L → skip? But according to earlier logic, since L is in the valid range, this shouldn't happen. But perhaps better to check.\n\n   start = n - L.\n\n   if start <0 → invalid? Because start is n-L. Since L ranges up to n-1, n-L is >= 1. For example, L =n-1 → start = n - (n-1) =1. So start is always positive.\n\n   s_candidate = t[start : start + L] → t[start:] since start + L = n - L + L = n.\n\n   check if len(s_candidate) is L. Well, since start is n-L, and t is length n, then t[start:] is length L.\n\n   check if t[0:start] == s_candidate[0:start]. Because s_candidate is supposed to be s, and the first part of t is s[:start].\n\n   check if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k].\n\n   if both conditions are true → return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf after checking all L's, nothing found → return NO.\n\nNow, how to compute ceil((n+1)/2) in Python?\n\nIn Python, for integer division, we can compute it as (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example, if n is even:\n\nn=6 → (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4. (n+1 +1) // 2 → (6+1+1)/2 = 8/2=4 → correct.\n\nWait, (n+1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for n=6 → (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → floor is 3. Ceil is 4. So to compute ceil((n+1)/2), perhaps (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think:\n\nLet me compute ceil((n+1)/2) for different values.\n\nn is even: say n=6. (n+1)/2 = 7/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4.\n\nn is odd: say n=7 → (7+1)/2 = 4 → ceil is 4.\n\nSo for general, ceil((n+1)/2) can be written as (n + 2) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for n=6: (6 + 2) // 2 = 8//2=4 → correct.\n\nn=7: (7+2)//2 = 9//2=4.5 → 4 in integer division. Which is correct.\n\nYes, because (n+1)/2 is equal to (n+1 +1)/2 when n is even? Not sure. Alternatively, ceil(a/b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo for (n+1)/2, the ceil is ((n+1) + 2-1) // 2 → (n+1 +1) // 2 → (n+2) // 2.\n\nYes. So for example, for n=6: (6+2)//2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo the starting L is (n+2)//2.\n\nSo the loop is for L in range( (n+2)//2 , n ):\n\nWait, since L can be up to n-1. So the range is from (n+2)//2 to n-1 inclusive.\n\nBut in Python, the range is exclusive on the upper bound. So for example, range(a, b) includes a, a+1,..., b-1. So to include up to n-1, the upper bound is n.\n\nSo code:\n\nfor L in range( (n+2)//2, n ):\n\n   process L.\n\nBut let's test for n=6:\n\n(n+2)//2 is (6+2)//2 = 4. So L ranges from 4 to 5 (since upper bound is n=6, so range(4,6) gives 4,5 → correct.\n\nAnother example: n=8 → (8+2)//2 = 5. So L runs from 5 to 7 (since upper bound is 8, so range(5,8) is 5,6,7 → correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (n+2)//2, n ):\n\n   process L.\n\nNow, for each L in this range, compute k = 2*L -n.\n\nCheck if 1 <=k <= L-1. Because for example, if n=5, L=3, then k=6-5=1. Which is okay. But perhaps in some cases, due to integer division, maybe not. But according to the earlier analysis, since L is in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], then k is between 1 and L-1. However, perhaps due to integer division, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nTake n=5, L=3. (n+2)//2 is (5+2)//2= 3.5 → 3.5 floored to 3? Wait, no, in Python, (n+2)//2 when n=5 is (5+2)//2=7//2=3. So L starts at 3. For L=3, k= 2*3 -5 =1. Which is between 1 and 2 (L-1=2). So okay.\n\nAnother example: n=4. (n+2)//2 = (4+2)//2=3. So L starts at 3. n-1 is 3. So L is 3. k=2*3-4=2. L-1 is 2. So k=2 is allowed. So yes.\n\nAnother example: n=3. (n+2)//2 = (3+2)//2=5//2=2. So L starts at 2. n-1 is 2. So L=2. k=2*2-3=1. Which is between 1 and 1 (since L-1=1). So yes.\n\nThus, for all L in this range, k is between 1 and L-1. So we can proceed without checking.\n\nThus, code:\n\nOnce we have L, compute k = 2*L -n.\n\nThen compute start = n - L.\n\ns_candidate = t[start:]\n\nthen check:\n\nif t[:start] == s_candidate[:start] and s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k].\n\nIf yes, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where t is of length 2. For example, t is \"aa\". Then n=2. Possible L is (2+2)//2=2. But the upper bound is n=2, so range(2,2) is empty. So no possible L. So output NO.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the error is when two messages are merged with positive overlap. For t=\"aa\", possible s is \"a\" (length 1). Then merging two \"a\" with overlap 1 (which is allowed? Wait, the overlap must be less than the length of s. s has length 1. So overlap must be between 1 and 0 (since L-1=0). Which is impossible. So no. Thus, for t=\"aa\", output is NO.\n\nAnother edge case: t is \"aaa\". n=3. Possible L is (3+2)//2=5//2=2. So L ranges from 2 to 2 (since upper bound is n=3).\n\nFor L=2, k=2*2-3=1. Which is between 1 and 1 (L-1=1). So okay.\n\nstart = 3-2=1. s_candidate is t[1:] → \"aa\".\n\nCheck t[:start] is t[:1] → \"a\". s_candidate[:1] is \"a\" → matches.\n\nCheck s_candidate[-1:] == s_candidate[:1]. s_candidate is \"aa\". s_candidate[-1:] is \"a\", and s_candidate[:1] is \"a\". So yes. Thus, return YES and \"aa\".\n\nSo for input \"aaa\", output is YES and \"aa\".\n\nBut what is the actual scenario? The original two messages are \"aa\" each. Merging with overlap of 1. The merged string would be \"a\" + \"aa\" → \"aaa\". Which is correct. So this is a valid case.\n\nAnother example: t is \"aaaa\" (n=4). Possible L is (4+2)//2=3. So L=3, and n-1=3. So L=3.\n\nk=2*3 -4=2. Check 1<=2 <=2 (L-1=2). Yes.\n\nstart =4-3=1. s_candidate is t[1:] → \"aaa\".\n\nCheck t[:1] is \"a\", and s_candidate[:1] is \"a\" → okay.\n\nCheck s_candidate[-2:] == s_candidate[:2]. s_candidate is \"aaa\". s_candidate[-2:] is \"aa\", and s_candidate[:2] is \"aa\" → yes. So output YES and \"aaa\".\n\nSo for input \"aaaa\", output is YES and \"aaa\".\n\nAnother case: t is \"ababab\" (n=6). Let's see.\n\nPossible L ranges from (6+2)//2=4 to 5.\n\nCheck L=4:\n\nk= 2*4 -6= 2. Check 1<=2 <=3 → yes.\n\nstart=6-4=2. s_candidate is t[2:] → 'abab'.\n\nCheck t[:2] is 'ab' and s_candidate[:2] is 'ab' → okay.\n\nCheck s_candidate[-2:] (last 2 chars) is 'ab' and s_candidate[:2] is 'ab' → yes. So valid. So output YES and 'abab'.\n\nSo the code would return YES.\n\nBut what is the actual scenario? The original s is 'abab', two copies merged with overlap 2. The first s is abab, the second is abab. Overlapping the last 2 chars (ab) with the first 2 chars (ab). So merged string is ab + abab → ababab → which is t. So correct.\n\nSo code works here.\n\nNow, code implementation:\n\nRead t from input.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n   k = 2 * L - n\n\n   start = n - L\n\n   s_candidate = t[start:]\n\n   # check if t[:start] == s_candidate[:start]\n\n   if t[:start] != s_candidate[:start]:\n\n       continue\n\n   # check if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]\n\n   if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n       print(\"YES\")\n\n       print(s_candidate)\n\n       exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, for strings, slicing beyond the length is handled. For example, if start is 0, then t[:start] is empty string. Also, for s_candidate[-k:], if k is 0, but in our case k is at least 1.\n\nBut in our code, k is >=1.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → output 'acaca'.\n\nn=9. (9+2)//2 = 11//2=5. So L runs from 5 to 8.\n\nFor L=5:\n\nk= 2*5 -9=1. start =9-5=4. s_candidate is t[4:] → 'acaca'.\n\nt[:4] is 'acac' (original t is 'acacacaca' → indexes 0-8. t[:4] is 'acac'.\n\ns_candidate[:4] is 'acac' → same. Then check s_candidate[-1:] (last 1 char) is 'a', and s_candidate[:1] is 'a' → yes. So returns YES.\n\nSample Input 3: 'abcabc' → output NO. As discussed earlier.\n\nSample Input 4: 'abababab' → output 'ababab'.\n\nn=8. (8+2)//2=5. So L runs from 5 to 7.\n\nFor L=6:\n\nk= 2*6 -8 =4. start=8-6=2. s_candidate is t[2:] → 'ababab'.\n\nt[:2] is 'ab' and s_candidate[:2] is 'ab' → ok.\n\ns_candidate[-4:] is 'abab' (since s_candidate is 'ababab' → last 4 chars are 'abab'), and s_candidate[:4] is 'abab' → yes. So returns YES.\n\nSample Input 5: 'tatbt' → output NO.\n\nn=5. (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → 3. So L runs from 3 to 4.\n\nFor L=3:\n\nk=2*3 -5=1. start=5-3=2. s_candidate is t[2:] → 'tbt'.\n\nCheck t[:",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` due to an error where the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second message. The overlap must be a positive number of characters but less than the length of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Overlap Constraints**: For a string `t` of length `n`, the possible length `L` of the original message `s` must be such that `L` is between `(n + 1) / 2` and `n - 1`. This ensures that the overlap `k` (calculated as `2L - n`) is a positive integer less than `L`.\n2. **Check Valid Overlaps**: For each valid length `L`, compute the overlap `k` and check if the string `t` can be split into two parts such that the first part matches the prefix of the candidate string `s` and the overlap part matches correctly.\n3. **Validate Candidate String**: For each candidate string derived from `t`, verify if it meets the overlap conditions and if the prefix of `t` matches the prefix of the candidate string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\nfound = False\n\nfor L in range((n + 2) // 2, n):\n    k = 2 * L - n\n    start = n - L\n    s_candidate = t[start:]\n    if t[:start] != s_candidate[:start]:\n        continue\n    if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(s_candidate)\n        found = True\n        break\n\nif not found:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: The loop iterates over possible lengths `L` of the original message `s`, starting from `(n + 2) // 2` up to `n - 1`.\n3. **Calculate Overlap**: For each length `L`, calculate the overlap `k` using the formula `k = 2L - n`.\n4. **Check Validity**: For each candidate string derived from `t`, check if the prefix of `t` matches the prefix of the candidate string and if the overlap part of the candidate string matches correctly.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid candidate string is found, print \"YES\" followed by the candidate string. If no valid candidate is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths for the original message `s` and ensures that the overlap conditions are met, providing a solution that handles all edge cases within the constraints.",
