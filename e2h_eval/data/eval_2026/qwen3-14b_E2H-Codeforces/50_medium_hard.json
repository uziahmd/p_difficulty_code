    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nA good tree has edges with weights 1 or -1. And for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Oh right, so for every vertex, when you multiply all the edges connected to it, you get -1. \n\nSo, first, I need to figure out what constraints this imposes on the tree structure and the edge weights. Let's think about the product condition. For each vertex, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let's consider the degrees of the vertices. Because each edge connects two vertices, the product for each vertex depends on the edges connected to it.\n\nWait, but the product for each vertex is -1. Let me think about the product of all such products across all vertices. Each edge is counted twice here: once for each endpoint. So the product of all the vertex products would be the product of (-1) raised to the degree of each vertex. But also, each edge contributes its weight twice (once for each endpoint). So the product of all vertex products is equal to the product over all edges of (weight^2). Since weight is either 1 or -1, weight squared is 1. Therefore, the product of all vertex products is 1.\n\nBut the product of all vertex products is also (-1)^n multiplied by the product of the degrees? Wait, no. Each vertex's product is -1, so the product of all vertex products is (-1)^n. But that must equal 1. So (-1)^n = 1. Which implies that n must be even. Wait, but that's only possible if n is even. Otherwise, there are no good trees. \n\nWait, that's a crucial point. If n is odd, then the product of all vertex products would be (-1)^n = -1, which can't equal 1. Therefore, when n is odd, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer is zero in that case. \n\nSo for example, when n=2, which is even, there's a possibility. For n=1, there are no edges. But the product condition for the single vertex: the product of all edges incident to it. Since there are no edges, the product is 1? But the condition requires it to be -1. So for n=1, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer is zero. \n\nSo, the first thing to check is if n is 1 or odd. Then the answer is zero. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo for even n ≥ 2, we have to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to handling even n ≥ 2. Let's focus on that case.\n\nNext, how to model the constraints of the good trees. For each vertex, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let's think about the degrees. Suppose a vertex has degree k. Then, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. Since each edge is ±1, the product is -1. That implies that the number of -1 edges incident to the vertex must be odd. Because the product of numbers (each ±1) is -1 if and only if there's an odd number of -1s.\n\nSo for each vertex, the number of edges with weight -1 incident to it must be odd. \n\nBut since each edge connects two vertices, changing the weight of an edge affects the count for both endpoints. This seems like a system of constraints. How can we model this?\n\nLet me think about the degrees. Let me think of the tree as a graph where each edge has a weight of ±1. For each vertex, the number of edges with weight -1 adjacent to it must be odd. Let me denote for each vertex v, let x_v be the number of edges incident to v with weight -1. Then x_v must be odd for all v.\n\nBut since each edge is counted in exactly two vertices' x counts, the sum of all x_v's must be even. Because each edge contributes 1 to exactly two x_v's (if the edge has weight -1, otherwise 0). So the total sum is twice the number of edges with weight -1. Which is even. However, each x_v is odd, and there are n vertices. So the sum of x_v's is n * (some odd number). But n is even. So sum of x_v's is even, which matches. So the constraints are consistent.\n\nBut how do we model the possible trees and their edge weights?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. For each vertex, the product of the edges is -1. Let me take the logarithm? No, since we are dealing with multiplicative products, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of parity. Let me think of each edge's weight as a variable, which can be 1 or -1. For each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. Taking the product of the edges adjacent to a vertex is equivalent to multiplying all variables (edge weights) connected to it. So for each vertex v, the product of the variables (edges) adjacent to it is -1. Let me take the product over all edges adjacent to v, and set it equal to -1. \n\nBut since the variables are ±1, taking the product is equivalent to multiplying them. Let me think of this as equations. Let me denote the variables as e_1, e_2, ..., e_{n-1} (each e_i is ±1). For each vertex v, the product of e's adjacent to v is -1. How many such equations are there? For n vertices, but they are not independent. For example, the product of all equations would be the product of (-1)^n. But earlier analysis shows that this must be 1, which holds when n is even.\n\nBut how can we find the number of valid assignments of edge weights given a tree structure?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the trees are considered good if both the structure is a tree (so any tree structure) and the edge weights satisfy the product conditions. So, for each possible tree structure (i.e., each possible spanning tree on n labeled vertices), we have to count the number of valid edge weight assignments (each ±1) that satisfy the product conditions for all vertices. Then, for each such valid tree (structure + weights), compute d(1,n) and sum all those values.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 5e5, we need an efficient approach. It's impossible to iterate through all trees and all possible weights. Therefore, there must be some mathematical formula or combinatorial approach to compute the required sum.\n\nFirst, perhaps we can separate the problem into two parts:\n\n1. Determine the number of valid edge weight assignments for a given tree structure.\n2. For each such valid assignment, compute d(1, n) and find the sum over all valid trees and their valid assignments.\n\nBut even this seems challenging. However, maybe the number of valid assignments depends only on the structure of the tree. But given that the product conditions are constraints on the edges, perhaps for any tree structure, the number of valid assignments is 2^{k}, where k is some number. Let's think.\n\nFor example, in the case of n=2, the tree is just one edge between 1 and 2. The product conditions for each vertex: for vertex 1, the product of its incident edges (only the edge between 1 and 2) must be -1. Similarly for vertex 2. So the edge weight must be -1. Thus, there's exactly one valid assignment. Which matches the first sample input.\n\nAnother example: n=4. The third sample input says that for n=4, there are 16 good trees. Wait, but how does that fit with the count? Well, the total number of trees is 4^{2} = 16, and for each tree, the number of valid assignments? Let's see. For each tree, the number of valid assignments would be 2^{something}? For example, in the sample, for n=4, each good tree has some number of valid assignments. But according to the note, there are 16 good trees. Wait, but the total number of trees is 4^{2} = 16. So for each tree, there is exactly one valid assignment of weights? Or not?\n\nWait, the note says that for n=4, there are 16 good trees. But the total number of trees is 4^2=16. So each tree must have exactly one valid weight assignment. Because the total number of good trees would be (number of trees) × (number of valid assignments per tree). But according to the note, the total is 16. So for each tree, the number of valid assignments is 1. How?\n\nLet me think for a general tree. Suppose that the tree is fixed. How many valid assignments of edge weights are there?\n\nEach edge has a weight ±1. The constraints are that for each vertex, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. Let's think of this as a system of equations over GF(2), but with multiplicative variables. However, since the product is -1, which is equivalent to having an odd number of -1s for each vertex. Alternatively, if we take the logarithm, but since we're dealing with multiplicative products, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of parity.\n\nLet me take the product of the edges adjacent to each vertex. Let me take the product as -1. Let me represent each edge weight as a variable in GF(2), where 1 corresponds to 0 and -1 corresponds to 1. Then, the product being -1 is equivalent to the sum of the variables (mod 2) being 1. Because multiplying -1's gives (-1)^k, which equals -1 iff k is odd. So the sum mod 2 is 1.\n\nSo, for each vertex, the sum of the variables (edge weights represented as 0/1) adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. Now, this becomes a system of linear equations over GF(2). The variables are the edges (each edge is a variable), and the equations are for each vertex, sum of variables adjacent to it equals 1 mod 2.\n\nThe number of solutions to this system is either 0 or 2^{m}, where m is the dimension of the solution space. So, for each tree, we need to find whether this system has solutions, and if so, the number of solutions.\n\nBut for a tree, which is a connected graph with n-1 edges, and n vertices. Let's think about the system of equations. Let me denote the variables as x_e for each edge e. Each equation is sum_{e adjacent to v} x_e = 1 mod 2 for each vertex v.\n\nBut the sum of all equations: sum_{v} [sum_{e adjacent to v} x_e] = sum_v 1 mod 2.\n\nThe left side counts each x_e exactly twice (since each edge is adjacent to two vertices). So the left side is 2 * sum x_e mod 2, which is 0. The right side is n mod 2. So for the system to be solvable, n must be even. Which aligns with our previous conclusion. So when n is even, the system is solvable, and when n is odd, no solutions. Hence, for even n, the system has solutions. \n\nNow, the question is: what is the rank of this system? The system has n equations, but they are not independent. For example, the sum of all equations is zero mod 2, as discussed. So the rank is at most n-1. Let's suppose that the rank is n-1. Then, the number of solutions is 2^{(number of variables - rank)}. The number of variables is m = n-1 (edges). So the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? Wait, that would imply that for each tree, there is exactly one solution. Which would explain why for n=2, there's one solution. For n=4, each tree would have exactly one solution. Which matches the sample where for n=4, the total number of good trees is 16 (which is the number of trees, since each tree has exactly one valid assignment). \n\nSo that suggests that for each tree, the system has exactly one solution. Therefore, the number of valid edge weight assignments for a given tree is 1. Hence, the total number of good trees is equal to the number of possible trees (n^{n-2}) multiplied by 1, but only when n is even. Wait, but that's not the case for the sample input n=4. The note says that for n=4, there are 16 good trees. The number of trees is 4^{2} = 16. So yes, each tree contributes exactly one valid assignment. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that for even n ≥ 2, each tree structure has exactly one valid assignment of edge weights. Therefore, the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} (number of trees) × 1 (number of assignments per tree). \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing the sum of d(1,n) over all possible trees (with n^{n-2} trees), each with exactly one valid edge weight assignment. \n\nSo now, the task is to find the sum of d(1,n) for all trees, considering that each tree has exactly one valid edge weight assignment. \n\nBut how do we compute this sum? Let's think about what d(1,n) represents. For a given tree with edge weights assigned according to the constraints, d(1,n) is the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n. \n\nBut how can we compute the sum over all trees of this value?\n\nNote that each tree contributes exactly one value of d(1,n), which is determined by the edge weights of the tree. However, since the edge weights are uniquely determined by the tree structure (given the constraints), we need to find for each tree, what is the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n, and then sum that over all trees.\n\nBut how can we find this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For a given tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined. How? The system of equations for the tree has exactly one solution. How can we find this solution?\n\nLet me think of the equations again. For each vertex v, the sum of x_e (variables representing edges) adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. But solving this system for a tree. Let's consider that the tree is connected, and the system has exactly one solution. How can we find this solution?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to determine the edge weights based on some properties of the tree. Let me think of the tree as a graph. Let me pick a root, say node 1. For each node, assign a value (like a potential) such that the edge between parent and child has a certain weight. \n\nWait, considering that the product of the edges adjacent to each node is -1. Let's think of the tree as rooted at node 1. For each node v, let's define a value f(v) which is the product of the weights along the path from the root (node 1) to node v. Then, the product of the edges incident to node v would be equal to f(v) multiplied by the product of the edges along the path from v to the root (but that's f(v))... Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose node v is connected to its parent u. The edge between u and v has weight w. Then, the product of all edges incident to v includes the edge to u (w) and all edges in the subtree of v. But this seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the product of all edges incident to a node is -1, and the tree is connected. Let's think of the tree as a collection of edges. Let me consider that for each edge, the weight can be determined based on the parity of the degrees or something else.\n\nAlternatively, since the system of equations has exactly one solution, perhaps the solution can be found by choosing a spanning tree and assigning the variables accordingly. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of all d(1,n) across all trees can be found by considering the contribution of each edge to the total sum. Let me think about linearity of expectation. Wait, but here we are not dealing with probabilities but with sums. However, perhaps we can find for each edge, how often it contributes +1, -1, or 0 to the total sum across all trees.\n\nBut since each tree contributes exactly one value of d(1,n), which is the sum of the weights of edges on the path from 1 to n, we can think of the total sum as the sum over all trees of (sum_{e in path} w_e). By linearity of summation, this is equal to the sum over all edges e of (the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by the weight of e in that tree).\n\nBut how can we compute this? The problem is that the weight of e depends on the tree structure and the constraints. However, perhaps we can find for each edge e, the expected value of its weight in the valid assignment, multiplied by the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n. But this seems vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each tree, the weight of each edge is determined uniquely by the constraints. So, perhaps for each edge e, we can find the value of w_e in terms of the tree structure. Then, for each tree, the contribution of e to d(1,n) is w_e multiplied by 1 if e is on the path between 1 and n, else 0. Summing over all trees and edges.\n\nBut how to find the value of w_e for each edge in a given tree?\n\nLet me think again about the system of equations. For each vertex v, the sum of the weights (as 0/1) of edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. Let me think of the variables as x_e ∈ {0,1}, where x_e = 0 corresponds to weight 1, and x_e = 1 corresponds to weight -1. Then, for each vertex v, sum_{e adjacent to v} x_e = 1 mod 2.\n\nThis system has exactly one solution. How to find it?\n\nLet me think of the tree as a graph. Let me pick an arbitrary root, say node 1. For each node v, except the root, there is a unique parent in the tree. Let me assign variables x_e for each edge. For each node v, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. \n\nLet me consider that for the root node (node 1), the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. Let me denote the edges adjacent to the root as e_1, e_2, ..., e_k. Then sum x_e_i = 1 mod 2. For each other node v, which has a parent u, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to v is x_{e_parent} (the edge connecting v to u) plus the sum of x_e for edges in the subtree of v. But this seems recursive.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For each node v, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. Let me suppose that for each node except the root, we can express x_e (the edge between v and its parent) in terms of the other edges adjacent to v. \n\nFor example, take node v (not the root). Let's say the edges adjacent to v are the edge to its parent (u) and some children edges. The sum of all x_e adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. Let me denote the edge between u and v as e. Then, the sum of x_e (for e) plus the sum of x_e for edges in the subtree of v equals 1 mod 2. But the sum of x_e for edges in the subtree of v can be expressed recursively. However, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, for the root node, the sum of all x_e adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. For each other node, the sum of x_e adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. Let me imagine that for each node except the root, the x_e for the edge connecting it to its parent is determined by the other edges adjacent to it. \n\nLet me try to find the value of x_e for each edge. For example, take node v (not root). Suppose it has degree d. The sum of all x_e adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. One of these edges is the edge to its parent. Let me denote this edge as e. The other edges are edges to children. Let me assume that for each child, their edges have already been determined. Then, the x_e for the edge to the parent is determined by the equation: x_e + sum (x_other_edges) = 1 mod 2. Hence, x_e = 1 - sum (x_other_edges) mod 2.\n\nBut this suggests that once we choose the variables for the edges in the subtree, we can compute the variable for the edge to the parent. However, for the root node, there's no parent. Hence, for the root node, the sum of all x_e adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. But this sum includes all edges connected to the root. However, the variables for those edges are determined by the equations for their respective children.\n\nThis seems like a way to assign variables. Let me think of the root as node 1. For each node, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root, we can compute the x_e for the edge connecting it to its parent. \n\nBut how does this work for the root? Let's say that after processing all other nodes, the root's equation must hold. However, since the root's equation is sum of x_e adjacent to it equals 1 mod 2, and all those x_e are determined by the equations of the children, perhaps this equation is automatically satisfied. Or perhaps there's a contradiction unless some condition holds. \n\nBut earlier analysis showed that the system has exactly one solution. Hence, the equations are consistent. Therefore, the process of determining the variables for each edge (starting from leaves and moving up to the root) will result in the root's equation being satisfied automatically. \n\nBut how can we ensure that? Let me take an example. For n=2, the root is node 1. It has one edge to node 2. The equation for node 1 is x_e = 1 mod 2. The equation for node 2 is x_e = 1 mod 2. Hence, x_e = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. Wait, but n=3 is odd, so there are no solutions. Let's take n=4. Suppose the tree is a star with node 1 connected to nodes 2, 3, 4. Let's compute the variables. For each leaf node (2, 3, 4), they have degree 1. Their equation is x_e (the edge to node 1) = 1 mod 2. Hence, each of these edges must have x_e = 1. Then, for node 1, which has three edges, the sum of x_e's is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 mod 2 = 1. Which satisfies the equation. So this works. Hence, the edge weights are all -1. \n\nNow, for this tree, the path from 1 to 4 is just the single edge between them. Hence, d(1,4) is -1. \n\nBut in the sample input for n=4, the sum of d(1,4) across all good trees is -10. Since there are 16 good trees (each tree contributes a certain d(1,4)), but in this example, this particular tree contributes -1. How does that fit in?\n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's think about the variables. For each edge, the weight is determined by the equation. So for a given tree, the weight of each edge is determined by the equations. However, the exact value depends on the structure of the tree. \n\nBut how to find the sum of d(1,n) across all trees?\n\nLet me think about the following: for any tree, the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n is equal to the product of some terms? No, it's the sum of the weights. \n\nAlternatively, since the weight of each edge is determined by the system of equations, perhaps there's a way to express the sum d(1,n) in terms of the structure of the tree. \n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's think differently. For each tree, the weight of each edge can be determined by the system of equations. Let me think of the system as follows: the variables x_e are determined uniquely. How?\n\nLet me imagine that the tree is rooted at node 1. For each node v ≠ 1, the edge between v and its parent u has x_e determined by the equation for v. Because, for node v, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it is 1. Suppose that node v has children c_1, c_2, ..., c_k. Then, the equation for node v is x_e (the edge to parent u) plus the sum of x_{e_i} (edges to children) equals 1 mod 2. But since the children's edges are processed after their parents, perhaps this is not helpful.\n\nWait, if we process the tree in a bottom-up manner, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root. For each leaf node (other than the root), the equation can be used to determine the x_e of the edge to its parent. \n\nFor example, consider a leaf node v (not root). Its degree is 1, so the equation is x_e (edge to parent) = 1 mod 2. Hence, x_e = 1. So the edge between v and its parent has weight -1. \n\nIf a node v (not root) has degree 2, and one edge is to its parent, and the other is to a child (which is a leaf). Then, the equation for v is x_parent + x_child = 1 mod 2. Since the child is a leaf, x_child is 1. So x_parent = 0 mod 2. Hence, the edge to the parent has weight 1. \n\nThis seems to suggest that for each node, the x_e of the edge to its parent is determined by the other edges adjacent to the node. \n\nIn this way, the entire tree can be processed, and the x_e for each edge can be determined. However, for the root node, the equation must be satisfied. Let me think about that. \n\nOnce all other edges are determined, the root's equation is the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it. Let me suppose that the root has degree k. Then, the sum of x_e for those edges is S. According to the system, this sum must be 1 mod 2. But how is this ensured?\n\nBecause during the bottom-up processing, the x_e for edges adjacent to the root are determined by the equations of their respective children. For example, if the root has a child v, then during processing v's equation, the x_e for the edge between root and v is determined. However, since the root is the parent of v, the x_e for that edge is determined by the equation of v. \n\nBut then, when we sum all the x_e for edges adjacent to the root, this sum must be 1 mod 2. How is that ensured? Because the system has exactly one solution, this sum must be 1 mod 2. But how?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the root has degree 2, and two children, each of which is a leaf. For each leaf, the x_e of the edge to the root is 1 mod 2. Hence, the sum for the root is 1 + 1 = 2 mod 2 = 0. Which is not equal to 1. Contradiction. But earlier analysis said that the system has a solution. What's wrong here?\n\nAh, this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect. Because in this example, the system would have no solution, which contradicts the earlier assertion that when n is even, the system has exactly one solution. \n\nWait, but in this case, n=3 (root with two children). But n is odd. So the system has no solution. Which is correct. But if n is even, say n=4. Let's take a root with three children. For example, a star-shaped tree with root node 1 connected to nodes 2, 3, 4. Each of these nodes is a leaf. For each leaf, the x_e of the edge to the root is 1 mod 2. The sum for the root is 1+1+1 = 3 mod 2 = 1, which satisfies the equation. So this works. \n\nAnother example: n=4, tree is a chain 1-2-3-4. Root is 1. Let's process the tree bottom-up. \n\nNode 4 is a leaf. Its edge to parent (node 3) must be 1 mod 2. So x_3-4 = 1. \n\nNode 3 has edges to node 2 and node 4. The equation for node 3 is x_2-3 + x_3-4 = 1 mod 2. We know x_3-4 is 1. So x_2-3 = 0 mod 2. \n\nNode 2 has edges to node 1 and node 3. The equation for node 2 is x_1-2 + x_2-3 = 1 mod 2. x_2-3 is 0, so x_1-2 = 1 mod 2. \n\nRoot node 1 has edges to node 2. The equation for node 1 is x_1-2 = 1 mod 2. Which is satisfied. \n\nSo the edge weights are: 1-2: -1, 2-3: 1, 3-4: -1. \n\nThe path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4. The sum is (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1. \n\nSo for this tree, d(1,4) is -1. \n\nBut how can we find a general formula for d(1,n) across all trees?\n\nPerhaps we can find that for any tree, d(1,n) is equal to - (number of edges in the path from 1 to n) mod 2? No, because in the example above, the path length is 3 edges, and the sum is -1. Which is -1 mod 2 is 1, but the actual sum is -1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a relation between the parity of the number of edges on the path from 1 to n and the value of d(1,n). But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of d(1,n) as the sum of the weights of edges on the path. Since each weight is ±1, the sum is equal to (number of edges with weight -1) minus (number of edges with weight +1) on the path. Let me denote k as the number of edges with weight -1 on the path. Then, d(1,n) = k - (L - k) = 2k - L, where L is the length of the path (which is n-1 for a tree, but the path from 1 to n is a simple path, which has length equal to the depth of n in the tree when rooted at 1). \n\nBut how to find the average value of 2k - L across all trees?\n\nAlternatively, since L is fixed as the length of the path between 1 and n, which varies depending on the tree. For example, in a star-shaped tree, the path from 1 to n is length 1. In a chain, it's length n-1. \n\nBut how can we find the sum over all trees of d(1,n)?\n\nLet me think about the following: for each tree, the value of d(1,n) is determined by the edge weights. But the edge weights are determined by the system of equations. Perhaps there's a way to find the expected value of d(1,n) across all trees, then multiply by the number of trees (n^{n-2}).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the system of equations again. For a given tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined. Let me imagine that the tree is rooted at 1. For each node v, let's define a value f(v) which is the product of the weights along the path from the root to v. Then, what is the product of the weights of all edges incident to v?\n\nThe product of the edges incident to v is equal to f(v) multiplied by the product of the weights of the edges in the subtree of v. Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nThe product of the edges incident to v includes the edge from v to its parent (say, w) and all edges from v to its children. The product of these edges is equal to (weight of parent edge) multiplied by the product of the weights of the child edges. \n\nBut f(v) is the product of the weights along the path from root to v. So f(v) = f(parent(v)) * weight of the edge between parent(v) and v. \n\nNow, for the product of all edges incident to v: the edge to the parent has weight w_p, and the edges to children have weights w_1, w_2, etc. The product is w_p * w_1 * w_2 * ... \n\nBut how does this relate to f(v)? Not sure. \n\nBut the constraint is that this product is -1. \n\nLet me think about the product of all edges incident to v. Let's denote this product as P_v = -1. \n\nBut also, since the product of the edges from v to its children is part of P_v. \n\nAlternatively, for the root node, the product of all edges incident to it is P_root = -1. Since the root has no parent, it's the product of all edges from the root to its children. \n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with this. \n\nLet me go back to the earlier idea of the sum over all trees of d(1,n). Since each tree contributes exactly one value, and the total number of trees is n^{n-2}, perhaps we can find the expected value of d(1,n) across all trees and multiply by n^{n-2}.\n\nBut how to compute this expectation?\n\nLet me think of d(1,n) as the sum of the weights of the edges on the path from 1 to n. Let me denote this path as E. For each edge e in E, its contribution to d(1,n) is w_e. So, the total sum over all trees is sum_{trees} sum_{e in E} w_e = sum_{e} [number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n] * E[w_e | e is on the path].\n\nBut how to find E[w_e | e is on the path]?\n\nBut for a given edge e, how is its weight determined in the valid assignment? It depends on the structure of the tree. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find for any edge e, the expected value of its weight across all trees where e is on the path from 1 to n. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a symmetry here. For example, in any tree, the weight of an edge e is determined by the system of equations. For any tree, the weight of edge e is -1 if the number of edges incident to its endpoints with odd degrees is... No, not sure.\n\nWait, earlier examples show that for a leaf node (degree 1), the edge to its parent must have weight -1. Because the equation for the leaf node is that the product of its incident edges (just this one edge) is -1. Hence, the weight is -1. \n\nSimilarly, for any node v, if it has degree d, then the number of edges with weight -1 incident to it is odd. \n\nBut how to find the weight of a particular edge e in the tree?\n\nLet me think of the tree as a graph. For each edge e connecting u and v, suppose we remove it. This splits the tree into two components. Let me say that one component contains node 1 and the other contains node n. Or not necessarily. But for any edge e, it lies on the path between 1 and n if and only if removing e would split the tree into two components, one containing 1 and the other containing n. \n\nBut how does this help?\n\nLet me consider that for any edge e, the weight w_e is determined by the system of equations. Let's imagine that the tree is rooted at 1. For any edge e, which is between a parent u and child v. Then, during the bottom-up processing, the weight of this edge is determined by the equation for node v. \n\nFor example, if node v has degree d, and after processing all children of v, the sum of their edge weights is s. Then, the equation for v is w_e (edge to parent) + s = 1 mod 2. Hence, w_e = 1 - s mod 2. \n\nBut what is s? It is the sum of the edge weights of the edges from v to its children. \n\nBut how can we find this in general?\n\nAlternatively, notice that for any tree, the weight of each edge is determined by the parity of the number of leaves in its subtree. Or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, think of the following: for any tree, the weight of an edge e is -",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the distances $d(1, n)$ for all good edge-weighted trees with $n$ vertices. A good tree is defined as one where each edge has a weight of either 1 or -1, and the product of the weights of all edges incident to each vertex is -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: For a tree to be good, the product of the weights of all edges incident to each vertex must be -1. This implies that each vertex must have an odd number of edges with weight -1.\n2. **Constraints on $n$**: If $n$ is odd, there are no good trees because the product of all vertex products (each being -1) would result in $-1^n$, which is not 1 when $n$ is odd. Thus, the answer is 0 for odd $n$.\n3. **Even $n$ Case**: When $n$ is even, each tree structure has exactly one valid assignment of edge weights that satisfies the conditions of a good tree.\n4. **Sum of Distances**: The distance $d(1, n)$ for a given tree is the sum of weights along the path from vertex 1 to vertex $n$.
