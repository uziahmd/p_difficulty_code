There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays against player 3, they have already played one game (against player 2), and player 3 hasn't played any. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So output is 2. For n=4, the sample says the answer is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play 3 games? Let's see. Let's imagine the structure. If the winner plays three games, that would require them to have played against three opponents. But each time, the opponent must have a number of games played differing by at most one. Let's think: the first game, the winner has 0 games, opponent also 0. Then after winning, they have 1 game. Next game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. Suppose the winner plays against someone who has 0 games. Then after that, the winner has 2 games. Then for the third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But how can there be someone with 1 game? Let's think. Maybe the tournament structure requires that. But maybe for n=4, it's not possible. Because in order to have a third game, the winner would need to have opponents that meet the criteria. Let me think of the structure. For example, if you have four players. The first round could be two matches: 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4. Then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner plays two games. But if you try to arrange for the winner to play three games, perhaps you need more players. Like, maybe the structure requires that each time you have a new player. \n\nWait, maybe the maximum number of games the winner can play is related to the Fibonacci sequence? Because each time, the number of players needed to allow the winner to have one more game increases in a way similar to Fibonacci numbers. Let me think. For example, to have a winner play k games, the minimum number of players required is something like the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that to have a player play m games, they must have beaten m opponents. Each time they play a game, the opponent must have a number of games that's either equal to or one less than their current count. So, for the first game, the opponent has 0 games. After that, the winner has 1 game. For the second game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. But if the opponent has 0 games, then after that, the winner has 2 games. For the third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. How can that happen? Well, that opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. For example, if the winner has played 2 games, and the opponent has played 1 game. How does that opponent get to 1 game? That would require that opponent to have played once before. So, maybe the number of players required to allow the winner to have m games is the sum of the players needed for the previous steps. \n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me think. Let's define f(m) as the minimum number of players required to allow the winner to have m games. For m=0, it's 1 (but that's trivial). For m=1, you need 2 players. For m=2, you need 3 players. Because the winner plays two games. Let me see: first game against one player (so 2 players), then the second game against another player. But that's only possible if that player has 0 games. Wait, but the winner has played 1 game. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So for m=2, the minimum players is 3. But for m=3, how many players do we need? Let's think. To have the winner play three games, the third game's opponent must have played either 2 or 1 games. Let's assume that the opponent has played 1 game. How can that happen? That opponent must have had a previous match. So, for the third game, the winner (who has played two games) plays against someone who has played one game. That someone would have had to have played once. So, for that, you need a subtree where that player has played once. So, the total players would be the players required for the first two games (which is 3) plus the players required for the opponent in the third game. Wait, maybe f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2). Because for the winner to play m games, they need to have played m-1 games, and then the next game's opponent must have played m-1 or m-2 games. Wait, maybe the minimal number of players is the sum of the previous two. Let me check:\n\nFor example:\n\nf(0) = 1 (the winner, no games)\nf(1) = 2 (two players, one game)\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3. Which matches the example where n=3 gives 2 games.\nFor f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. So, with 5 players, the winner can play 3 games. Let's see. How?\n\nFirst, the winner plays against someone (game 1). Then, they need to play another game. The opponent here can be someone who has played 0 or 1 games. Let's say the winner plays against someone who has played 0 games (so game 2). Then, for game 3, the opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. How can we arrange that? Let's think. Suppose the winner has played two games. The opponent needs to have played 1 game. So, that opponent must have played once. So, for that, there must be a subtree where that player has played once. So, for example, the winner's third game is against a player who has already played once. That player would have come from a match where they had to play once. So, the total number of players is f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. \n\nSo, in general, the minimal number of players needed to allow the winner to play m games is the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number. Wait, let's check:\n\nIf we consider the Fibonacci sequence starting with f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2, f(2) = 3, f(3) = 5, f(4)=8, etc. So the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... which is the Fibonacci numbers starting from 1, 2. So the m-th term is Fib(m+2), perhaps?\n\nSo, the problem becomes: given n, find the maximum m such that f(m) ≤ n. Where f(m) is the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number. Wait, but how to compute that.\n\nLet me think again. For example, for n=3, the maximum m is 2, since f(2)=3. For n=4, the maximum m is 2, since f(3)=5 is larger than 4. So the answer is 2. For n=5, the answer is 3. So the approach is to find the largest m where f(m) ≤n. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum m such that the (m+2)-th Fibonacci number is ≤n. But how to compute that. Let's think about the Fibonacci sequence here. Let's define the sequence as follows:\n\nLet's define fib[0] = 1, fib[1] = 2, fib[2] = 3, fib[3] = 5, fib[4] = 8, etc. So fib[k] = fib[k-1] + fib[k-2]. \n\nSo for each m, the minimal number of players needed is fib[m]. So for a given n, the maximum m such that fib[m] <=n. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Generate the Fibonacci sequence until the next term exceeds n. Then, the maximum m is the index of the last term that is <=n. \n\nBut wait, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2 is n=3. The output is 2. Which corresponds to m=2. Because fib[2] is 3. \n\nSample Input 4 is n=4. The maximum m is 2, since fib[2]=3 <=4, and fib[3]=5>4. So the answer is 2. \n\nSample Input 10: the output is 4. Let's see. Let's compute the fib sequence:\n\nfib[0] = 1\n\nfib[1] = 2\n\nfib[2] = 3\n\nfib[3] = 5\n\nfib[4] = 8\n\nfib[5] = 13. \n\nFor n=10, the largest m is 4, since fib[4]=8 <=10, and fib[5]=13>10. So answer is 4. Which matches the sample. \n\nYes! So the problem reduces to finding the largest m such that fib[m] <=n, where fib is defined as above. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the point where they exceed 1e18. Then, for a given n, find the maximum m where fib[m] <=n.\n\nBut how to generate the Fibonacci numbers. Let's think about the maximum possible n, which is 1e18. Let's compute the sequence:\n\nLet's compute the terms:\n\nfib[0] = 1\n\nfib[1] = 2\n\nfib[2] = 3\n\nfib[3] = 5\n\nfib[4] = 8\n\nfib[5] = 13\n\nfib[6] = 21\n\nfib[7] = 34\n\nfib[8] = 55\n\nfib[9] = 89\n\nfib[10] = 144\n\n...\n\nEach term grows exponentially, so the sequence will reach 1e18 in about 80 steps. So generating them is feasible even for large n. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Generate all the fib numbers up to the maximum possible (until it exceeds 1e18). For each n, find the maximum m where fib[m] <=n. \n\nBut how to generate the list. Let's think:\n\nInitialize a list with fib[0] = 1, fib[1] = 2. Then for each next term, add the previous two. \n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n, perform a binary search to find the maximum m where fib[m] <=n. \n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the list will be small. For example, the 80th term is around 1e16 or something. Let's compute:\n\nLet me compute the terms step by step:\n\nLet me compute the terms until I reach 1e18.\n\nBut for code purposes, we can generate the list in a loop. Let's think of the code.\n\nIn Python:\n\nWe can generate the list as follows:\n\nfib = [1, 2]\n\nthen while the last element is <= 1e18, append next element (sum of last two). \n\nOnce that list is generated, for a given n, we can iterate through the list to find the maximum m where fib[m] <=n. \n\nBut wait, the list is in order, so we can use binary search. However, since the list is small, even a linear search would be acceptable. \n\nBut for code efficiency, binary search is better. \n\nBut for the problem, considering that the list is small, even for n=1e18, the list will have about 80 elements. So even a linear search is acceptable. \n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n. \n\nGenerate the list of fib numbers as described. \n\nFind the largest m such that fib[m] <=n. \n\nThe answer is m. \n\nWait, but let's check for n=2. The fib list is [1, 2, 3, ...]. For n=2, the maximum m is 1, because fib[1] is 2. Which gives answer 1. Which matches the first sample. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nGenerate the list of fib numbers. Then, for the given n, find the maximum m where fib[m] <=n. \n\nNow, how to generate the list. Let's think:\n\nStart with a list, say, fibs = [1, 2]. Then, while the next term is <= 1e18, append it. \n\nBut for example:\n\nnext term is 3 (1+2), then 5 (2+3), etc. \n\nSo code:\n\nfibs = [1, 2]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float. So perhaps better to use integers. So:\n\nmax_n = 10**18\n\nfibs = [1, 2]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > max_n:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, this will generate all the necessary terms. \n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given input n, we can loop through the list and find the largest m where fibs[m] <=n. \n\nWait, but the list is [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...], and each index corresponds to m. For example, index 0 is m=0, which gives 1 player. But the problem states that n starts from 2. \n\nBut for the problem, the maximum m is determined as the largest index where fibs[m] <=n. \n\nFor example, for n=2, the list has 1, 2. So the maximum m is 1 (since fibs[1] is 2). \n\nSo the code for the problem is:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n is 1, but according to the input constraints, n is at least 2. \n\nSo for the given n, find the maximum m such that fibs[m] <=n. \n\nBut how to find this m. \n\nFor example, in the list, the elements are in increasing order. So we can iterate through the list and find the largest element that is <=n. \n\nSo in code:\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] >n:\n\n        break\n\nso the answer is i-1. \n\nBut for example, if n is 3, then the list has 1,2,3,5,... So for i=2, fibs[2]=3. So the answer is 2. Which is correct. \n\nBut what if n is larger than all elements in the fibs list? For example, if n is 1e18, but the last element in fibs is less than that. Then, the maximum m is len(fibs)-1. \n\nWait, but the loop generating the fibs stops when next_val exceeds 1e18. So the last element in fibs is the largest that is <=1e18. \n\nSo, for example, if n is 1e18, then the answer is len(fibs)-1. \n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\ngenerate the list of fibs as explained.\n\nthen, for the input n, find the maximum m such that fibs[m] <=n. \n\nSo, in code, for example:\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    # generate fibs list\n\n    fibs = [1, 2]\n\n    while True:\n\n        next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n        if next_val > 1e18:\n\n            break\n\n        fibs.append(next_val)\n\n    # Now find the maximum m where fibs[m] <=n\n\n    # iterate through the list\n\n    for i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n        if fibs[i] >n:\n\n            break\n\n    print(i-1)\n\nWait, but for example, if n is 1e18, then the loop will stop when next_val exceeds 1e18. So the last element in fibs is the largest possible. So in the for loop, the i will be len(fibs), and then the code would break. Then, i-1 is len(fibs)-1. Which is correct. \n\nBut let's test for n=2. The fibs list is [1,2,3, ...]. So in the for loop:\n\ni starts from 0:\n\ni=0: fibs[0]=1 <=2 → continue\n\ni=1: fibs[1]=2 <=2 → continue\n\ni=2: fibs[2] =3 >2 → break. So i is 2. So print i-1=1. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=3. The loop breaks at i=3 (fibs[2]=3, then i=3, fibs[3]=5>3. So i-1=2. Correct. \n\nAnother example: n=4. The fibs list is [1,2,3,5,...]. So i=3 (fibs[3] is 5>4). So i-1=2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5. The i would be 3 (fibs[3] is 5, which is <=5. Then i increments to 4, fibs[4] is 8>5. So break. i-1 is 3. Which is correct. \n\nSo this logic works. \n\nBut in Python, the code for generating the fibs list may have an issue with the initial values. Let me check. \n\nLet me think about the initial list. The first two elements are 1 and 2. Then, the next elements are 3, 5, 8, etc. So for m=0, the value is 1. But the problem says that the minimum number of players for m=0 is 1. However, the problem's input starts with n≥2. So for n=2, the maximum m is 1. Which is correct. \n\nSo the code seems correct. \n\nBut let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. Output is 2. Which is correct. \n\nSample Input 4: n=4. Output is 2. Which is correct. \n\nSample Input 10: the fib list would have 1,2,3,5,8,13. So for n=10, the loop breaks at i=5 (fibs[4] is 8, then i=5, fibs[5] is 13>10. So i-1=4. Which is the correct answer. \n\nSo yes, this approach works. \n\nNow, the code in Python. \n\nBut note that in the code, the loop for generating the fibs list uses 1e18. However, in Python, 1e18 is a float. So when comparing next_val (an integer) to 1e18, it's possible that for very large numbers, the comparison is not accurate. So better to use integers. \n\nSo, in code:\n\nmax_n = 10**18\n\nfibs = [1, 2]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > max_n:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\nBut in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so this is okay. \n\nNow, for the input n, the code proceeds as described. \n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the problem says that n ≥ 2, so no need to handle that. \n\nNow, let's code this. \n\nBut the code for the for loop may need to be adjusted. Because in Python, the loop for i in range(len(fibs)) will go from 0 to len(fibs)-1. For example, if the fibs list is [1,2,3,5], then len(fibs) is 4. The for loop runs i from 0 to 3. \n\nBut let's think: for each i in range(len(fibs)), check if fibs[i] >n. \n\nSo, for example, if n is larger than all elements in fibs, then the loop will run all the way through. So, for example, if n is 1e18 and the last element of fibs is 1e18, then the loop will check for all i up to len(fibs)-1, and then exit. \n\nWait, let's take the code:\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] >n:\n\n        break\n\nso, for example, if n is larger than all elements in fibs, then the loop will run through all i in range(len(fibs)), and the code will break only when i reaches len(fibs). But the loop is for i in range(len(fibs)), which is from 0 to len(fibs)-1. So after the loop, i will be len(fibs). \n\nBut in this case, the code would have broken only when fibs[i] >n. But if none of the elements are larger than n, then the loop completes. So, after the loop, i is len(fibs). So the code would print i-1 = len(fibs)-1. Which is correct. \n\nSo the code is:\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] >n:\n\n        break\n\nprint(i-1)\n\nBut wait, when the loop breaks, i is the first index where fibs[i] >n. So the maximum m is i-1. \n\nBut when the loop completes without breaking, i is len(fibs), and then i-1 is len(fibs)-1. Which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, testing for n=2:\n\nfibs is [1,2,3, ...]. The for loop checks:\n\ni=0: 1<=2 → continue.\n\ni=1: 2<=2 → continue.\n\ni=2: 3>2 → break. So i is 2. print 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1 (but input is 2 or higher). \n\nSo the code should work. \n\nNow, let's code this. \n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n as integer. \n\nGenerate the fibs list as discussed. \n\nThen find the maximum m. \n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the case when n is 1, but the input is 2 or higher. \n\nSo the code is:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfibs = [1, 2]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\n# Now find the maximum m\n\ni = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] > n:\n\n        break\n\nprint(i-1)\n\nWait, but in Python, the for loop will run for i in range(len(fibs)), which is 0 to len(fibs)-1. \n\nBut what if the fibs list is [1, 2], and n is 2? Then the loop runs i=0 and i=1. \n\nAt i=0, fibs[0] is 1 <=2 → continue. \n\nAt i=1, fibs[1] is 2 <=2 → continue. \n\nThen, the loop ends. i is 2 (since range(len(fibs)) is 0,1, and the loop runs for i=0 and 1. After the loop, i is 2. Then print i-1 = 1. Which is correct. \n\nSo the code is correct. \n\nBut in the code, the for loop is written as:\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] >n:\n\n        break\n\nSo the code will check all elements in the fibs list. \n\nNow, let's test the code for the sample input. \n\nSample input 2: n=3. \n\nThe fibs list is [1,2,3,5, ...]. \n\nLoop:\n\ni=0 → 1 <=3 → continue.\n\ni=1 → 2 <=3 → continue.\n\ni=2 → 3 <=3 → continue.\n\ni=3 → 5>3 → break. \n\nSo i is 3. print 3-1=2. Correct. \n\nSample input 4: n=4. \n\ni=0 → 1 <=4 → continue.\n\ni=1 → 2 <=4 → continue.\n\ni=2 →3 <=4 → continue.\n\ni=3 →5>4 → break. i=3. print 2. Correct. \n\nSample input 10: \n\nfibs is [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...]. \n\nn=10. \n\ni runs from 0 to len(fibs)-1. \n\nAt i=4: fibs[4] is 8 <=10. \n\ni=5: fibs[5] is 13>10 → break. So i is 5. print 5-1=4. Which is correct. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nBut wait, the code for generating the fibs list may not be correct. Let's think about the initial values. \n\nThe first two terms are 1 and 2. Then, the next term is 3 (1+2). Then 2+3=5. Then 3+5=8. Then 5+8=13, etc. Which is correct. \n\nThus, the code should be correct. \n\nNow, let's code it in Python. \n\nBut note that the initial fibs list is [1, 2], and the loop appends next_val. \n\nAnother thing to note is that for n=2, the code returns 1, which is correct. \n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead n, generate the fibs list, then find the maximum m. \n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input as n. \n\nBut for n up to 1e18, the code can handle it. \n\nNow, let's write the code. \n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\nLet's test each case. \n\nCase n=2: the code returns 1. Correct. \n\nCase n=3: returns 2. Correct. \n\nCase n=4: returns 2. Correct. \n\nCase n=10: returns 4. Correct. \n\nThus, the code works for the samples. \n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfibs = [1, 2]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\ni = 0\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] > n:\n\n        break\n\nprint(i-1)\n\nBut wait, in the code, the variable 'i' is being used in the for loop. \n\nWait, in Python, the code:\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if fibs[i] >n:\n\n        break\n\nSo, for example, if the fibs list is [1,2,3,5], then the loop runs for i=0,1,2,3. \n\nBut in the code, after the loop, i is 3 (if the loop breaks at i=3). \n\nBut in the code, the for loop is written as:\n\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n\n    if ...:\n\n        break\n\nSo, the code is correct. \n\nBut what if the fibs list is empty? Well, since the initial fibs list is [1,2], len(fibs) is 2. So the for loop will run. \n\nAnother edge case: n=2. \n\nBut the code is correct. \n\nAnother edge case: n=1. But the input constraints say n≥2, so no need to handle. \n\nAnother case: n=5. The answer is 3. \n\nYes, because fibs[3] is 5. So the code returns 3. \n\nSo, the code is correct. \n\nThus, this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given the constraint that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be reduced to finding the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to the given number of players, `n`. This is because the structure of the tournament requires a sequence where each subsequent game the winner plays depends on the previous games, which follows a Fibonacci-like sequence.\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: Generate Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible value (10^18) since the number of players can be as large as 10^18.\n2. **Binary Search for Maximum Games**: For a given number of players `n`, find the maximum index in the generated Fibonacci sequence such that the corresponding Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\n\nfibs = [1, 2]\nwhile True:\n    next_val = fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]\n    if next_val > 10**18:\n        break\n    fibs.append(next_val)\n\ni = 0\nfor i in range(len(fibs)):\n    if fibs[i] > n:\n        break\n\nprint(i - 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: The Fibonacci sequence is generated starting with the first two terms as 1 and 2. Each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms. This sequence continues until the next term exceeds 10^18.\n2. **Finding Maximum Games**: For a given input `n`, iterate through the generated Fibonacci sequence to find the largest index where the Fibonacci number is less than or equal to `n`. This index corresponds to the maximum number of games the winner can participate in.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that the solution is computed in logarithmic time relative to the size of the Fibonacci sequence, which is feasible given the exponential growth of Fibonacci numbers.",
