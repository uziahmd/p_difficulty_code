Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how? Since each road divides the plane into regions, the blocks are regions divided by these lines. The challenge is to represent each block in a way that allows us to compute adjacency efficiently.\n\nBut considering that the number of blocks can be huge (since each new line can potentially double the number of regions), it's impossible to generate all blocks explicitly. So we need another approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of representing the blocks directly, think about the problem in terms of the regions defined by the roads. Each region can be uniquely identified by the sign of the equations of each road. Because for each road, a point lies on one side or the other of the line. So for each road, the value of a_i x + b_i y + c_i will be either positive or negative. So, the region can be represented by a tuple of signs for each road. However, since there are n roads, each with two possible signs, there are 2^n possible regions. But for n=300, this is impossible. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe we don't need to generate all regions. Instead, think about the problem as a graph where each node represents a region (block), and edges exist between regions that share a common border. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home region and the university region. But how to model this graph without enumerating all regions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem using BFS, but each state is determined by the current position's relation to the roads. However, since the home and university positions are given, maybe we can compute their respective regions (as sign vectors) and then find the minimal steps between them by considering transitions through roads.\n\nBut how do we determine which regions are adjacent? For two regions to be adjacent, they must differ by exactly one road's sign. Because if you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. So, if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are adjacent. Wait, is that true?\n\nLet me think. Suppose two regions are separated by a single road. Then, moving across that road would change the sign of that road's equation. So, any two regions that differ in exactly one road's sign are adjacent. However, if two regions differ in more than one road's sign, then they might not be adjacent. But wait, maybe there are cases where two regions differ in more than one sign but are adjacent. No, because if they are adjacent, their boundary must be along a single road. So the regions must be separated by exactly one road. Therefore, two regions are adjacent if and only if their sign vectors differ in exactly one road's sign.\n\nSo, this suggests that each region can be represented by a binary vector (for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the road). Then, moving from one region to another requires changing exactly one bit in this vector. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of bit flips needed to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step can flip exactly one bit.\n\nBut that seems too simplistic. Because the actual adjacency depends on whether the regions are separated by a single road. However, the sign vectors differing by one bit implies that they are separated by exactly that road. So, in that case, they are adjacent. So, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. But wait, that's not correct. Because the Hamming distance is the number of differing bits. But each step can flip one bit. So the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance. However, this can't be right. Because the Hamming distance is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. But how does that relate to the minimal steps required to move between the two regions?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the home is in a region where for all roads, the sign is positive. The university is in a region where for exactly one road, the sign is negative, and others are positive. Then, the Hamming distance is 1, so the minimal steps is 1. Which makes sense. Because you can cross that road once to reach the other region.\n\nAnother example: suppose the home and university differ in two roads. Then, the Hamming distance is 2. But can you get from one to the other in two steps? Yes. Because you can cross the first road, then cross the second. But maybe there's a way to cross both roads in one step? No, because each step crosses exactly one road. So the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\nWait, but this would imply that the answer is simply the Hamming distance between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector. However, this can't be correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Because the Hamming distance is the number of roads where the two regions differ. However, the minimal steps between the two regions is equal to the number of roads that separate them. Because each step can cross one road. But perhaps there's a way to cross roads in such a way that you can reach the target region with fewer steps? Or is the Hamming distance the correct answer?\n\nWait, suppose you have two regions that differ in two roads. Let's say, for example, that the home is in region A, and the university is in region B. The regions differ in roads 1 and 2. To get from A to B, you need to cross road 1 and road 2. But each crossing changes the sign of one road. So, starting from A, crossing road 1 takes you to a region that differs in road 1. Then, crossing road 2 takes you to a region that differs in road 1 and 2. So, the minimal steps is two. So the Hamming distance is two. Which matches. Similarly, if the Hamming distance is k, the minimal steps is k. So, the answer is the Hamming distance between the two regions.\n\nBut wait, this would make the problem very easy. Because all we need to do is compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, and count how many such roads there are. That's the answer.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which changes the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university regions. Because each such road must be crossed once.\n\nBut how do we know that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads? Because each time you cross a road, you can flip the sign of that road. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of roads that separate the home and university regions.\n\nWait, but how do we know that the home and university regions are connected via such steps? Because each time you cross a road, you can move to a neighboring region. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to get from the home region to the university region. Each such road crossing is a step. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two regions.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nFor each road, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. If they are, then that road is part of the minimal path. Because each such road must be crossed once.\n\nWait, but that's exactly the Hamming distance between the sign vectors. Because for each road, the home and university have different signs if and only if the road separates them. So, the number of such roads is the Hamming distance. And thus, the minimal steps is that number.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed. For example, if there are two roads separating the regions, you need to cross them both, hence two steps. But what if there's a way to cross one road and then cross another road, but that's two steps. So the minimal steps is indeed the number of roads that separate the two regions.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many roads have the home and university on opposite sides of them.\n\nWait, but this seems too simple. Let's look at the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x +1y +0 =0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0).\n\nFor the home (1,1):\n\nCheck for each road:\n\nRoad 1: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0. So home is on the positive side.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So the road separates them. So this road counts.\n\nRoad 2: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1>0. University: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So this road also separates them. So total of 2 steps. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nFor the third road: a=1, b=1, c=-3. For home (1,1): 1+1 -3 = -1 <0. For university (-1,-1): -1 -1 -3 = -5 <0. So same sign. So this road doesn't separate them. So the other two roads (x=0 and y=0) separate them. So total of 2 steps. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo the sample outputs align with this approach. So perhaps the problem is indeed as simple as counting the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nBut why? How can this be? Because the problem says that you can move between blocks if they share a common border. So each step is crossing a road. So the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of roads you need to cross to get from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads that separate the two regions?\n\nWell, think of the regions as nodes in a graph. Each node is connected to others that differ by one road. The minimal path between home and university is the Hamming distance. Because each step flips one bit. So the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWe can compute for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the answer.\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. For each road, compute the sign of the home point (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i). Similarly compute the sign of the university point (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i).\n\n2. For each road, check if the two signs are different. If so, increment the count.\n\n3. Output this count.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Because the problem's sample input shows that this approach works. But why is this the case?\n\nBecause each road that separates the home and university regions must be crossed once. And since the regions are connected via adjacent regions, the minimal steps is the number of such roads. Because each such road must be crossed once.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses each of these roads once, and no more?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where two regions are separated by two roads. Let's imagine that the home region and the university region are separated by two roads. Then, the minimal steps would be two. But how can you cross those two roads? Well, you can cross the first road, which brings you into a region that is separated by one road. Then cross the second road, which brings you to the target region. So yes, two steps.\n\nThus, the answer is indeed the number of roads that separate the home and university regions.\n\nThis seems to be the case. So the problem reduces to checking for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, and counting how many such roads there are.\n\nBut why then the problem is considered hard? Maybe because there's some edge case I'm missing?\n\nWait, let's think again. What if there's a road that the home and university are on the same side of, but there's another road that is crossed multiple times. But according to the problem's movement rules, you can't cross a road twice in a single step. But the minimal steps would require only crossing the roads that separate the two regions.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So for each road, the home and university are on one side or the other.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the answer is the number of roads that separate the home and university regions.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), university coordinates (x2, y2), read n roads. For each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If their product is negative, then they are on opposite sides, so increment the count.\n\nThe answer is that count.\n\nBut wait, what about when the product is zero? But the problem says that neither home nor university lie on any road. So for each road, the value for home and university is non-zero. So the product can't be zero.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me test this against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1).\n\nRoads:\n\n0 1 0 → equation 0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0.\n\nFor home: 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1 → positive.\n\nFor university: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative. So product is negative. Count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → x=0.\n\nHome: 1*1 + 0*1 +0 = 1 → positive.\n\nUniv: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative. Product negative. Count +=1. Total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nHome (1,1), univ (-1,-1). Three roads:\n\nRoad 1: 1 0 0 → x=0. Same as before. Home is +1, univ is -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 0 1 0 → same as before. count +=1.\n\nRoad 3: 1 1 -3 → equation x + y -3 =0.\n\nHome: 1 + 1 -3 = -1 → negative.\n\nUniv: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 → negative. product is positive. So not counted. So total is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the sample outputs match. So this approach seems correct.\n\nBut why is the problem considered hard then? Maybe because the original problem is more complex, but the actual solution is simple. Perhaps the problem is designed to trick people into thinking it's a BFS problem, but in reality, it's just a simple count.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the movement between regions is allowed through adjacent regions, and each step crosses a road. The minimal steps is the minimal number of roads to cross, which is exactly the number of roads separating the two regions. Because each road that separates them must be crossed once.\n\nBut how to be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads?\n\nWell, since the regions form a planar graph, and each road is a line dividing the plane. The regions are connected in such a way that any two regions can be connected by a path of adjacent regions. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two regions.\n\nBut why? Because each time you cross a road that separates them, you reduce the number of separating roads by one. Wait, no. For example, if you have two separating roads, crossing one of them would take you to a region that is separated by one road. Then crossing the second road would take you to the target region. So the steps are two. Which is the count of the separating roads.\n\nSo the answer is indeed the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward. For each road, check whether home and university are on opposite sides of the road. Count the number of such roads.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of the n roads:\n\n    a, b, c = coefficients\n\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, that's all?\n\nYes. So the code is very simple.\n\nBut why is the problem called \"Crazy Town\" and marked as very hard? Maybe because people might overcomplicate it, thinking of BFS or other methods, but the actual solution is straightforward once you realize the key insight.\n\nBut let's think again. Are there any cases where this approach is incorrect?\n\nSuppose there are two roads that are parallel. For example, two horizontal lines. Suppose the home is above both, and the university is below both. Then, the two roads separate the home and university. So the count would be 2. However, the minimal steps would be 1. Because you can cross one road, and then you are in a region that is below that road but above the other. Then cross the second road. But that would take two steps. So the count is 2, and the steps required is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads, all intersecting at a single point. The home is in a region that is on the positive side of all three roads. The university is on the negative side of all three roads. Then, the count is 3. So the minimal steps is 3. Because you have to cross each road once.\n\nBut is there a way to get from the home to the university in fewer steps? Probably not. Because each step can cross only one road. So, you need to cross all three roads, so three steps.\n\nTherefore, the approach seems correct.\n\nThus, the code is as simple as that.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nRead the input:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, but the input is read as two separate test cases? Or is that a mistake? Wait, looking back, the user provided two examples. The first input is for the first example, and the second input is for the second example. But the problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut the user's note says that the input is given as in the example. However, for the code submission, the code should read from stdin. So for the code, the input is:\n\nThe first line contains x1, y1.\n\nSecond line contains x2, y2.\n\nThird line contains n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nCompute for each line, the value of (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) and (a*x2 + b*y2 + c). Check if their product is negative. If yes, increment count.\n\nPrint the count.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut need to read input correctly. For example, in Python, reading from stdin, perhaps with input().split().\n\nBut for cases where the input is given with multiple lines, perhaps via:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nBut let's test it against the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nval1 for first road: 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1. val2: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1. val2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product -1 → count becomes 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → val1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → product negative → count +=1.\n\n0 1 0 → same as before, count +=1.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → val1 is 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 is 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no increment. So total is 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nBut what about when the roads are not in general position? For example, if there are multiple roads, but the home and university are separated by some roads. But the code still counts them correctly.\n\nThus, this approach seems correct. Therefore, the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. The home and university blocks are located in different regions, and the minimum number of steps required to move between them is determined by the number of roads that separate these two regions. \n\nFor each road, we check if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. If they do, this road must be crossed to move from the home block to the university block.

If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Steps**: Each road that separates the home and university blocks is counted. This count directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each step corresponds to crossing a separating road.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines dividing the plane, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
