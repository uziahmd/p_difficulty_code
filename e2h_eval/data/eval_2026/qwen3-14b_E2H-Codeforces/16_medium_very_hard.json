Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from one block (region) to another, where each step involves crossing a road (i.e., moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border). The home and university are in different blocks, and we need to find the shortest path between them.\n\nFirst, I need to model this as a graph problem. Each block is a node, and edges exist between blocks that share a common border. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there are infinitely many regions, it's impossible to represent all of them directly. So, perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model the problem based on the positions relative to each road. Since each road divides the plane into two parts, the position of a point relative to a road can be represented by the sign of the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i. For example, if a point is on one side of the road, it will have a positive value, and on the other side, negative. \n\nBut since each road is a line, the blocks can be characterized by the signs of their positions relative to each road. However, since there are n roads, each block is determined by the sign for each road. But since the home and university are not on any road, their positions are fixed in terms of these signs.\n\nBut how do we model the transitions between blocks? Because moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. So, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because crossing that road changes the sign for that road. But wait, if two blocks differ in exactly one road's sign, then they share a common border (the road itself), so you can move between them in one step. But if they differ in more than one road's sign, then they are not adjacent. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign changes needed to go from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration, where each step can flip exactly one sign (i.e., cross a single road). \n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because each road is a line, and when you cross it, you change the sign for that road. So, each move corresponds to flipping the sign of exactly one road. Therefore, the problem becomes equivalent to finding the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped (i.e., crossed) to get from the home's configuration to the university's configuration.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let me think. Let's consider the home's position as a vector of signs for each road. Similarly for the university. Let's call these vectors H and U. Each entry in the vector is either +1 or -1, depending on the sign of a_i x + b_i y + c_i for the home (or university) point.\n\nThe question is: what is the minimal number of positions where H and U differ, but with some constraints? Wait, no. Because each step allows you to cross a road, which changes the sign for that road. So, if you start at H, and you want to reach U, the minimal steps would be the number of roads where H and U differ, but only if those differences can be achieved by flipping one road at a time. However, this seems like the Hamming distance between H and U. But that's not correct. Because each step can flip exactly one road's sign. So, the minimal steps would be the number of differing roads between H and U. Because each differing road requires a flip. But wait, that's only if you can flip each differing road once. But is that possible?\n\nFor example, suppose H and U differ in k roads. Then, you can flip each of those roads once, and that would take k steps. But is there a scenario where you can't do that? Like, maybe some roads are overlapping in such a way that flipping one affects others? No, because each road is independent. Flipping a road's sign is just crossing that road once. So, the minimal steps should be exactly the number of roads where H and U differ. \n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0, and 1x +0y +0 =0 → x=0.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nCheck each road:\n\nFirst road: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 → positive. So sign is +1.\n\nSecond road: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1 → positive. So H's vector is [1, 1].\n\nUniversity is (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative. Sign -1.\n\nSecond road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative. So U's vector is [-1, -1]. \n\nSo the difference is in both roads. So Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. That's correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nCheck home's signs:\n\nFor x=0: 1 → positive.\n\nFor y=0: 1 → positive.\n\nFor x + y -3 = 0 → 1+1-3 = -1 → negative. So H's vector is [1, 1, -1].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nx=0 → -1 → negative.\n\ny=0 → -1 → negative.\n\nx + y -3 → -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 → negative. So U's vector is [-1, -1, -1]. \n\nDifferences are in first two roads. Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo that seems to fit. So the answer is the number of roads where the signs of home and university differ. But why is that the case?\n\nBecause each step can cross one road, changing the sign of that road. So, if you have k differing roads, you need to cross each of them once. So the minimal steps is exactly k.\n\nWait, but why can't there be a shorter path? For example, suppose there are two roads, and the home and university differ in both. Then, you need to cross both roads, which takes two steps. There's no way to cross one road and get to the target. So yes, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors.\n\nBut then, why is this problem considered hard? Oh, maybe I'm missing something. Because perhaps some roads are overlapping in such a way that crossing one road can affect multiple sign differences. But no, each road is independent. Because each road is a line. When you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So, for example, if you have two differing roads, you need to cross each once, regardless of their positions.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute for each road, whether home and university are on the same side of the road or not. The number of roads where they are on different sides is the answer.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Let me think again. Suppose that the home and university are on opposite sides of a road. Then, that road is in the set of differing roads. So, the minimal steps is the count of such roads.\n\nBut why is that the case?\n\nBecause each step allows you to cross a road. So, if you need to cross k roads, you need k steps. Because each step can cross exactly one road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate home and university.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each road that separates home and university must be crossed once. And roads that don't separate them can be ignored.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads? Because each time you cross a road, you flip its sign. So, if you cross all roads where home and university differ, then you will end up in the university's region.\n\nBut how can you cross those roads? Because each crossing is allowed, and the order doesn't matter. Because crossing a road once changes the sign. So, regardless of the order, crossing all roads that differ will take you from home to university.\n\nBut then, the answer is simply the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nFor each road, compute the sign of home and the sign of university. If they are different, increment the count.\n\nSo, for each road i, compute (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). Check if their product is negative. Because if the product is negative, then the two points are on opposite sides of the road. If it's positive, they are on the same side. If zero, but the problem says that neither home nor university is on any road, so that's impossible.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nRead home (x1,y1) and university (x2,y2).\n\nRead n roads.\n\nFor each road, compute s1 = a_i*x1 + b_i*y1 + c_i.\n\ns2 = a_i*x2 + b_i*y2 + c_i.\n\nIf s1 * s2 < 0, then this road is in the count.\n\nSum all such roads, that's the answer.\n\nWait, but that's very straightforward. So why the sample input gives 2 in the first case?\n\nLet me check:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nRoads are 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0. For home (1,1): s1 = 1*1 +0 =1. For university (-1,-1): s2 = 1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road is 1x +0y +0 =0 → x=0. s1 = 1*1 +0 =1, s2 = -1. product -1 <0 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nRoads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\ns1 for x=0 is 1 → positive.\n\ns2 for university (-1,-1) is -1 → product is negative → count +=1.\n\nSame for y=0: product is negative → count +=1.\n\nThird road: x + y -3 = 0. For home: 1+1-3 = -1. For university: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Both negative. product is positive → no count. So total 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo according to this logic, the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. So the code is straightforward.\n\nBut why is this problem considered hard? Because maybe there's some misunderstanding here. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is non-zero. So, for example, if two blocks share a common road segment (i.e., they are adjacent along a road), then you can move between them. But the problem says that if two blocks are adjacent to the same intersection (like a crossroad) but don't share a common boundary segment, you can't move between them in one step.\n\nBut according to our previous reasoning, the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the home and university. But perhaps that's not the case. Because maybe there's a scenario where two points are separated by k roads, but you can reach the destination in fewer steps. How?\n\nWait, for example, imagine two roads that cross each other. Suppose home is in a block that is on the positive side of both roads, and the university is on the negative side of both roads. Then, the number of differing roads is 2. According to our approach, the answer is 2. But perhaps you can cross one road, then cross the other, which would take two steps. But that's the same as the count. So the answer is indeed 2.\n\nAnother example: suppose home is on positive side of road A, and negative of road B. University is negative of road A and positive of road B. So, the differing roads are both A and B. So according to our approach, the answer is 2. But can you cross road A and B in two steps. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if there is a scenario where you can cross a road that isn't in the differing set? For example, suppose there are three roads. Home and university differ in two roads, but there's a third road that can be crossed to reach the destination in fewer steps. But that seems impossible. Because crossing a road that doesn't separate home and university would not change the sign for that road. So, for example, if you cross a road that doesn't separate them, then after crossing, you are in a block that is different from the original. But how does that help?\n\nWait, let's say home and university differ in two roads. Suppose there's a third road that is not separating them. If you cross that road, you flip the sign for that road. But since that road wasn't separating them, the new sign would be different. But then, you would have to cross more roads to reach the university. So, it's not helpful. Therefore, the minimal steps is indeed the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where home and university are on opposite sides of the road. Therefore, the code is straightforward.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead x1, y1 and x2, y2.\n\nRead n roads.\n\nFor each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). Multiply them. If the product is negative, increment the count.\n\nOutput the count.\n\nBut wait, why is that correct? Because each road that separates the two points must be crossed once. And each such road contributes exactly one step. Because each step crosses one road. So the minimal steps is the number of such roads.\n\nBut why can't there be a path that crosses some roads multiple times, leading to a shorter path? For example, maybe crossing a road twice, but that would not be useful. Because crossing a road twice would take you back to the original side. So that would not help.\n\nSo the minimal steps is indeed the count of roads that separate the two points.\n\nThis seems too easy. But the sample inputs support this. Also, the problem's note says that it's a very hard question. So perhaps there's a mistake in this reasoning?\n\nWait, let's think of a case where the home and university are separated by zero roads. That is, they are in the same block. Then, the answer is zero steps. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother example: suppose there's one road. The home is on one side, the university on the other. Then, answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: two roads, but the home and university are separated by both roads. Then answer is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the two points are separated by three roads, but there's a way to cross two roads and reach the university? How?\n\nWait, suppose that the home and university are in regions that are separated by three roads, but the regions are connected via a path that crosses two roads. How?\n\nBut according to the earlier reasoning, that's not possible. Because each road that separates the home and university must be crossed. Because if you have a road that separates them, then any path from home to university must cross that road. Because otherwise, the home and university are on the same side of that road. So, if there's a road that separates them, then any path must cross it once. Thus, the number of roads that separate them is the minimal steps.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the answer is the number of roads where home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nTherefore, the code is straightforward. Let's proceed to code this.\n\nNow, coding in Python:\n\nRead the input. The first line is x1, y1. Second line is x2, y2. Third line is n. Then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nFor each of the n roads, compute s1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c. s2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If s1 * s2 < 0, then count +=1.\n\nFinally, print count.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So, s1 and s2 cannot be zero. So, no need to handle that case.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward.\n\nLet's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor first road: a=0, b=1, c=0.\n\ns1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1.\n\ns2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1. 1 * (-1) = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=1, b=0, c=0.\n\ns1 = 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1.\n\ns2 = 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2 → output 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nRoad 1: a=1, b=0, c=0 → s1 = 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1. s2 = 1*(-1) +0 +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: a=0, b=1, c=0 → s1= 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. s2= 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad3: a=1, b=1, c=-3. s1 = 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. s2 = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no count. So total is 2 → output 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for samples.\n\nBut why is this problem considered hard? Maybe the original problem is more complex, but perhaps the actual problem is as simple as this. But according to the problem description, the answer is the number of roads separating the two points.\n\nBut why is the problem's note saying it's very hard? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem says that the movement is allowed between blocks if they share a common border. So, two blocks are adjacent if they share a common border. But the way we model the problem is that each road that separates the home and university must be crossed once. But how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads?\n\nBut according to the problem's model, each time you cross a road, you move to an adjacent block. So, if you cross a road that separates the two points, you can reach the destination in steps equal to the number of such roads.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is not that straightforward. Let me think of a case where two points are separated by two roads, but the minimal steps is 1. How?\n\nSuppose there are two roads that are parallel. The home is on one side of both roads, and the university is on the other side of both. So, the two roads are parallel. So, the home and university are separated by both roads. According to our approach, the answer is 2. But is there a way to cross one road and reach the university? No. Because the two roads are parallel, so the regions between them are separated by each road. So, to get from the home to the university, you have to cross both roads. So, the answer is indeed 2.\n\nAnother example: two roads that cross each other. The home is in a region that is on the positive side of both roads. The university is on the negative side of both roads. So, the minimal steps is 2. Because you have to cross both roads. So, the answer is 2.\n\nBut what if the home and university are on opposite sides of one road, but same side of others. Then answer is 1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code is straightforward. So why is the problem considered hard? Maybe the original problem was different, but according to the problem statement, this approach is correct.\n\nSo, the code is as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of the n roads:\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nBut wait, let's check the problem statement again. The problem says that the home and university are not located on any road. So, s1 and s2 can't be zero. So, the code is safe.\n\nSo, the code should work. But why is the problem considered hard? Maybe there was a misunderstanding in the problem. For example, perhaps the problem requires considering that some roads may be redundant, but according to the problem statement, the answer is the count.\n\nBut according to the sample inputs, the code works. So perhaps this is the correct solution.\n\nSo, the Python code is straightforward. Now, let's code it.\n\nBut the input is read as follows. For example, in the first sample input, the input is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, but the input is given as a list of strings. But in reality, the input comes from stdin. So, the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut the user provided the input as a list of strings, but in practice, the code should read from standard input. So, the code will read the first line as x1, y1, then the second line as x2, y2, then n, then n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nSo, the Python code is:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if s1 * s2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nBut let me check for possible errors. For example, when a and b are zero? But the problem says that for each road, ai and bi are not both zero. So, the line is valid.\n\nBut in the code, we don't need to handle that. Because the code just computes s1 and s2. Even if a and b are zero, but since the problem says that ai and bi are not both zero, so each line is a valid line.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block to a target block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves crossing a road, and the minimum number of steps is determined by the number of roads that separate the starting and target blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be reduced to checking how many roads separate the starting point (home) from the target point (university). Each road divides the plane into two regions, and if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move between these regions.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, we check if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. This can be determined by evaluating the sign of the linear equation defining the road for both points. If the signs differ, the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Read the coordinates of the home and university.\n   - Read the number of roads and their coefficients.\n   - For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university points.\n   - Count the number of roads where the signs of these values differ, indicating the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        s1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        s2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if s1 * s2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n- **Sign Check**: For each road, the values of the linear equation at the home and university points are computed. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates the points are on opposite sides of the road, thus requiring a crossing.\n- **Counting Crossings**: The number of such roads is counted and printed as the result, which represents the minimum number of steps needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
