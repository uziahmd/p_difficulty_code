His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores for all participants, but they are not linked to names. So, we have to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each participant has exactly one a and one b, right? Wait, no. Wait, the input gives two lists: the second line is a1...an for the first tour, third line is b1...bn for the second tour. But the participants are in arbitrary order. Oh right, but each participant has one a and one b. But the problem says that the teacher has the results of both tours, but the problem is that the results have only points, no names. So, the teacher needs to find Vasya's possible best and worst place.\n\nWait, but how are the participants' a and b values paired? Because the way they are given is arbitrary. For example, for the first sample input, all a's are 1 and all b's are 1. So each participant's total is 2. So Vasya's total is at least x=2. So he could be in any position, since all have same sum. So best is 1, worst is 5.\n\nBut for the second sample input, the a's are [4,3,5,6,4,4], and b's are [8,6,0,4,3,4]. So the possible pairings are such that for each participant, their a and b are from the respective lists. But the teacher doesn't know which a and b belong to which participant. So, when considering the possible rankings, we can arrange the pairs (a_i, b_j) in any way as long as each a is used once and each b is used once. Wait, no. Wait, each participant has exactly one a and one b. So the actual pairing is a permutation. For example, the original data is that for each participant, there is an a_i and a b_i. But the problem says that the teacher has the lists of a's and b's in arbitrary order. So the teacher doesn't know which a_i belongs to which b_i. So when trying to find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya, we have to consider all possible ways of matching the a's and b's into pairs (each a is matched with exactly one b, and vice versa), and then for each such possible pairing, compute Vasya's possible total (which is at least x). But how do we model that?\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So, in the best case scenario, we want to maximize his rank (i.e., make him as high as possible). To find the best possible rank, we need to find the scenario where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. Wait, no. Wait, the best possible rank is the highest position he can get. So for that, we need to arrange the pairings such that his total is as high as possible, and others are arranged so that as many as possible have higher totals than him. Or maybe the other way around.\n\nWait, no. Let's think about it. The best possible rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible. Because if his total is higher than others, he gets a better rank. But since the problem states that Vasya's total is at least x, but the actual total could be higher. So for the best possible rank, we can choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya (so that he can have the highest possible sum, thus possibly getting first place). But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So, when considering possible pairings, we need to have at least one pair (a_i + b_j) >=x. But the problem says that it's guaranteed that such a pair exists.\n\nBut for the purposes of calculating the best and worst possible ranks, we need to imagine that Vasya's actual total is some value that is at least x. However, the way the problem is structured, the best and worst possible ranks are determined by choosing the best and worst possible scenarios for Vasya's total and the others.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to maximize the number of participants that have a total less than or equal to Vasya's total. Wait, no. Wait, the best rank is when Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are arranged to have as few people as possible with higher totals. So, to find the best possible rank, we need to select a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and then count how many people have a higher total than him. But how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of it this way: for the best possible rank, we can assign Vasya's a and b to be the pair that gives the maximum possible sum (so that he has the highest possible total). Then, in that scenario, the number of people with higher totals would be zero (if his sum is the maximum possible). But how to find that maximum possible sum?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible ranks that Vasya could have, given that his total is at least x. So, the teacher can choose any possible pairing of a's and b's, as long as there exists at least one pair (for Vasya) that sums to at least x. But the teacher is trying to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, considering all possible pairings where there's at least one pair (for Vasya) with sum >=x.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem is that Vasya is one of the participants, and the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the actual total could be higher. So for the best possible rank, the teacher can assume that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and arrange the other participants' pairings to minimize his rank. Wait, no. For example, if Vasya's total is the maximum possible, then he would get first place. So for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But that's not always the case. Because maybe even when you maximize his total, there are other participants with the same total. But since the jury can assign the ranks arbitrarily, then Vasya could be first.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But that's only if there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum possible. But how to confirm that?\n\nWait, no. Let's think of the first sample input. All participants have a total of 2. So in that case, the best possible rank is 1, and worst is 5. Because the jury can assign the ranks as they like.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. Because the teacher can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's total is the maximum possible (so that he's first). But how can we ensure that?\n\nWait, but what if there's another participant that can have a higher total than Vasya's maximum possible total? For example, suppose that the maximum possible sum for Vasya is S, but there's another participant who can have a sum of S+1. Then, in that case, the best possible rank for Vasya is 2.\n\nWait, but how do we find the maximum possible sum for Vasya?\n\nAh, here's the key. Since we can pair the a's and b's in any way, for the best possible rank, we can choose the pairing where Vasya's a_i and b_j are chosen such that their sum is as high as possible. Then, for the other participants, their pairings are arranged in such a way that their sum is as low as possible. Wait, but how?\n\nBut the problem is that the pairing is a one-to-one mapping between a's and b's. So, for example, if we want to maximize Vasya's sum, we need to pair the maximum a with the maximum b. Then, the sum would be a_max + b_max. However, this may not be possible because the rest of the pairings will affect the other participants' totals.\n\nBut for the purpose of determining the best possible rank, perhaps the approach is to maximize Vasya's total (so that he can have the highest possible sum), and then count how many participants have a sum higher than that. But how can we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it like this: to find the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya has the maximum possible total sum. Then, the best rank he can get is 1 if there's no other participant that can have a higher sum than that. Otherwise, it depends on how many people can have higher sums.\n\nBut how do we find the maximum possible sum for Vasya?\n\nWell, the maximum possible sum is when we pair the largest a with the largest b. So, if we sort the a array in descending order, and the b array in descending order, then pair them in the same order, that would give the maximum possible sum for each participant. So, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is a_max + b_max.\n\nBut wait, but in this case, the sum of all participants' pairs would be the maximum possible. However, for the best possible rank, we need to arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as large as possible, and other participants' sums are as small as possible. But how can we arrange that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible (so that he's as high as possible), and then count how many other participants have a sum greater than or equal to that. But how?\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me think about the problem again. The problem says that for the best possible rank, we can arrange the pairings in a way that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. For example, if we can choose Vasya's sum to be the maximum possible, then the best rank is 1 (since no one else can have a higher sum than him). But how to check if that's possible.\n\nWait, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is when he gets the maximum a and maximum b. But in that case, the other participants would have their a's and b's paired in a way that their sums are as low as possible. But how does that affect the other participants' sums?\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that regardless of how we pair the other participants, the best possible rank for Vasya is determined by the maximum sum he can have, and how many others can have a sum greater than or equal to that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the following:\n\nTo find the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's sum is as high as possible. Then, the minimal possible rank is 1. Because the jury can arrange the participants with the same sum as Vasya to be placed after him. Wait, but the problem says that if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can assign places as they choose. So for the best possible rank, we can arrange that Vasya is first, even if others have the same sum. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut why in the first sample input, the best possible rank is 1. Which makes sense. But what if there are other participants that have higher sums than the maximum possible sum for Vasya?\n\nWait, that's impossible. Because the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum possible sum of any participant. Because if you pair a_i and b_j in such a way that Vasya's sum is a_i + b_j, which is the maximum possible (a_max + b_max), then no other participant can have a higher sum than that. Because all other participants are paired with other a's and b's. So for example, if you pair the maximum a with the maximum b, then the next a and next b would be paired, etc. So that gives the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut that can't be right. Let's take an example. Suppose n=2, x=0. a = [5, 0], b = [5, 0]. So the maximum possible sum for Vasya is 5+5=10. But the other participant would have 0+0=0. So in this case, Vasya's best possible rank is 1.\n\nAnother example: n=2, x=0. a = [5, 5], b = [5, 5]. Then, the maximum sum for Vasya is 10, and the other participant's sum is also 10. So the best possible rank is 1, because the jury can assign him first.\n\nSo in all cases, the best possible rank is 1. But that contradicts the second sample input. Wait, in the second sample input, the output is 1 for best. Which aligns with this reasoning.\n\nWait, but then why in the first sample input, the output is 1 for best. So according to this reasoning, the best possible rank is always 1. But that seems to contradict the problem statement's note where in the first sample, the best is 1. So maybe that's correct.\n\nBut then why is the problem asking for the best possible rank? Because it's always 1. But that can't be right. What if the maximum sum for Vasya is not possible?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that there exists at least one pair (a_i + b_j) >=x. So for the best possible scenario, we can choose that pair to be the maximum possible sum. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut then why is the problem even asking for the best possible rank? Because it's always 1. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst place Vasya could have won. The total results' table sorts participants by sum of points. If two or more have same sum, the jury can assign places as they choose.\n\nSo for the best possible place, Vasya can be placed as high as possible. So the best possible is 1. Because the jury can assign him first even if others have same sum. So the best possible rank is always 1. Unless there's a case where even the maximum possible sum for Vasya is not enough to be first. But how?\n\nNo, because the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum possible sum among all participants. Because if you pair the maximum a and maximum b for Vasya, then the other participants are paired with lower a and/or b. So their sum can't be higher than that. Therefore, Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Hence, he can be placed first.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. Which would explain why the first sample output is 1. And the second sample's best is also 1.\n\nThen, why does the problem ask for the best possible rank? It must be that I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that Vasya's sum is at least x, but not necessarily equal to the maximum possible sum. For example, suppose that the maximum possible sum is S, but Vasya's sum can be S (if he takes that pair), but the problem says that his sum is at least x. So for the best possible rank, we can choose that he has the maximum possible sum. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is always 1. Unless there's a case where even the maximum sum is less than x. But the problem says that it is guaranteed that there is at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, in that case, the maximum sum is at least x. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nHmm. Then why does the problem have the first sample output as 1 5? Because in that case, the best is 1 and worst is 5.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. So how to compute the worst possible rank?\n\nNow, the worst possible rank is when Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and as many other participants as possible have a higher sum than him.\n\nSo to compute the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum higher than Vasya's sum, given that his sum is at least x.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nSo for the worst case, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other pairings to maximize the number of participants with higher sums than him.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think. For the worst case, we need to choose a sum s for Vasya such that s >=x, and then find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >s. Then, the worst rank is that number + 1 (because if k participants have higher sum than him, he is ranked k+1).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible s (>=x) such that the maximum number of participants can have sum >s. But how to find this s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst case is when Vasya's sum is exactly x, and as many other participants as possible have a sum >x. So the worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have a sum >x plus 1.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nBut how do we find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >x, given that Vasya's sum is at least x.\n\nBut how to model the pairing of a and b to maximize the number of participants with sum >x, while ensuring that Vasya's sum is at least x.\n\nWait, but for the worst possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is exactly x. Because if we can have a scenario where his sum is x and others have as many as possible higher than x, then that would give the worst possible rank.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >x, given that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) that sums to >=x (which is guaranteed).\n\nBut how to compute that maximum number?\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where we want to pair a_i and b_j such that as many pairs as possible have a_i + b_j > x. But we also need to ensure that there is at least one pair that is >=x (but since the problem guarantees that, perhaps we don't need to worry about that).\n\nWait, but for the worst case, we need to arrange the pairings such that the number of participants with sum >x is as large as possible, and Vasya's sum is exactly x. But how?\n\nBut how to find the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >x. Once we find that number, then the worst possible rank is that number +1 (since Vasya's sum is x, and those participants have higher sum, so he is ranked after them).\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >x?\n\nThis is a classic problem. Let me think. For example, to maximize the number of pairs with a_i + b_j > x, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then pair them. Or perhaps the other way around.\n\nWait, the standard approach for maximizing the number of pairs with a_i + b_j > x is to sort one array in ascending and the other in descending, then greedily pair the smallest a with the largest b, etc.\n\nWait, here's the idea. Sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then for each a_i, find the first b_j that when paired with a_i, their sum is >x. Then, we can pair them and proceed.\n\nBut I think the standard way is to sort a in ascending and b in ascending, then use two pointers. For example:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, for the maximum number of pairs with a_i + b_j >x, we can use a two-pointer approach. Start with i=0 (smallest a) and j =n-1 (largest b). If a[i] +b[j] >x, then this pair can be counted, and we move i up and j down. Else, we move i up. This way, we find the maximum number of pairs possible.\n\nYes, that's the standard approach. Let me think again. Suppose we have sorted a in ascending and b in ascending. We want to find the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j >x. The two-pointer approach works as follows:\n\nInitialize i=0 (start of a), j =n-1 (end of b). Count=0.\n\nWhile i <n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >x:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nThis gives the maximum number of pairs possible. Because for each a[i], we try to pair it with the largest possible b[j] that can make the sum exceed x. If it can't, then we move to the next a[i].\n\nSo, applying this approach, we can find the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >x.\n\nBut in our problem, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >x. Because then, if Vasya's sum is x, he would be ranked after all of them. So the worst possible rank is that count +1.\n\nBut wait, how do we ensure that there is at least one pair that is >=x. Well, the problem says that it is guaranteed.\n\nBut in our case, when we compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >x, then adding Vasya's pair (which is >=x) may be part of that count. Wait, no. Because in the scenario where we want to maximize the number of pairs with sum >x, we can have that. However, if Vasya's sum is x, then he is not part of that count. So how to model this?\n\nWait, the problem says that Vasya is one of the participants. So, when considering the worst possible rank, we need to choose a pairing where:\n\n- There is at least one pair (Vasya's) with sum >=x.\n\n- The number of other participants with sum >x is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFind the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >x. Then, the worst possible rank is that number +1 (assuming that Vasya's sum is x, and he is not counted in that number). However, if the maximum number of pairs with sum >x is m, then there are m participants with sum >x, and Vasya's sum is x. Thus, his rank is m+1.\n\nBut how to find that m?\n\nYes, that's the approach. Because for the worst possible scenario, we want as many participants as possible to have sum >x. So, the maximum number of such participants is m. Then, Vasya's sum is x, and he is ranked m+1.\n\nBut how to compute m?\n\nAs discussed earlier, using the two-pointer approach.\n\nBut wait, what if the maximum number of pairs with sum >x is m. However, there might be some pairs that can be arranged to have sum >x, but we need to leave one pair (Vasya's) with sum >=x. How can that be ensured?\n\nBecause in the problem statement, it is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So, even if all other pairs are arranged to have sum >x, there is at least one pair (Vasya's) that can have sum >=x. But how?\n\nWait, the two-pointer approach gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >x. However, when you compute that, you may have used all the possible pairs. But since there exists at least one pair with sum >=x, perhaps that is included in the count.\n\nBut perhaps not. For example, if x is very small, then all pairs can be arranged to have sum >x. Then, the maximum number of pairs with sum >x is n. But Vasya's sum is also part of that. But in that case, the worst possible rank would be n+1? Which is impossible. Wait, no. Because if all participants have sum >x, then Vasya's sum is >=x, which is also >x (if x is not equal to the sum). Wait, no. If x is 2 and all participants have sum 3, then Vasya's sum is 3 >=2. So, all participants have sum >x (since 3>2). Then, the worst possible rank would be n, because there are n-1 participants with sum >x (since Vasya is one of them). Wait, but if all participants have sum >x, then the maximum number of participants with sum >x is n. But Vasya is one of them. So, in that case, the worst possible rank would be n (since he is tied with others, but the jury can put him last).\n\nSo, in this case, the worst possible rank is n.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think again. The maximum number of participants that can have sum >x is m. Then, the worst possible rank is m + 1 if Vasya's sum is <=x. But in our case, Vasya's sum is at least x. So if m is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >x, then:\n\nIf Vasya's sum is x, then there are m participants with sum >x. So his rank is m+1.\n\nBut if Vasya's sum is >x, then there are m participants with sum >x, but he is one of them. So his rank depends on how many others are higher than him.\n\nBut this complicates things. However, for the worst possible rank, we want to maximize the number of participants that have sum >x. Because even if Vasya's sum is >x, but there are many others with higher sum, his rank would be worse.\n\nWait, but how can we arrange for that? For example, if we can have m participants with sum >x, and Vasya's sum is the minimal possible among them (say, just over x), then the number of participants with sum >x is m, and Vasya is one of them. So his rank is m +1 (if there are others with sum equal to his, but the jury can arrange him to be last).\n\nBut this seems complex. However, perhaps the worst possible rank is the maximum between (m + 1) and (the number of participants with sum >=x, etc.), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is (number of participants with sum >x) + 1. Because even if Vasya's sum is x, then there are (number of participants with sum >x) participants above him. But if his sum is higher than x, but there are more participants with sum higher than him, then the worst possible rank would be that number +1.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nThe key insight here is that to find the worst possible rank, we need to maximize the number of participants that have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum. Since Vasya's sum is at least x, we can choose his sum to be x (the minimal possible) to maximize the number of participants with sum >x. Because if his sum is higher than x, then some participants with sum >x may be less than his sum, but by setting his sum to x, we allow the maximum number of participants to have sum >x.\n\nTherefore, the approach is to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >x. Let's call this m. Then, the worst possible rank is m + 1.\n\nBut how to compute m?\n\nAs discussed before, using the two-pointer approach to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >x.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe best possible rank is 1.\n\nThe worst possible rank is m + 1, where m is the maximum number of pairs with sum >x.\n\nBut how to compute m?\n\nLet me take the first sample input. The first sample input is:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nSo, for each pair, sum is 2. So the maximum number of pairs with sum >x is 0. So m=0. Then worst rank is 0 +1 =1? But the sample output is 5. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, this suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. So what's wrong here?\n\nIn the first sample input, the worst possible rank is 5. But according to the calculation, m is zero, so the worst rank is 0 +1 =1. Which is wrong. So clearly, my approach is incorrect.\n\nSo where is the mistake here?\n\nAh! Because when all participants have sum equal to x (in this case, 2), then the maximum number of participants with sum >x is zero. So according to the previous approach, the worst possible rank would be 0 +1 =1. But in reality, the worst possible rank is 5, because all participants have the same sum. So the jury can assign Vasya the last place.\n\nSo, the mistake is that in this case, when all participants have sum equal to x, then the worst possible rank is n (since all have the same sum, and the jury can assign him last). But according to the previous approach, it would be 0 +1 =1.\n\nSo, the previous approach is incorrect. Therefore, I need to rethink the problem.\n\nLet me think again. The worst possible rank depends on two factors:\n\n1. How many participants have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum.\n\n2. How many participants have a sum equal to Vasya's sum.\n\nBecause if there are k participants with sum >Vasya's sum, and l participants with sum equal to Vasya's sum, then the worst possible rank is k + l. Because the jury can assign Vasya to be after all the k participants and after all the l-1 participants with the same sum.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nSo, for the worst possible rank, we need to maximize the number of participants that have sum >= Vasya's sum. But Vasya's sum is at least x. However, to maximize the number of participants with sum >= Vasya's sum, we need to choose Vasya's sum to be as small as possible (so that more participants can have sum >= it).\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nTo find the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >= s, where s is Vasya's sum (which is at least x). The worst rank would then be that number.\n\nBut how to find s and the maximum number of participants with sum >=s.\n\nBut since we can choose s to be as small as possible (but at least x), this would maximize the number of participants with sum >=s.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s, where s is the minimal possible value (x) that satisfies that there exists at least one pair (for Vasya) with sum >=x.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFind the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=x. Then, the worst possible rank is that number.\n\nBecause in that scenario, Vasya's sum is x, and there are that many participants with sum >=x, so he can be placed last among them.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=x.\n\nBut this is similar to the previous problem, but instead of counting pairs with sum >x, we count pairs with sum >=x.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum number.\n\nAgain, using a two-pointer approach.\n\nLet me think. For example, in the first sample input, all pairs have sum 2, which is equal to x. So the maximum number of participants with sum >=x is 5. So the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nIn the second sample input, x=7. Let's see.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=6, x=7.\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=7.\n\nHow?\n\nTo maximize the number of participants with sum >=7, we can pair the a and b arrays optimally.\n\nLet me think. How to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x.\n\nThe approach is similar to the previous one. Let me think of the two-pointer approach again.\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then for each a_i, pair it with the largest possible b_j that can make the sum >=x. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, sort a in ascending, sort b in ascending, then use two pointers.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think of the standard approach for maximum number of pairs with sum >=x.\n\nLet me think of the two-pointer approach again.\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i=0 (start of a), j =n-1 (end of b). count=0.\n\nWhile i <n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >=x:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nThis approach tries to pair the smallest a with the largest b. If their sum is >=x, then we take this pair and move on. Else, we move to the next a.\n\nThis should give the maximum possible number of pairs with sum >=x.\n\nLet me test this with the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1: a and b are all 1s. x=2.\n\nsorted a: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nsorted b: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\ni=0, j=4. a[0]+b[4] = 2 >=2 → count=1, i=1, j=3.\n\na[1]+b[3] = 2 → count=2, i=2, j=2.\n\na[2]+b[2] = 2 → count=3, i=3, j=1.\n\na[3]+b[1] = 2 → count=4, i=4, j=0.\n\na[4]+b[0] = 2 → count=5. So total count is 5. Which is correct. Hence, the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nIn the second sample input, x=7.\n\na is [4,3,5,6,4,4]. Let's sort a in ascending order: [3,4,4,4,5,6].\n\nb is [8,6,0,4,3,4]. sorted in ascending order: [0,3,4,4,6,8].\n\nNow, apply the two-pointer approach:\n\ni=0 (a=3), j=5 (b=8). 3+8=11 >=7 → count=1. i=1, j=4.\n\na=4, b=6 → 4+6=10 ≥7 → count=2. i=2, j=3.\n\na=4, b=4 → 8 ≥7 → count=3. i=3, j=2.\n\na=4, b=4 → 8 ≥7 → count=4. i=4, j=1.\n\na=5, b=3 → 5+3=8 ≥7 → count=5. i=5, j=0.\n\na=6, b=0 → 6+0=6 <7 → i increments to 6, loop ends.\n\nTotal count is 5.\n\nSo the maximum number of participants with sum >=x is 5. Hence, the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >=x, which is computed by the two-pointer approach.\n\nWait, but in this case, the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x is 5. So the worst possible rank is 5. Which is correct.\n\nBut how does this relate to the previous example where all pairs are equal to x?\n\nIn that case, the count is n, and the worst possible rank is n.\n\nSo the conclusion is:\n\nThe best possible rank is always 1.\n\nThe worst possible rank is the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >=x, which is found by the two-pointer approach.\n\nWait, but why? Because if there are m pairs with sum >=x, then Vasya is one of them, and the jury can arrange him to be the last among them. Hence, his rank is m.\n\nBut in the first sample input, m=5, and the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches.\n\nIn the second sample input, m=5, and the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: n=2, x=0, a=[5,0], b=[5,0]. sorted a is [0,5], sorted b is [0,5]. two-pointer approach:\n\ni=0, j=1. 0+5=5 >=0 → count=1. i=1, j=0. 5+0=5 >=0 → count=2. So m=2. Worst possible rank is 2. Which makes sense, because Vasya can be placed second.\n\nBut if x=0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to determine these ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: The best possible rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. This is because we can always pair his scores such that his total is the highest possible, allowing him to be placed first regardless of other participants' scores.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we need to maximize the number of participants who can have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's minimum total score (x). This is achieved using a two-pointer technique:\n   - Sort the scores from the first tour in ascending order.\n   - Sort the scores from the second tour in ascending order.\n   - Use two pointers to count the maximum number of valid pairs where the sum of scores is at least x. This count gives us the worst possible rank as it represents the maximum number of participants who could have a score greater than or equal to Vasya's minimum score.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        print(\"1 1\")\n        return\n    n, x = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Best rank is always 1\n    best = 1\n    \n    # Calculate worst rank\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    count = 0\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] >= x:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    worst = count\n    \n    print(f\"{best} {worst}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of participants, Vasya's minimum total score, and the scores from the two tours.\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: The best rank is always 1 because we can always pair Vasya's scores to be the highest possible.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: Using the two-pointer technique on sorted arrays of scores from both tours, we determine the maximum number of participants who can have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's minimum score. This count gives the worst possible rank as it represents the maximum number of participants that could be ranked higher or equal to Vasya, allowing the jury to place him last among them.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute both the best and worst possible ranks using sorting and a two-pointer technique, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
