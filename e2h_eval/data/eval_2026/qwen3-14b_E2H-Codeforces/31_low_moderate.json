Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The original cards are given, and the new cards can be any integers between -x and x, inclusive. Each new card can be any of those numbers, but we need to find the minimal count.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let me think: the sum of the new cards should be equal to -S. Now, I need to find the minimal number of cards required to achieve this sum, given that each card can contribute between -x and x.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given a target sum T (which is -S), find the minimal number of cards needed such that their sum is T, with each card's value between -x and x.\n\nBut how do I find that minimal number?\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. For example, if T is zero, then no cards are needed. But if T is non-zero, then what?\n\nLet me think of the maximum possible sum per card. Each card can contribute up to x (if positive) or down to -x. So for the minimal number of cards, we want to use as much as possible the maximum possible per card.\n\nFor example, suppose T is positive. Then, each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards would be ceil(T / x). But wait, since each card can contribute up to x, but maybe there's some remainder. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 5 / 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because two cards can contribute 2+2=4, and then one more card of 1. But wait, the maximum per card is 2, but the sum can be achieved with 3 cards. However, the problem is that the sum of the new cards must be exactly T. So for T positive, the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). Similarly for T negative, it's ceil( |T| / x ), because each card can contribute up to x in absolute value. Wait, but for negative T, the same logic applies. For example, if T is -5 and x is 2, then we need to get a sum of -5. Each card can contribute at most -2. So the minimal number is ceil(5/2) = 3 cards. Because 3 * (-2) is -6, which is less than -5. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take T as the target sum. Let me consider the absolute value of T. Let me call it abs_T. The minimal number of cards required is the minimal k such that k * x >= abs_T. Because each card can contribute up to x in the direction needed. For example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute x. So the total sum would be k*x. But we need k*x >= T. The minimal k is ceil(T/x). Similarly for negative T, the same applies. Because the absolute value is the same. So the minimal k is ceil( abs_T / x ). But wait, let's test some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nOriginal cards are -1, 1, 2. Their sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So the target sum for the new cards is -2. So abs_T is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 is 1. So the minimal number is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second example: input is -2 and -2. Sum is -4. So T is 4. x is 3. So abs_T is 4. 4 /3 is 1.333..., so ceil is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to work. So the formula is: compute T = -sum_of_found_cards. If T is zero, answer is 0. Else, compute the minimal k where k is the ceiling of (abs(T)/x). But wait, let me think about other possibilities.\n\nWait, what if T is 3 and x is 2. Then, abs_T is 3. x is 2. So 3/2 is 1.5, ceil is 2. So 2 cards. For example, 2 + 1. But each card can be up to 2. So yes, two cards: 2 and 1. So that's possible. So the minimal is 2. Which is correct.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the newly found ones) equals zero. The solution involves calculating the current sum of the found cards and then determining the minimum number of additional cards required to balance this sum to zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: Compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the minimum number of cards required such that their sum can reach the target sum. This is done by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value on a card (x), and taking the ceiling of this division to ensure we account for any remainder.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        arr = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        total = sum(arr)\n        target = -total\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        abs_target = abs(target)\n        min_cards = math.ceil(abs_target / x)\n        print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. Each line is processed to extract the number of cards, the maximum absolute value on a card, and the list of numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum for the new cards is the negative of this sum.\n3. **Handling Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: For non-zero targets, the minimum number of cards required is determined by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value on a card (x), using ceiling division to ensure we account for any remainder. This ensures we use the minimum number of cards to achieve the required sum.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of found cards, ensuring it handles all edge cases effectively.",
