Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And we need to output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles in a regular polygon work. Let me recall some geometry here. A regular n-gon has all internal angles equal. Wait, but the problem isn't about the internal angles of the polygon itself. Instead, it's about choosing three vertices and forming an angle at one of them. So for example, in a square (n=4), if you pick three consecutive vertices, the angle at the middle one is 90 degrees. But if you pick vertices that are not adjacent, maybe the angle changes.\n\nLet me think: For a regular polygon, the central angles are 360/n degrees. But when considering angles formed by three vertices, perhaps there's a formula to calculate that angle based on the number of sides between the points.\n\nLet me consider the case where the three points are v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the vertex of the angle. Suppose that between v1 and v2 there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are m steps clockwise. But since the polygon is regular and convex, maybe the actual positions are determined by the number of edges between the points. However, since the polygon is regular, the angle depends on how many vertices are skipped between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3.\n\nWait, but for the angle at v2, perhaps the key is how many steps between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. However, since the polygon is regular, the angle might depend on the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. But maybe there's a way to model this.\n\nLet me think about the regular polygon inscribed in a circle. All vertices lie on a circle. The angle at v2 would be an inscribed angle. For example, if we have three points A, B, C on a circle, then the angle ABC is determined by the arcs AC. Wait, the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of the arc AC that doesn't contain B. Or wait, maybe it's half the measure of the arc that is opposite to the angle. Let me recall that in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended at the circumference is half the central angle. So for example, if points A, B, C are on a circle, then the angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B.\n\nSo, in the regular polygon, each vertex is equally spaced around the circle. Let's say that between v1 and v2, there are k steps (i.e., there are k edges between them along the perimeter). Similarly, between v2 and v3, there are m steps. But since the polygon is convex and regular, the angle at v2 depends on the arc that's opposite to it. Wait, perhaps for the angle at v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2. Let me think.\n\nSuppose that in the regular n-gon, the vertices are placed on a circle. Let's take v2 as the vertex of the angle. Then, the angle at v2 depends on the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Let me imagine that. If I have v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between them along the arc that doesn't pass through v2, then the central angle for that arc is (k * 360/n) degrees. Then, the inscribed angle at v2 would be half of that. Wait, no. Because the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc that it subtends. So if the arc from v1 to v3 (not passing through v2) is x degrees, then the angle at v2 is x/2 degrees.\n\nBut how do we find x? Well, if v1 and v3 are separated by (k) steps along the arc that doesn't pass through v2, then the central angle for that arc is (k * 360/n) degrees. Therefore, the angle at v2 is (k * 360 / n) / 2 = (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nWait, but how to determine k here? Because for the angle at v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 must be determined. Let's say that between v1 and v2, there are m steps in one direction, and between v2 and v3, there are l steps in the same direction. Then, the total steps between v1 and v3 along that direction would be m + l.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the closest possible angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} $. For an angle formed at a vertex $ v_2 $ by points $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $, the angle can be determined based on the arc subtended by $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ that does not include $ v_2 $.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle at $ v_2 $ is half the measure of the arc subtended by $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $. This leads to the formula for the angle at $ v_2 $: $ \\theta = \\frac{(k \\times 180)}{n} $, where $ k $ is the number of steps between $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ along the arc that does not pass through $ v_2 $.\n3. **Optimal k Calculation**: We need to find the value of $ k $ such that the angle $ \\theta $ is closest to the given angle `a`. This involves checking values of $ k $ around the calculated optimal value and selecting the closest valid one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import math\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Calculate the angle for each possible k\n    # The angle at v2 is (k * 180) / n, but k must be such that there are at least 1 step between v1 and v2 and v2 and v3\n    # So k ranges from 1 to n-2 (since v1 and v3 must be distinct and not adjacent to v2)\n    # Wait, no.

Or any, as per problem statement\n            if k < best_k_final:\n                best_k_final = k\n\n    # Now, we have best_k_final.

Because the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is k_final.\n\n    # For example, if v2 is vertex 2, then v1 could be vertex 1, and v3 could be vertex 1 + k_final + 1?\n    # Let me think: If v2 is vertex 2, then to have k steps between v1 and v3 not passing through v2, we can take v1 as 1, and v3 as 1 + k + 1 = k + 2.\n    # But this may go beyond n. So we need to wrap around.\n\n    # To make it simple, let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k_final.\n    # But when adding, we need to mod by n to wrap around.\n\n    # However, for the case where k_final is 1, the angle is (1 * 180)/n degrees.\n    # So for example, in a triangle (n=3), k can only be 1, which gives 60 degrees.\n\n    # Let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as (2 + k_final) % n\n    # But wait, in a polygon with n vertices, the positions are 1-based. So if v2 is 1, then v1 can be 2 and v3 can be 2 + k_final.\n    # However, if 2 + k_final exceeds n, we wrap around.

If 2 + k_final > n, then v3 = 2 + k_final - n.\n\n    # Let's test with n=4 and k_final=2. Then v1 is 2, v3 is 2+2=4. Which is correct, since in square, the angle at 1 with v1=2 and v3=4 would be 90 degrees.\n\n    # So the code for choosing the vertices would be:\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = v1 + best_k_final\n    if v3 > n:\n        v3 -= n\n    # But wait, for example, if n=4, k_final=2, v1=2, v3=4. That's correct.\n\n    # However, another possibility is that v3 could be v2 - k_final steps, but since we want to avoid wrapping, maybe it's better to just use the above method.\n\n    # However, there's a problem if v3 equals v2 or v1. So need to ensure that v1, v2, v3 are distinct.\n\n    # But since k_final is between 1 and n-2, and v1 is 2, v3 will be at least 3 (if k_final=1) and at most n-2 + 2 = n. So when k_final is n-2, v3 is 2 + n-2 = n. Which is valid.\n\n    # Therefore, the vertices would be 2, 1, and (2 + best_k_final) if <=n, else (2 + best_k_final - n). But since best_k_final is up to n-2, 2 + (n-2) = n. So no need to subtract n.\n\n    # So v3 is 2 + best_k_final. However, if that's larger than n, subtract n. But since best_k_final is up to n-2, 2 + (n-2) = n, so no.\n\n    # So finally, the answer is v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_k_final.\n\n    # But wait, let's check for n=4 and best_k_final=2: 2+2=4, which is correct.\n\n    # Another example: n=4, best_k_final=1.
