Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The original cards are given, and the new cards can be any integers between -x and x, inclusive. Each new card can be any of those numbers, but we need to find the minimal count.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let me think: for example, if the current sum is 3, then the new cards must add up to -3. The question is, what's the minimal number of cards needed to reach that target sum, given that each card can contribute between -x and x.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: given a target value T (which is -S), find the minimal number of cards needed to sum to T, where each card can contribute between -x and x. But since each card can be any value in that range, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think about the possible approach. For example, if T is zero, then no cards are needed. Otherwise, what's the minimal number of cards?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible contribution per card. Each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, to reach a target T, the minimal number of cards would be determined by how much each card can contribute towards the target.\n\nBut wait, the target could be positive or negative. Let's take absolute value. Let me consider the absolute value of T. Let's say |T| = K. Then, each card can contribute up to x towards this. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(K / x). But wait, maybe not. Because if K is divisible by x, then exactly K/x cards. Otherwise, (K//x) + 1. Wait, for example, if K is 5 and x is 2. Then 5/2 is 2.5, so ceil(2.5) is 3. Which would be 2+2+1? Or maybe 2+2+1? But each card can contribute up to x. So, for example, if K is 5 and x is 2, then 3 cards: 2, 2, 1. But since the maximum per card is 2, but the sum is 5. So yes, 3 cards. So the minimal number is ceil(K / x).\n\nWait, but what if K is 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, so ceil is 2. Which is possible with 2 and 1. So yes. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if T is not zero. But wait, what if T is zero? Then zero cards are needed.\n\nWait, but there's a catch here. Suppose T is 3 and x is 2. So the minimal number of cards is 2. But if T is 3, then you can have one card of 3? Wait no. Because the maximum allowed per card is x. So if x is 2, then each card can contribute at most 2. So 3 can't be achieved with one card. So you need two cards, like 2 + 1. So the minimal number is ceil(3/2) = 2. Which works.\n\nSo the formula is: if the target is T, then the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is zero? Then it's zero cards. So that's the case.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1 is 3 2, with numbers -1, 1, 2. The sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 = 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2: 2 3, numbers -2, -2. Sum is -4. So T is 4. So |T| is 4, x is 3. 4 /3 is 1.333..., ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems to work. So the problem reduces to:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards. Let T be the negative of that sum. Then, if T is zero, answer is zero. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, how to compute that in code?\n\nWait, but in code, how to compute ceil(a / b) when a and b are integers. Well, in Python, you can do (a + b -1) // b. For example, 5 + 2 -1 =6, divided by 2 gives 3. Which is correct. For 3 + 2-1 =4//2=2. Correct. So for |T| divided by x, using that formula.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then, the answer is zero. So the steps are:\n\nCompute sum_S = sum of the given array.\n\ntarget_T = -sum_S\n\nif target_T == 0: return 0\n\nelse:\n\n   compute abs_T = abs(target_T)\n\n   minimal_cards = ceil( abs_T / x )\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nSo in code:\n\nsum_S = sum(arr)\n\ntarget_T = -sum_S\n\nif target_T == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_T = abs(target_T)\n\n    minimal = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(minimal)\n\nWait, but that seems too simple. Are there any edge cases that this misses?\n\nLet me think. For example, if the target_T is 0, then 0 cards. That's correct.\n\nAnother example: target_T is 5, x is 5. Then 5/5 = 1. So one card. Correct.\n\nWhat if target_T is 5, x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666, ceil is 2. (3+3=6, but that's more than 5. Wait, but the problem says that the sum of the new cards must be exactly target_T. So how can we achieve that?\n\nWait, for example, target_T is 5, x is 3. So the minimal number of cards is 2. Because 3 + 2 = 5. But each card can be any integer between -3 and 3. So yes, two cards: 3 and 2. So that's possible. So the formula works.\n\nBut what if target_T is 1, x is 3. Then, 1/3 is 0.333, ceil is 1. Which is correct. One card with 1.\n\nAnother example: target_T is 4, x is 3. Then 4/3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. So two cards. Like 3 and 1. So that's correct.\n\nSo the formula works. So the problem is reduced to this.\n\nBut why does this work? Because each card can contribute up to x towards the target. So the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of the absolute value of the target divided by x.\n\nBut wait, what if the target is negative? Well, since we take absolute value, it's handled.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: sum is -1 + 1 + 2 = 2. target_T is -2. So absolute is 2. x is 2. (2 + 2 -1 ) // 2 → (3)//2 = 1. Correct.\n\nSample 2: sum is -2 + -2 = -4. target_T is 4. x is 3. (4 +3 -1) //3 = 6//3 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is n=1, x=1, and the card is 1. sum is 1. target_T is -1. absolute is 1. x is 1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. So answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x=2. target_T is -3. absolute is 3. (3+2-1)/2 = 4/2=2. So two cards. Which can be 2 and 1. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_S = sum of the list.\n\ntarget_T = -sum_S.\n\nif target_T == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_T = abs(target_T)\n\n    minimal = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(minimal)\n\nWait, but what if x is 0? No, the input constraints say x is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nYes, because the input says x is between 1 and 1000.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says that the numbers on the cards can be from -x to x, inclusive. So for example, if x is 2, the possible numbers are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2. So the maximum possible per card is x, and the minimum is -x.\n\nBut in our approach, we are considering that each card can contribute up to x towards the target. So for example, if the target is positive, we can use cards with value x, and if the target is negative, we can use cards with value -x. But the formula is based on the absolute value. So for example, if the target is 5 and x is 3, then the minimal number of cards is 2. Which would be 3 + 2 (but 2 is allowed, since x is 3). So yes.\n\nBut what if the target is 5 and x is 3. So the sum of the new cards must be 5. So the minimal number of cards is 2. Which is possible with 3 and 2. So yes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute the sum of the given cards, find the target T as the negative of that sum, and then compute the minimal number of cards as ceil(|T| / x), which can be done with the formula (abs_T + x -1) // x.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input, split into n, x, then the list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_S = sum of the list.\n\ntarget_T = -sum_S.\n\nif target_T is zero, output 0.\n\nelse:\n\nabs_T = abs(target_T)\n\nminimal = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\nprint(minimal)\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2. target_T is -2. So abs_T is 2. (2 +2-1) //2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. target_T is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, 1. sum is 1. target_T is -1. abs is 1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 5. So target_T is -5. abs_T is 5. (5 +5-1)/5 = 9//5=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 6, x=5. target_T is -6. abs_T=6. (6 +5-1)/5 = 10//5=2. Which is correct. 5+1=6. So two cards.\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, code in Python.\n\nRead input: first line is n and x. Second line is the list of numbers.\n\nIn Python:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\narr = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_S = sum(arr)\n\ntarget_T = -sum_S\n\nif target_T == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_T = abs(target_T)\n\n    minimal = (abs_T + x -1) // x\n\n    print(minimal)\n\nWait, but what if the sum is zero? For example, input is 2 3, numbers 1 and -1. Then sum is 0. So output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the sum is zero but the target_T is zero. So code returns zero. Correct.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nSo the code is as above.\n\nLet me check the sample input again. The first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2. target_T is -2. So code returns (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. target_T is 4. (4 +3-1) is 6. 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is a given maximum absolute value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum required to balance the found cards to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the ceiling of the division of the absolute value of the target sum by x.
