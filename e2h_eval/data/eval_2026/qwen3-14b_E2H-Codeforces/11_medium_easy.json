A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts each can make, given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (bottles of drink), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, first, calculate how much total drink they have. That's k multiplied by l. Then, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, because each of the n friends needs nl per toast. Wait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends has one toast. So if there are t toasts, total drink needed is t * n * nl. But the total available drink is k*l. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, that's only if we consider drink as the limiting factor.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Total slices available is c*d. So maximum toasts based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt, each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, total is n * np. So maximum toasts based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources must be sufficient. So the total possible toasts is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nWait, but let me check the example given. Let's take the first sample input:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends. Drink: 4*5 =20 ml. Each toast requires 3*3 =9 ml? Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml, so for one toast, total is 3 *3 =9 ml. So total toasts based on drink is 20 / 9 = 2.222..., which is 2 when integer division. Which matches the note's explanation. Then limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each, total 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (since 3 friends each have one). So 80 /3 is 26.666... but wait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, wait, why?\n\nWait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that's because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for one toast, n slices. So total number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) divided by n. So in the first example, 10*8=80 slices. Divided by 3 friends per toast. 80 /3 is 26.666, which would be 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that doesn't match. Oh wait, no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, 80 slices divided by 3 slices per toast (since each toast requires n slices). So 80 /3 is 26.666, so 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. So for t toasts, total slices needed is t * n. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n. \n\nIn the first example, c is 10, d is 8. So total slices is 80. n is 3. So 80//3 is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait looking back at the note:\n\nIn the first sample, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, that would require 80 *3 = 240 slices. But 10*8=80 slices. So that's impossible. So there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, maybe I got the problem statement wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nProblem says: \"each friend needs a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n*t slices. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut in the note, the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me see:\n\nIn the first example, the input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So c is 10, d is 8. So total slices is 10 *8 = 80. So for t toasts, we need t * 3 slices. So 3t <= 80. So t can be up to 26 (since 26*3=78, 27*3=81>80). But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that the number of slices is 80 * 3 = 240. Which is not possible. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend. Or perhaps per toast, each friend needs one slice. So per toast, n slices. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that the total slices is 80, and per toast, one slice. So that would mean that per toast, one slice. But that would be if each toast requires one slice in total. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. So the total number of slices required for t toasts is t * n. So the maximum t based on limes is (c*d) // n. \n\nBut according to the note, in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me compute that. \n\nIn the first sample, c=10, d=8. So total slices is 10 *8=80. So for t toasts, we need t * n slices. n is 3. So 3t <= 80 → t ≤ 26.666, so 26. But the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's impossible. So what's wrong here?\n\nLooking back at the note:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, that would be possible only if each toast requires one slice. So why does the note say that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice in total, not per friend. That would explain the note. But that contradicts the problem description. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. So for the first sample, with 80 slices, that would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666 toasts. But the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that implies that the problem statement is different. What's the correct way here?\n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, the limes are 10 limes, each cut into 8 slices. So 80 slices. If each toast requires one slice, then 80 toasts. But that would be if each toast requires one slice in total. But the problem says each friend needs a slice. So that would be n slices per toast. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Which suggests that I'm misunderstanding the problem statement. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those three things. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. So the total number of slices needed is t * n. \n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible only if the number of slices is 80, and per toast, 1 slice. So that suggests that the problem statement is that each toast requires one slice in total, not per friend. But that would contradict the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong? No, that's unlikely. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nLet me re-express the note's example:\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends. So for each toast, each of the 3 friends needs a slice. So per toast, 3 slices. So the total number of slices is 10*8=80. So maximum t is 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26. But the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. So why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible if the number of slices is 80, and each toast requires 1 slice. Which would imply that per toast, each friend needs 1 slice. But that's impossible unless there is only one friend. But in this case, there are 3 friends. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice per person. So for each toast, each person needs one slice. So for each toast, each person gets one slice. So for one toast, n slices. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would require that 80 * n <= total slices. \n\nBut in the note, the sample input has 3 friends. So 80 *3 = 240 slices. But total slices is 80. So 240 > 80. So that's not possible. So why does the note say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the note is wrong, or I have a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the note says: \n\n\"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\"\n\nWhich implies that the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) divided by something. In this case, 10*8=80, which is the total number of slices. So if that equals the number of toasts, that suggests that each toast requires one slice. So why? How?\n\nMaybe the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice per person. But that's not possible. Or perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice per person, but the note is wrong. That seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice for the entire group. For example, one slice per toast. Then, the number of toasts possible is 80. Which would match the note. But that would contradict the problem statement. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the note's explanation is correct. So I must find out why. Let's re-examine the note's explanation:\n\nThe note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. The salt is enough for 100 toasts. But the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Then, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3, which is 2.\n\nWait, but why divide by 3? Because the friends are 3. So the min is 6, but that's the total number of toasts possible. Then, each friend can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts. But that would suggest that the total number of toasts is 6, and each friend makes 2. So how is that calculated?\n\nWait, maybe the initial approach was wrong. Let me think again.\n\nLet me re-define variables. Let t be the number of toasts each friend can make. Then, total number of toasts is t * n. Because each of the n friends makes t toasts. \n\nSo for the drink: each toast per friend requires nl ml. So total drink needed is t * n * nl. Which must be ≤ k * l.\n\nFor the limes: each toast per friend requires one slice. So total slices needed is t * n. Which must be ≤ c * d.\n\nFor the salt: each toast per friend requires np grams. So total salt needed is t * n * np. Which must be ≤ p.\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of:\n\n(k*l) // (n * nl), \n\n(c*d) // (n), \n\np // (n * np)\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three numbers.\n\nIn the first sample input, let's compute each value:\n\nDrink: (4 *5) = 20. n * nl = 3 *3 =9. 20//9=2.\n\nLimes: (10*8) =80. n is 3. 80//3=26.\n\nSalt: p is 100. n * np is 3 *1=3. 100//3=33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. Which matches the sample output. So the answer is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which is confusing. Because according to this calculation, the limes allow for 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How does that fit in?\n\nAh! The note's explanation is perhaps incorrect. Or perhaps it's a translation error. Because according to the calculation, the limes can provide 80 slices, which is 80/(n) = 26.666 toasts. So the note's explanation is wrong. But the actual sample output is correct. So the correct approach is to compute the three values as above, and take the minimum.\n\nSo the note's explanation may have an error. But the sample output is correct. So the code should proceed with the approach outlined.\n\nSo, the steps for solving the problem are:\n\nCalculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, which is the minimum of:\n\n- total_drink // (n * nl)\n- total_lime_slices // n\n- total_salt // (n * np)\n\nSo, the code needs to compute these three values and take the minimum of them.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nRead the input line as integers. The input is a single line with n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nSo, for example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo:\n\nn = 3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l = 4*5=20. Then, max_toasts_by_drink = 20 // (3 *3) = 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c*d = 10*8=80. max_toasts_by_lime = 80//3 = 26.\n\ntotal_salt = p =100. max_toasts_by_salt = 100//(3*1) = 33.\n\nminimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10. total drink is 100*10=1000. nl is 4. So per toast, 5*4=20. 1000//20 =50.\n\nlimes: c=1, d=19. total slices 1*19=19. max toasts by limes is 19//5=3. \n\nsalt: p=90. np=3. per toast, 5*3=15. 90//15=6. \n\nminimum is 3. So output is 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000. total drink is 1000*1000=1,000,000. nl is 50. per toast, 10*50=500. 1,000,000//500 = 2000.\n\nlimes: c=25, d=23. total slices 25*23=575. max toasts by limes is 575//10=57.\n\nsalt: p=1, np=1. per toast, 10*1=10. 1//10=0. So minimum is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code needs to compute these three values and take the minimum.\n\nThus, the code steps are:\n\nRead the input line as integers.\n\nCompute:\n\ndrink_total = k * l\n\nmax_drink = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total_slices = c * d\n\nmax_lime = lime_total_slices // n\n\nsalt_total = p\n\nmax_salt = salt_total // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, handle the input. The input is a single line with 8 integers. So, in Python, read the input line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as a list of strings. For example, the first example input is ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', ...]. But in reality, the input is a single line. So the code should read from stdin, split into parts.\n\nIn Python, the code can be written as:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the three values.\n\nBut need to make sure that division is integer division. In Python, using // operator.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntoast_lime = total_lime // n\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nThat's the code. Let me test with the first sample input.\n\nSample input line: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. n * nl is 3*3=9. 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_lime is 10*8=80. 80//3=26.\n\ntoast_salt is 100 // (3*1) = 33. So min(2,26,33) is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input line: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\ntotal_drink = 100 * 10 = 1000. n * nl = 5*4=20. 1000//20=50.\n\ntotal_lime = 1 *19=19. 19//5=3.\n\ntoast_salt: 90 // (5*3) = 90//15=6. min(50,3,6) is 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\ntotal_drink: 1000 *1000 = 1,000,000. n * nl is 10 *50=500. 1e6//500=2000.\n\ntotal_lime: 25 *23=575. 575//10=57.\n\ntoast_salt: 1 // (10*1) = 0. min(2000,57,0) is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where one of the resources is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers. So no.\n\nWhat if the division results in zero? Like if the salt is not enough for even one toast. Then the answer is zero.\n\nAnother case: when all three are same. For example, n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1. Then:\n\ndrink: 1*1=1. n * nl=1*1=1. 1//1=1.\n\nlime: 1*1=1. 1//1=1.\n\nsalt: 1// (1*1)=1. min is 1. Output is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when n is 1, and the other parameters are such that each resource allows for 5 toasts. Then the answer is 5.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nSo the Python code is as written.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink available, the total number of lime slices, and the total amount of salt.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on each resource:\n   - **Drink**: Total drink divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total lime slices divided by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: Total salt divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value from the three resource constraints calculated above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntoast_lime = total_lime // n\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into individual variables representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast per friend, and grams of salt per toast per friend.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. The number of toasts possible based on drink is determined by dividing the total drink by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime. The number of toasts possible based on lime slices is determined by dividing the total slices by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n4. **Salt Calculation**: The number of toasts possible based on salt is determined by dividing the total salt by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value of the three calculated values, representing the limiting resource that determines the maximum number of toasts each friend can make. This value is printed as the output.",
