A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible value that's allowed by each resource.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The inputs are n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. Let me think about each of these:\n\n- n is the number of friends.\n- k bottles of drink, each with l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n- c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices is c * d.\n- p grams of salt.\n- For each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, but for one toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, the total drink required is n * nl (since each of the n friends has nl). Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (one per friend), and n * np grams of salt.\n\nSo the total number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute, divided by the per-toast requirements.\n\nLet me think:\n\nTotal drink available: k * l. Each toast uses n * nl. So the maximum toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, since each toast requires per friend, so for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So yes.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total slices is c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So maximum toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: total is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3*3=9 ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. \n\nLimes: 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 / 3 is 26.666..., floor 26.\n\nSalt: 100 / (3 * 1) = 33.333... floor 33.\n\nThen the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that's the approach.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the three possible maximums for each resource, then take the minimum of them.\n\nSo the code needs to compute:\n\ndrink_total = k * l\n\ntoast_drink = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total = c * d\n\ntoast_lime = lime_total // n\n\nsalt_total = p \n\ntoast_salt = salt_total // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nBut wait, what if any of these values is zero? Like in the third example in the sample input.\n\nThird input is 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\ndrink_total is 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000. Each toast requires 10 * 50 = 500. So 1e6 / 500 = 2000.\n\nLime total is 25 * 23 = 575. Divided by 10 gives 57.5 → floor 57.\n\nSalt is 1 gram. Each toast requires 10 * 1 = 10 grams. 1//10 is 0. So the minimum is 0. Which is the sample output.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, the problem is to read the input, compute these three values, and output the minimum.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is a single line with 8 integers. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first example, the input is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1' which corresponds to n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the code needs to read these 8 numbers. So in Python, we can read the input line, split into parts, and convert to integers.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what if division is not integer? For example, if the total is not exactly divisible by the per-toast requirement. But since we have to make the same number of toasts for all friends, we can't have fractions. So floor division is correct here.\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nLet me check the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2 is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000. Each toast requires 5 * 4 = 20. 1000 / 20 = 50.\n\nLime: c=1, d=19 → 1*19=19 slices. Divided by 5 → 3 (since 19//5 is 3.8 → floor 3).\n\nSalt: p=90. Each toast requires 5 * 3 = 15. 90//15 = 6. So min(50, 3, 6) is 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase when any of the three is zero. For example, if p is zero? But according to the problem statement, the input numbers are positive integers. So no, the inputs are all >=1.\n\nBut in code, even if p is zero, but according to the problem statement, the inputs are positive. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when n is 1. Then the per-toast requirements are nl, 1 slice, np grams.\n\nBut code handles that.\n\nAnother case: when any of the divisions gives zero. For example, if the total drink is less than n * nl. Then toast_drink is zero, so the answer is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into the 8 variables. Then compute the three values and take the min.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → outputs 2.\n\nCalculations:\n\ndrink_total = 4*5=20. n * nl = 3*3=9. 20//9 = 2.\n\nlime_total = 10*8=80. 80//3 = 26.\n\nsalt: 100/(3*1) = 33.333 → 33. min(2,26,33) → 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: third sample input.\n\n10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\ndrink_total is 1000*1000 = 1,000,000. n * nl is 10*50=500. 1e6 // 500 = 2000.\n\nlime_total is 25 *23 = 575. 575 //10 = 57.\n\nsalt: 1 // (10 *1) = 0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of each resource, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the input values which include the number of friends, the number of bottles of drink, the volume per bottle, the number of limes, the number of slices per lime, the amount of salt, the drink required per toast per friend, and the salt required per toast per friend.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Total Drink**: Calculate the total volume of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle.\n   - **Total Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices by multiplying the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n   - **Salt Available**: Use the given amount of salt directly.\n3. **Toast Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Requirement**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available, considering the drink required per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Requirement**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total lime slices available, considering the slices required per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt Requirement**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available, considering the salt required per toast for all friends.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum value derived from the constraints of the three resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntoast_lime = total_lime // n\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total volume of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles (`k`) by the volume per bottle (`l`). The number of toasts possible with this drink is determined by dividing the total volume by the drink required per toast for all friends (`n * nl`).\n- **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is found by multiplying the number of limes (`c`) by the number of slices per lime (`d`). The number of toasts possible with these slices is determined by dividing the total slices by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends (`n`).\n- **Salt Calculation**: The number of toasts possible with the available salt is determined by dividing the total salt (`p`) by the salt required per toast for all friends (`n * np`).\n- **Result**: The final result is the minimum value among the toasts possible from each resource, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource constraint.",
