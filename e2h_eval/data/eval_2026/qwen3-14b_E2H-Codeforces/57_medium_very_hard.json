His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But since the teacher has the first and second tour points but not the names, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x, and then determine the best and worst possible positions he could get.\n\nHmm. So for the best possible rank, we want to maximize his total points (so that he's as high as possible), and for the worst possible rank, minimize his total points (so that others are higher than him). But wait, no. Because for the best rank, we need to find the scenario where Vasya's total is as high as possible, so that he's placed first. For the worst rank, we need to arrange the pairings such that as many people as possible have a total higher than or equal to Vasya's. Wait, but how do we model this?\n\nLet me think again. The problem says that the actual pairing of a_i and b_j for each participant is unknown. So for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to which person. However, the teacher knows that there exists at least one pairing where a_i + b_j >=x (since it's guaranteed that Vasya was present). \n\nBut the question is, what's the best and worst possible rank Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings of the a and b arrays. Because the jury can assign the pairings in any way, but each participant must have exactly one a and one b value.\n\nWait, no. The participants are fixed. Each participant has a first tour score and a second tour score. But the problem states that the teacher has the first and second tour results but they are in arbitrary order. So the teacher doesn't know which a_i corresponds to which b_j for each participant. So the problem is to consider all possible ways to pair the a's and b's (each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa) and find the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have in the total sum, given that there's at least one pair (a_i + b_j) >=x (but that's already guaranteed).\n\nBut Vasya is one of the participants. So, in the pairing, there's exactly one pair (a_i, b_j) that is Vasya's. But the teacher doesn't know which. So for the purpose of calculating best and worst possible ranks, we need to consider all possible pairings where there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x (but that's given). Then, among all those possible pairings, what is the best possible rank Vasya can have (i.e., the minimal possible rank) and the worst possible (the maximal possible rank).\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because for each possible pairing, Vasya's position depends on his a_i + b_j and the other participants' sums. But since the pairing can be arranged in any way, we can choose the pairing that gives Vasya the best possible rank, and another that gives the worst possible.\n\nSo for the best rank: We want to select a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and as many others as possible have lower sums. For example, if we can make Vasya's sum the maximum possible, then he would be first.\n\nFor the worst rank: We want to select a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange others' sums such that as many as possible are higher than or equal to his sum.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think about the approach.\n\nFirst, for the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to maximize Vasya's total. Since Vasya's total is a_i + b_j, and we can choose any pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But in order to maximize his total, we should choose the maximum possible a_i + b_j. But since the pairing must be such that each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa, how can we ensure that?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the pairing is arbitrary. So the teacher can choose any possible pairing of the a and b arrays. So, for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's pair is the maximum possible (a_i + b_j), and that the rest of the pairings are arranged so that as few as possible people have higher sums than him.\n\nWait, but how can we model this? Because the rest of the pairings will affect how many people have a higher sum.\n\nBut perhaps for the best case, we can take the maximum possible sum for Vasya (which is the maximum a_i + b_j, but we need to ensure that this sum is at least x). Then, count how many pairs (in the entire pairing) have a sum greater than this maximum. But since we can arrange the pairings, maybe we can arrange that no one else has a higher sum than Vasya's. So the best possible rank is 1, if there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have a sum strictly greater than the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have. But since we can choose pairings, we can arrange for Vasya's sum to be the maximum possible. So the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a possible pairing where his sum is maximum.\n\nWait, but for example, in the first sample input, all a and b are 1. So the maximum sum is 2. All participants have sum 2. So in this case, the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5. Because the jury can assign the ranks arbitrarily.\n\nSo, to find the best possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (which is the maximum a_i + b_j, but ensuring that it is at least x). Then, the best possible rank is the number of participants whose sum can be greater than that maximum. But since we can arrange pairings, perhaps we can avoid that. So the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a way to pair the a and b arrays such that Vasya's sum is the maximum.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank for Vasya is determined by how many pairs (a_i, b_j) can have a sum strictly greater than the sum that Vasya has. But since we can choose Vasya's sum to be as high as possible, then the best possible rank is 1 if there's a way to have his sum be the maximum possible. But how?\n\nMaybe the best possible rank is 1. Because, if we can pair Vasya with the maximum a_i and maximum b_j, then his sum is the maximum possible, and the rest can be arranged to have lower sums. But how can we ensure that?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the pairing must be a bijection between a and b. So, for example, if the maximum a_i is 5 and maximum b_j is 6, then pairing them would give sum 11. But if there are multiple a_i and b_j that are high, then pairing them might not allow us to have Vasya's sum as the maximum. But since we can choose the pairing, perhaps for the best case scenario, we can arrange that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the approach would be:\n\nFind the maximum possible sum s that Vasya can have (s = a_i + b_j >=x). Then, in the optimal pairing, arrange that no other participant has a sum greater than s. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Well, suppose that there are some pairs (a_i, b_j) that have sum greater than s. But in that case, how can we pair them?\n\nWait, but if we choose s to be the maximum possible sum (say, the maximum of all a_i + b_j), then there can be multiple pairs that have that same sum. But in that case, the jury can assign Vasya to be first, even if others have same sum. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut maybe there's a case where even if you take the maximum sum, there are more than one pairs with that sum. But the problem says that the jury can assign the ranks in any way. So for best case, Vasya can be first.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1, unless there's some constraint that prevents it. Wait, but the problem says that Vasya's sum is at least x. But if the maximum possible sum is less than x, but the problem says it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So the maximum possible sum is at least x. So for the best case, Vasya can have that maximum sum, and thus be placed first. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the output is 1 for best. Which matches. In the second example, the output is also 1 for best. So maybe the best possible rank is always 1. But that seems too simple. What if there are multiple people with the same maximum sum?\n\nBut the problem says that the jury can assign the ranks as they like. So even if there are multiple people with the same maximum sum, Vasya can be placed first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo that's straightforward. The best possible rank is 1. Wait, but why is the first sample output 1 5? Because in that case, the best is 1. So yes. So the first part of the answer is always 1. But why?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Suppose that there are multiple pairs that can be chosen for Vasya's sum. But in order to get the best possible rank, we can choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya, and arrange the other pairings such that no one else has a higher sum. Thus, Vasya can be first.\n\nSo the best possible rank is 1. Therefore, the first part of the answer is always 1. But wait, what if there's no possible way to have Vasya's sum be the maximum? How?\n\nNo, because we can choose any pairing. So, for example, if there's a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum s, and another pair (a_k, b_l) with sum s. But if we can arrange that Vasya's pair is one of them, and others are arranged to have lower sums. But how?\n\nWait, but in the pairing, each a_i is used once and each b_j is used once. So for example, if there are two a's with value 5 and two b's with value 5. Then pairing them together would result in two pairs with sum 10. If Vasya's pair is one of them, then there's another participant with same sum. So the best possible rank is 1 (as per the problem's note, where all participants have same sum, and the jury can assign Vasya first). So yes.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is always 1. So the first part of the output is 1.\n\nBut then why in the first sample input, the output is 1 5. Which is correct. So the first part is 1. So the first part of the answer is always 1. So that's easy.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the worst possible rank. That's more complicated.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of participants that can have a sum greater than or equal to Vasya's sum. But since we can arrange the pairings, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but at least x) and arrange that as many other participants as possible have a sum higher than or equal to his.\n\nSo how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. To find the worst possible rank, we need to:\n\n- Choose a sum s for Vasya (s >=x) such that s is as small as possible, and then arrange the pairings such that as many other participants as possible have sum >=s. Then, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >=s plus 1 (if there are k participants with sum >=s, then Vasya can be placed at k+1-th position if all those k are higher, or if some are equal, but since the jury can arrange the ranks, they can place Vasya after all those who have higher sum, and before those with equal sum. So the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum > s plus 1 (if there are m participants with sum >s, then Vasya can be placed m+1-th. Or if there are m participants with sum >=s, then the worst possible is m+1-th? Or perhaps it's the number of participants with sum strictly greater than s plus the number of participants with sum equal to s and placed before him. But since the jury can arrange the ranks, the worst possible is when all those with sum >=s are placed before him. So the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >=s plus 1? No, because if there are m participants with sum >=s, then the worst possible rank is m+1? Or m? Because if all of them are placed before him, then he is m+1-th. But if some have the same sum as him, then the jury can put him after them. So for example, if there are m participants with sum >=s, then the worst possible rank is m +1? Or m?\n\nWait, the problem says that if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can assign the places according to their choice. So for the worst possible rank, we can arrange that as many as possible participants have sum >=s, and then Vasya is placed last among those. So the worst possible rank would be the number of participants with sum >s plus the number of participants with sum equal to s (including Vasya) plus 1? No, perhaps not.\n\nLet me think again. Let's say that in the worst case scenario, Vasya's sum is s. The number of participants with sum strictly greater than s is k. Then, the number of participants with sum equal to s is m. Then, the worst possible rank for Vasya is k + m + 1? Or k + 1? Because the jury can arrange that all participants with sum >s are ranked above him, and all participants with sum =s are ranked below him. So then, his rank is k + 1. But if the jury can arrange that all participants with sum >=s are ranked above him, then his rank is k + m + 1. But that's not possible because the participants with sum =s can be placed either before or after him. So for the worst possible rank, the jury would arrange that all participants with sum >s are placed before him, and all participants with sum =s are placed after him. Then, his rank is k + 1. However, if the jury can arrange that some participants with sum =s are placed before him, then his rank could be worse. Wait, but if the jury wants to make his rank as bad as possible, they would arrange that as many as possible participants have sum >=s, and place Vasya after them. So, for example, if there are m participants with sum =s, then the worst possible rank is k + m + 1? No, because the participants with sum =s can be placed either before or after him. So the worst possible rank is k + m + 1? No, because the maximum number of people that can be ranked above him is k (those with higher sum) plus m (those with same sum). So if the jury arranges that all those m are placed before him, then his rank is k + m + 1. But that's possible only if the m participants with sum =s can be arranged to be placed before him. But since the jury can choose, that's allowed. Therefore, the worst possible rank is k + m + 1? But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum strictly greater than s plus 1. Because if you can arrange that all those with sum greater than s are placed before him, and those with sum equal to s are placed after him. Then, his rank is k + 1. But if you can arrange that all those with sum >=s are placed before him, then his rank is k + m + 1. But how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me think of the example given in the first sample input. All participants have sum 2. So s = 2. The number of participants with sum >s is zero. The number with sum equal is 5. Then, the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample output. So in that case, the worst possible rank is 5, which is the number of participants with sum equal to s (including Vasya) and the rank is that number. So how?\n\nIn that case, the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >=s. Because if all of them are placed before him, but that's not possible because he is one of them. So the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >=s. Because the jury can arrange that he is placed last among them.\n\nSo the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >=s, where s is Vasya's sum in the worst case.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo, for the worst possible scenario, we need to choose s (Vasya's sum) as small as possible (but >=x) and arrange that as many other participants as possible have sum >=s.\n\nSo the approach for the worst case is:\n\nFind the minimal possible s (>=x) such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s, and the maximum number of other participants have sum >=s.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, to find the worst possible rank, we can think of the following: for each possible s (the sum that Vasya can have, which is >=x), find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s. Then, the worst possible rank is that maximum number + 1? Or the maximum number?\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: the worst possible rank occurs when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but still >=x), and as many other participants as possible have sum >=s. So for the worst case, we want to choose the minimal s (>=x) such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s, and the maximum number of other participants can have sum >=s.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the worst case:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible s (>=x) that Vasya can have, and then find how many participants can have sum >=s. But how?\n\nBut how to find the minimal s? It's the minimal possible sum that can be achieved by pairing a_i with b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. But since we can choose any pairing, the minimal possible s is the minimal value such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s, and s >=x.\n\nBut how to find this minimal s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal s is the minimal possible sum that can be achieved by pairing a_i and b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. But how to compute that?\n\nBut even if we find that minimal s, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is s (the minimal possible), and then the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s. Then, the worst rank is that number plus 1 (if the count includes Vasya) ?\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nThis feels like a problem that requires some kind of binary search or greedy approach.\n\nLet me think again. For the worst case, we want to maximize the number of participants that have sum >= s, where s is Vasya's sum (which is >=x and as small as possible). So to maximize the number of participants with sum >=s, we need to choose s as small as possible, but such that there's a way to pair the a and b arrays such that Vasya's sum is s, and as many others as possible can have sum >=s.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to find for each possible s (>=x), the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s. Then, the worst possible rank is that maximum number plus 1 (assuming that Vasya is included in that count). But how to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s, given that there's a pairing where Vasya's sum is s.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the problem's sample explanation. For the worst case, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange the rest of the pairings so that as many as possible other participants have a sum >=s.\n\nTo maximize the number of participants with sum >=s, we need to maximize the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed with sum >=s, given that one of the pairs is s (for Vasya).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps for the worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible s (>=x) that Vasya can have. But how?\n\nBut perhaps the minimal s is x. However, there may be cases where even if we try to set s=x, it's not possible to have a pairing where Vasya's sum is x, but the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So, the minimal s is the minimal value >=x such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j = s, and that the rest of the pairs can be arranged to have as many as possible sum >=s.\n\nBut how to find that s?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, we can think that Vasya's sum is s (>=x), and we want to maximize the number of participants with sum >=s. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed such that their sum is >=s, and then subtracting 1 (since Vasya is one of them) and adding 1 to get the rank. But how?\n\nBut to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s, given that s is chosen such that there exists at least one pair (for Vasya) with sum >=x.\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible number of pairs with sum >=s for varying s?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=k, which is a classic problem.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor the worst case, we need to find the minimal s (>=x) such that the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s is as large as possible. Wait, no. Wait, we need to find the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=s, where s is the minimal possible value (to allow as many pairs as possible). But how?\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=s, where s is the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (>=x). So, the steps would be:\n\n- Find the minimal possible s that Vasya can have (i.e., the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x, and there exists a pairing where Vasya's pair is that sum, and the rest of the pairs are arranged to allow as many as possible other participants to have sum >=s).\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst possible rank, we can think that Vasya's sum is s, and we want to maximize the number of participants that have sum >=s. So for each possible s >=x, we can compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=s. Let's call this number K. Then, the worst possible rank is K (since Vasya is one of them, and the jury can arrange him to be last among them). But how to find the maximum K over all possible s >=x?\n\nWait, but if we can find the maximum possible K (number of pairs with sum >=s) for any s >=x, then the worst possible rank is K. Because that would mean that there's a way to have K participants with sum >=s (including Vasya), and the worst possible rank is K.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum K?\n\nThis seems like a classic problem. The maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=s. For this, we can use a greedy approach. Sort the a array in ascending order, sort the b array in descending order, then pair the smallest a with the largest b, etc. This way, we can maximize the number of pairs with sum >=s.\n\nWait, but for a given s, the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=s is computed by sorting a in ascending order, and b in descending order, and then greedily pairing a[i] with b[j], checking if their sum is >=s. But how to find the maximum number of such pairs.\n\nSo, the approach for a given s is:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then, for each i from 0 to n-1, check if a[i] + b[i] >=s. The number of such pairs is the maximum possible.\n\nWait, no. For example, if a is [1, 2, 3], b is [4, 5, 6], and s=5. Pairing 1 with 6 (sum 7), 2 with 5 (7), 3 with 4 (7) gives all three pairs. But if you sorted a ascending and b ascending, then pairing 1 with 4 (sum 5), 2 with 5 (7), 3 with 6 (9) gives all three pairs. So the method of sorting a ascending and b descending may not be the right way. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to sort a in ascending and b in ascending, then pair the largest a with the largest b, etc. Or perhaps the correct approach is to sort a and b in ascending order, then pair the smallest a with the largest b, etc.\n\nWait, here's a standard approach for maximizing the number of pairs with sum >=s. Sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers: one at the start of a (i=0), and one at the end of b (j=n-1). For each a[i], if a[i] + b[j] >=s, then we can pair them, increment the count, and move both pointers. Else, move the a pointer forward. This way, we can find the maximum number of pairs possible.\n\nYes, this is a standard approach. Let me think: for example, a = [1, 2, 3], b = [1, 2, 3], s=4. We want to pair 1 with 3 (sum 4), 2 with 2 (sum 4), 3 with 1 (sum 4). But using the two pointers approach: a is sorted ascending, b sorted ascending. i starts at 0, j starts at 2. a[0] + b[2] = 1+3=4 >=4. So count increases by 1, i becomes 1, j becomes 1. Now a[1] + b[1] = 2+2=4 >=4. Count becomes 2, i becomes 2, j becomes 0. a[2] + b[0] = 3+1=4 >=4. Count becomes 3. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1, 1, 1], b = [1, 1, 1], s=2. All pairs sum to 2. So maximum is 3.\n\nAnother example: a = [1, 3, 5], b = [2, 4, 6], s=6. The two pointers approach would start with a[0]=1 and b[2]=6. 1+6=7 >=6. count=1. i=1, j=1. a[1]=3 + b[1]=4 =7 >=6. count=2. i=2, j=0. a[2]=5 + b[0]=2 =7 >=6. count=3. So all pairs are counted. Correct.\n\nSo this two pointers approach gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s.\n\nSo, for the worst case, we need to find the maximum number of pairs (including Vasya's) that can be formed with sum >=s, where s is the minimal possible value that is >=x. But how to find this s?\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal s (>=x) for which the maximum number of pairs is as large as possible?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, we can find the maximum possible K (number of pairs with sum >=s) for any s >=x, and then the worst possible rank is K. Because that would mean that there exists a pairing where K participants have sum >=s (including Vasya), and the worst possible rank is K.\n\nBut how to find this K?\n\nLet me think. The maximum K is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=s for any s >=x. But how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum K is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=x. Because x is the minimum required for Vasya. So, if we can find the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x, then that would be the maximum possible K, and thus the worst possible rank would be K.\n\nWait, but why? Because for the worst case, we want to have as many participants as possible with sum >=s (where s is Vasya's sum >=x). So the maximum possible K is when s is as small as possible (like x), allowing as many pairs as possible. So the maximum K is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=x. Then, the worst possible rank is K.\n\nBut why? Because if we can form K pairs with sum >=x, then Vasya can be one of them, and the worst possible rank is K. Because the jury can arrange that all K participants are ranked above or equal to him, placing him at K-th position.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nTake the first sample input: n=5, x=2. All a and b are 1. So each pair sum is 2. So the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x is 5. Hence, the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample input, the output is 1 5. Let's see:\n\nSample input:\n\n6 7\n\na: [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb: [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nSo x is 7. We need to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >=7.\n\nLet's sort a and b.\n\na sorted: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nb sorted: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\nNow, using the two pointers approach to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >=7.\n\nInitialize i=0 (start of a), j=5 (end of b).\n\nCheck a[i] + b[j] = 3 +8=11 >=7 → count +=1 → count=1. i=1, j=4.\n\na[1]=4 + b[4]=6 → 10 >=7 → count=2. i=2, j=3.\n\na[2]=4 + b[3]=4 → 8 >=7 → count=3. i=3, j=2.\n\na[3]=4 + b[2]=4 → 8 >=7 → count=4. i=4, j=1.\n\na[4]=5 + b[1]=3 → 8 >=7 → count=5. i=5, j=0.\n\na[5]=6 + b[0]=0 → 6 <7 → can't pair. So the total is 5.\n\nThus, maximum number of pairs with sum >=7 is 5. Hence, the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nSo for the worst case, the answer is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=x. And that number is the worst possible rank.\n\nWait, but why? Because in this scenario, Vasya is one of the pairs in that maximum count. So the worst possible rank is that count. Because the jury can arrange that all those pairs are placed before or equal to him, making him the last among them.\n\nSo, the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n- Best possible rank is 1.\n\n- Worst possible rank is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=x.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum number of pairs?\n\nAs discussed earlier, using the two pointers approach on sorted a and sorted b.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead a list and b list.\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in ascending order.\n\nUse two pointers approach to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x.\n\nThe worst possible rank is that number.\n\nBut wait, what if the maximum number of pairs is less than n? For example, if x is very high. But the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So the maximum number of pairs is at least 1.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nFor the best rank: print 1.\n\nFor the worst rank: compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x, using the two pointers approach.\n\nBut wait, let's test this against the first sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1], sorted a is same.\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1], sorted same.\n\ntwo pointers approach:\n\ni=0, j=4 → 1+1=2 >=2 → count=1. i=1, j=3 → 1+1=2 → count=2. i=2, j=2 → 1+1=2 → count=3. i=3, j=1 → 1+1=2 → count=4. i=4, j=0 → 1+1=2 → count=5. So the maximum number is 5. Hence, worst rank is 5. Which matches.\n\nAnother example: sample 2.\n\nAs discussed, the maximum number is 5. So output is 1 5.\n\nAnother test case: let's say n=2, x=3. a=[1, 2], b=[2, 3]. So possible pairs:\n\n(1,2) sum 3, (2,3) sum 5 → max pairs with sum >=3 is 2. So worst rank is 2.\n\nBut what if x=4. Then, the maximum number of pairs with sum >=4 is 1 (pair (2,3) sum 5). So worst rank is 1. But since Vasya must have sum >=4, which is possible. So the worst rank is 1.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, implement this:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list a, list b.\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i=0, j = n-1, count=0.\n\nWhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >=x:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nThe count is the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is count.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple ways to pair the elements, and this count is the maximum possible? Yes.\n\nSo the code for the worst case is this count.\n\nSo the final answer is '1' and 'count'.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the count is 5, which is the worst possible rank. Which is correct.\n\nBut why does this count represent the worst possible rank?\n\nBecause in this scenario, there are count participants that have sum >=x. So the worst possible rank is count. Because Vasya is one of them, and the jury can arrange that he is placed last among them.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead a list, read b list.\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in ascending order.\n\nCompute the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x as described.\n\nThen, output 1 and that count.\n\nWait, but what about cases where the count is larger than n? No, because the loop runs while i <n and j >=0. So the maximum count is n.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nBut let's check another example.\n\nExample where x is very high. For instance, n=2, x=10. a = [5, 5], b = [5,5]. The sum of each pair is 10. So the count is 2. Thus, worst possible rank is 2.\n\nWhich is correct, since Vasya could be placed second.\n\nAnother example: n=3, x=5. a = [1, 2, 3], b = [4, 5, 6]. The maximum number of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to determine these ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: The best possible rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. This is because we can always pair Vasya's scores such that his total points are the highest possible among all participants, leveraging the flexibility in pairing scores.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum number of participants who can have a total score greater than or equal to the minimum score Vasya could have (which is given as `x`). This is done using a greedy approach with two pointers:\n   - Sort both the scores from the first tour (`a`) and the second tour (`b`) in ascending order.\n   - Use two pointers to count the maximum number of valid pairs (i.e., pairs where the sum of scores is at least `x`). This count gives the worst possible rank since it represents the maximum number of participants who could have scores equal to or higher than Vasya's minimum possible score.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    \n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    count = 0\n    \n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a[i] + b[j] >= x:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    print(\"1\", count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the lists of scores from the first and second tours.\n- **Sorting**: Both lists of scores are sorted in ascending order to facilitate the greedy pairing approach.\n- **Two Pointers Technique**: By using two pointers starting from the beginning of the first list and the end of the second list, we efficiently count the maximum number of valid pairs (scores summing to at least `x`). This technique ensures we maximize the number of valid pairs by checking each potential combination optimally.\n- **Output**: The best possible rank is always 1, and the worst possible rank is determined by the count of valid pairs calculated using the two pointers method.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine both the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya using sorting and a linear traversal with two pointers, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
