Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this problem. The key idea is probably to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would be the point that requires the largest d to cover.\n\nBut wait, the street starts at 0 and ends at l. So, the first thing I need to do is sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, I can't easily check the gaps between consecutive ones. Also, I have to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position divided by 2 would be a candidate for d. Similarly, if the last lantern is not at l, then the distance from the last lantern to l divided by 2 is another candidate.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the initial segment from 0 to the first lantern. The required d here is (a[0] - 0) / 2.\n3. Check the segments between consecutive lanterns. For each pair, the maximum gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]) / 2. Because the middle of the gap would be the farthest point from either lantern.\n4. Check the segment from the last lantern to l. The required d here is (l - a[-1]) / 2.\n5. The answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like, n=1. Then the maximum between the first part (distance from 0 to a[0] divided by 2) and the last part (distance from a[0] to l divided by 2). That makes sense.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n7 15\nThe lantern positions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they become 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nThen the initial gap is 0 to 0 (so nothing), then between 0 and 3: 3-0=3, divided by 2 is 1.5. Then between 3 and 5: 2/2=1. Between 5 and7: 2/2=1. Between 7 and9: 2/2=1. Between 9 and14: 5/2=2.5. Between 14 and15: 1/2=0.5. Then the end part is 15 to 15: 0. So the maximum is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nSecond example input:\n2 5\npositions 2 and 5. Sorted as 2,5. The initial gap is 2-0=2, divided by 2 is 1. The gap between 2 and5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. The end part is 5 to 5: 0. So maximum is 1.5? But the sample output is 2.0. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait what's wrong here?\n\nWait no, the sample input is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. The street is from 0 to 5. The first lantern is at 2. The initial segment is from 0 to 2. The required d here is (2-0)/2 = 1. Then between 2 and5, the gap is 3, so 3/2=1.5. Then the end part is 5-5=0. So the maximum is 1.5. But the sample output is 2.0. Wait that's a contradiction. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample says that for input 2 5, the answer is 2.0. Let me check the note. The note says that with d=2, the first lantern covers [0,4], the second covers [3,5]. So the entire street is covered. But according to my approach, the maximum required d would be 1.5. But why?\n\nAh! Oh right! Because the first lantern is at 2. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 2. So the required d for that part is 2.0. Because the first lantern's coverage starts at 2 -d. So to cover 0, we need 2 -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ 2. So the initial calculation was wrong. Oh right! Because the initial segment is from 0 to a[0], which is 2. The required d is (a[0] - 0) / 2? No, that's not correct. Because the lantern is at a[0], and the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. So the lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the radius needs to be at least a[0] - 0. Because the lantern's coverage is from a[0] -d to a[0] +d. So to cover 0, we need a[0] -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a[0]. Wait no. Because the lantern is at a[0], and the distance from the lantern to 0 is a[0]. So the radius needs to be at least a[0], because the lantern's coverage is up to d. So if the lantern is at 2, then to cover 0, the radius must be at least 2. Because 2 - 0 = 2. So the initial calculation was wrong. So the initial approach was incorrect.\n\nOh no, so what's the mistake here?\n\nEarlier thinking was that the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns is the key. But that's not considering the ends. So the correct approach is:\n\nThe maximum distance between two consecutive lanterns, but also the distance from the start to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end. However, for those edges, the required d is the distance from the start to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to the end. Because for example, if the first lantern is at position x, then the distance from 0 to x is x. The lantern's coverage can reach up to x +d. But to cover 0, the lantern's coverage must include 0. So the distance between 0 and x is x. So the radius must be at least x. Because the lantern's coverage extends to x -d. So for 0 to be covered, x -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ x. Similarly for the end. So for the first part, the required d is a[0], and for the last part, it's l - a[-1]. But then, the maximum between these and the gaps between lanterns.\n\nWait no. Because for the gap between two consecutive lanterns, say a[i] and a[i+1], the maximum distance between them is a[i+1] - a[i]. The middle of that gap is at (a[i] + a[i+1])/2. The distance from this point to either lantern is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. So the required d for this gap is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. But for the first part, the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. The required d is a[0], because the lantern at a[0] needs to cover 0. So the radius must be at least a[0]. Similarly for the end. So in the second example, the first lantern is at 2. So the required d is 2. Then between 2 and 5, the gap is 3, so (3)/2 = 1.5. The end is l - a[-1] = 5-5=0. So the maximum of 2, 1.5, 0 is 2. Which matches the sample output. Oh right! So my earlier approach was wrong. The initial idea of taking (a[0] -0)/2 is wrong. It should be a[0], because the lantern is at a[0], and the distance from 0 to the lantern is a[0], so d must be at least that. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo the correct steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the maximum between:\n\n- the first lantern's position (since 0 to a[0] needs to be covered by the first lantern's radius)\n- the last lantern's distance to l (since l - a[-1] needs to be covered by the last lantern's radius)\n- the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1], max_gap_between_consecutive / 2 )\n\nWait, but wait. For example, if the first lantern is at 0, then a[0] is 0, so the required d for that part is 0. Which is correct. Similarly, if the last lantern is at l, then l -a[-1] is zero.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nAfter sorting the array, compute the initial distance (a[0] - 0) and the end distance (l - a[-1]). Then for the gaps between consecutive lanterns, compute (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. The maximum of all these three values is the required d.\n\nSo for the second example:\n\nn=2, l=5, a = [2,5]\n\ninitial distance is 2-0=2. end distance is 5-5=0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: if the lanterns are at 0 and 5. Then initial distance is 0, end distance is 0. The gap between them is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the maximum is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: lanterns at 0 and 3, l=5. The initial distance is 0. The end distance is 5-3=2. The gap between 0 and 3 is 3/2=1.5. So the max is 2. So d is 2. Which would cover 0 to 3+2=5. So yes, correct.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nSo the algorithm steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance (a[0] - 0) → but wait, no. Wait, the initial distance is a[0] - 0? Or the distance between 0 and a[0] is a[0]. So the required d for that part is a[0]. Because the lantern is at a[0], and to cover 0, the radius must be at least a[0].\n\nYes. So initial distance is a[0], end distance is l - a[-1].\n\nThen, for the gaps between consecutive lanterns, compute (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. The maximum among these is the maximum gap.\n\nSo the overall maximum is the maximum between initial, end, and max_gap.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial = a[0]\n\nend = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to n-2:\n\n   gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n   if gap > max_gap:\n\n      max_gap = gap\n\nthen, the required d is max( initial, end, max_gap / 2 )\n\nWait, but in the first example, the initial is 0, end is 0, and the max_gap is 5 (between 9 and 14?), wait no. Let me check the first example again.\n\nFirst example input: after sorting, the positions are 0, 3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nSo the gaps between consecutive are:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2=1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nSo the max_gap is 5. So max_gap/2 is 2.5. Initial is 0, end is 0. So the max is 2.5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo that works.\n\nAnother example: when the lanterns are at 0 and 5, l=5. Then initial is 0, end is 0. max_gap is 5, so 5/2=2.5. So d is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: lanterns at 0 and 4, l=5. Then initial is 0, end is 5-4=1. max_gap is 4. So 4/2=2. So the max between 0, 1, 2 is 2. So d is 2. Which would cover from 0 to 4+2=6 (but the street is only up to 5). So the end part is 5-4=1. So the required d is 2. Which is correct because the lantern at 0 covers up to 2, and the lantern at 4 covers up to 4+2=6. So the street from 0 to 5 is covered. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nNow, the edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1. For example, n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then initial is 5, end is 5. The max_gap is 0 (since there's only one element). So the max between 5, 5, 0/2=0 → 5. So d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=0. But l is given as at least 1. So no.\n\nAnother case: lanterns at 0 and l. Then initial is 0, end is 0. The gap is l, so max_gap/2 is l/2. So d is l/2.\n\nAnother case: multiple lanterns at same position. Like n=3, l=10, a=[2,2,2]. Then sorted is [2,2,2]. initial is 2, end is 8. The gaps between consecutive are 0. So max_gap is 0. So the maximum is max(2, 8, 0) → 8. Which is correct. Because the lanterns are all at 2, so the end part (from 2 to 10) requires d of 8.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input. First line is n and l. Second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. For example, the first example input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nBut in the input, the second line is the list of a_i. So in code, read n and l, then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen, sort the list.\n\nHandle the case when n=0? No, since n is at least 1.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, l from input.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial = a[0]\n\nend = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nd = max( initial, end, max_gap / 2 )\n\nThen print d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, initial is 0, end is 0. max_gap is 5 (from 9 to 14). So 5/2 is 2.5. So the maximum is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for the second example, the initial is 2, end is 0, max_gap is 3 (5-2). So 3/2=1.5. The max is 2. So correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about when the initial is 0? Like when the first lantern is at 0. Then initial is 0. So the required d for that part is 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the first lantern is at 0, and the next is at 3. Then the initial is 0, end is l - a[-1]. The gap between 0 and 3 is 3, so 3/2=1.5. So the max would be between 0, end, and 1.5.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, in Python, we need to read the input. But the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and l. The next line contains n integers. So the code should process one test case. But looking at the sample input, the first example has two inputs, but perhaps that's part of the example. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nBut that's probably the way the input is given in the problem. Wait, perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the formatting. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and l. The next line contains n integers. So the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nand the second is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nSo the sample input has two separate test cases, and the output is two lines. But in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input formatting. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the actual input is one test case, but the sample shows two. But in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines, and the output is one line.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. But perhaps the user intended that the code should read multiple test cases. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is the first test case, then the second line is the second test case. But the problem says that the input is two lines. So perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and print outputs to stdout. So perhaps the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich is one test case. The output is '2.5000000000'.\n\nThen the second input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nWhich is another test case, with output '2.0000000000'.\n\nBut the sample input is given as two lines. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. However, the code should handle a single test case. Because the problem says that the input is two lines.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input section, the first line contains two integers n and l. The next line contains n integers. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read two lines from input. The first line is n and l, the second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo in Python, the code would read:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen proceed as before.\n\nBut what about cases where the input is given with multiple test cases? Well, according to the problem statement, the code is supposed to process a single test case. So the code should read two lines, as per the problem description.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided two test cases. However, perhaps the problem expects that the code is written for a single test case. So the code should process one test case.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial, end, max_gap.\n\nCompute the maximum of initial, end, max_gap / 2.\n\nPrint that value with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nBut for cases when n is 0? But n is given as at least 1.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    initial = a[0]\n    end = l - a[-1]\n    max_gap = 0\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    d = max(initial, end, max_gap / 2)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the initial is a[0] = 0. So the code returns max(0, 0, 5/2=2.5) → 2.5. Correct.\n\nIn the second example, initial is 2, end is 0, max_gap is 3. So max(2, 0, 1.5) → 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then initial is 5, end is 5. max_gap is 0. So d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. initial is 2, end is 0. max_gap is 3. So d is max(2, 0, 1.5) → 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. initial is 0, end is 0. max_gap is 5. So d is max(0,0, 2.5) → 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the lanterns are not sorted? For example, a = [5, 0], then after sorting, it becomes [0,5], which is handled correctly.\n\nNow, the code needs to print the answer with 10 decimal digits. So using the format string.\n\nBut in Python, when you print, for example, 2.5, it would be printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first output is 2.5000000000, which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, when you use the format string, it will format the number with 10 decimal digits, even if trailing zeros. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about floating point precision issues? For example, when the maximum is exactly 2.5, but due to floating point representation, it might be stored as something like 2.499999999999999... or 2.500000000000000... ?\n\nBut since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, using floating point calculations should be sufficient. However, in Python, using the max function with the correct values should be precise enough.\n\nBut in the code, all the calculations are done with integers except for the division by 2. So for example, if max_gap is an even number, then it's exact. If it's odd, then it's a .5 value. But in Python, when you divide an integer by 2, it returns a float.\n\nBut when you have initial and end as integers, and max_gap/2 as a float, the max is computed correctly.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, the list is [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\ninitial = 0\n\nend = 15 -15=0\n\nmax_gap is 5 (between 9 and 14)\n\nso d = max(0, 0, 5/2=2.5) → 2.5. Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\ninitial is 2, end is 0. max_gap is 3. So max(2, 0, 1.5) → 2. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Output is 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. initial is 0, end is 0. max_gap is 5. So d is 5/2=2.5. So output is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, when you have a list of a, and n=1, then the for loop for i in range(n-1) is range(0), which doesn't run. So max_gap remains 0. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, the code must be ready to run, with necessary imports. The code uses sys.stdin.readline().\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    initial = a[0]\n    end = l - a[-1]\n    max_gap = 0\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    d = max(initial, end, max_gap / 2)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the case where n=0? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nBut what about when the list a is empty? No, since n is >=1.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`, given that each lantern can illuminate a distance up to `d` from its position. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to easily calculate the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Edge Distances**: Determine the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l).\n3. **Calculate Maximum Gap Between Consecutive Lanterns**: Iterate through the sorted list of lantern positions to find the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns.\n4. **Determine Minimum Radius**: The minimum radius required is the maximum value among the edge distances and half of the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. This ensures that all parts of the street are illuminated.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    initial = a[0]\n    end = l - a[-1]\n    max_gap = 0\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    d = max(initial, end, max_gap / 2)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in efficiently determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Edge Distance Calculation**: The initial distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and the end distance from the last lantern to the end of the street are crucial as they determine the minimum radius needed to cover these edges.\n- **Maximum Gap Calculation**: The largest gap between consecutive lanterns determines the minimum radius needed to ensure that the middle of this gap is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is derived by taking the maximum of the edge distances and half of the maximum gap, ensuring that all parts of the street are illuminated with the minimum possible radius.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures precision up to 10 decimal places as required by the problem constraints.",
