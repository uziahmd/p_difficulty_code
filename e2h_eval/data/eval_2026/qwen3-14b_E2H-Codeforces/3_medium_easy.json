Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this. The key is to find the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns, but also considering the ends of the street. Because the lanterns might not cover the very start or end of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to that lantern's position would be a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are sorted, we can check the gaps between consecutive ones.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. That's one possible maximum.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to the end (l). That's another possible maximum.\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum of these gaps divided by two would be the required d for that gap. Because if two lanterns are spaced by 'gap', then the middle point between them would be the farthest from either lantern. So the required d for that gap is gap/2.\n5. The overall d needed is the maximum of all these values: the start gap, the end gap, and the max of the consecutive gaps divided by two.\n\nWait, right. Because for two consecutive lanterns, say at positions a and b (a < b), the maximum distance from any point in between to the nearest lantern is (b - a)/2. Because the worst case is the midpoint between them. So that's why for each consecutive pair, we take (b - a)/2. Then compare that with the start and end distances.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial gap between 0 and the first lantern. Let's call this first_gap = a[0] - 0. Then the end gap is l - a[-1]. Then for each consecutive pair, compute the difference and divide by two. Then take the maximum among all these values.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? Like n=1. Then the first_gap is a[0], and the end_gap is l - a[0]. The maximum of those two would be the required d. Because the lantern's coverage must reach both ends.\n\nYes. So the algorithm would handle that case.\n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, the positions are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nFirst gap is 0 - 0 = 0. Then the end gap is 15 -15 =0. Then the consecutive gaps are:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nSo the maximum among these is 2.5, which is the answer. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting: [2,5]\n\nFirst gap is 2 - 0 = 2. End gap is 5-5=0. Consecutive gaps: 5-2=3 → 1.5. So the maximum between 2, 0, and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, how to code this?\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as 0.0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The first gap is a[0] - 0.0. Then the end gap is l - a[-1]. Then for each consecutive pair, compute (current - previous) / 2.0.\n\nTake the maximum of all these values.\n\nBut wait, for the first gap and end gap, we can think of them as (a[0] - 0) and (l - a[-1]). But for the first gap, the required d is that value, because the lantern's coverage must reach from 0 to a[0]. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo the maximum between (a[0], l - a[-1], and the max of (consecutive differences)/2).\n\nSo code steps:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n == 0: but according to input constraints, n >=1?\n\nWait, input says 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. So no need for n=0.\n\nSo:\n\nfirst = sorted_a[0]\n\nlast = sorted_a[-1]\n\nmax_d = max(first, l - last)\n\nthen for i in 1 to n-1:\n\ngap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\ncurrent = gap / 2.0\n\nif current > max_d: update max_d.\n\nSo the answer is max_d.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i.\n\nSort them.\n\nCompute first and last.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max( first, l - last )\n\nthen iterate through the sorted list, check consecutive gaps.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample:\n\nsorted_a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nfirst is 0, so first is 0. l - last is 15-15=0. So initial max_d is 0. Then check consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d becomes 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5 → max_d becomes 2.5.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nSo final max_d is 2.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample: input is 2 5, [2,5]. sorted is [2,5].\n\nfirst is 2, l - last is 5-5=0. So initial max_d is 2. Then the gap between 5-2=3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d remains 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then first is 5, l - last is 5. So initial max_d is 5. Then no consecutive gaps. So answer is 5. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then first is 0, l - last is 0. Consecutive gaps: 5-0=5 → 2.5; 10-5=5 → 2.5. So max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then first is 0, l - last is 0. The gap between them is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead input:\n\nThe first line has n and l. Then the next line has n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is like:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. Wait, the input for the problem is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and l.\n\nThe next line contains n integers ai.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as a single string, perhaps split into multiple lines. But for code submission, the code should read from stdin. So for example, the code should read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of ai.\n\nBut in the sample input, perhaps the first input is two test cases. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So for example, the code should read the first line as n and l, then the next line as the list of ai.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for the first case, the input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo the code should read n=7, l=15, and the list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0].\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the first line as n, l. Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the list has exactly n elements. However, according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nOnce we have a, we sort it.\n\nThen compute the initial max_d.\n\nThen loop through consecutive elements.\n\nSo code:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n == 0:\n\n    # but n >=1 per input constraints\n\nfirst = sorted_a[0]\n\nlast = sorted_a[-1]\n\nmax_d = max(first, l - last)\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case gives 2.5 as output. Let's see:\n\nYes, the code would compute max_d as 2.5, and print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut what about when the maximum is between the first element and 0, or between last element and l?\n\nLike for example, if the first lantern is at position 3, and l is 5. Then the first gap is 3, and the end gap is 5 - last. Suppose last is 5, then end gap is 0. So the maximum is 3. So the code would return 3.0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the first lantern is at position 0? Then the first gap is 0. So the code would check the other gaps.\n\nBut what if the first lantern is at 0, and the next is at 5, and l is 10. Then the first gap is 0, end gap is 10 - 5 =5. The consecutive gap between 0 and 5 is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the max is 5. So the code would return 5. Which is correct, because the end of the street is 10, and the last lantern is at 5. So the distance from 5 to 10 is 5, which is the required d.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase 1: All lanterns are at 0. For example, n=3, l=5, a=[0,0,0]. Then sorted_a is [0,0,0]. first is 0, last is 0. So initial max_d is max(0, 5-0=5) → 5. Then for consecutive gaps, all are 0. So the max_d is 5. Correct.\n\nCase 2: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then max_d is max(5, 5) →5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then initial max_d is max(0, 0) →0. Then the consecutive gap is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So the answer is 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then initial max is max(0, 0) →0. The consecutive gaps are 5 and 5. Divided by 2 is 2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[2, 5]. Then initial max is max(2, 0) →2. The consecutive gap is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So answer is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, in Python, when we print, we need to format it with 10 decimal digits. For example, in the first sample, 2.5 is printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSo using the format string with .10f.\n\nBut what about when the value is an integer? Like 2.0, which would be printed as 2.0000000000.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead a list.\n\nSort.\n\nCompute first and last.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(first, l - last).\n\nLoop through consecutive elements, compute (current - previous)/2.0, compare to max_d.\n\nFinally, print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = 0.0\n    first = a[0]\n    last = a[-1]\n    max_d = max(first, l - last)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if the first is 0 and the last is l? Then the initial max_d is max(0, 0) =0. Then the consecutive gaps may be checked. For example, if the lanterns are already covering the entire street. Like n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then the initial max_d is 0. Then the consecutive gap is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct. Because the middle of the street is 2.5 away from the nearest lantern.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: if the lanterns are placed at 0 and 5, and l is 5. Then the code returns 2.5, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting: [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nfirst is 0, last is 15. l is 15. So l - last is 0. So initial max_d is 0. Then the consecutive gaps are:\n\n3-0=3 →1.5 → max_d becomes 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 →1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 →1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 →1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 →2.5 → max_d is now 2.5.\n\nThen 15-14=1 →0.5 → no change.\n\nSo output is 2.5 → printed with 10 decimals.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nfirst is 2, l - last is 5-5=0 → max_d is 2.0. Then consecutive gap is 3 → 1.5. So max_d remains 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about when the lanterns are not sorted? For example, in the first sample, the input is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0], which after sorting becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. So the code handles that.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, l=1. a=[0]. Then first is 0, l - last is 1-0=1. So max_d is 1.0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=1, a=[1]. Then first is 1, l - last is 0. So max_d is 1.0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 0, 10]. Then sorted is [0,0,10]. first is 0, l - last is 0. Then consecutive gaps are 0 (between first two) and 10 (between 0 and 10). So the max_d is max(0, 0, 10/2=5) →5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct. Because the middle between 0 and 10 is 5. So the radius needs to be 5.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l`. The lanterns are placed at various points along the street, and each lantern can illuminate a distance `d` from its position. Our task is to find the smallest possible `d` such that the entire street is covered.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius `d`.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum distance that needs to be covered within this gap is half of the gap, as the farthest point from either lantern would be at the midpoint of the gap.\n4. **Determine Maximum Distance**: The required minimum radius `d` is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the ends of the street and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = 0.0\n    first = a[0]\n    last = a[-1]\n    max_d = max(first, l - last)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of lanterns `n` and the length of the street `l`. The second line contains the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking consecutive gaps.\n3. **Initial Checks**: The initial maximum radius `max_d` is determined by checking the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Consecutive Gaps**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The maximum distance required to cover this gap is half the gap, which is compared with the current maximum radius `max_d`.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to ensure the required accuracy.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius required by considering both the ends of the street and the gaps between lanterns, ensuring the entire street is illuminated with the smallest possible radius.",
