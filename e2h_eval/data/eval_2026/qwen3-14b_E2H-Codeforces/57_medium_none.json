His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the results of two tours, but they are not linked to names. So, for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but the teacher doesn't know which a_i pairs with which b_j. However, Vasya's total is at least x. We need to find the best and worst possible positions he could have, considering all possible pairings of a and b.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because the actual pairing of a and b for each participant is unknown. For example, if there are n participants, each participant's total is some a_i plus some b_j, but each a and b must be used exactly once. Oh right! Because each participant took part in both tours. So the problem is that the a array and b array are the first and second tour scores of the participants, but the pairing between a_i and b_j is unknown. So, for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa.\n\nBut since the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x, but the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible rank for him. So, the way to model this is: we can choose any possible pairing of a and b (so that each a is paired with exactly one b) such that there exists at least one pair where a_i + b_j >=x. Then, for that pairing, Vasya's total is that a_i + b_j. But since the teacher doesn't know which pairing is correct, we need to find the best and worst possible ranks that Vasya could have in any possible valid pairing.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem states that \"it is guaranteed that there are two integers i, j such that a_i + b_j >=x\". So, there's at least one possible pairing where Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher needs to consider all possible pairings (since the pairings are unknown), and for each possible pairing that includes at least one pair with sum >=x, determine what Vasya's rank could be. Then find the best possible (minimum) and worst possible (maximum) rank he could have.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because for the best possible rank, we want to arrange the pairings so that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. For the worst possible, arrange it so that his sum is as low as possible (but still >=x) and others are as high as possible.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x, but the actual value could be higher. So for the best possible rank, we need to maximize his total (so that he can be first), and for the worst possible, minimize his total (so that as many people as possible have higher or equal sums).\n\nBut how to model the possible pairings?\n\nLet me think. The key here is that for the best possible rank, we want to assign to Vasya the maximum possible a_i + b_j that is at least x. Then, arrange other pairings so that as few people as possible have a higher sum than him.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we want to assign to Vasya the minimal possible a_i + b_j that is at least x, and arrange the other pairings such that as many people as possible have a higher sum than him.\n\nBut how can we find these scenarios?\n\nLet me think about the best case first. To get the best possible rank, we need to have Vasya's total as high as possible. So, we can select the maximum possible a_i + b_j that is at least x. Then, in this scenario, the number of people who have a higher sum than him would be as few as possible.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the best possible rank? For the best case, we can assume that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Then, the best possible rank is 1 if there's no one else with a higher sum. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can think of the following: Assign Vasya the maximum possible sum (say S) that is >=x. Then, count how many pairs (a_i + b_j) can be greater than S. But since we can arrange the pairings, we need to make sure that the other pairs are arranged in a way that minimizes the number of people with higher sums than S.\n\nWait, but how can we arrange the pairings to minimize the number of people with higher sums than S? Well, if S is the maximum possible, then there can't be any pair with sum higher than S. Because S is the maximum possible sum. So, in that case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but how can we find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have? Because the maximum possible sum is the maximum of a_i + b_j for all possible pairs. But since the pairings are permutations, perhaps the maximum possible sum is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. Because if you pair the largest a with the largest b, that's the maximum sum.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have is max_a + max_b. So, if that sum is >=x, then in the best case, he can be ranked first.\n\nBut wait, maybe even if that sum is higher than x, but there's another pairing where someone else has a higher sum. But no, because if you pair the maximum a with maximum b, that's the maximum possible sum. So in that case, no other pairing can have a higher sum. So in that case, Vasya can be first.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1, provided that there's at least one pair with sum >=x.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that there is at least one pair. So for the best case, the answer is 1.\n\nBut that can't be right. Let me look at the example given. In the first sample input, all a_i and b_i are 1. So the maximum sum is 2. But since all participants have sum 2, then the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nIn the second sample input, the best possible rank is 1. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple people with the same sum as Vasya? Then the jury can assign the rank as per their choice. So for the best case, we can assume that Vasya is placed first, even if others have the same sum.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But why is that possible?\n\nWait, no. Because in some cases, even if Vasya's sum is the maximum, but there are multiple people with that sum. But the problem says that the jury can assign the ranks as they choose. So, in that case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, it's always 1, as long as there exists a possible pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum. Which is possible if there's at least one pair with sum >=x. Because the maximum sum possible is the maximum a_i + maximum b_j. So if that sum is >=x, then in that pairing, Vasya can have that sum, and thus be first.\n\nBut how do we know that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible? Well, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So, if the maximum possible sum is >=x, then that's possible.\n\nBut what if the maximum possible sum is less than x? But the problem says that it is guaranteed that there exists a pair with sum >=x. So the maximum possible sum must be >=x. Therefore, in the best case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the best possible rank is always 1. But looking at the sample input, the first sample output is 1 5. Which aligns with that. The second sample output is 1 5. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut why in the second sample, the best possible is 1. Because Vasya can be assigned the maximum sum, which is 4+8=12, which is higher than others. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut then why is the best possible rank not always 1? Because perhaps there's no possible way to have Vasya's sum be the maximum. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because the problem says that there is at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So, the maximum sum is at least that value. So, if we can pair Vasya's a_i and b_j to be that maximum sum, then he will be first.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? Because the pairing is arbitrary. For example, suppose that the maximum sum is achieved by a_i and b_j. Then, in the pairing, we can assign that pair to Vasya. But the rest of the pairs can be arranged in any way. So, in that case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is always 1. So why does the sample input have 1 as the first output? Because that's correct. So then why is the problem asking for the best possible rank? Because maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe there's a case where even though there's a pair with sum >=x, but when you pair it, other people might have higher sums. Wait, but if you choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya, then no one else can have higher than that. Because that's the maximum sum possible. So, in that case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1, unless there's no possible pairing. But the problem says that there is at least one pair. So the answer for best is always 1.\n\nBut then why is the first sample output 1 5? Because that's correct. So the best possible is 1.\n\nSo the first part of the output is always 1. That seems too easy. But maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x, but in reality, Vasya's total could be higher than x. However, when considering the best possible rank, the teacher can choose to assign Vasya's pair as the maximum possible sum (which is >=x). Thus, in that scenario, Vasya's rank is 1.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. Therefore, the first part of the answer is always 1.\n\nBut that seems to be the case. So why is the problem even asking for it? Maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nLet me think of a test case. Suppose n=2, x=3. a = [1, 2], b = [2, 1]. The possible pairs are:\n\nIf pairing is (1,2) and (2,1): the sums are 3 and 3. So Vasya could be in first place (if the jury gives him first).\n\nIf pairing is (1,1) and (2,2): sums are 2 and 4. Then, Vasya's sum could be 2 (but that's less than x=3?), but the problem says that there is a pair with sum >=x. So in this case, the possible pairings are such that at least one pair is >=x.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum possible sum is 2+2=4. So for the best case, Vasya can be assigned that sum. So his rank is 1. So yes.\n\nSo the best possible is always 1. Therefore, the first part of the output is always 1.\n\nSo the first part of the answer is 1. Then, the second part is the worst possible rank.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the worst possible rank. Now, how to compute that.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and as many other participants as possible have a higher sum than him.\n\nSo, how can we model this?\n\nThe approach for the worst possible rank is:\n\nFind the minimal possible sum S that Vasya can have (S >=x), and then count the maximum number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than S. Then, the worst possible rank is that count + 1.\n\nBut how to find S and that count?\n\nBut how to find S? Because S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x, given that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is S.\n\nBut how to find the minimal S >=x such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is S.\n\nBut perhaps we can think of it as follows: To minimize S (so that more people can have higher sums), we need to choose the minimal S that is >=x. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal possible S is the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some a_i + b_j, and then arrange the rest of the pairs to maximize the number of people with sum > S.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum number of participants that can have a sum greater than Vasya's sum. To maximize this number, we need to minimize Vasya's sum (as much as possible, but still >=x), and arrange the rest of the pairs so that as many as possible have sum > S.\n\nSo, the steps for the worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible S (>=x) that can be achieved by pairing some a_i and b_j. Let's call this S_min.\n\nBut how do we find S_min? It's the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x, but such that there exists a pairing where this pair is used. However, since the pairing must be a permutation (each a and b is used once), the minimal S_min is the minimal possible value that is >=x and can be part of a valid pairing.\n\nWait, but how to find that? For example, suppose that x is 2, and a is [1, 1], b is [1, 1]. Then, any pairing gives sum 2, so S_min is 2.\n\nBut for the worst case, we need to have S as small as possible. So, in that case, S is 2, and all other participants have sum 2. So the worst possible rank is 2, since the jury can assign Vasya the last position among those with same sum.\n\nBut according to the first sample input, the worst possible rank is 5. Which is n.\n\nSo the worst possible rank depends on how many people can have sum > S, and how many have sum equal to S.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAnother approach: For the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut to maximize this number, we need to choose Vasya's sum as low as possible (but >=x), and arrange the other pairs to maximize the number of people with sum > S.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find the minimal S (>=x) such that there exists a pairing where S is Vasya's sum, and then compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the worst case:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible S (>=x) that can be achieved by pairing some a_i and b_j. Then, for that S, find the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S.\n\nBut how to find that S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nTo minimize S (so that more people can have higher sums), we can take the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. However, this may not be possible due to the constraints of pairing.\n\nWait, but how can we find the minimal S that can be achieved in some pairing. Because once we fix that S is a_i + b_j, we need to pair the rest of the a's and b's in a way that allows that pairing.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we find such S?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that in order to have Vasya's sum as small as possible, we need to assign him a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible but >=x. However, we need to make sure that the rest of the a and b can be paired such that each is used once.\n\nBut how can we find this minimal S?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can use binary search. Let me think.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to think of this as follows:\n\nWe need to select a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, and then pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that maximizes the number of pairs with sum > a_i + b_j. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst case scenario, we can think of the following:\n\nWe want to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible (but still >=x), and then count the maximum number of pairs (from the remaining a's and b's) that have sum > (a_i + b_j). Then, the worst rank is that count + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the first sample input:\n\nn=5, x=2. All a's and b's are 1. So any pair for Vasya is 2. Then, the remaining a's and b's are 4 ones each. The maximum number of pairs with sum > 2 is zero, since all are 2. So the worst rank is 5 (since 0 people have higher sum, and all 5 have same sum, so the worst possible rank is 5).\n\nIn the second sample input:\n\nn=6, x=7.\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nThe sample output for worst is 5.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, Vasya's sum is 4+3=7 (the minimal possible sum >=x). Then, how many pairs can be formed with sum >7?\n\nLet's see. The remaining a's are [4,3,5,6,4] (assuming Vasya took 4 from a and 3 from b). Wait, original a is [4,3,5,6,4,4], and b is [8,6,0,4,3,4].\n\nIf Vasya takes a_i=4 (say the first element) and b_j=3 (the fifth element). Then, the remaining a's are [3,5,6,4,4], and remaining b's are [8,6,0,4,4].\n\nNow, we need to pair these remaining a's and b's to maximize the number of pairs with sum >7.\n\nSo, for the remaining a's and b's, what is the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >7?\n\nLet me think of the optimal way to pair them. For example, to maximize the count, we need to pair the largest a's with the largest b's.\n\nSo, sort the a's in descending order and the b's in descending order, then pair them.\n\nSo sorted a's (remaining): 6,5,4,4,3\n\nsorted b's (remaining): 8,6,4,4,0\n\nPairing them:\n\n6+8=14>7 → yes\n\n5+6=11>7 → yes\n\n4+4=8>7 → yes\n\n4+4=8>7 → yes\n\n3+0=3 → no.\n\nSo total of 4 pairs with sum >7. So Vasya's sum is 7. So the worst possible rank is 4+1=5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach for the worst case is:\n\nFind the minimal possible S (>=x) that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j), then compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining a's and b's with sum > S. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to find that minimal S.\n\nBut how to find the minimal S. Since the problem requires that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x, and we need to choose the minimal such S.\n\nBut how to find that S. Because for that, we can iterate through all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) that are >=x, and for each such pair, compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining a and b with sum > S. Then, take the minimal S and the corresponding maximum count. However, this approach would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\nSo, we need a more efficient way.\n\nAlternative idea: The minimal S is the minimal value >=x that can be formed by some a_i + b_j. However, we need to find the minimal such S. But even if we find that, how do we compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S.\n\nBut even if we find that S, how to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal S is not unique. For example, there could be multiple pairs with the same sum. So, perhaps the minimal S is the minimal possible value that is >=x, and for that S, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S.\n\nBut how to find that S efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the worst case:\n\nFirst, find the minimal possible S such that S >=x and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum S. Then, for that S, compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S.\n\nBut how to find S.\n\nBut even that is not straightforward.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can think that for the worst case scenario, we need to choose S as small as possible. So, the minimal S is the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some a_i + b_j. However, to find that minimal S, perhaps we can generate all possible a_i + b_j >=x, and find the minimal among them. But for n up to 1e5, this would be O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nBut that's not feasible. So, how can we find the minimal S >=x that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j)?\n\nAh, but the problem is that the pairing is not fixed. For example, even if there exists some a_i and b_j with sum S >=x, but when you take that pair, the rest of the a's and b's can be paired. However, for the minimal S, perhaps we can ignore the pairing constraints and just find the minimal possible sum >=x. Because for any such sum, there exists a way to pair the rest of the elements.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, suppose that we have a_i = [1, 2], b_j = [3, 4]. Suppose x is 3. The minimal S is 1+3=4 (but also 2+3=5, etc). However, if we take the pair (1,3) as Vasya's, then the remaining a is [2], and remaining b is [4], which can be paired. So that's okay. So, in general, if there exists any pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x, then we can take that pair as Vasya's, and pair the rest of the elements. Because even if we remove a_i and b_j, the rest can be paired as long as there are n-1 elements left. Which is possible.\n\nSo, the minimal S is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. So, to find that, we can compute all possible a_i + b_j and find the minimal one that is >=x. However, for n up to 1e5, this would be O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nBut that's not feasible. So how else can we find the minimal possible S?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher can choose any possible pairing. So, for the worst case, the teacher can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x as Vasya's. So, the minimal possible S is the minimal possible sum >=x across all possible pairs. But how can we find this minimal S without checking all O(n^2) pairs?\n\nAh! Because the minimal S is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. To find this, we can sort the a array and the b array. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, take the minimal of all such a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nYes! Here's the idea: sort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order. For each a_i, find the smallest b_j that when added to a_i is >=x. Then, for each a_i, the minimal such b_j is found via binary search. Then, the minimal S is the minimal among all these a_i + b_j.\n\nBut wait, this approach finds the minimal possible sum for any pair (a_i, b_j) that is >=x. However, this is not considering that once we select a_i and b_j, the rest of the pairs must be formed. However, as discussed earlier, for the purpose of finding S, we can ignore that constraint, because the rest of the pairs can be formed in some way (as long as there exists at least one pair, which is guaranteed).\n\nBut this approach would give us the minimal possible S that is >=x. Once we have that S, we can proceed to calculate the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S, given that a_i and b_j are removed from their respective arrays.\n\nSo the steps for the worst case would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible S (>=x) that can be achieved by any pair (a_i, b_j).\n\n2. Once S is found, remove one occurrence of a_i and b_j from their arrays (for example, the a_i and b_j that contribute to S).\n\n3. Then, compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining a and b arrays with sum > S. This is done by sorting the remaining a in descending order and remaining b in descending order, then greedily pairing them.\n\nThe maximum number of such pairs is the count of pairs that can be formed with sum > S.\n\nThen, the worst possible rank is count + 1.\n\nBut how to implement step 1.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose a is [4,3,5,6,4,4], b is [8,6,0,4,3,4], x=7.\n\nWe need to find the minimal S >=7. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=7.\n\nLet's sort a and b.\n\na sorted: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nb sorted: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\nFor each a_i in sorted a:\n\na_i = 3. Need b_j >=7-3=4. The smallest b_j >=4 is 4. So 3+4=7.\n\na_i=4. Need b_j >=3. The smallest is 0? No, 0 is less than 3. Wait, 7 -4=3. So need b_j >=3. The smallest such in b is 3. So 4+3=7.\n\nSimilarly for other a_i's. So the minimal S is 7.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the approach for finding S is:\n\nSort a and b. For each a_i in sorted a, find the minimal b_j (using binary search) such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal S is the minimum of all a_i + b_j for which this is possible.\n\nOnce we find that S, then we need to find how many pairs can be formed from the remaining a and b (after removing one a_i and one b_j) with sum > S.\n\nBut how to find which a_i and b_j to remove. Because there may be multiple pairs that give S.\n\nBut for the worst case scenario, we need to choose the pair (a_i, b_j) that allows the maximum number of pairs with sum > S. Wait, no. Because once S is fixed (the minimal possible), we need to choose the pair (a_i, b_j) that, when removed, leaves the rest of the a and b arrays such that the maximum number of pairs with sum > S can be formed.\n\nBut this complicates things. Because for different pairs (a_i, b_j) that sum to S, removing them may leave different remaining arrays, leading to different counts.\n\nBut perhaps, for the worst case, we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) that gives S, and then proceed to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S.\n\nBut how to choose which pair to remove. For example, if there are multiple pairs that give S, which one to choose to maximize the number of pairs with sum > S?\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to choose the pair (a_i, b_j) that allows the maximum number of pairs with sum > S. However, how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, since S is the minimal possible, we can assume that after removing any pair that gives S, the remaining arrays can be paired optimally.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, given the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to find the minimal S as described, and then for the remaining a and b arrays (after removing one a_i and one b_j that sum to S), compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S.\n\nBut how to choose which a_i and b_j to remove. For example, in the sample case, the pair (4,3) gives S=7. But there are other pairs that give S=7, like (3,4), (4,3), etc. Removing different pairs may affect the remaining arrays.\n\nBut perhaps the way to proceed is to find the minimal S, and then for that S, find the maximum possible number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S, regardless of which a_i and b_j were used to form S.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S is determined as described, and then the maximum number of pairs with sum > S can be computed by considering all a and b, and subtracting one occurrence of a_i and b_j that sum to S.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me think of this:\n\nOnce we have the minimal S, we can compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S. But since we have to remove one a_i and one b_j (the ones used for Vasya's sum), the maximum number of pairs would be the maximum possible pairs (with sum > S) in the full a and b arrays, minus 1 if the pair (a_i, b_j) that was removed contributes to that count.\n\nWait, but this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nOnce S is determined, we can compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the entire a and b arrays with sum > S. Then, subtract 1 if the pair (a_i, b_j) that gives S is counted in that maximum number. But this is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S is the same as the maximum number of pairs in the full arrays, minus whether the pair (a_i, b_j) is counted in that maximum. But again, not sure.\n\nBut given that the problem requires that after selecting the pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya, the rest of the pairs are formed, perhaps the maximum number of pairs with sum > S can be found as follows:\n\nTake the full a and b arrays, sort them in descending order. Pair them greedily. Then, count how many pairs have sum > S. Then, subtract 1 if the pair (a_i, b_j) used for Vasya is part of that count. But again, this is not straightforward.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps there's a better way.\n\nLet me think again. Once S is determined, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the entire a and b arrays (without any removal), minus 1 if the pair (a_i, b_j) that was used for Vasya is part of that maximum. But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S, assuming that one pair (a_i, b_j) is removed. But how to do this efficiently.\n\nThis seems challenging. Perhaps, given the time constraints, the following approach can be considered:\n\nOnce we have determined the minimal S, we can proceed as follows:\n\n- Sort the a array in descending order and the b array in descending order.\n\n- Pair them greedily, counting how many pairs have sum > S. Let's call this count_total.\n\n- Now, since we have to remove one pair (a_i, b_j) that sums to S, we need to adjust count_total by subtracting 1 if that pair was part of the count_total.\n\nBut how to find whether that pair was part of the count_total.\n\nBut this is not straightforward. Because the greedy pairing may have included that pair or not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nOnce S is determined, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the entire a and b arrays, with sum > S. Then, since one pair (a_i, b_j) is removed (which sums to S), the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the remaining arrays is count_total - 1 if that pair was part of the count_total, or count_total if it wasn't.\n\nBut how to know if that pair was part of the count_total.\n\nBut perhaps this is not necessary. Because the pair (a_i, b_j) that sums to S may not be part of the count_total. For example, if S is 7 and the pair (a_i, b_j) is 7, which is not greater than S. So in this case, the count_total is the number of pairs with sum > S, and the removal of this pair does not affect it.\n\nThus, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S in the remaining arrays is count_total.\n\nBut this would be incorrect if the pair (a_i, b_j) was part of the count_total. But since S is the minimal sum >=x, and the pair (a_i, b_j) has sum exactly S, which is not greater than S, it cannot be part of count_total. Thus, the count_total remains the same.\n\nWait, this makes sense. Because count_total is the number of pairs with sum > S. The pair (a_i, b_j) that we removed has sum exactly S, which is not greater than S. So removing it doesn't affect the count_total.\n\nThus, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S in the remaining arrays is count_total.\n\nBut how to compute count_total.\n\nAh! So the approach is:\n\nOnce S is determined, the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum > S is the maximum number of pairs possible from the full arrays (without removing any pair), which is computed by sorting a and b in descending order and pairing them greedily.\n\nBecause when we remove one pair (a_i, b_j) that sums to S, which is not part of the count_total, the count_total remains the same.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor the worst case:\n\n1. Find the minimal S >=x.\n\n2. Compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S from the full arrays. Let's call this count.\n\n3. The worst possible rank is count + 1.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause in this scenario, Vasya's sum is S, and there are count pairs with sum > S. So, Vasya's rank is count + 1.\n\nBut how to compute count.\n\nYes. For example, in the first sample, S is 2. The maximum number of pairs with sum > 2 is zero. So count is zero, and rank is zero + 1 = 1? No, but the sample says the worst rank is 5.\n\nWait, there's a contradiction here. What's wrong here?\n\nIn the first sample, all pairs have sum 2. So count is zero. So the worst possible rank is 0+1 = 1? But the sample says it's 5.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. Because count is the number of pairs with sum > S. But in the first sample, all pairs have sum equal to S. So count is zero. But the worst possible rank is n, because all participants have sum equal to S. So the rank is 5.\n\nBut according to the formula count + 1, it would be 0 + 1 = 1, which is wrong.\n\nSo there's a flaw in the previous logic. What's wrong here?\n\nThe problem is that the count is the number of pairs with sum > S. But the other participants can have sum equal to S. So, the worst possible rank depends on how many people have sum > S, and how many have sum equal to S.\n\nIn the first sample, all participants have sum equal to S. So, the worst possible rank is n.\n\nBut according to the formula count + ",
