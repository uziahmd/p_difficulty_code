Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border of non-zero length. So, each step is moving between adjacent blocks that share a segment of a road.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? Well, the key is to model the blocks as nodes in a graph, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent (i.e., share a boundary segment). Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Since there are infinite blocks, but the number of roads is up to 300, maybe there's another approach. Wait, perhaps instead of considering all possible blocks, we can model the problem based on the regions divided by the lines. But how?\n\nAnother thought: Each time you cross a road, you move into a different block. However, the movement is allowed only if the two blocks share a common boundary segment. So, the adjacency between blocks depends on the roads they are separated by.\n\nWait, but how can I determine which blocks are adjacent? That seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to model the problem using BFS, where each state is determined by the set of roads that separate the current block from the home block. But that might not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the number of roads that separate the home block from the current block. Wait, no, that's not directly applicable here. Because each road divides the plane into two parts. So, for any given point (home or university), the position relative to each road can be determined. For example, for each road, the home is either on one side or the other. Similarly for the university.\n\nIf two blocks are adjacent, then they must differ by exactly one road. Because crossing a road takes you from one block to another. Wait, but if you cross a road, you enter a neighboring block. So, the adjacency between blocks can be determined by their difference in the sign of the equations of the roads.\n\nSo, here's an idea: Each block can be uniquely identified by the signs of the expressions (a_i x + b_i y + c_i) for each road. But since there are n roads, each with two possibilities (positive or negative), the total number of possible combinations is 2^n. However, since the actual number of blocks is O(2^n), but for n=300, that's impossible to handle directly. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires us to find the minimal steps between two blocks. So, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents the region (block) that the home is in, and then the regions that can be reached by crossing roads. But again, the problem is how to model these regions.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of each region as being defined by the sign of each road. For example, for each road i, the home is in one of two regions (either a_i x + b_i y + c_i > 0 or < 0). Similarly for the university. Then, the minimal steps between the two regions would be determined by the number of roads that separate them. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, suppose that two regions are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road. Because to move between them, you cross that road. So, the minimal steps between the home and university regions would be the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to get from the home's region to the university's region. However, this is not exactly correct because the regions might be separated by multiple roads, but the steps can be taken by crossing roads in some order.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node is a state of the signs of the roads. But again, with n up to 300, that's impossible. So that's not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university regions. Because each step allows you to cross one road. But how?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose that the home is in region A and the university is in region B. The regions are separated by some roads. The minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that you have to cross to get from A to B. However, since each crossing moves you across a road, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that separate A and B. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region, and edges exist between regions that share a common boundary (so, they differ by exactly one road). Then, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of edges to traverse between the home region and the university region.\n\nBut how to model this? Since the number of regions is exponential, it's impossible to model all regions explicitly.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the parity of the number of roads that separate the home and university. Wait, no. For example, suppose that the home and university are on opposite sides of one road. Then, the minimal steps is 1. If they are on opposite sides of two roads, but those roads are not adjacent, then the minimal steps could be 2 (crossing each road once). But if the two roads are intersecting, then maybe the regions are adjacent through some path.\n\nWait, but how can we model this? Maybe the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of roads that you have to cross to get from the home to the university. Because each step crosses exactly one road. So the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university regions, but that's not necessarily true. Because maybe there's a way to cross roads in such a way that the steps are fewer than the number of differing roads.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is the set of roads that you have crossed an odd number of times. Wait, this is getting too abstract.\n\nLet me think of the problem differently. Let's consider the home and university positions. For each road, we can determine whether the home is on one side of the road or the other. Similarly for the university. For each road, if the home and university are on the same side of that road, then that road does not separate them. Otherwise, it does.\n\nThe minimal number of steps needed is the minimal number of roads that you have to cross to get from the home to the university. Because each step crosses exactly one road. So, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that separate the home and the university, but how?\n\nWait, suppose that the home and university are on opposite sides of k roads. Then, the minimal steps needed is k, but maybe not. Because crossing roads can change the position relative to other roads. For example, if two roads cross each other, then crossing one road may change the position relative to the other road.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once. For example, if the home and university are separated by k roads, then you need to cross each of those roads once. But how to determine that?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose there are two roads, which cross each other. The home is in the region that is positive for both roads. The university is in the region that is negative for both roads. Then, the home and university are separated by both roads. But the minimal steps to get from home to university is 2 steps: cross one road, then cross the other. But maybe there's a way to cross one road and then cross the same road again? No, because that would bring you back. So yes, two steps.\n\nAnother example: suppose there's one road. Home is on one side, university on the other. So minimal steps is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: three roads, arranged in such a way that the home and university are separated by two roads. But maybe there's a path that crosses one road and then another, leading to the university. Then steps is 2.\n\nSo, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Wait, but how to compute that?\n\nWait, for each road, check whether the home and the university are on opposite sides. The number of such roads is the minimal steps. Because each such road must be crossed once. Because, if you cross a road, you can flip the sign for that road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nWait, that seems to fit the examples. Let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 (which is y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0).\n\nCheck for each road:\n\nFor the first road (y=0): home is (1,1) → 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1>0. University is (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So this road separates them. So count +=1.\n\nSecond road (x=0): home x is 1>0, university is -1<0. Also separates. So count is 2. Output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0.\n\nCheck each road:\n\nFirst road (x=0): home is +, univ is -, so separate. Count +=1.\n\nSecond road (y=0): same as before. Count +=1.\n\nThird road: x + y -3 =0. For home (1+1-3) = -1 <0. University: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. So same sign. Not separated. So total count is 2. Output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to work. So the answer is simply the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nWait, that's a very simple solution. So why is the problem considered as a programming problem? Because perhaps the answer is the number of roads that separate the two points. But how to confirm this?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose there are two roads, which are parallel. Home is on one side of both roads, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, the number of separating roads is 2. But to get from home to university, you need to cross both roads, which would require two steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: two roads that cross. The home is in a region that is on the same side of both roads as the university. Then, the answer is zero steps. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by one road. Then answer is 1.\n\nSo according to this logic, the answer is the number of roads for which the home and university lie on opposite sides.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because each road that separates them must be crossed once. And since each step crosses exactly one road, the minimal steps is the number of such roads.\n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where you cross a road that doesn't separate them, but somehow reach the university faster?\n\nWait, suppose there are two roads, road A and road B. Suppose home is on the positive side of A and B, and the university is on the positive side of A and negative of B. So the number of separating roads is 1 (road B). So the minimal steps is 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if there's another road C, which is not separating home and university, but crossing it would allow you to reach the university in fewer steps? Well, no. Because crossing a road that doesn't separate them would take you to a region that's not closer to the university. Because the university is on the same side of that road as the home. So crossing that road would take you to a region that's on the opposite side of that road, but the university is still on the same side as the original. So that would not help.\n\nTherefore, the minimal steps required is indeed the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: for each road, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. The count of such roads is the answer.\n\nSo how to compute this?\n\nFor each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If their product is negative, then the points are on opposite sides of the road, so count it.\n\nBut wait, the road equation is a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. So for a point (x,y), the value is evaluated as (a_i x + b_i y + c_i). The sign of this value determines which side of the road the point is on. So for two points, if the signs are different, then they are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nSo for each road, compute val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i, val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. If val1 * val2 < 0, then count +=1.\n\nSo the answer is the count of such roads.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 are not zero. Therefore, their product is negative if and only if they are on opposite sides.\n\nYes. So the code becomes:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2), n roads.\n\nFor each road, compute val1 and val2. If val1 * val2 < 0, increment count.\n\nOutput count.\n\nBut let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nHome (1,1), univ (-1,-1). Roads:\n\nFirst road: 0 1 0 → equation is 0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0.\n\nval1 = 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → x=0. val1 is 1*1 +0 +0 =1. val2 is -1. product -1 → count +=1. Total 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nRoads are x=0, y=0, x + y -3 =0.\n\nFor the third road, val1 is 1+1-3 = -1. val2 is -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no count. So total 2 roads (x=0 and y=0) → output 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because each road that separates the two points must be crossed once. And since each step crosses exactly one road, the minimal steps is the number of such roads.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where two roads are crossed in a way that allows you to reach the destination in fewer steps?\n\nLike, suppose there are two roads, A and B, which cross each other. The home is in a region that is on the positive side of A and positive of B. The university is on negative of A and negative of B. So the number of separating roads is 2. So the answer is 2. But can you cross A and then B, which would take two steps. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nAnother case: three roads arranged such that the home and university are separated by two roads, but there's a way to cross one road and then cross another road that is not separating them. But that's not possible. Because after crossing a road, you are in a region that is on the opposite side of that road. But the university is on the opposite side of two roads. So, you need to cross both roads.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the answer is indeed the count of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, let's implement this.\n\nRead x1, y1, then x2, y2, then n, then read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each road:\n\ncompute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 <0 → count +=1\n\nThen output count.\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nBut why is the problem considered as a competitive programming problem? Because maybe the initial thinking is more complex, but the actual solution is simple.\n\nSo the code is easy to write.\n\nNow, let's test for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=0. But according to input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, no: input says third line is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n can't be zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when home and university are separated by zero roads. So output is 0. For example, when they are in the same block.\n\nAnother case: when all roads are separating. For example, home and university are on opposite sides of all roads. Then the answer is n.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead input:\n\nFirst line: x1, y1.\n\nSecond line: x2, y2.\n\nThird line: n.\n\nThen n lines of a, b, c.\n\nCompute count.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the first two lines as integers.\n\nThen read n, then read n lines.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nThird road: a=1, b=1, c=-3.\n\nval1 = 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1.\n\nval2 = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0. So not counted. So count is 2. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code works.\n\nSo the problem is solved with this approach. The key insight was realizing that the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. That's a clever observation, but once you see it, the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block to a destination block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common boundary between two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move between these regions. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\n1. **Reading Input**: We first read the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Checking Separation**: For each road, we evaluate the position of both the home and university relative to the road. If they are on opposite sides of the road, we count that road as a separator.\n3. **Counting Separators**: The total count of such separating roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home to the university.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Coordinates**: The coordinates of the home and university are read from the input.\n2. **Reading Roads**: The number of roads and their coefficients are read.\n3. **Evaluating Road Separation**: For each road, we compute the value of the linear equation at the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, thus requiring a step across this road.\n4. **Counting Steps**: The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps needed, as each separating road must be crossed once to move from the home to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the geometric properties of lines dividing the plane, ensuring an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of roads.",
