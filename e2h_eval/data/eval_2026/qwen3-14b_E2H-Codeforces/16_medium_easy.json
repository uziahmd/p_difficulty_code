Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step involves crossing a common border of non-zero length between two blocks.\n\nHmm, first, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how? Since each road divides the plane into regions, the blocks are regions divided by these lines. The challenge is to represent each block in a way that allows us to compute adjacency efficiently.\n\nBut considering that the number of roads can be up to 300, the number of blocks could be huge. So enumerating all blocks isn't feasible. So there must be a smarter approach.\n\nWait, the key here is that movement between blocks is allowed if they share a common border (non-zero length). So, moving from one block to another requires crossing a line (road). But each road is a line that separates two regions. So, for any given block, the adjacent blocks are those that are separated by one of the roads.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe think of each block as being determined by the sign of the equations of each road. Because for each road, a point lies on one side or the other. So the position of a point relative to each road can be represented as a set of signs. For example, for each road i, compute whether the point is on the positive side (a_i x + b_i y + c_i > 0) or negative side (a_i x + b_i y + c_i < 0). Then, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because changing the sign across one road would mean you cross that road, hence adjacent.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the two regions are separated by that road. However, if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are adjacent. Because the road is the boundary between them. So the adjacency is determined by differing in exactly one road's sign.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to modeling the home and university positions as nodes in a graph, where each node is a signature of signs for all roads. Then, two nodes are connected if their signatures differ in exactly one road. The question is then to find the minimal number of steps (edges) between the home's signature and the university's signature.\n\nBut how do we compute this? Because the number of possible signatures is 2^n, which for n=300 is impossible. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Let's think about the problem in terms of BFS. But since the number of possible states is 2^300, it's impossible to track them all. So that approach isn't going to work.\n\nAlternative idea: The minimal steps between the home and university is the number of roads that separate them. Wait, no. Because each step can cross one road. So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the home and the university. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. Because each step can cross one road. For example, if the home and university are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps is k. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, think of each road as a hyperplane. The home and university are in different regions. The minimal steps needed is the number of hyperplanes (roads) that separate them. But how to compute that?\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, imagine two points separated by two roads. If they are on opposite sides of both roads, then maybe you can cross one road, then another. So steps would be 2. Which matches the number of separating roads.\n\nBut what if the two points are separated by three roads, but some of them are overlapping? Or perhaps not. Wait, but each road is a line. The problem is that the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that you have to cross to get from the home to the university.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal number of roads that separate the two points?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region (block), and edges exist between regions that are adjacent. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home's region and the university's region.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to represent the regions and compute their adjacency.\n\nBut here's an alternative approach. For each road, the home and university may be on the same side or different sides. Let's compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides. Let me explain:\n\nFor each road i, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If these two values have opposite signs, then the road separates the home and the university. Let's count the number of such roads. Let's call this count 'k'. Then, the minimal steps is k. But why?\n\nBecause each step can cross one road. So, if there are k roads separating the two points, then you need to cross each of them once. But how does that ensure that the path exists?\n\nWait, maybe not. Because suppose two points are separated by two roads. But those roads are parallel. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. But if the roads are arranged in a way that allows crossing them in sequence.\n\nBut how can we be sure that the minimal steps is equal to the number of roads separating the two points?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose there are two roads. Home is in a region that is on the positive side of both roads, and the university is on the negative side of both. Then, the number of separating roads is 2. To get from home to university, you need to cross both roads. So the minimal steps is 2. Which matches the count.\n\nAnother example: if there are two roads that cross each other. The home is on one side of road 1, and on the same side of road 2 as the university. The university is on the opposite side of road 1. Then, the separating roads count is 1. So the minimal steps is 1.\n\nBut what if the two points are separated by k roads, but there's a way to cross them in fewer steps? For example, if two roads cross each other, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then, the number of separating roads is 2. But can you cross both roads in one step? No, because each step can cross only one road. So you need to cross each road once, which takes two steps.\n\nTherefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university.\n\nBut how can we be sure that this is always the case?\n\nBecause each time you cross a road, you can flip the sign for that road. So, the minimal steps required is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. Because for each such road, you need to cross it once.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple roads that are not separating the two points, but you have to cross them in order to reach the destination? For example, imagine three roads arranged in a triangle. Suppose home is inside the triangle and the university is outside. Then, the number of separating roads is 3. But to get out, you have to cross each of the three roads. So steps would be 3.\n\nBut what if there's a scenario where two points are separated by k roads, but there's a path that crosses some roads more than once, but ends up with a shorter path? Probably not. Because each step crosses exactly one road. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nWait, but how do we know that the two points are in regions that can be connected by crossing exactly the roads that separate them?\n\nThis seems to be the case. Because, each time you cross a road that separates the two points, you reduce the number of separating roads by one. But perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the two points are separated by two roads. Suppose you cross one of them, but then you are in a region that is still separated by the other road. Then, you have to cross that one. So steps is 2.\n\nBut if the two roads are arranged such that crossing one road allows you to cross another road in the same step? No, because each step crosses exactly one road. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Because each such road must be crossed once, and each step crosses exactly one road.\n\nSo the solution is to compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. The answer is the count of such roads.\n\nWait, but let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Two roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0; and 1x + 0y + 0 = 0 → x=0.\n\nFor each road:\n\nFor road 1 (y=0):\n\nHome: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 → positive.\n\nUniversity: 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 → negative. So opposite signs. So this road counts.\n\nFor road 2 (x=0):\n\nHome: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1 → positive.\n\nUniversity: 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 → negative. Opposite signs. So count is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x + y -3 =0.\n\nFor each road:\n\nRoad 1 (x=0): home is positive, univ is negative → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2 (y=0): same as before → count +=1.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 = 0. For home (1+1-3) = -1 → negative. For university (-1-1-3) = -5 → also negative. Same sign. So no count. So total is 2, which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo the sample outputs match this approach.\n\nSo the answer is to compute the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nThat's a very simple solution. So how do we check if two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nFor a line ax + by + c = 0, the sign of ax + by + c for a point (x,y) determines which side of the line the point is on. So for the home (x1,y1) and university (x2,y2), compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If val1 * val2 < 0, then they are on opposite sides. So we count that road.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each road:\n\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but why is this correct?\n\nBecause each such road must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate the two points.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where two roads are crossed in a way that allows you to reach the destination in fewer steps?\n\nLike, suppose there are two roads that cross each other. Suppose the home is in one quadrant, the university in another. Suppose the two roads separate the home and university. So the count is 2. But perhaps you can cross one road, then cross another, but that's two steps. Which is the same as the count. So the answer is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are three roads, but the home and university are separated by two of them. Then the answer is 2.\n\nSo according to this logic, the answer is simply the count of roads that separate the two points.\n\nThis seems to be the case. Thus, the code is straightforward.\n\nSo the problem is easy once you realize that the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points.\n\nNow, let's check the constraints. The input can be up to 300 roads. For each road, we compute the values. So O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the home coordinates, then the university coordinates, then n, then n lines.\n\nThen for each line, compute val1 and val2, check if their product is negative.\n\nCount the number of such roads.\n\nOutput the count.\n\nBut wait, what about when a road is such that the home is on the line? But the problem statement says that neither home nor university is on any road. So val1 and val2 can't be zero. So no need to worry about that.\n\nYes, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So val1 and val2 are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nSo the sample input:\n\nFirst case:\n\nRoads are y=0 and x=0. The home (1,1) is positive for both. The university (-1,-1) is negative for both. So product is negative for both roads. Count is 2. Output is 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nThree roads. The third road is x + y -3 = 0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1. For university (-1,-1): -1-1-3 = -5. Both negative. So product is positive. So not counted. So count is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nThus, the Python code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each a, b, c:\n\nval1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\nval2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0:\n\ncount +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code. It's very simple. Let me test it against the samples.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor first road (0, 1, 0): val1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road (1,0,0): val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product -1 <0 → count +=1. Total 2 → output 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nFirst road: a=1, b=0, c=0. val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0=1. val2 =1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=0, b=1, c=0 → same as before. val1 is 1, val2 -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: a=1, b=1, c=-3. val1 is 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 =-1. val2 is 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. So total 2. Output 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo the Python code can be written as follows.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move between these regions. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equal to the number of roads that separate these two points.\n\nTo determine if a road separates the two points, we evaluate the sign of the linear equation for each road at both points. If the signs are different, the points lie on opposite sides of the road, and thus the road must be crossed.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Separation**: For each road, we compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads**: Each road that separates the home and university is counted. The total count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
