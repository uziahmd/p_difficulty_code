You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find the minimum number of edges to add to form an odd-length cycle, and the number of ways to do that. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's required. A simple cycle of odd length with each vertex appearing once. So, the cycle must be of length at least 3 (since it's more than one vertex), and the length must be odd. \n\nWait, but how does adding edges affect this? Let me think. The original graph might already have such a cycle. If it does, then t is 0 and w is 1? Or maybe there are multiple ways. Wait, no. Because if the graph already has an odd-length cycle, then the answer is t=0 and w=1? Or maybe the number of ways depends on how many existing cycles there are. But the problem says that the output is the number of ways to add t edges. So if there's already an odd-length cycle, then t is 0, and w is 1? Or maybe the number of possible ways to add zero edges (i.e., the number of existing odd cycles)? Wait, no. Because the problem says that the way to add edges is considered as the set of edges added. If the graph already contains an odd cycle, then adding zero edges would count as a valid way. But how many such ways are there? Well, if there's more than one existing odd cycle, but the question is about the number of ways to add edges. However, since adding zero edges is the only way when t=0, but the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges. So, if the graph already has at least one odd cycle, then the answer for t is 0 and w is 1? Because the way is to add zero edges. But wait, maybe there are multiple ways? No, because adding zero edges is just one way. Unless the problem counts different existing cycles as different ways, but that's not the case. Because the problem says that two ways are considered equal if they have the same set of added edges. So, if the graph already has an odd cycle, then the way is to add zero edges. Therefore, the answer would be t=0 and w=1. But wait, in the sample input, for example, the second input is a triangle (3 nodes connected in a cycle). The output is 0 1. Which matches that. So that makes sense.\n\nSo the first thing to check is whether the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If it does, then the answer is t=0 and w=1. Otherwise, we need to find the minimum number of edges to add to create such a cycle.\n\nNow, how to determine if a graph has an odd-length cycle. Oh right! A bipartite graph does not have any odd-length cycles. So if the graph is bipartite, then there are no odd-length cycles. Otherwise, there is at least one. So the first step is to check if the graph is bipartite. If it's not bipartite, then t is 0 and w is 1. But if it is bipartite, then we need to add edges to make it non-bipartite, which would introduce an odd-length cycle.\n\nWait, but the graph may consist of multiple connected components. Each connected component can be checked for bipartiteness. So the entire graph is bipartite if all its connected components are bipartite. So the first thing is to check if the graph is bipartite. If it's not, then the answer is t=0 and w=1. Otherwise, proceed to calculate t and w.\n\nBut how to compute t and w when the graph is bipartite?\n\nSo, when the graph is bipartite, adding edges to create an odd-length cycle. How can that be done?\n\nWell, the minimal number of edges to add. Let's think: For a bipartite graph, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of a connected component would create an odd-length cycle. Because in a bipartition, all paths between two nodes in the same partition have even length. Adding an edge between them creates a cycle of odd length (path length +1). \n\nBut to create an odd-length cycle, we need to connect two nodes in the same partition. So, for each connected component, which is bipartite, we can look at the two partitions. Suppose the component has partitions A and B. Then, adding any edge between two nodes in A or between two nodes in B would create an odd cycle. \n\nBut the minimal number of edges to add is 1. Because adding a single such edge would create an odd cycle. So, if the graph is bipartite, then the minimal t is 1. But wait, what if the graph is bipartite but has a connected component with only one node? For example, if a connected component is a single node. Then, the bipartition is {A}, {B} where A is size 1 and B is size 0. Then, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition is impossible here. But since the component is a single node, there's no way to create an odd cycle by adding edges. Wait, but the component is a single node. Adding any edge would require connecting it to another node. But that would be adding an edge between the node and another node. However, since the component is isolated, perhaps the graph has multiple components. \n\nWait, but the problem requires that the cycle is formed. So, for example, if the graph is bipartite and consists of multiple connected components. Let's think about the case where the graph is bipartite. Then, to create an odd-length cycle, we need to add edges in such a way that there's a cycle of odd length. \n\nLet me think about the minimal t. Let's consider the case where the graph is bipartite. Then, the minimal t is 1 if there exists at least two nodes in the same partition of some connected component. But if all connected components are bipartite and for each component, the two partitions have sizes such that one of them is 1 (like a tree with one node in one partition and others in the other?), then maybe adding an edge between two components could create an odd cycle. \n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the graph is bipartite. So, each connected component is bipartite. To create an odd cycle, you need to add edges such that there is a cycle of odd length. How can that be achieved?\n\nCase 1: Add an edge within a connected component. For example, in a connected component that is bipartite, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition. This creates an odd-length cycle. So, the minimal t is 1. \n\nBut if the connected component is a single node (so no edges), then adding any edge would connect it to another node. But that would create a connected component that's a tree (if the other component is connected). Wait, but adding an edge between two nodes in different components. Let's say the graph has two components, each being a single node. Then, adding an edge between them would form a component with two nodes connected by an edge. That's a bipartition (each node in separate partitions). So, no odd cycle. So, to create an odd cycle, you need to add edges in such a way that you create a cycle. For example, if the graph has three nodes, each as separate components. Then, adding edges between them in a way that forms a triangle. But that requires adding two edges. Because initially, there are no edges. So adding edges between 1-2, 2-3, and 1-3 would form a triangle. But to form a triangle, you need to add two edges (since the initial graph has none). So, in this case, the minimal t is 2. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, then:\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd-length cycle. \n\nThe minimal t is either 1 or 2, depending on the structure of the graph.\n\nLet me think again. \n\nIn a bipartite graph, adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of a connected component will create an odd-length cycle. So, if there exists a connected component with at least two nodes, then we can add such an edge. So, the minimal t is 1. However, if all connected components are single-node components (i.e., n nodes with no edges), then adding any single edge would not create an odd cycle. Because that edge connects two nodes, forming a component which is a tree (so bipartitioned). To create an odd cycle, you need to add edges that form a cycle. For example, in a graph with 3 nodes and no edges, adding two edges (say 1-2, 1-3, and 2-3) would form a triangle. But to form a triangle, you need to add two edges. Wait, no. If you add two edges, like 1-2 and 2-3, then you have a path of length 2. But that's not a cycle. To form a cycle, you need to have a closed loop. So, for three nodes, you need three edges. So adding two edges would not create a cycle. So, in order to create a cycle, you need to add enough edges to form a cycle. \n\nSo, for a graph that is bipartite and consists of all isolated nodes (no edges), then the minimal number of edges to add is 3 (to form a triangle). But that would require adding three edges. However, that's not the minimal. Wait, but maybe there's a better way. For example, if the graph is composed of multiple components, each being a single node. Then, adding edges between three nodes to form a triangle would require adding three edges. But that's not possible. Wait, no. For three nodes, you need three edges to form a triangle. So, adding three edges. But that would be t=3. However, perhaps there's a way to add fewer edges. \n\nWait, no. Because if there are three nodes with no edges, then adding two edges would form a path of two edges (so two nodes connected to a third). No cycle. To form a cycle, you need at least three edges. So, in this case, the minimal t is 3. But that's a lot. However, what if the graph has more than three nodes? For example, if there are four nodes, all isolated. Then, to create a cycle of three nodes, you need to add three edges. Alternatively, create a cycle of four nodes (even length) which is not acceptable. So, the minimal is three edges. \n\nBut this seems to complicate the problem. How do we handle this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is determined based on the number of connected components. Let me think again. \n\nIf the graph is bipartite, then:\n\nCase 1: There exists a connected component with at least two nodes. Then, adding one edge between two nodes in the same partition of that component would create an odd cycle. So t is 1.\n\nCase 2: All connected components are single-node components. Then, the minimal t is 3, but wait, how can you form an odd-length cycle? For example, to form a triangle, you need three nodes and three edges. So, if the graph has n ≥ 3 nodes, then you can add three edges to form a triangle. But the minimal number of edges to add is 3. However, in this case, the problem says that the answer is t=3 and w is the number of ways to choose three nodes and form a triangle. But for the case where n is 3 and m is zero, then adding three edges (all possible edges) would create a triangle. So the number of ways is 1. \n\nBut according to the sample input, the third example is n=3, m=0, and the output is 3 1. Which matches that. So that's correct. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFirst, check if the graph is bipartite. If not, then t=0 and w=1.\n\nElse, if the graph is bipartite:\n\nCheck if there is at least one connected component with size ≥ 2. If yes, then t=1, and w is the number of possible edges that can be added between two nodes in the same partition of any connected component. \n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nFor each connected component, which is bipartite, we can split into two partitions A and B. Let the size of A be a, and size of B be b. The number of possible edges that can be added between two nodes in the same partition is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2). But since adding any of these edges would create an odd-length cycle. \n\nSo, for all connected components, the total number of such edges is the sum over all components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2). However, we need to count the number of ways to add exactly t edges. Since t is 1, the answer is the total number of such possible edges. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that we have to find the number of ways to add exactly t edges to form an odd-length cycle. So, when t=1, the number of ways is the number of possible edges that can be added to create an odd cycle. \n\nBut in this scenario, adding any such edge will create an odd cycle. So the number of ways is the sum for each connected component of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2).\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple connected components. For example, suppose there are two connected components, each with a_i and b_i. Adding an edge in one of them would create an odd cycle. So all those edges are valid options. \n\nSo, in this case, the answer for w is the sum over all connected components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2).\n\nBut what if the graph is bipartite and there are multiple connected components, but each has only one node. For example, if n=4, m=0. Then, each component is a single node. So, adding any edge would not create an odd cycle. So, the minimal t is 3, and the number of ways is the number of possible triangles. How to compute that?\n\nIn this case, the minimal t is 3. Because you need to add three edges to form a triangle. But how many ways are there? For example, if there are four nodes, then the number of possible triangles is C(4,3) = 4. Each triangle requires adding three edges. So, for each triplet of nodes, you have to add all three edges. So the number of ways is the number of triplets. \n\nBut how to compute this in general. \n\nSo, the overall approach is:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite:\n\n   if there exists at least one connected component with size ≥ 2:\n\n       t = 1\n\n       w = sum over all components ( (a_i choose 2) + (b_i choose 2) )\n\n   else:\n\n       (all components are single-node components)\n\n       if n < 3:\n\n           impossible? But the problem says that the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. So, for n=1, it's impossible. But according to the input constraints, the graph can have n=1? Wait, the input allows n to be 1. But for n=1, you can't form a cycle of more than one vertex. So, in this case, the problem's answer would be impossible. But according to the sample input, for n=3 and m=0, the answer is t=3 and w=1. So, how to handle this.\n\nSo, for the case when all components are single-node components:\n\nif n < 3: then you cannot form a cycle. But the problem says that the input is given, and the output must be t and w. So, what's the correct approach here? For example, if n=2 and m=0, then the minimal number of edges to add is 2 (to form a cycle of two nodes, but that's not allowed since the cycle must have more than one vertex. Wait, a cycle of two nodes would be a loop, but the problem states that the cycle must be simple, with each vertex occurring once. So, a cycle of two nodes is not allowed. Hence, the minimal t is 3 (but for n=2, it's impossible). So, in this case, the problem requires that the answer is t=3 and w=0? Or is there a mistake in the logic here?\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. So, the minimal cycle length is 3. So, for the case where all components are single-node components, and n is less than 3, it's impossible. But according to the problem's input constraints, n can be 1. So, how to handle this case?\n\nBut the problem says that the graph is not necessarily connected. So, for example, if the input is n=2, m=0. Then, the graph is bipartite. So, according to our earlier logic, since all components are single-node components (each node is its own component). Then, the minimal number of edges to add is 3, but with n=2, it's impossible to form a cycle of length 3. So, the answer would be impossible. However, according to the problem statement, the input is such that the answer exists. Or perhaps the problem guarantees that the answer exists. But looking at the sample input, the third example is n=3, m=0, which outputs 3 1. So, for n=3, m=0, the answer is possible. But for n=2, m=0, it's impossible. So, how to handle this?\n\nBut according to the problem's output requirements, the code must output t and w. So, perhaps in such cases, the code should return t=3 and w=0? But that's not possible. Wait, but for n=2, to form a cycle of length 3, you need three nodes. So, it's impossible. Hence, the answer would be t is impossible, but the problem says that the input is given, and the output must be computed. So, perhaps the code needs to handle such cases. However, the problem says that the graph can be such that it's impossible to form such a cycle. But according to the problem statement, the answer must exist. Wait, no. The problem says that the graph can be such that you need to add edges to form a cycle. But for example, if n=2, then even after adding any edges, you can't form a cycle of length 3. Because the maximum number of nodes is 2. Hence, in this case, the answer would be impossible. But how can that be handled?\n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, the third case is n=3, m=0. So, the code must handle that. So, perhaps the code should check for the case where all components are single-node components. Then:\n\nif n < 3: then it's impossible to form a cycle. So, but how can that be? The problem says that the answer must exist. However, perhaps the problem's constraints ensure that n ≥ 3. Let me check the problem statement. The input constraints for n and m are not specified except that n is the number of vertices. The problem says that the graph is not necessarily connected. So, for example, if n is 2, then the answer would be impossible. But according to the problem's note, the output must be printed. So, perhaps the code must handle this case. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the graph can be such that you need to add edges to form a cycle. So, for example, if n=2 and m=0, then the answer is impossible. But according to the problem's output, the code must print t and w. So, perhaps the code should return t=3 and w=0? But that's not correct. However, the problem's sample input includes the third case where n=3, m=0. So, for that case, the answer is t=3 and w=1. For the case where n=2, m=0, the answer would be t=3 and w=0. But how can that be handled in the code?\n\nBut perhaps, in the code, when all components are single-node components, then:\n\nif n < 3: then there's no way to form a cycle. So, the answer is impossible. But according to the problem statement, the input is given, and the code must output something. However, the problem's note says that the answer must be possible. So, perhaps the problem ensures that the input is such that the answer exists. For example, in the input, n is at least 3. But the problem's input description says that n can be any value. So, perhaps the code must handle all possibilities. \n\nBut for now, let's proceed with the following steps:\n\nFirst, check if the graph is bipartite. If not, output t=0 and w=1.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if there is at least one connected component with size ≥ 2. If yes:\n\nt = 1.\n\nw is the sum over all connected components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2), where a_i and b_i are the sizes of the two partitions of that component.\n\nElse:\n\nAll components are single-node. Then, to form a cycle, we need to have at least three nodes. So, if n < 3, then no solution. But according to the problem's sample input, the third case is n=3, m=0. For that case, the answer is t=3 and w=1. So, in this case, when all components are single-node and n ≥ 3, then t is 3, and w is the number of ways to choose 3 nodes (C(n,3)), since adding all three edges between them forms a cycle of length 3.\n\nBut how to compute this. For example, for n=4, the number of ways is C(4,3) =4. Each way adds three edges. So, the answer for t is 3, and w is 4.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif all components are single-node:\n\n   if n < 3:\n\n       impossible? But the problem says to output t and w. Maybe in this case, the answer is t=3 and w=0. But perhaps the problem ensures that n ≥3. However, the code must handle all cases.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output must be printed regardless. So, in code, for the case where all components are single-node and n ≥3, then t is 3, and w is C(n,3).\n\nBut why is that the case? Because adding three edges between three nodes forms a triangle. But there are C(n,3) ways to choose the three nodes. Each such choice requires adding three edges. So, the number of ways is the number of triplets of nodes.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with that logic.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1. Check if the graph is bipartite. If not, output 0 1.\n\n   How to check if the graph is bipartite? For each connected component, perform BFS and assign colors. If during BFS, a conflict is found, the graph is not bipartite.\n\n2. If the graph is bipartite:\n\n   a. Check if there exists a connected component with size ≥2. \n\n   b. If yes:\n\n       t = 1\n\n       w is the sum over all components of (a_i choose 2 + b_i choose 2)\n\n   c. Else:\n\n       if n < 3:\n\n           ??? But according to the problem, the answer must exist. However, the code needs to output something. For example, for n=1, the answer is impossible. But the problem may not have such test cases.\n\n       else:\n\n           t = 3\n\n           w = C(n, 3)\n\nBut how to compute C(n,3)? It's n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input:\n\nThird example is n=3, m=0. All components are single-node. So, t=3, w=1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: n=4, m=0. Then, the answer is t=3 and w=4.\n\nSo, the code must handle that.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement BFS or DFS to check bipartition for each connected component.\n\nFor each connected component, track the size of the two partitions.\n\nSo, during the BFS, for each component, we can track the color of each node. For example, color array, where color[i] is 0 or 1. Then, for each component, count the number of nodes with color 0 (a_i) and color 1 (b_i).\n\nOnce we have all components' a_i and b_i, then:\n\nsum_w = sum for each component (a_i * (a_i -1) // 2 + b_i * (b_i -1) // 2 )\n\nSo, that's the w for the case when t=1.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead m edges.\n\nBuild adjacency list.\n\nCheck if the graph is bipartite.\n\nIf not bipartite: output 0 1.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if any component has size ≥2.\n\nHow to check this? For each component, check if the size (a_i + b_i) ≥2. So, if any component has size ≥2, then yes.\n\nIf yes:\n\nt=1, w=sum_w.\n\nElse:\n\n   if n <3: then output t=... but what? Well, in this case, there are no edges, and all components are single-node. So, for n=1, impossible. For n=2, impossible. So, what's the answer?\n\nBut according to the problem's note, the output must be t and w. However, the problem says that the graph must be modified to form a cycle. So, if n is less than 3, then it's impossible. However, the problem may not have such test cases. But the code must handle it.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, the third example is n=3, m=0, which outputs 3 1. So, for n=3, the code proceeds with t=3 and w=1. So, for n <3, the code can output t=3 and w=0? Or perhaps the code can assume that n ≥3 when all components are single-node.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nIn code, perhaps:\n\nif all components are single-node:\n\n   if n <3:\n\n       # impossible. But according to the problem statement, the answer must exist. However, the code must output something.\n\n       # but in this case, the answer would be t=3 and w=0?\n\n       # but how?\n\n       # For example, n=2, m=0. You can't form a cycle. So, the answer would be impossible. But the problem says that the code must output something. However, the problem may not have such test cases.\n\n       # For the purpose of this problem, perhaps the code can assume that when all components are single-node, then n is ≥3. But that's not necessarily true.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample includes n=3, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nif all components are single-node:\n\n   if n >=3:\n\n       t=3\n\n       w = comb(n,3)\n\n   else:\n\n       # impossible, but how to handle?\n\n       # perhaps the answer is t=3 and w=0?\n\nBut in this case, the problem may not have such test cases, so the code can proceed under the assumption that when all components are single-node, n is ≥3.\n\nBut for the code, we need to handle all possibilities.\n\nBut let's proceed with that logic.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement Bipartition checking.\n\nFor each connected component, track the color counts (a_i, b_i).\n\nThen, check if any component has size ≥2.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, coding in Python:\n\nImplementing Bipartition check:\n\nWe can use BFS for each component.\n\nInitialize color array with -1.\n\nFor each node not visited, perform BFS.\n\nAssign colors alternately. If a conflict is found, the graph is not bipartite.\n\nNow, during this process, for each component, track the size of the two partitions.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    u, v = map(int, input().split())\n\n    adj[u].append(v)\n\n    adj[v].append(u)\n\ncolor = [-1]*(n+1)\n\nis_bipartite = True\n\ncomponents = []  # list of tuples (a, b) for each component\n\nfor u in range(1, n+1):\n\n    if color[u] == -1:\n\n        # new component\n\n        queue = deque()\n\n        queue.append(u)\n\n        color[u] = 0\n\n        a = 0\n\n        b = 0\n\n        a += 1\n\n        while queue:\n\n            node = queue.popleft()\n\n            for neighbor in adj[node]:\n\n                if color[neighbor] == -1:\n\n                    color[neighbor] = color[node]^1\n\n                    if color[neighbor] == 0:\n\n                        a +=1\n\n                    else:\n\n                        b +=1\n\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\n\n                else:\n\n                    if color[neighbor] == color[node]:\n\n                        is_bipartite = False\n\n        # Wait, the initial code for counting a and b is wrong. Because when we start with u, color is 0. So, a starts as 1. Then, when adding neighbors, their color is 1, so added to b. But during BFS, the code above is not correctly tracking a and b. Because the initial code adds a +=1 for u, but then during the BFS, when processing neighbors, it adds to a or b based on their color. But the initial code for u is color 0, which is added to a. But the code as written:\n\n        # When u is processed, the code adds a +=1. But in the code above, after initializing color[u] =0, then a +=1. Then, when processing the neighbors, for each neighbor, if they are colored, check if same as current node. Else, assign color and increment a or b accordingly.\n\n        # However, this approach is wrong. Because during BFS, the code is not tracking the counts properly. Because the initial code for u is color 0, which is added to a. Then, for each neighbor, when assigned color 1, added to b, etc. But the code as written in the pseudocode above would not capture the initial node's count correctly. Because in the code above, the initial node is u, which is color 0, and a is incremented by 1. Then, during BFS, each neighbor is added to the queue and their color is set. But for the initial node, after that, the code processes the node, but the code for the initial node's count is not handled properly.\n\n        # So, the correct approach is to track a and b for each component. For example, during BFS, for each node, when it's colored, increment a or b accordingly.\n\n        # So, let's rework this part.\n\n        # Initialize a and b for the component.\n\n        a = 0\n\n        b = 0\n\n        queue = deque([u])\n\n        color[u] = 0\n\n        a += 1\n\n        while queue:\n\n            node = queue.popleft()\n\n            for neighbor in adj[node]:\n\n                if color[neighbor] == -1:\n\n                    color[neighbor] = color[node] ^ 1\n\n                    if color[neighbor] == 0:\n\n                        a +=1\n\n                    else:\n\n                        b +=1\n\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\n\n                else:\n\n                    if color[neighbor] == color[node]:\n\n                        is_bipartite = False\n\n        # After processing the component, add (a, b) to components list.\n\n        components.append( (a, b) )\n\nWait, but this code is incorrect. Because the initial node is added to the queue, and color is set to 0, and a is incremented by 1. Then, during BFS, each neighbor is processed. However, the code for the initial node's processing is not handled properly. For example, when the initial node is popped from the queue, and its neighbors are processed. But the code for counting a and b is done when the neighbor is colored, not when the node is processed. So, the initial node's color is counted as a=1, but when the node is popped from the queue, its neighbors are processed. However, the code counts a and b only when neighbors are colored. So, the code is missing the count for the node itself. Wait, no. The initial node is colored and added to a. Then, when the node is popped from the queue, the code processes its neighbors. But the code for the node itself is already accounted for in a or b. \n\nBut in the code above, the initial node is added to a. Then, when processing the node's neighbors, their color is set, and added to a or b accordingly. However, when the node is processed, the code doesn't account for it again. So, the code for a and b is correct. Because the initial node is added to a, and each subsequent node added to the queue is processed, and their color is added to a or b. \n\nBut what about the node itself? For example, the initial node is color 0, added to a. Then, when the node is popped from the queue, its neighbors are processed. But the code does not recount the node. So, the code for a and b is correct. \n\nBut in the code above, the initial node is added to a, and then during the BFS, all other nodes in the component are added to a or b. So, the total a + b is the size of the component.\n\nYes. So, the code for the component's a and b is correct.\n\nBut during the BFS, the code checks for conflicts. However, if during the BFS, a conflict is found (color[neighbor] == color[node]), then is_bipartite is set to False. However, once is_bipartite is set to False, the rest of the code may not need to process further. But for the purposes of the code, it's okay to continue processing. \n\nOnce all components are processed, then:\n\nif is_bipartite is False:\n\n    print(0 1)\n\nelse:\n\n    check if any component has a + b >= 2.\n\n    for that, check if any (a, b) in components has a + b >=2.\n\n    if yes:\n\n        t = 1\n\n        compute sum_w = sum( a*(a-1)//2 + b*(b-1)//2 for a, b in components )\n\n        print(t, sum_w)\n\n    else:\n\n        # all components are single-node.\n\n        if n <3:\n\n            # impossible. But how?\n\n            # According to the problem statement, perhaps the answer is t=3 and w=0?\n\n            # Or perhaps the problem ensures that this case does not occur.\n\n            # For example, if n is 1, then the answer is impossible. But the code must output something.\n\n            # However, given that the problem's sample includes n=3, perhaps the code can assume that when all components are single-node, then n >=3.\n\n            # So, proceed with:\n\n            if n >=3:\n\n                t = 3\n\n                w = n*(n-1)*(n-2)//6\n\n                print(t, w)\n\n            else:\n\n                # but what? For example, n=2, m=0.\n\n                # In this case, the answer is impossible. However, the code must output something. But according to the problem statement, the answer must be possible. So perhaps the code can assume that this case does not happen.\n\n                # For the purpose of passing the test cases, perhaps the code can proceed with:\n\n                # print(3, 0) ?\n\n                # Or perhaps the problem ensures that when the graph is bipartite and all components are single-node, then n >=3.\n\n        else:\n\n            t =3\n\n            w = ... \n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, for the third case, n=3 and m=0, the code outputs 3 1. Which matches the calculation of C(3,3)=1. So, the code for this case is correct.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, in the code, during the components processing, the code may have components with a + b = 1 (single node). For example, if a component is a single node, then a=1, b=0. So, a + b =1.\n\nSo, the code for checking if any component has size ≥2 is:\n\nhas_large_component = any( (a + b) >=2 for a, b in components )\n\nIf has_large_component is True, then proceed with t=1 and sum_w.\n\nElse, proceed with the else case.\n\nNow, in code:\n\nOnce the components are collected, and the graph is bipartite:\n\nhas_large = any( (a + b) >=2 for a, b in components )\n\nif has_large:\n\n    t = 1\n\n    sum_w = 0\n\n    for a, b in components:\n\n        sum_w += a*(a-1)//2 + b*(b-1)//2\n\n    print(t, sum_w)\n\nelse:\n\n    # all components are single-node.\n\n    if n >=3:\n\n        t = 3\n\n        w = n * (n-1) * (n-2) // 6\n\n        print(t, w)\n\n    else:\n\n        # impossible. How to handle?\n\n        # but the problem says that the answer must exist. So perhaps this case is not present in the input.\n\n       ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to an undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length, and the number of ways to achieve this. The solution involves checking if the graph is bipartite and then determining the necessary steps based on the structure of the graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Bipartiteness**: A graph is bipartite if it can be colored using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. If the graph is not bipartite, it already contains an odd-length cycle, so the answer is 0 edges and 1 way.\n2. **Component Analysis**: If the graph is bipartite, analyze each connected component. If any component has at least two nodes, adding one edge between nodes in the same partition will create an odd-length cycle.\n3. **Handling Single-Node Components**: If all components are single-node (i.e., isolated vertices), forming a cycle requires adding three edges to form a triangle among three nodes. The number of ways to do this is determined by combinations of choosing three nodes from the total nodes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        v = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n\n    color = [-1] * (n + 1)\n    is_bipartite = True\n    components = []\n\n    for u in range(1, n + 1):\n        if color[u] == -1:\n            queue = deque()\n            queue.append(u)\n            color[u] = 0\n            a = 1\n            b = 0\n            while queue:\n                node = queue.popleft()\n                for neighbor in adj[node]:\n                    if color[neighbor] == -1:\n                        color[neighbor] = color[node] ^ 1\n                        if color[neighbor] == 0:\n                            a += 1\n                        else:\n                            b += 1\n                        queue.append(neighbor)\n                    else:\n                        if color[neighbor] == color[node]:\n                            is_bipartite = False\n            components.append((a, b))\n\n    if not is_bipartite:\n        print(\"0 1\")\n        return\n\n    has_large = any((a + b) >= 2 for a, b in components)\n    if has_large:\n        t = 1\n        sum_w = 0\n        for a, b in components:\n            sum_w += (a * (a - 1)) // 2 + (b * (b - 1)) // 2\n        print(f\"{t} {sum_w}\")\n    else:\n        if n >= 3:\n            t = 3\n            w = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6\n            print(f\"{t} {w}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"3 0\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Bipartite Check**: Using BFS, each connected component is checked for bipartiteness.
