    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. Let's first understand what's happening here. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, for the LCM to be as small as possible, we want x and y to be as small as possible and their GCD to be as large as possible.\n\nBut since x = a + k and y = b + k, adding k to both. Let's think about the difference between a and b. Suppose a and b are different. Let's say a < b. Then, when we add k, the difference between x and y remains (b - a), because (b +k) - (a +k) = b -a. So, the difference between the two numbers is fixed. Let me denote d = |a - b|. So, the two numbers are x and x + d, where d is the absolute difference between a and b.\n\nWait, right. Because if a is smaller than b, then x = a +k, and y = b +k = x + (b -a). So, the two numbers are x and x +d, where d is the difference between a and b. So, the LCM of x and x +d. Now, the LCM of x and x +d is (x*(x +d))/gcd(x, x +d). But since gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d), because gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d). So, the LCM becomes (x*(x +d))/gcd(x, d).\n\nSo, our problem reduces to finding x such that (x*(x +d))/gcd(x, d) is minimized, where x is a +k (and k is non-negative). Also, since k can't be negative, x must be at least a if a < b, or at least b if a > b. Wait, no. Let me think. Suppose a is 6 and b is 10. Then, d is 4. So, x = a +k = 6 +k. Then y = 10 +k = x +4. So, x can be any value >=6 (since k is non-negative). But if a was larger than b, say a=10 and b=6, then x would be a +k =10 +k, and y would be 6 +k, which is x -4. So, in that case, the difference is still d=4, but the two numbers are x and x -d. But the LCM of x and x -d is the same as LCM of x and x -d, which is same as LCM of x and d (since x -d and x have gcd same as x and d). Wait, maybe not. But regardless, the LCM of x and x +d is the same as LCM of x and x +d, regardless of which is larger. So, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering d = |a - b|, and then trying to find x such that x is (a +k) where k is non-negative, and x is such that the LCM of x and x +d is minimized.\n\nWait, but when a and b are equal, then d is zero. In that case, x and y are both equal to a +k, so their LCM is a +k. Therefore, the minimal LCM is achieved when k is zero. So in that case, the answer is zero.\n\nSo, the first thing to check is if a == b. Then the answer is 0. Otherwise, we need to proceed.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to when a != b. Let me assume that a < b. Then, d = b -a. Then, x is a +k, and y is x +d. We need to find x >= a (since k >= 0) such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized.\n\nBut how do I find x? Let's think about the LCM formula again. For x and x +d, LCM(x, x +d) = x*(x +d) / gcd(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/g, where g is gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d). So, the LCM is (x*(x +d))/g. Since d is fixed, perhaps we can find x such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d, which would make the gcd(x, d) as large as possible. Because the larger the gcd, the smaller the LCM.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since x and x +d differ by d, their gcd is the same as gcd(x, d). So, the idea is that for x, we can look for values of x that are multiples of divisors of d. Because if x is a multiple of a divisor of d, then the gcd(x, d) would be that divisor. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider that for x, we can write x = m * t, where t is a divisor of d. Then, the gcd(x, d) is t * gcd(m, d/t). Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the optimal x is such that x is a divisor of d. Or perhaps the optimal x is such that x divides d, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the LCM expression. Since x and x +d are two numbers with difference d. The LCM is minimized when x and x +d share a large common divisor. For example, if x is such that x and x +d are both multiples of some number g, then their LCM would be (x*(x +d))/g. So, to minimize the LCM, we need to maximize g.\n\nSo, the maximum possible value of g is the maximum possible divisor of d. Because since x and x +d have gcd equal to gcd(x, d), which is a divisor of d. Therefore, the maximum possible value of g is d, but that would require that x is a multiple of d. Let me see. If x is a multiple of d, then x = m*d. Then, x +d = (m +1)*d. Their gcd is d, and LCM is (m*d * (m+1)*d)/d = m*(m+1)*d. Which is m(m+1) *d. For this to be minimal, m should be as small as possible. So, m=0? But x has to be at least a. Wait, if a is less than d, then m could be zero. But x = a +k. For example, suppose a=6, b=10, d=4. Then, x is 6 +k. If we set x to be 4 (so m=1?), but 6 +k =4 implies k=-2 which is invalid. So, in that case, x cannot be 4. So, the idea is that for each possible divisor t of d, we can try to find x such that x is congruent to -d mod t, or something like that. Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that since x and x +d have a gcd of g, which divides d. Let me think of g as a divisor of d. Then, the LCM of x and x +d is (x*(x +d))/g. But since x and x +d are multiples of g, we can write x = g * m, and x +d = g * n, where m and n are coprime. Then, since x +d -x =d = g(n -m). Therefore, d = g*(n -m). So, n -m = d/g. Also, since m and n are coprime, and n = m + (d/g). So, the LCM of x and x +d is (g*m * g*n)/g = g*m*n. Which is g * m * (m + d/g). So, the LCM is g*m*(m + d/g). But since n and m are coprime, and n = m + (d/g), this implies that m and m + (d/g) are coprime. Therefore, m must be such that it is coprime with (d/g) + m. Wait, not sure. But regardless, the LCM expression is g * m * (m + (d/g)).\n\nNow, our goal is to minimize this expression. Since d is fixed, and g is a divisor of d, perhaps for each possible divisor g of d, we can find the minimal possible value of m * (m + (d/g)), and then take the minimum over all possible g.\n\nBut how do we find m?\n\nWell, since x = g * m, and x must be at least the minimum of a and b. Let's say that a < b. Then, x must be >= a. So, m must be >= ceil(a/(g)). But also, since x +d = g * n = g*(m + (d/g)), which is x +d = g*m +d. Which equals (g*m) +d. Which is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal value of m*(m + (d/g)) occurs when m is as small as possible. For example, if m is chosen to be the smallest possible such that x >= a. Let me think. Let's say that for a given divisor g of d, we can compute the minimal possible m, then compute the corresponding LCM.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal possible m for each g?\n\nFor example, for a given g, x must be >= a. So, m must be >= ceil(a/g). However, since x = g * m, and x can be any value such that x >=a. Then, m_min is ceil(a/g). But then, for that m_min, the value of m*(m + (d/g)) is m_min * (m_min + (d/g)).\n\nBut for each g (divisor of d), we can calculate this value and then find the overall minimum.\n\nBut then, how do we get all possible divisors of d?\n\nThis seems like a feasible approach. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return 0.\n\n2. Else, find all divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d, compute the minimal m such that x = g * m >= a (assuming a < b). Wait, but if a is larger than b, then the same logic applies but with a and b swapped. So, perhaps first compute d = |a -b|, then compute the minimal x such that x is (a +k) where k >=0, and x is such that x is part of the pair (x, x +d) or (x +d, x), depending on which is larger.\n\nBut for the general case, let me assume that a < b. So, x is a +k, which must be >= a. Then, for each divisor g of d, we can find the minimal m such that x = g*m >= a. Then, compute the LCM as g * m * (m + (d/g)).\n\nBut then, for each g, the minimal m is ceil(a/g). But wait, since x must be >= a. For example, if a is 6 and g is 4, then m must be >= 6/4 = 1.5, so m_min is 2, leading to x = 8. Then, the LCM is 4 * 2 * (2 + (4/4)) = 4 * 2 * 3 = 24. Which is exactly the example given in the problem. So, in that case, the minimal LCM for this divisor is 24. But there may be other divisors of d (which is 4) that give a smaller LCM.\n\nLet's see. The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each of them:\n\nCase g=1:\n\nd/g =4.\n\nWe need m such that x = 1*m >=6. So m_min is 6. Then, LCM is 1 * 6 * (6 +4) = 6*10 = 60.\n\nCase g=2:\n\nd/g = 2.\n\nm_min is ceil(6/2) =3. Then LCM is 2 *3*(3+2) = 2*3*5 =30.\n\nCase g=4:\n\nd/g =1.\n\nm_min is ceil(6/4)=2. LCM is 4*2*(2+1) =4*2*3=24. Which matches the example.\n\nSo, the minimal among these is 24. So, the minimal LCM is achieved when g=4, and m=2. Then, x is 4*2=8, which is a +k =6 +k=8 => k=2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work.\n\nBut how do we handle all possible divisors of d? Also, note that for each divisor g of d, we have to compute this value, and then choose the minimal LCM. Then, among all those possibilities, we select the minimal LCM, and the corresponding k.\n\nBut there's another thing. What if there are multiple divisors that give the same minimal LCM? Then, we need to choose the smallest k. So, for each candidate (g, m), we can compute the corresponding k, and then select the minimal one.\n\nBut how do we generate all possible divisors of d?\n\nFirst, we need to find all the divisors of d. For d up to 1e9, this is manageable. Because even for 1e9, the number of divisors is not too big (for example, if d is a prime, it has two divisors). So, generating all divisors of d can be done via factorization, but for the purposes of programming competition, perhaps we can generate all divisors by checking up to sqrt(d).\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, we process each of them as described.\n\nBut there's another thing: for each divisor g of d, we need to consider both g and d/g? Or not? Wait, no. Because when we generate all divisors of d, we have all possible values of g. For example, in the case of d=4, the divisors are 1,2,4. So, all possibilities are covered.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = abs(a - b). If d is zero, return 0.\n\n- Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g of d:\n\n   - Compute the minimal x = g * m, where m is the minimal integer such that x >= min_val. Here, min_val is the minimum between a and b. Wait, no. Because when a < b, the x is a +k, which must be >= a. But if a > b, then the x is b +k, which is >= b. So, perhaps we can compute min_val = min(a, b), and then for each divisor g, compute m_min = ceil( min_val / g ). Then x = g * m_min. Then, the corresponding k is x - min_val.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. Suppose a < b. Then, the x is a +k. So, x must be >=a. So, m_min is ceil( a / g ). Then, x = g * m_min. So, k = x -a.\n\nSimilarly, if a > b, then the x is b +k. So, x must be >=b. So, same approach.\n\nBut since d = |a -b|, and min_val is min(a, b), then for all cases, the minimal x is determined by min_val. So, in code, we can compute min_val = min(a, b), and then for each divisor g, compute m_min as ceil( min_val / g ), and then x = g * m_min. Then, k is x - min_val.\n\nBut then, once we have x, the other number is x +d (if a < b) or x -d (if a > b). But since d = |a -b|, and x is >= min(a, b), then x +d is >= max(a, b). So, the pair is (x, x +d) if a < b, or (x +d, x) if a > b. Either way, the LCM is same as before.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x as above, then compute the LCM for that x, and track the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nBut also, there is another possibility. For example, perhaps the minimal x is not the first possible m_min. Maybe for some cases, taking a larger m gives a smaller LCM. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think. For a given g, the LCM is g * m * (m + (d/g)). Let me denote t = d/g. Then, the expression is g * m*(m + t). Since t is fixed for a given g, the expression is minimized when m is as small as possible. Because m*(m +t) increases as m increases. For example, m=1 gives 1*(1 +t) = 1 +t. m=2 gives 2*(2 +t) = 4 + 2t. Which is larger than 1 +t if t is positive. So, for each g, the minimal value of the expression is achieved when m is as small as possible, i.e., m_min = ceil( min_val / g ). Therefore, for each g, we can compute this m_min, and the corresponding LCM.\n\nTherefore, the approach is to generate all divisors of d, and for each, compute the minimal possible LCM for that divisor, then choose the overall minimal.\n\nOnce we find the minimal LCM, we need to find the minimal k that achieves it. So, for each divisor, compute the corresponding k, and track the minimal k among all candidates with the minimal LCM.\n\nBut wait, there's another case. What if the minimal LCM is achieved when x is not the minimal possible for a divisor, but for a different divisor? But according to our earlier reasoning, for each divisor, the minimal possible m gives the best possible LCM for that divisor.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute d = |a -b|. If d is zero, return 0.\n\nElse, generate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g:\n\n   compute t = d / g.\n\n   compute m_min = ceil( min_val / g ), where min_val is min(a, b).\n\n   x = g * m_min.\n\n   then, the LCM is (x * (x +d )) / gcd(x, d). But since x is a multiple of g, and g is a divisor of d, then gcd(x, d) is g * gcd( m_min, d/g ). Wait, but earlier we thought that the LCM is g * m_min * (m_min + t), where t = d/g. Which is the same as (x * (x +d )) / g. Because x = g * m_min, x +d = g * m_min +d = g * m_min + g * t = g (m_min + t). So, x * (x +d) is g^2 * m_min (m_min + t). Divided by g (the gcd), gives g * m_min (m_min +t). Which is the same as before.\n\nSo, the LCM for this case is g * m_min * (m_min + t). Which is the same as (x * (x +d )) / g.\n\nSo, for each divisor, compute this value.\n\nOnce we have all these values, we can compare them and find the minimal one.\n\nBut what about other possibilities? For example, what if there exists a k such that x is not of the form g * m, where g is a divisor of d? For example, perhaps x is not aligned with any divisor of d, but gives a better LCM. Is that possible?\n\nLet me think. Suppose d is 4. Let's take x = 3. Then, x +d =7. The gcd(3,4) is 1. So, LCM is 3*7 /1 =21. Which is less than the 24 from the previous example. But according to our approach, the divisors of d=4 are 1,2,4. For g=1, the minimal m_min is ceil(6/1) =6. Which gives x=6. Then, LCM is 6*10 /1 =60. But here, x=3 is not considered. How come?\n\nAh! Oh no, this suggests that our approach is missing some possibilities. Because in this case, x=3 (for example, if a was 3 and b was 7, then d=4, and min_val is 3. So, for divisor g=1, m_min is 3/1 =3. So x=3*1=3. Then, LCM is 1 *3*(3 +4) =3*7=21. Which is indeed better than the 24 from the previous case. So why didn't our approach consider that?\n\nAh, because in our previous example, the a was 6, but in this case, if a was 3 and b was 7, then the approach would work. So, the problem is that in the original example, the a was 6 and b was 10. So, d=4. But when considering x=3, which is less than a=6. So, that's not allowed. Because k must be non-negative. So, in that case, x must be >= a (since a is min_val). So, in the case where a=6, x=3 is not allowed. But in the case where a=3 and b=7, then x=3 is allowed (k=0), and gives LCM 21.\n\nSo, the approach is correct, but only for x >= min_val. So, for each divisor, the minimal m is chosen to ensure that x is >= min_val.\n\nSo, in the original example where a=6 and b=10, the x=3 is not allowed. So, for that case, the approach correctly finds the minimal possible.\n\nSo, the problem with the previous example was that x=3 was not allowed. So, the approach is correct.\n\nSo, the key is that for each divisor of d, we generate x as the minimal possible value (>= min_val) that is a multiple of g. Then, compute the LCM for that x.\n\nBut then, what about other possible x's that are not multiples of any divisor of d? For example, suppose d=4, and x is 5. Then, x +d =9. The gcd(5,4) is 1. So, LCM is 5*9=45. Which is worse than the 21 in the previous example. So, perhaps the minimal LCM is achieved when x is aligned with a divisor of d.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there isn't a better x that is not aligned with any divisor of d?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose d=6. Let's say min_val is 2. So, a=2, b=8. Then, d=6.\n\nLet's consider x=4. Then, x +d =10. gcd(4,6)=2. So, LCM is (4*10)/2=20. Now, the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor each of these:\n\ng=1: m_min=ceil(2/1) =2. x=2. LCM is 1*2*(2+6) =2*8=16. Which is better than 20. So, that's better.\n\nBut wait, x=2 gives LCM of (2,8) which is 8. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, if x=2, then x +d is 8. The LCM of 2 and 8 is 8. But according to the formula, g=1, t=6. So, LCM is 1*2*(2+6) = 16. But actual LCM is 8. So, there's a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, what's the problem here?\n\nEarlier reasoning said that the LCM is g * m * (m + t), where t =d/g. But in this case, g=1, d=6, t=6. m=2. So, the formula says 1 * 2 * (2 +6) = 16, but actual LCM is 8. So, there's an error in the formula.\n\nWhat's wrong here? Let's re-derive.\n\nEarlier, we said that x = g * m, and x +d = g * m +d. Since d = g * t (since t =d/g), then x +d = g*m + g*t = g (m +t). So, the two numbers are x = g*m, and x +d = g*(m +t). So their LCM is (g*m * g*(m +t )) / gcd(g*m, g*(m +t )).\n\nThe gcd of g*m and g*(m +t) is g * gcd(m, m +t). Since m and m +t differ by t, their gcd is gcd(m, t). Therefore, the overall gcd is g * gcd(m, t). So, the LCM is (g^2 * m (m +t )) / (g * gcd(m, t )) ) = g * m (m +t ) / gcd(m, t).\n\nAh! So, the formula I used earlier was wrong. It's not simply g * m * (m +t), but divided by gcd(m, t). Which complicates things.\n\nIn the example where x=2, which is g=1, m=2, t=6. Then, the LCM is 1 * 2 * (2+6) / gcd(2,6) = 16 / 2 = 8. Which matches the actual value.\n\nSo, the formula is g * m * (m +t) / gcd(m, t), where t =d/g.\n\nThis changes things. So, my earlier approach was wrong. Therefore, the previous reasoning is invalid. This complicates the problem.\n\nSo, the LCM for a given g is [g * m * (m + t)] / gcd(m, t), where t =d/g.\n\nBut how can we find the minimal value of this expression for each g?\n\nThis seems more complex. Because for each divisor g, and for m_min, which is the minimal possible m for that g, the LCM depends on gcd(m, t). Which could vary.\n\nBut how can we find the optimal m for each g?\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think again.\n\nGiven that for each divisor g of d, we have t =d/g. And for x =g*m, m must be >= m_min (ceil( min_val /g )).\n\nWe need to find the m >= m_min that minimizes [g * m (m + t) ] / gcd(m, t).\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each t, the minimal value of [m (m +t)] / gcd(m, t). But this seems difficult.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find the optimal m for each t. Let's think about m and t.\n\nNote that m and t can be any integers, with m >= m_min. Let me think about the function f(m) = [m (m +t)] / gcd(m, t).\n\nLet me denote g = gcd(m, t). Then, m = g * m', and t = g * t', where gcd(m', t') = 1.\n\nThen, f(m) becomes [g m' (g m' + g t') ] / g = [g m' * g (m' + t') ] / g = g m' (m' + t').\n\nWhich is g * m' (m' + t').\n\nBut since t =g * t', and m' and t' are coprime.\n\nBut since t is fixed (for a given g), and t =d/g, then for each m, we can find g = gcd(m, t), and then express f(m) as g * m' (m' + t').\n\nBut since t' = t/g, and m' is m/g.\n\nBut how does this help us?\n\nWell, since m' and t' are coprime, m' + t' and m' are coprime? Not necessarily. For example, m'=2, t'=3: sum is 5, which is coprime with 2. But m'=2, t'=2: but they are not coprime. Wait, no. Because in this case, since m' and t' are coprime, t' must be co-prime with m'.\n\nSo, for example, m' and t' are coprime. Then, m' + t' and m' have gcd of gcd(m', t') = 1. Because any common divisor of m' and m' +t' must divide t', which is coprime with m'. Hence, the gcd is 1. Therefore, m' and m' + t' are coprime.\n\nTherefore, the product m' (m' + t') is the product of two coprime numbers, hence their product is minimized when m' is as small as possible.\n\nBut since f(m) is g * m' (m' + t'), and since g is the gcd(m, t), which is the same as the gcd(m, t) = g.\n\nBut how can we find the minimal value of f(m) for a given t and m >= m_min?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of an example.\n\nTake the earlier example where t=6 (from d=6, g=1, t=d/g=6). We need to find m >= m_min. Suppose m_min is 2 (as in the case where min_val is 2). So m starts from 2.\n\nFor m=2:\n\ngcd(2,6) is 2. So, g=2, m'=1, t'=3. Then, f(m) = 2 * 1 * (1 +3) = 2*4=8. Which matches the example.\n\nFor m=3:\n\ngcd(3,6) is 3. So, m'=1, t'=2. f(m) =3 *1 * (1+2) =3*3=9.\n\nFor m=4: gcd(4,6)=2. m'=2, t'=3. f(m)= 2 * 2*(2+3) =2*2*5=20.\n\nFor m=5: gcd(5,6)=1. m'=5, t'=6. f(m) =1 *5 * (5+6) = 5*11=55.\n\nSo, the minimal value is achieved at m=2, which gives 8.\n\nSo, for this case, the minimal is achieved when m is such that the gcd(m, t) is as large as possible, allowing m' to be as small as possible.\n\nBut how can we find this for general cases?\n\nIt seems that for each t, the minimal f(m) is achieved when m is a multiple of t. Because then, m =k * t. Then, gcd(m, t) =t. Then, m'=k, t'=1. So, f(m) = t *k*(k +1). Which is minimized when k is as small as possible.\n\nBut in the previous example, when t=6, and m=6 (k=1), f(m) =6 *1*(1+1) =12, which is larger than the 8 achieved when m=2. So, that approach may not be the best.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal f(m) occurs when m is a divisor of t. Or when m is such that m and t share a large common divisor.\n\nBut how can we find this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for each t, the minimal value of f(m) is achieved when m is the smallest possible value such that m is congruent to -t mod something. Or perhaps when m is chosen such that m and t have a large gcd.\n\nBut this feels too vague.\n\nPerhaps, for each divisor g of d, we can generate all possible divisors of t =d/g, and find for each possible divisor h of t, the minimal m that is a multiple of h, and so on. But this might be computationally intensive.\n\nAlternatively, given that for each g (divisor of d), we can find the minimal m >= m_min, and then compute the LCM for that m, but since this is not guaranteed to be minimal, but perhaps it's the best we can do given the time constraints.\n\nBut this would not cover all possibilities, leading to possibly incorrect results.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach was wrong, but given the time constraints, how can we proceed?\n\nLet me think of another approach. Since the LCM of (x, x +d) is minimized when x and x +d are as small as possible and have a large GCD. So, perhaps the optimal x is the minimal possible x such that x is congruent to -d mod some large value.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the minimal LCM occurs when x and x +d are multiples of some large number. For example, if x and x +d are multiples of some number g, then their LCM is (x +d) * x / g. But since x and x +d differ by d, then g must divide d. So, this brings us back to the earlier idea of considering the divisors of d.\n\nBut in this case, the earlier mistake in the formula shows that the approach needs to account for the fact that the LCM is [x*(x +d)] / gcd(x, d), which for x = g*m and d = g*t, is [g*m * g*(m +t)] / (gcd(g*m, g*t)) = [g^2 * m(m +t)] / (g * gcd(m, t)) ) = g * m(m +t) / gcd(m, t).\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, and for x = g*m, the LCM is g * m(m +t) / gcd(m, t), where t =d/g.\n\nTo find the minimal LCM, perhaps for each g, we need to find the minimal possible value of this expression for m >= m_min.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe for each g, we can find the best m by trying to find the minimal m >= m_min such that gcd(m, t) is maximized. Since the larger the gcd(m, t), the smaller the denominator, leading to a smaller overall value.\n\nSo, for example, for a given t, we want to find m >= m_min that shares the largest possible gcd with t.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think. For a given t, the maximum possible gcd(m, t) is t itself, which occurs when m is a multiple of t. So, for m =k*t, the gcd(m, t) is t. So, the expression becomes g * [k*t * (k*t + t)] / t = g * [k * t (k+1) * t ] / t = g * k * t (k+1). Which simplifies to g *k *t (k+1). To minimize this, we want the smallest possible k.\n\nBut k must be chosen such that m =k*t >= m_min.\n\nSo, for example, if m_min is 2 and t=6, then the smallest k is 1 (since 1*6=6 >= 2). So, m=6, leading to expression value of g * 1 *6 * (1+1) = g*12. But earlier example shows that choosing m=2 (with gcd 2) gives a smaller value. So, this approach of maximizing the gcd(m, t) might not always be the best.\n\nBut why? Because in that case, even though the gcd is smaller, the m is much smaller, leading to a smaller overall value.\n\nSo, there's a trade-off between the size of m and the size of the gcd.\n\nThis makes the problem more complex. Given the time constraints, perhaps the way to proceed is to generate for each divisor g of d, the possible candidates for m that are either:\n\n- the minimal m_min (ceil(min_val/g)), or\n\n- m_min -1 (if possible, but ensuring that x >= min_val)\n\n- or other nearby values, and evaluate their LCM.\n\nBut this might not be sufficient, but perhaps for the purposes of the competition, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since for the minimal LCM, it's likely that the optimal x is such that x is close to the minimal possible value, and the optimal k is small, perhaps we can generate for each divisor g of d, the m_min and m_min -1 (if valid), and evaluate those.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the minimal LCM occurs when x is as small as possible, and for x to be as small as possible, we can focus on x being around the minimal possible value, which is min_val.\n\nLet me think of the original example where a=6, b=10, d=4, min_val=6.\n\nFor the divisor g=4, t=1. m_min = ceil(6/4) = 2. So, m=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `(a + k)` and `(b + k)` is minimized. If there are multiple values of `k` that yield the same minimum LCM, we choose the smallest `k`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that the difference between `a` and `b` remains constant when `k` is added to both. This difference, denoted as `d`, helps in simplifying the problem.\n2. **Special Case for Equal Values**: If `a` equals `b`, the LCM is simply `a + k`, which is minimized when `k = 0`.\n3. **Divisors of Difference**: For distinct values of `a` and `b`, we consider all divisors of the absolute difference `d = |a - b|`. This is because the LCM of two numbers can be minimized by leveraging their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n4. **Evaluate Candidates**: For each divisor of `d`, compute potential values of `k` that could minimize the LCM. This involves checking values around the minimum possible `k` derived from each divisor.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return divisors\n\ndef compute_min_k(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    min_val = min(a, b)\n    max_val = max(a, b)\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    \n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        t = d // g\n        m_min = (min_val + g - 1) // g  # ceil division\n        x = g * m_min\n        k_candidate = x - min_val\n        # Compute LCM of x and x + d\n        x1 = x\n        x2 = x + d\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x1, x2)\n        current_lcm = (x1 * x2) // current_gcd\n        # Check if this is better\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate\n        \n        # Also check m_min -1 if it's valid\n        if m_min > 1:\n            m_candidate = m_min - 1\n            x_candidate = g * m_candidate\n            if x_candidate >= min_val:\n                k_candidate = x_candidate - min_val\n                x1 = x_candidate\n                x2 = x_candidate + d\n                current_gcd = math.gcd(x1, x2)\n                current_lcm = (x1 * x2) // current_gcd\n                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n                    min_lcm = current_lcm\n                    best_k = k_candidate\n    \n    return best_k\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        a_str, b_str = line.strip().split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = int(b_str)\n        print(compute_min_k(a, b))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Divisors Calculation**: The function `get_divisors` generates all divisors of a number, which is crucial for evaluating potential values of `k`.\n2. **Minimizing LCM**: For each divisor of the difference `d`, we calculate potential values of `k` that might minimize the LCM.
