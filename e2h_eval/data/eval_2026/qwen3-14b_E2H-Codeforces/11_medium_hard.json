A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs and what each part contributes.\n\nThe inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend?), wait no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. Wait, no. Wait the description says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend requires these things. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Because each of the n friends has their own requirements.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose they make t toasts. For each toast, each friend needs some amount. So for each toast, the total drink required is n * nl (since each of the n friends uses nl per toast). Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total for t toasts would be:\n\nDrink: t * n * nl ml. But the total available drink is k * l ml. So the maximum t allowed by drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nLime slices: total available is c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So maximum t allowed by limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: total available is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum t allowed by salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values. Because all three resources must be sufficient for t toasts.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the maximum possible toasts based on each resource, then take the minimum of those.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4*5 = 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Wait, wait:\n\nWait, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. So the maximum t from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Let me compute that for the first sample.\n\nk*l is 4*5=20. n * nl is 3 * 3 = 9. 20 / 9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. So that's 2 toasts.\n\nLimes: c*d is 10*8=80 slices. Each toast requires n slices (3 per toast). 80 / 3 is 26.666..., floor 26. But wait, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait in the note, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, but according to my calculation, for each toast, you need 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80/3 = 26.666, which would be 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the calculation here.\n\nWait the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". Wait why? Let me check the note again. The note says that in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires a slice per friend. So for each toast, there's n slices needed. So for 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So with 80 slices, you can make 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's conflicting. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the total available is c*d slices. So the maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nIn the first sample, c is 10, d is 8. So c*d is 80. n is 3. So 80//3 is 26. But according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend, but perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"In the first sample: ... the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\"\n\nWait wait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, the limes can provide 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices can make 80 / 3 = 26.666 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So this suggests that perhaps my understanding is wrong.\n\nAh! Wait, maybe I have the problem statement backwards. Maybe each toast requires one slice per friend. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. But in the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that 80 slices is enough for 80 toasts. Which would mean that per toast, only 1 slice is needed. So perhaps I have misread the problem statement.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs a slice of lime. Therefore, for one toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. So for t toasts, n * t slices.\n\nBut in the note, the sample input is 3 friends, and the limes are 10 * 8 = 80 slices. The note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that for each toast, 1 slice is needed. But that contradicts with the problem statement.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why is the limes enough for 80 toasts? According to the note, the limes are 10 * 8 = 80 slices. How does that translate into 80 toasts? If each toast requires one slice per friend, then for each toast, 3 slices are needed. So 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I must have misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nWait maybe the problem statement says that each toast requires one slice of lime, not per friend. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh, so for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the note's explanation seems to be wrong. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would suggest that the number of toasts is (c*d) / 1, but that would be if each toast requires one slice. But according to the problem statement, it's n slices per toast.\n\nSo why does the note say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nLet me recheck the note's explanation:\n\nThe note says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Which is the total number of slices. So if each toast requires one slice, then that's correct. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires n slices. So why does the note say that?\n\nThis suggests that perhaps I have misread the problem statement. Let me read again:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, each friend takes one slice. So for each toast, n slices are required. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible only if each toast requires 1 slice. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires one slice of lime, regardless of the number of friends. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for a toast, the number of slices required is equal to the number of friends. So for t toasts, n * t slices. But the note says that in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that the total number of slices is 80, and each toast requires one slice. So in that case, the number of toasts is 80.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, that would require that each toast requires one slice. So why is that?\n\nAh! Maybe the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs a slice. But the note's explanation is wrong. Or perhaps the problem statement is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, one slice is needed, not per friend. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo if there are n friends, and each makes a toast, then for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for each toast, n slices are needed. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible only if each toast requires one slice. So in the first sample, the limes are 10 * 8 = 80 slices. If each toast requires one slice, then 80 toasts can be made. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires n slices. So how does that fit?\n\nLet me look at the sample input and output again. The first sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. The output is 2.\n\nThe note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3 equals 2. So the min is 6, which comes from drink. So according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Then, the limes allow 80 toasts. Salt allows 100 toasts. Then, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So that suggests that the drink allows for 6 toasts, but the limes allow for 80, and salt 100. But why?\n\nSo the drink calculation is (k * l) / (n * nl) ?\n\nIn the first sample, k*l is 4 * 5 = 20. n * nl is 3 * 3 = 9. 20 / 9 is 2.222, which is floored to 2. But the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which suggests that the calculation is (k*l) / nl, then divided by n?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that for the drink, the total is (k*l) divided by (nl) and then divided by n? Or perhaps the drink per toast is nl per friend, so for t toasts, each friend has t * nl. So total drink needed is n * t * nl. So the total available is k*l. So t_max_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nIn the first sample, that's 20 / (3 * 3) = 20 / 9 = 2.222, so 2. But the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which suggests that the calculation is (k*l) / nl divided by n. Let me compute that: (20 / 3) = 6.666, divided by 1? No. Wait the note says that 20 / 3 is 6. So that suggests that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be the case if the total drink per toast is nl per friend. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl. So total drink needed is n * t * nl. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). But in the first sample, that's 20/(3*3) = 20/9=2.222, which is 2. But according to the note, it's 6. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which implies that for each toast, the total drink needed is 3 ml. But why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for one toast, each of the n friends drinks nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. For t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the note, they say that the drink is 20 ml, and 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be the case if per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be if n * nl is 3. But in the sample input, n is 3, nl is 3. So 3 * 3 = 9. So 20 / 9 is 2.222. But the note says 20/3 is 6. So why is that?\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. For t toasts, total is t * n * nl. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the note, the sample input has n=3, nl=3. So n * nl = 9. k*l is 20. 20//9 is 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps I mixed up the parameters. Let me check the first sample input again.\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nWhich corresponds to n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the drink per toast per friend is nl=3 ml. So for one toast, each of the 3 friends needs 3 ml. So total per toast is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. For t toasts, 9 * t ml. The total available is 4 * 5 = 20 ml. So t can be 20 // 9 = 2. But the note says that the drink allows for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be the case if for each toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. So why is the note saying that?\n\nThis is very confusing. There's a contradiction between the note and the problem statement. How to resolve this?\n\nLet me read the note again:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait why is it divided by 3? Because each toast requires 3 ml of drink? But according to the problem statement, each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml.\n\nSo the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. But according to the problem statement's logic, it should be 2 toasts. But the final answer is 2, which is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the note is taking the drink's 20/3 = 6, then dividing by 3 (number of friends) to get 2.\n\nSo why is the drink's calculation 20/3 instead of 20/(n * nl)?\n\nThis suggests that the problem statement's description is different from what I thought. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nMaybe the drink is calculated as follows: each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the total for t toasts is t * nl per friend. So for all friends, the total is n * t * nl. But perhaps the note's calculation is wrong. Or perhaps the problem statement is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters in total, not per friend. For example, if there are n friends, and for each toast, they all drink together, requiring nl milliliters. That would change the calculation.\n\nBut the problem says \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So per friend, per toast, they need these amounts. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total for all friends is n * t * nl.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink calculation is 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be the case if the total drink needed for t toasts is t * nl. Which would be if each toast requires nl ml for all friends. So for example, if for one toast, the total drink is nl ml, not per friend.\n\nThis is conflicting. How to resolve this?\n\nWell, looking at the sample input and output, let's try to reverse engineer what the correct calculation is.\n\nIn the first sample, the answer is 2. The note says that the minimum of 6, 80, 100 is 6, and then divided by 3 gives 2.\n\nSo the drink calculation is 6. How is that 6 derived from the input?\n\nThe input is k=4, l=5. Total drink is 4*5=20. The nl is 3. So 20 / 3 = 6.666..., which is floored to 6. So this suggests that the drink is being calculated as (k*l) // nl. But why?\n\nThat would be the case if the total drink needed per toast is nl. For example, if for one toast, the total drink consumed is nl ml, not per friend. So for t toasts, total drink is t * nl. Which would give t_max_drink = (k*l) // nl. \n\nBut that would contradict the problem statement's wording. However, the sample indicates that this is the correct approach.\n\nSo perhaps the problem statement's wording is incorrect, or I have misinterpreted it. Let's think again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these things. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml, so for n friends, it's n * nl ml. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl ml. But according to the sample, the calculation is (k*l) / nl, which would be for t * n * nl = k*l → t = (k*l) / (n * nl). But in the sample, the note says that it's (k*l)/nl = 20/3 = 6. Which suggests that the t is (k*l)/nl divided by n? Or something else?\n\nWait in the note, they take the 20 / 3 = 6, then divide by 3 (the number of friends) to get 2. Which would be the case if the drink calculation was (k*l) / nl divided by n. So:\n\nt_drink = (k*l) // nl // n ?\n\nFor the first sample, 20//3 is 6, then 6//3 is 2. Which matches the answer.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Let me think: if each toast requires nl ml per friend, then for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink needed is n * t * nl. So t is (k*l) // (n * nl). Which is 20 // (3 * 3) = 20//9=2. Which is the same as (k*l) // (nl * n) = 2. But according to the note, the calculation is (k*l) // nl // n = 20//3=6, then 6//3=2. Which is the same result. So both ways give the same result. \n\nWait because (k*l) // (nl * n) is equal to ((k*l) // nl) // n ?\n\nNot necessarily. For example, if k*l is 20, nl is 3, n is 3: 20//3 is 6, then 6//3 is 2. Which is same as 20//(3*3)=20//9=2. So in this case, it's the same. But what if the numbers are different?\n\nLet's say k*l is 10, nl is 3, n is 3. Then 10// (3*3) is 10//9=1. Whereas (10//3) is 3, then 3//3=1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: k*l is 11, nl=3, n=3. 11//9=1. (11//3)=3, 3//3=1. Same.\n\nAnother example: k*l is 12, nl=3, n=3. 12//9=1. 12//3=4, 4//3=1. Same.\n\nSo in general, (a // b) // c = a // (b*c) ?\n\nYes, if a, b, c are positive integers. Because integer division is floor division. So (a // b) // c is equal to floor(a/(b*c)).\n\nBecause:\n\nLet me think mathematically. Let a = q*b + r, where 0 ≤ r < b.\n\nThen a//b = q.\n\nThen (a//b) // c = q // c.\n\nOn the other hand, a/(b*c) = (q*b + r)/(b*c) = q/c + r/(b*c). The floor of this is floor(q/c + something less than 1/(c)).\n\nIf q = m*c + s, where 0 ≤ s < c, then q/c = m + s/c. So floor(a/(b*c)) is m if r/(b*c) is less than 1 - s/c ?\n\nNot sure. But in practice, for integer division, the two approaches give the same result. So whether we calculate (k*l) // (n * nl) or ((k*l) // nl) // n, the result is the same.\n\nSo in the note, the calculation is done as (k*l) // nl = 20//3=6, then divided by n=3 to get 2. Which is the same as (k*l) // (n * nl) = 20//9=2.\n\nSo the note's explanation is using the first approach, but the actual calculation is the same.\n\nSo this suggests that the way to calculate the maximum number of toasts based on the drink is (k*l) // (n * nl), which is the same as ((k*l) // nl) // n.\n\nBut in the note, they explain it as (k*l) / nl = 6 toasts, then divided by n=3 to get 2. So the note's explanation is slightly misleading, but the calculation is correct.\n\nSo this means that the three resources are:\n\nDrink: total available is k*l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So max_toasts_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nLimes: total slices is c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So max_toasts_limes = (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: total available is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So max_toasts_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\nmax_toasts_drink = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20//9 = 2.\n\nmax_toasts_limes = (10*8) // 3 = 80//3 = 26.\n\nmax_toasts_salt = 100 // (3*1) = 100//3 = 33.\n\nThe minimum is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nIn the note, they said that the drink allows for 6 toasts, which is (k*l)//nl = 20//3=6, then divided by n=3 to get 2. Which is the same as the correct calculation.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate each of the three maximum possible toasts for each resource, then take the minimum.\n\nSo now, the plan is to compute these three values and take the minimum.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nThe input is a single line with n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nWe need to read these values, compute the three maxima, then take the minimum.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen:\n\ndrink_total = k * l\ntoast_drink = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total_slices = c * d\ntoast_lime = lime_total_slices // n\n\nsalt_total = p\ntoast_salt = salt_total // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but let's check the first sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ndrink_total = 4*5=20. n * nl = 3*3=9. 20//9=2. Correct.\n\nlime_total_slices = 10*8=80. 80//3=26. Correct.\n\nsalt_total = 100. n * np = 3*1=3. 100//3=33. So min(2, 26, 33) is 2. Correct.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample from the input:\n\nSample input 2: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10, c=1, d=19, p=90, nl=4, np=3.\n\ndrink_total = 100*10=1000. n * nl =5 *4=20. 1000//20=50.\n\nlime_total_slices=1*19=19. 19//5=3.\n\nsalt_total=90. n * np =5*3=15. 90//15=6.\n\nmin(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000. drink_total = 1000*1000 = 1e6. n * nl is 10 *50=500. 1e6//500 = 2000.\n\nlime_total_slices: 25 * 23 = 575. 575 //10 =57.\n\nsalt_total: 1. n * np = 10*1=10. 1//10=0. So min(2000, 57, 0) is 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is straightforward. Read the input, compute the three values, take the minimum.\n\nBut what about cases where division results in zero?\n\nLike if the salt is not enough for even one toast. For example, if n * np is larger than p, then toast_salt is zero, and the answer is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nThus, the Python code is:\n\nRead the input line, split into integers.\n\nCompute the three values as described.\n\nPrint the minimum of them.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead from stdin. The input is a single line. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlimes = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(drink, limes, salt))\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if n * nl is zero? No, the problem states that all inputs are positive integers. So n, k, l, etc. are >=1. So denominators are positive.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting the samples:\n\nFirst sample:\n\ndrink = (4*5) // (3*3) = 20//9=2.\n\nlimes = (10*8)//3=80//3=26.\n\nsalt = 100 // (3*1) = 33. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → drink_total=100*10=1000. n * nl =5*4=20 → 1000//20=50.\n\nlimes: c=1, d=19 → 1*19=19. 19//5=3.\n\nsalt: p=90. n*np=5*3=15. 90//15=6. min(50,3,6) → 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample:\n\ndrink: 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000. n * nl = 10 * 50 = 500. 1e6 / 500 = 2000.\n\nlimes: 25 *23 = 575. 575//10=57.\n\nsalt: 1 // (10 * 1) = 0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input line, split into variables, compute the three values, print min.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlimes = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, limes, salt))\n\nThat's the code. It's simple and straightforward. Now, let's test edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All resources exactly sufficient for 1 toast.\n\nn=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\ndrink: (1*1) // (1*1) = 1.\n\nlimes: (1*1) //1 =1.\n\nsalt: 1 // (1*1) =1. min is 1. Output 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when one of the resources is zero.\n\nFor example, n=2, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\ndrink: (1*1) // (2*1) = 0.5 → 0.\n\nlimes: (1*1)//2 = 0.\n\nsalt: 1//(2*1) = 0. min(0,0,0) → 0.\n\nAnother case where one of the resources is sufficient for 0 toasts.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nAnother case: when the division is exact.\n\nn=2, k=4, l=3, nl=3. drink_total = 4*3=12. n * nl = 2 *3=6. 12//6=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the maximum number of toasts possible based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values, as all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Drink Available**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n2. **Determine Maximum Toasts Based on Drink**: Divide the total drink by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Calculate Total Lime Slices Available**: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n4. **Determine Maximum Toasts Based on Limes**: Divide the total lime slices by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n5. **Calculate Total Salt Available**: Use the given grams of salt.\n6. **Determine Maximum Toasts Based on Salt**: Divide the total salt by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n7. **Result**: The answer is the minimum value from the three calculated maximums (drink, limes, salt).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nlimes = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, limes, salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles (`k`) by the milliliters per bottle (`l`). The maximum number of toasts based on drink is determined by dividing this total by the product of the number of friends (`n`) and the milliliters needed per toast per friend (`nl`).\n- **Lime Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is calculated by multiplying the number of limes (`c`) by the slices per lime (`d`). The maximum number of toasts based on limes is found by dividing this total by the number of friends (`n`), as each toast requires one slice per friend.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available is given by `p`. The maximum number of toasts based on salt is determined by dividing this total by the product of the number of friends (`n`) and the grams of salt needed per toast per friend (`np`).\n- **Result**: The minimum value among the three calculated maximums gives the number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring that all resources are sufficient for the same number of toasts for every friend.",
