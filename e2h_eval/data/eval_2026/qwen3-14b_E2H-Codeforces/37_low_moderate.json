    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem says that given an array a of distinct integers, we need to find a permutation b of a such that for every non-empty subset S of indices (not the full set, not empty), the sum of elements in positions S for array a is different from the sum of elements in positions S for array b. If no such permutation exists, output -1.\n\nHmm. So the key is that for any subset S (with size between 1 and n-1), the sum of a's elements on S is not equal to the sum of b's elements on S. Wait, but since b is a permutation of a, the sum of all elements in a and b is the same. But the subsets are not the entire array. So for each subset S, the sum of a's elements on S must not equal the sum of b's elements on S.\n\nWait, but how can that be possible? Because if you take a subset S and its complement, then the sum of S in a plus the sum of the complement in a equals the total sum. Similarly for b. So for example, if S is a subset, then the sum of S in a is equal to the sum of S in b only if the sum of the complement of S in a is equal to the sum of the complement of S in b. But since the total sum is the same for a and b, the sum of S in a is equal to the sum of S in b if and only if the sum of the complement of S in a is equal to the sum of the complement of S in b. But since S can be any subset, this seems like a lot of conditions to satisfy.\n\nBut how do we construct such a permutation b?\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 2, the array is [1,2]. The output is [2,1]. Let's check why this works. The subsets are {1} and {2}. For the subset {1}, the sum in a is 1, in b it's 2. Different. For subset {2}, sum in a is 2, in b it's 1. Different. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 elements [1000, 100, 10, 1]. Output is [100, 1, 1000, 10]. Let's see. For any subset S (non-empty, not all), the sum in a and in b must differ. How does this permutation work?\n\nMaybe there's a pattern here. Let me think about what kind of permutation would make sure that for all subsets S, the sum of S in a is not equal to the sum of S in b.\n\nOne approach is to arrange the permutation b such that for each position i, the value of b[i] is different from a[i], but that's not sufficient. Because even if individual elements are swapped, some subsets might have the same sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a permutation where the elements are ordered in such a way that their values are \"unique\" in some way. For example, if we sort the array in a certain way, perhaps with alternating signs or something. But since the elements are all positive, that might not help.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that for every subset S (excluding the empty set and the full set), the sum of a's elements on S is not equal to the sum of b's elements on S. Let's think about this condition. Suppose that for every subset S, the sum of a_S ≠ sum of b_S. How can we ensure this?\n\nLet me think about the difference between the sums. For a given subset S, the difference between sum_a_S and sum_b_S is equal to the sum over S of (a_i - b_i). Let's denote this as D_S = sum_{i in S} (a_i - b_i). We need D_S ≠ 0 for all subsets S (non-empty, not full).\n\nBut since b is a permutation of a, the sum of (a_i - b_i) over all elements is zero. So for any subset S, the sum of D_S plus the sum over the complement of S (which is the same as -D_S) is zero. Which makes sense.\n\nBut how to ensure that D_S is not zero for all subsets S except the full set and empty set?\n\nWait, but the problem says that for all subsets S with 0 < |S| < n. So the full set is not considered. So for any S that is not the full set, D_S must not be zero.\n\nBut how can we arrange the permutation so that this holds?\n\nAnother way to think: For any subset S (non-empty, not full), the sum of a_S is not equal to the sum of b_S. Which implies that the sum of a_S",
    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to construct a permutation `b` of the given array `a` such that for every non-empty subset of indices (excluding the full set), the sum of elements in those positions in `a` and `b` are different. If no such permutation exists, we should return `-1`.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe core challenge is ensuring that for **every** subset of size between 1 and `n-1`, the sum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` differ. This can be very computationally intensive if we try all permutations directly.\n\nHowever, there's a clever observation: **If we reverse the sorted order of the array**, it might satisfy the condition. This is because reversing the sorted array ensures that the largest and smallest values are swapped, which increases the chances of different sums for subsets.\n\nWe can test this by:\n1. Sorting the array `a`.\n2. Reversing the sorted array to get `b`.\n3. Verifying that this permutation satisfies the required condition.\n4. If not, return `-1`.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n- Sort the input array `a`.\n- Create `b` as the reversed version of the sorted array.\n- Check all possible subsets of indices (excluding empty and full sets) to ensure that the sum of the elements in those subsets from `a` and `b` are different.\n- If any subset violates the condition, output `-1`. Otherwise, output the reversed sorted array.\n\nThis approach leverages the fact that reversing a sorted array tends to produce distinct subset sums, and for small `n` (up to 22), checking all subsets is computationally feasible using bitmasking.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    # Sort the array\n    sorted_a = sorted(a)\n    b = sorted_a[::-1]  # Reverse the sorted array\n    \n    # Check if this permutation works\n    valid = True\n    total = sum(a)\n    \n    # Generate all subsets of indices with size between 1 and n-1\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        for indices in combinations(range(n), k):\n            sum_a = sum(sorted_a[i] for i in indices)\n            sum_b = sum(b[i] for i in indices)\n            if sum_a == sum_b:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if not valid:\n            break\n\n    if valid:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, b)))\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The code reads the input and sorts the array.\n- It then creates a reversed version of the sorted array as a candidate for `b`.\n- Using bitmasking or combinations, it checks all subsets of size between 1 and `n-1` to ensure that the sum of the corresponding indices in `a` and `b` are different.\n- If any subset fails, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it outputs the reversed sorted array.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the constraint `n ≤ 22` by leveraging combinatorics and the properties of sorted/reversed arrays.",
