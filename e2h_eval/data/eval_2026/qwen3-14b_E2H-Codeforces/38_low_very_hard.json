    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the minimum number of nodes required for a p-reachable directed graph and then determining the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly p-reachable means. From the description, a p-reachable graph has exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So, for each such pair, both directions must be reachable. Wait no, wait: the definition says that u and v are reachable from each other. So for each pair (u, v) where u < v, if there's a path from u to v and also a path from v to u, then that counts towards p. So the total count is the number of unordered pairs {u, v} (since u < v) where they are mutually reachable. \n\nBut the problem is to find the minimum number of nodes needed so that the graph has exactly p such pairs. Then, among all such minimal node graphs, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs. \n\nUnidirectional pairs are those where u != v, there's a path from u to v but not from v to u. So for each ordered pair (u, v), if it's unidirectional, then that's counted. But the problem says \"ordered pair of nodes (u, v)\" so the count is for ordered pairs. However, the first part is about p which is for unordered pairs (u < v) where mutual reachability exists. \n\nSo the first step is to model how to construct a graph with exactly p such mutual pairs, using as few nodes as possible. Then, maximize the number of unidirectional ordered pairs in that scenario.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the graph. For the minimal number of nodes, perhaps we need to arrange the graph into strongly connected components (SCCs) where each component contributes certain mutual pairs, and between components, there's some directionality. \n\nWait, but mutual reachability between two nodes implies that they are in the same SCC. Because if u can reach v and vice versa, then they are in the same SCC. Therefore, the number of mutual pairs (u < v) where u and v are in the same SCC is the sum over all SCCs of C(k, 2), where k is the size of the SCC. Because for each SCC of size k, there are k choose 2 unordered pairs that are mutually reachable. \n\nSo the total p is the sum over all SCCs of (k_i choose 2), where k_i is the size of each SCC. \n\nTherefore, our problem reduces to choosing a set of integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_m such that sum_{i} (k_i choose 2) = p, and the total number of nodes (sum k_i) is minimized. \n\nMoreover, once we have that, for the second part, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs. Let's think about that. \n\nThe total number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v is n*(n-1). The number of ordered pairs that are mutually reachable is 2 * sum (k_i choose 2) (since for each unordered pair {u, v}, there are two ordered pairs (u, v) and (v, u)). But wait, no. Because if u and v are in the same SCC, then both (u, v) and (v, u) are reachable. So the number of ordered pairs that are mutually reachable is 2p, since p is the count of unordered pairs. \n\nBut then, the unidirectional pairs are those ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v, and exactly one direction is reachable. Also, there are ordered pairs where neither is reachable. But the problem counts only those where there's a path from u to v but not from v to u. \n\nSo the total number of unidirectional pairs would be equal to the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v, minus the number of ordered pairs that are mutually reachable (which is 2p) minus the number of ordered pairs that are not reachable in either direction. \n\nBut how do we calculate that? Well, maybe we can think in terms of the DAG of SCCs. Suppose we have a DAG where each node represents an SCC. Between any two different SCCs A and B, if there's an edge from A to B, then all nodes in A can reach all nodes in B, but not vice versa (assuming the DAG is structured that way). \n\nBut this depends on how the SCCs are connected. To maximize the number of unidirectional pairs, perhaps we want to arrange the SCCs in a way that maximizes the number of ordered pairs between different SCCs where there is a single direction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of unid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding p-reachable Graphs**: A p-reachable graph has exactly `p` ordered pairs (u, v) where `u < v` and both `u` and `v` are mutually reachable. This translates to finding the sum of combinations of sizes of Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) that equals `p`.\n\n2. **Minimizing Nodes**: To minimize the number of nodes, we need to use the largest possible SCC sizes first. This is because larger SCCs contribute more to the total count of mutual pairs with fewer nodes.\n\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: After determining the minimal number of nodes, we maximize unidirectional pairs by considering the structure of the DAG formed by SCCs. The maximum unidirectional pairs can be calculated based on the number of nodes and the structure of the SCCs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the minimal number of nodes\n    # We need to find k_1, k_2,...k_m such that sum C(k_i, 2) = p, and sum k_i is minimized\n    # This is equivalent to using the largest possible k_i's first\n\n    nodes = []\n    remaining = p\n    k = 1\n    while remaining > 0:\n        # Find the largest k such that C(k, 2) <= remaining\n        # C(k, 2) = k*(k-1)/2\n        # We can binary search for this\n        low = 1\n        high = 2 * 10**5 + 10\n        best = 1\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            val = mid * (mid - 1) // 2\n            if val <= remaining:\n                best = mid\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        # Add best to nodes\n        nodes.append(best)\n        remaining -= best * (best - 1) // 2\n        k += 1\n\n    min_nodes = sum(nodes)\n\n    # Now compute the maximum number of unidirectional pairs\n    # The total number of ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v is n*(n-1)\n    # The number of mutual pairs is 2*p\n    # The number of unidirectional pairs is total_ordered_pairs - mutual_pairs - non_reachable_pairs\n    # But how to find non_reachable_pairs?\n\n    # However, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs occurs when the DAG between components is a linear chain\n    # So the number of ordered pairs between different components is maximized as follows:\n    # Suppose we have components of sizes s_1, s_2, ..., s_m arranged in a linear order.\n    # Then for each pair of components (A, B) where A comes before B, all s_A * s_B ordered pairs from A to B are present.\n    # Similarly, none from B to A.\n    # Thus, the number of unidirectional pairs between components is sum_{i<j} s_i*s_j * 2 (since each direction is considered once)\n    # Wait no: for each pair of components A and B, if A is before B, then there are s_A*s_B ordered pairs from A to B (unidirectional) and none from B to A.
