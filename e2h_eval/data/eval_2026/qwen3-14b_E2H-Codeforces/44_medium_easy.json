He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, Polycarp has n problems arranged in order, and he needs to split them into exactly k days. Each day he solves a contiguous block of problems starting from the beginning. So the first day's problems are the first t1 problems, the second day's are next t2, etc., with t1 + t2 + ... + tk = n. And each day he must solve at least one problem. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The total profit is the sum of these maxima. Our goal is to maximize this total profit.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is to find the optimal way to split the array into k parts such that the sum of maxima of each part is as large as possible.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming here. Because for each position and number of days, we can track the maximum profit.\n\nLet me think about the DP approach. Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum profit we can get by splitting the first i problems into j days.\n\nThe base case would be dp[0][0] = 0, but maybe not. For example, dp[i][1] would be the maximum of the first i problems, since all must be done in one day.\n\nFor transitions, for dp[i][j], we need to consider where the previous split was. For example, for the j-th day, we can split the first m problems into j-1 days, and then take the max from m+1 to i for the j-th day. So:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) ), for m ranging from j-1 to i-1 (since each of the previous j-1 days must have at least one problem each, so m must be at least j-1, and i - m >=1, so m <= i-1).\n\nBut calculating this directly would be O(n^2 * k) time, which for n=2000 and k=2000 would be 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWait, but n and k are up to 2000. So O(n^2 *k) is 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10 operations. That's impossible to compute in time. So this approach is not feasible. So we need to find a way to optimize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to precompute the max values for ranges. For example, precompute a 2D array max_range[i][j] which represents the maximum value in a[i...j]. Then, when we need to compute the max from m+1 to i, we can get it quickly.\n\nBut even with that, the DP approach is O(n^2 *k), which is still too slow. Hmm. Let me think if there's a better way.\n\nWait, but for each j, maybe we can compute the DP for j days based on j-1 days. Let's think about how to compute dp[i][j].\n\nAnother thought: since the split must be contiguous and sequential, for the j-th day, the split must end at i. So for each i and j, we can look back to some m where the j-1th day ends at m, and then the j-th day is m+1 to i.\n\nBut again, the same problem arises. How to compute this efficiently?\n\nWait, but for each i and j, the maximum of a[m+1..i] can be calculated as follows. Let's say for each i, we can keep track of the maximums as we move m from j-1 to i-1. For example, for a fixed i and j, when we iterate m from j-1 to i-1, the max from m+1 to i can be computed incrementally. Because when m decreases by 1, the range becomes m+1 to i, which is adding a new element (a[m+1]) to the left. So for each i and j, we can track the current maximum as we go from m = i-1 down to j-1. Wait, but that might be possible.\n\nLet me think. For example, for a given i and j, when considering m from (j-1) to (i-1). For each m, the current day's max is max(a[m+1 ... i]). So if I start from m = i-1, the range is [i], which is a[i]. Then m decreases by 1, the range is [m+1 ... i] = [i-1, i], so the max is max(a[i-1], a[i]), and so on. So for each i and j, if we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, we can track the current maximum as we go. Then, for each m, the max for the current day is known, and we can compute dp[i][j] as the maximum of dp[m][j-1] + current_max.\n\nThis way, for each i and j, the inner loop over m is O(n), but with the max being tracked incrementally. So the overall time complexity would be O(n^2 *k). But for n=2000 and k=2000, that's 8e10 operations, which is way too big.\n\nBut wait, the constraints are n and k up to 2000. However, in practice, if k is up to n, but for each j, the DP depends on j-1. Let's think about the actual possible values for j. For example, for j=1, the only way is to take all the first i elements, and the max is the max of a[1..i]. For j=2, it's splitting into two parts, etc.\n\nBut even with that, O(n^2 *k) is too slow. So perhaps there's another way to optimize this.\n\nWait, but what if k is small? For example, if k is up to 2000, but n is 2000. Maybe there's a way to find that the DP can be optimized using certain observations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed. Since each day must take at least one problem, and the splits are contiguous. The key is that the maximum for each day is determined by the maximum in the segment.\n\nBut how can we find the optimal splits?\n\nAnother thought: Since each day's segment contributes its maximum, and we want to maximize the sum. Since the maximums are additive, perhaps we can arrange to have as many high-value elements as possible as individual maxima. For example, if there are multiple peaks, splitting between them may allow each peak to contribute to the sum.\n\nBut how to formalize this? For example, in the sample input, the array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]. The optimal split is [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2]. The maxima are 5,6,9. Notice that the 6 and 9 are both peaks. So splitting after the 6 (which is the max of the first part) and then taking 9 as the next max.\n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the DP approach, even though O(n^2 *k) is too slow, but with some optimizations, maybe it's manageable.\n\nWait, let's calculate the actual numbers. For n=2000 and k=2000, the worst case is when k=n. Then for each j, the DP[i][j] can be calculated. But when j equals i, then the split is each day one problem, so the sum is sum of a[i]. But for j=2000, the DP would be O(n^2) steps. But if n is 2000, then 2000^2 is 4 million, multiplied by k=2000 gives 8e9 operations. Which is way too big for Python to handle in time. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nThus, we need to find a better approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of the following. Since each day's segment must be consecutive and start from the beginning, the splits are determined by positions where the splits occur. For example, the splits are after positions s_1, s_2, ..., s_{k-1}, such that s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{k-1} < n. The first day is from 0 to s_1, the second day from s_1+1 to s_2, etc. But since the splits are cumulative, the splits are determined by the positions where the days end.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nWait, the maximum sum of maxima is achieved by making sure that each day's segment includes a high value, and that those high values are not covered by other segments. So for example, if there's a very high value, we want to have it as the maximum of its own day. But how to balance that with the need to split into k days.\n\nAnother observation: The maximum possible total profit is the sum of the top k elements of the array. But this is only possible if those elements can be separated into different days. However, since the array is processed in order, this is not always possible. For example, if the array is [1, 3, 2, 4], and k=2, the top two elements are 4 and 3. But to split into two days, the first day could be [1,3], and the second [2,4], sum 3 +4 =7. Or [1,3,2] and [4], sum 3+4=7. But if the array is [3,1,4,2], then splitting into [3], [1,4,2] gives sum 3+4=7, which is the sum of the top two elements.\n\nBut if the array is [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2], the top three elements are 9, 6, 5. Which is exactly the sample's solution. So the sum is 9 +6 +5=20. But in the sample, the sum is 5+6+9=20, which is the same. So perhaps the optimal strategy is to select the k largest elements, each as the maximum of their day. However, this is only possible if those elements are placed in such a way that they can be separated into different days. For example, if the array is [5, 6, 5], and k=2, the best is to split into [5,6] and [5], sum 6+5=11, or [5], [6,5] sum 5+6=11. But the top two elements are 6 and 5. So that works.\n\nBut what if there are multiple elements with the same value? For example, array [2000, 2000, 2000], k=2. Then the best is to split into [2000], [2000, 2000], sum 2000 + 2000 = 4000. Which is the sum of two of the elements.\n\nSo perhaps the problem reduces to selecting k elements, each of which is the maximum in their respective day, and the sum of these elements is maximized. However, how to ensure that the selected elements can be split into days in order.\n\nBut how to model this. For example, the selected elements must be in increasing order of positions. Because each day's segment comes after the previous one. So the selected elements must be in positions p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_k, and each p_i is the maximum in their respective day.\n\nBut how to find such positions. This seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, but perhaps in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as choosing k positions where each position is the maximum of its day. The days are consecutive. So for example, the first day ends at position p_1, the second ends at p_2, etc. Each of these p_i's must be such that the maximum of the segment from the previous end +1 to p_i is the value at p_i. Wait, no. Because the maximum could be somewhere else in the segment. But if we want to select the maximum of each segment, then perhaps we can choose to split the array in such a way that the maximum of each segment is as large as possible.\n\nBut this seems vague. Let me think again.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the problem for k days. The first day's segment is from 1 to x, the second from x+1 to y, etc. For each segment, the maximum is added to the total. To maximize the total, we want each segment's maximum to be as large as possible. However, the segments are overlapping in the sense that the choice of x affects the possibilities for the rest of the segments.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x, y, etc.\n\nAnother idea: Since the problem requires exactly k days, and each day must have at least one problem, the minimal number of days is 1 and maximal is n. So for k=1, the answer is the maximum of the entire array. For k=n, the answer is the sum of all elements.\n\nNow, for the DP approach, perhaps the O(n^2 *k) approach is manageable with some optimizations. Let's think about the actual constraints. For n=2000 and k=2000, the DP would have to compute 2000*2000 = 4 million entries. For each entry, we have O(n) steps. So 4 million * 2000 = 8e9 operations. That's way too much for Python, which can handle roughly 1e8 operations per second.\n\nBut perhaps the actual value of k is not up to n. For example, if k is small, like up to 100, then O(n^2 *k) would be manageable. However, the problem allows k up to 2000.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP approach. Let me think again about the DP transitions.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence again:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) ) for m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nIf we can compute the max(a[m+1..i]) efficiently for all m, then maybe we can proceed.\n\nAs mentioned before, for a fixed i and j, when m ranges from i-1 down to j-1, the max from m+1 to i can be maintained as we decrease m. Let's see:\n\nFor example, for i=5, j=2. We can iterate m from 4 down to 1 (assuming j-1 is 1). For each m, the range is m+1 to i. So when m=4, the range is 5, which is a[5]. When m=3, the range is 4-5, so max(a[4], a[5]). When m=2, the range is 3-5, so max of a[3], a[4], a[5], etc. So as m decreases, the range increases to the left. We can track the current maximum as we go.\n\nSo for each i and j, we can compute this in O(i) time. Thus, for each i and j, the time is O(i), and for all i and j, the total time is O(n^2 *k). But again, for n=2000 and k=2000, this is 8e9 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to reduce the time. Let's think about the constraints again. For example, for j, we can't have j > i. Because to split i problems into j days, each day must have at least one problem. So j can be at most i. So for each i, j can be from 1 to min(k, i). But even with that, the total number of states is O(nk), and for each state, O(n) time. So again, O(n²k).\n\nBut maybe there's an alternative way to think about the problem. For example, for the case where k is large, say k is close to n, the optimal way is to split into as many days as possible where each day's maximum is the maximum of the single element. But in that case, the sum is the sum of the elements. However, if there are multiple elements, but the sum is higher when grouping some elements. For example, if there's a very large element and others are small. But when k is large, you have to split into many days, so perhaps the optimal is to take the largest elements as individual days and group others.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to use this for a general solution.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem for the case when k is small. For example, when k=2, the optimal split is to split the array into two parts. The first part is from 1 to m, and the second from m+1 to n. The profit is max(a[1..m]) + max(a[m+1..n]). To maximize this, we can find the best m.\n\nBut for larger k, perhaps the problem can be approached greedily. But I don't think a greedy approach will work here. For example, consider the array [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2], and k=3. The optimal split is to take the first 3, then 2, then 3. The maxima are 5,6,9. Suppose we greedily take the maximum in the entire array (9) as the last day. Then the first two days have to split the first 6 elements into 2 days. The maxima would be 5 (from first 3) and 6 (from next 3). Which gives the same result. So maybe a greedy approach of choosing the next maximum in the remaining array as the split point.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, in the first step, we have to choose the split points such that the maximum of each day is as large as possible. However, this may not be optimal. Let's think of a counterexample. Suppose the array is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]. Suppose k=3. The maximum elements are 9, 6, 5. If we split to have 9 as the last day, then the first two days would need to cover the first 6 elements. The maximum for the first two days could be 4 and 5. Sum would be 4+5+9=18. Alternatively, if we split the first day as [3,1,4,1,5], then the first day's max is 5, and the second day [9,2,6], max 9. Then third day is none. Wait, no, k is 3. So maybe the split is [3,1,4,1,5], [9], [2,6]. Sum is 5+9+6=20. Which is better. So the greedy approach of taking the maximum of the entire array as the last day is better. But how to choose the splits for the first days.\n\nThis suggests that a greedy approach might work if we process the splits from the end. For example, for k days, we can choose the positions where the splits are made by finding the k-1 largest elements in the array, ensuring that each is in a separate day.\n\nBut how to do that. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nWe need to select k-1 split points. For each split point, we need to select a position such that the maximum in the segment from the previous split point to this split point is as large as possible.\n\nBut this is not straightforward. However, considering that each split must be made in the array, and the splits are in order, perhaps we can find the positions where the maximums are located.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the sample input. The maximum for the last day must be the maximum of some suffix of the array. Similarly, the maximum for the previous day must be the maximum of some prefix of the array up to the split point. So perhaps, we can find the positions for the splits in reverse order.\n\nFor example, for the last day, the maximum is the maximum of the last segment. To maximize the sum, we want the last segment's maximum to be as large as possible. So we can find the position of the maximum element in the entire array, and make that the last segment. Then, for the previous day, we can find the maximum in the remaining part, etc.\n\nBut this approach may not work for all cases. Let's take the sample input again. The array is [5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]. The maximum is 9, which is at position 7 (assuming 1-based). So the last day should be from 7 to 8. Then, the previous day's maximum is the maximum of the first 6 elements. The maximum of the first 6 elements is 6, which is at position 4. So the previous day is from 4 to 6. Then the first day is from 1 to 3. Which gives the sample solution.\n\nAnother example: the third sample input is [1, 2000, 2000, 2], k=2. The maximum of the entire array is 2000. So the last day could be from position 2 to 4 (the last 3 elements) with max 2000. Then the first day is [1], with max 1. Total is 2001. But the correct answer is 4000, which is achieved by splitting into [1,2000], [2000,2]. So the maximum of each day is 2000 and 2000. So in this case, the greedy approach of selecting the maximum of the entire array as the last day would not give the optimal solution. Because the maximum of the entire array is 2000, but if we split it into two days, each containing a 2000, the sum is higher.\n\nSo the greedy approach of choosing the maximum in the entire array as the last day is not sufficient. Hence, the approach of selecting the split points greedily may not work.\n\nThus, back to the DP approach. Perhaps we can find a way to optimize the DP for the given constraints.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible n and k. n is 2000, and k is 2000. But for each j, the value of j can't exceed i when computing dp[i][j].\n\nLet me think about the DP for j=1. It's easy: dp[i][1] = max(a[0..i-1]).\n\nFor j=2, dp[i][2] = max( dp[m][1] + max(a[m+1..i-1] )) for m from 1 to i-1.\n\nBut if we can compute the max(a[m+1..i]) quickly, then for each i and j, the computation can be done.\n\nBut how to precompute the max ranges. Well, we can precompute a 2D array where max_range[i][j] is the maximum of a[i..j], for 0 ≤ i ≤ j < n.\n\nThis can be precomputed in O(n²) time. For example, for each i, we can compute the max from i to j for j ≥i.\n\nOnce we have this, then for any m and i, the max from m+1 to i is max_range[m+1][i].\n\nBut even with this, the DP remains O(n²k) time.\n\nBut maybe with Python's speed, even O(n²k) is too slow. However, for n=2000, n² is 4 million. Multiply by k=2000, it's 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nBut perhaps the constraints for k are not that tight. For example, if the problem allows for k up to 2000, but in practice, the code can pass with some optimizations. However, I doubt it.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. The maximum profit is the sum of the maxima of k segments. Since each segment must be a prefix of the remaining array. So for the first day, we choose a segment of length t1, then for the second day, a segment of length t2 from the next part, etc.\n\nBut since the segments are prefixes, the problem is similar to partitioning the array into k parts, with each part being a prefix of the remaining array. So the problem is to choose k-1 split points, s_1, s_2, ..., s_{k-1}, such that 0 < s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{k-1} < n. The total profit is the sum of the maxima of each segment.\n\nNow, the question is to find these split points to maximize the sum.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming again, but with a different approach.\n\nLet me define dp[j][i] as the maximum profit for the first i problems split into j days.\n\nThen, dp[j][i] = max for m from j-1 to i-1 of dp[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nNow, for the base case, dp[1][i] = max(a[0..i-1]).\n\nNow, for the transition, for each j from 2 to k, and for each i from j to n, we can compute dp[j][i].\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nThe problem is that for each j and i, the inner loop is O(i) steps. But perhaps with some optimizations, like precomputing the max_range array, we can compute this.\n\nLet me try to write the code for this approach, and see if it can be optimized.\n\nFirst, precompute the max_range array.\n\nIn Python, for n=2000, the max_range can be computed as follows:\n\nmax_range = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_max = a[i]\n    max_range[i][i] = current_max\n    for j in range(i+1, n):\n        current_max = max(current_max, a[j])\n        max_range[i][j] = current_max\n\nThis takes O(n²) time, which is acceptable for n=2000.\n\nOnce we have this, the DP can proceed.\n\nThen, for the DP table:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp with dimensions (k+1) x (n+1). Since Python uses 0-based indices, perhaps it's easier to adjust the indices accordingly.\n\nBut for the code, let's assume that a is 0-based.\n\nThen, dp[j][i] represents the maximum profit for the first i elements split into j days.\n\nSo for j=1, dp[1][i] = max_range[0][i-1].\n\nFor j>1, dp[j][i] = max( dp[j-1][m] + max_range[m][i-1] ), for m ranging from j-1 to i-1.\n\nWait, because the first m elements are split into j-1 days, and the next i-m elements are the j-th day. So the j-th day is from m to i-1 (since m is the number of elements in the first j-1 days). Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the indices.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nSuppose we have i elements. We want to split them into j days. The first j-1 days cover m elements (m ranges from j-1 to i-1, since each of the j-1 days must have at least 1 element, and the j-th day must have at least 1 element, so m can be from j-1 to i-1). Then the j-th day covers i - m elements, which are the elements from m to i-1 (assuming 0-based array).\n\nSo the max for the j-th day is max_range[m][i-1].\n\nSo the recurrence is:\n\ndp[j][i] = max( dp[j-1][m] + max_range[m][i-1] for m in range(j-1, i) )\n\nBut for each j and i, this requires iterating over m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut with the precomputed max_range, this is possible.\n\nNow, considering that n is 2000 and k is 2000, this approach may not be feasible for Python, but perhaps with some optimizations, like using rolling arrays or limiting the j's.\n\nBut given that the problem is from a programming competition, perhaps the intended solution is this DP approach, and the test cases are designed to fit within the time constraints.\n\nLet me try to think about the time complexity again. For n=2000 and k=2000, the DP would have to compute for each j from 1 to k, and for each i from 1 to n. For each of these, for j from 2 to k, and i from j to n, the inner loop runs O(i) steps. So total operations are sum_{j=1}^k sum_{i=j}^n O(i) = sum_{j=1}^k sum_{i=j}^n i.\n\nWhich is roughly O(k * n²). For n=2000 and k=2000, this is O(2000 * 2000²) = 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nBut wait, what if k is up to n? For example, when k=n, the inner loops would be for j from 1 to n, and for each i from j to n. For j=n, i can only be n. So for j=n, the inner loop is O(1). For j= n-1, i ranges from n-1 to n. For each i, the inner loop is O(i) steps. But this is still O(n²) for j=n-1. So overall, the total number of operations is O(k * n²) which is O(n³) in the worst case. For n=2000, this is 8e9 operations, which is way beyond what can be handled in Python in reasonable time.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible. So what can be done?\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem differently. Since the splits are contiguous and must be in order, the maximum for each day is the maximum of the segment. So, for the first day, the maximum is the maximum of the first t1 elements. For the second day, the maximum is the maximum of the next t2 elements, and so on.\n\nBut the sum of these maxima is what we need to maximize.\n\nNow, let's think about the problem as follows: the maximum sum is the sum of the maxima of the k segments. To maximize this sum, we need to select the k segments such that each segment's maximum is as large as possible.\n\nBut how to choose these segments. One observation is that the maximum of the entire array must be included in one of the segments. Also, the second maximum must be in a different segment, etc. But this is not necessarily true, but it's a direction to think.\n\nAnother Idea: For the DP approach, perhaps we can find that for each j and i, the optimal m is not arbitrary. For example, when trying to compute dp[j][i], we can find that the optimal m is such that the max_range[m][i-1] is as large as possible. But how to use this.\n\nAlternatively, for each j and i, the optimal m for dp[j][i] is such that the max_range[m][i-1] is the maximum possible. But this is not necessarily true because the dp[j-1][m] also plays a role.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find for each i and j, the best m.\n\nBut I'm stuck here.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the array is processed in order, perhaps for each j, the optimal way to split the first i elements into j days is to take the maximum of the first i elements and split it into the last day. For example, for j days, the last day's maximum is the maximum of the last segment. So perhaps the DP can be optimized by considering that for each i and j, the optimal m is such that the segment m+1 to i contains the maximum of the entire array up to i.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the sample input again. For j=3, i=8. The maximum of the entire array is 9, which is in the last segment. So the optimal m for j=3 and i=8 is m=6 (since the segment from 7 to 8 has max 9). Then, dp[3][8] = dp[2][6] + 9. And dp[2][6] is the maximum for splitting the first 6 elements into 2 days. Which would be splitting into [5,4,2,6] and [5,1], giving max 6 +5=11. Or [5,4,2] and [6,5,1], which is 5 +6=11. So the total is 11 +9=20, which matches the sample.\n\nSo in this case, the last segment contains the maximum of the entire array. Perhaps this is a general pattern. If we can find that the optimal way to split into j days is to have the last segment contain the maximum of the first i elements, then we can find the optimal m as the position where the maximum occurs.\n\nBut how to determine this. For example, if the maximum of the first i elements is at position p. Then, the last segment is from p to i. But then, the previous segments are split into j-1 days from the first p elements.\n\nBut this may not always be the case. Let's think of a case where splitting the last segment to include the maximum is not optimal.\n\nConsider the array [5, 6, 3, 4], and k=2. The maximum is 6 at position 1 (assuming 0-based). If we split into [5,6], [3,4], the sum is 6 +4=10. Alternatively, if we split into [5], [6,3,4], the sum is 5 +6=11. Which is better. So in this case, the last segment contains the maximum of the entire array, and the sum is higher. So this supports the idea.\n\nAnother example: array [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6], k=3. The maximum is 9. If we split the array into [3,1,4,1,5], [9], [2,6], sum is 5 +9 +6=20. Alternatively, if we split into [3,1,4,1,5,9], [2], [6], sum is 9 +2 +6=17. Or [3,1,4,1,5], [9,2], [6], sum is 5 +9 +6=20. Or [3,1,4], [1,5,9,2], [6], sum is 4 +9 +6=19. So the best is to have the last segment contain the maximum. So this suggests that it's beneficial to have the last segment contain the maximum of the entire array.\n\nThus, perhaps the optimal way is to always have the last segment contain the maximum of the current array. This could lead to a greedy approach.\n\nSo, for the DP, when computing dp[j][i], we can look for the position of the maximum in the first i elements, say pos. Then, the last segment is from pos to i, and the previous segments are split into j-1 days for the first pos elements.\n\nBut how to verify this. Let's think of a case where this approach may not work.\n\nConsider the array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and k=2. The maximum is 5, at position 0. So the last segment would be [5], and the first segment would be [4,3,2,1], sum is 5 +4=9. But alternatively, if the last segment is [5,4,3,2,1], sum is 5 +5=10. Wait, no. For k=2, the split must be into two days. If the last segment is the entire array, then the first day is zero elements, which is invalid. So the only valid split is to have the first day as some m elements, and the second day as the rest.\n\nIn this case, the maximum of the entire array is 5, which is in the first day. So the best split is to have the first day as [5], and the second day as the rest, giving sum 5 +4=9. Which is indeed the best possible.\n\nAnother example: array [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6], k=3. The maximum is 9. So the last segment must include it. So the first two days are split into the first 6 elements. For the first two days, we can split into [3,1,4,1,5], [9], giving sum 5",
