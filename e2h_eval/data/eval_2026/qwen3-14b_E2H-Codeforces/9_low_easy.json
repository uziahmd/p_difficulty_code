Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, so a standard knapsack approach might not work here because with n=1e5 and m=3e5, the O(nm) solution would be way too slow. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can handle each weight category separately. For example, for all items of weight 1, we can take as many as possible (sorted by cost descending), same for weight 2 and 3. But how do we combine them optimally?\n\nWait, but there's a catch. Because taking some items of weight 2 might be better than taking two items of weight 1. So the problem becomes how to optimally choose between different combinations of items of different weights.\n\nLet me think about grouping items by their weight. For each weight group, sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, precompute a prefix sum array. For example, for weight 1, we have a list of prefix sums where the i-th element represents the maximum cost when taking i items of weight 1. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce I have these prefix sums, I can iterate over possible numbers of items of weight 3 and 2, and compute how many items of weight 1 can fit into the remaining capacity. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, since the weights are small, maybe we can use dynamic programming with a twist. Let me think again.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible number of items of weight 3, say k, then for the remaining weight, we can consider the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items. But even this approach could be O(m) for each k, which might not be efficient enough.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the maximum possible number of items of weight 3 is m//3. Let's say we have up to 1e5 items, but m can be up to 3e5. So for each possible count of weight 3 items (say, up to 1e5?), but maybe it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let me think again.\n\nLet me break down the problem:\n\nFirst, separate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3. For each group, sort them in descending order of cost, and compute prefix sums. Then, for each group, we can take any number of items up to the maximum possible given the weight.\n\nSo for example, for the weight 1 group, the maximum number of items is min(k, m), where k is the number of items in that group. But the problem is combining these choices across different groups.\n\nThe key is that for each possible number of items taken from the weight 3 group, we can compute the remaining capacity and then find the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute that combination quickly?\n\nFor the combination of weight 1 and 2 items, given a certain remaining capacity, how do we find the best selection?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have a total capacity of 'rem' left. How to select items from weight 1 and 2 to maximize the cost.\n\nThis seems like a classic unbounded knapsack problem, but since the items are sorted, maybe there's a way to compute this quickly.\n\nWait, but for the weight 1 and 2 items, since they are sorted, we can precompute their prefix sums. Let's say we have:\n\n- For weight 1 items: prefix1[i] = sum of first i items.\n- For weight 2 items: prefix2[j] = sum of first j items.\n\nThen, given a capacity 'rem', we can try all possible numbers of weight 2 items (say, j), and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (i = rem - 2*j). But since j can't exceed min(len(prefix2), rem//2), and then i can't exceed len(prefix1). So for each possible j, compute the total value as prefix2[j] + prefix1[rem - 2*j], but ensuring that rem - 2*j >=0 and that we don't take more items than available.\n\nBut this would take O(rem) time for each step. However, if rem is up to m (say 3e5), and for each possible number of weight 3 items (say up to 1e5), this would be O(3e5 * 1e5) which is way too slow.\n\nHmm. So that approach is",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry given a weight constraint. Each souvenir has a weight of either 1, 2, or 3, and we aim to maximize the total cost while respecting the weight limit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Items by Weight**: Separate the items into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, and 3).\n2. **Sort and Compute Prefix Sums**: For each group, sort the items by their cost in descending order and compute prefix sums to quickly determine the maximum cost for taking the first `k` items.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Combinations**: For each possible number of weight 3 items that can be taken, compute the remaining capacity and then determine the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fit within this remaining capacity using precomputed prefix sums.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    w1 = []\n    w2 = []\n    w3 = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        wi = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ci = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        if wi == 1:\n            w1.append(ci)\n        elif wi == 2:\n            w2.append(ci)\n        else:\n            w3.append(ci)\n\n    # Sort each list in descending order\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Compute prefix sums for each weight\n    prefix1 = [0]\n    for c in w1:\n        prefix1.append(prefix1[-1] + c)\n\n    prefix2 = [0]\n    for c in w2:\n        prefix2.append(prefix2[-1] + c)\n\n    prefix3 = [0]\n    for c in w3:\n        prefix3.append(prefix3[-1] + c)\n\n    max_total = 0\n\n    # Try all possible numbers of weight 3 items\n    max_k3 = min(len(prefix3)-1, m // 3)\n    for k3 in range(0, max_k3 + 1):\n        weight_used = k3 * 3\n        remaining = m - weight_used\n        # Now handle weight 1 and 2 with remaining capacity\n        # For each possible number of weight 2 items, j\n        max_j = min(len(prefix2)-1, remaining // 2)\n        # To optimize, find the best j in 0..max_j, and corresponding i = remaining - 2*j\n        # But since prefix1 is sorted, we can take min(i, len(prefix1)-1)\n        # So for each j, compute the value\n        # However, trying all j from 0 to max_j is O(max_j), which could be up to 1.5e5\n        # So overall, it's O(1.5e5) * O(1e5) = 1.5e10?

Since the prefix arrays are sorted, the best j is such that we take as many high-value items as possible.\n\n        # However, even this doesn't give us a clear way to compute it quickly.\n\n        # Wait, but for the combination of w1 and w2, the problem is similar to a knapsack with two item types. Since the weights are small, perhaps we can use a two-pointer approach.\n\n        # Let me think: For the remaining capacity rem, we can have j as the number of w2 items. For each j, the number of w1 items is i = rem - 2*j.

However, since rem can be up to 3e5, and we have to do this for each k3, this might not help.\n\n        # Alternatively, let's note that for each rem, the optimal combination can be found by considering the best between taking as many w2 items as possible, or as many w1 items as possible, or a mix.\n\n        # However, without knowing the exact distribution, this might not work.\n\n        # Let's try to think differently. Let's precompute the best possible for all possible combinations of w1 and w2 up to the maximum possible capacity.\n\n        # But that's not feasible due to memory constraints.\n\n        # Maybe we can use the fact that for each possible rem, the optimal number of w2 items is up to rem//2, but we can find the best j in O(1) time using some pre-processing.\n\n        # Let's try to find the optimal j for the current rem.\n\n        # For example, the best j is the one that maximizes prefix2[j] + prefix1[rem - 2*j], but with rem - 2*j >= 0 and j <= len(prefix2)-1.\n\n        # This looks like a problem where we can use two pointers.

For example, we can try j from max(0, max_j - 1000) to max_j, and also j from 0 to min(1000, max_j). This is a heuristic to reduce the number of iterations.\n\n        # But this is not guaranteed to work, but given the problem's constraints, it might pass.\n\n        # However, the correct way is to find the best j in O(1) time for each rem.\n\n        # Let's think again: For a given rem, the optimal j is the one that maximizes prefix2[j] + prefix1[rem - 2*j].

So perhaps we can limit the number of j's we check.\n\n        # Another observation: for the current remaining, the best combination of w1 and w2 can be found by considering that for each possible number of w2 items (up to max_j), we can compute the best possible number of w1 items.\n\n        # However, with m up to 3e5, and n up to 1e5, maybe it's manageable.\n\n        # Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n        # Let's compute the best for this remaining\n        best = 0\n        max_j = min(len(prefix2)-1, remaining // 2)\n        # Let's try all possible j from 0 to max_j, but also consider the possibility of taking some j' where j' is up to max_j, and then the corresponding i is remaining - 2*j'\n\n        # To optimize, we can loop j from 0 to min(max_j, len(prefix2)-1), and for each, take i = min(remaining - 2*j, len(prefix1)-1)\n        # Then the value is prefix2[j] + prefix1[i]\n\n        # However, even for max_j up to 1.5e5, and max_k3 up to 1e5, this is 1.5e5 * 1e5 = 1.5e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\n        # Therefore, we need a better approach.\n\n        # Alternative idea: For the remaining capacity, the optimal number of w2 items can be determined by considering that for each possible j, we can take up to (remaining - 2*j) items of w1. Since the prefix arrays are sorted, the best j is such that we take as many high-value items as possible.\n\n        # However, even this doesn't give us a clear way to compute it quickly.\n\n        # Wait, but for the combination of w1 and w2, the problem is similar to a knapsack with two item types. Since the weights are small, perhaps we can use a two-pointer approach.\n\n        # Let me think: For the remaining capacity rem, we can have j as the number of w2 items. For each j, the number of w1 items is i = rem - 2*j. But since i can't be more than the available w1 items, and j can't be more than available w2 items.\n\n        # Let's try to find the optimal j in the range [0, min(max_j, rem//2)], and for each j, compute i = min(rem - 2*j, len(prefix1)-1). The total value is prefix2[j] + prefix1[i].\n\n        # But again, this would be O(max_j) per k3.\n\n        # However, considering that the maximum possible m is 3e5, and for each k3, the maximum j is up to 1.5e5, but the total number of k3 is up to 1e5, this approach is not feasible for the worst case.\n\n        # So perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the best combination of w1 and w2 for a given rem.\n\n        # Another idea: For each possible rem, we can precompute the best combination of w1 and w2. However, since rem can be up to 3e5, and we have to do this for each k3, this might not help.\n\n        # Alternatively, let's note that for each rem, the optimal combination can be found by considering the best between taking as many w2 items as possible, or as many w1 items as possible, or a mix.\n\n        # However, without knowing the exact distribution, this might not work.\n\n        # Let's try to think differently. Let's precompute the best possible for all possible combinations of w1 and w2 up to the maximum possible capacity.\n\n        # But that's not feasible due to memory constraints.\n\n        # Maybe we can use the fact that for each possible rem, the optimal number of w2 items is up to rem//2, but we can find the best j in O(1) time using some pre-processing.\n\n        # Let's try to find the optimal j for the current rem.\n\n        # For example, the best j is the one that maximizes prefix2[j] + prefix1[rem - 2*j], but with rem - 2*j >= 0 and j <= len(prefix2)-1.\n\n        # This looks like a problem where we can use two pointers. Let's assume that we can iterate j from 0 to max_j, but find the optimal in O(1) time.\n\n        # However, I don't see an immediate way to do this.\n\n        # Given the time constraints, perhaps the original approach is acceptable with optimizations.\n\n        # Let's proceed with the following code:\n\n        # For the current remaining capacity, find the best combination of w1 and w2.\n\n        # Let's try all possible j in a limited range. For example, we can try j from max(0, max_j - 1000) to max_j, and also j from 0 to min(1000, max_j). This is a heuristic to reduce the number of iterations.\n\n        # But this is not guaranteed to work, but given the problem's constraints, it might pass.\n\n        # However, the correct way is to find the best j in O(1) time for each rem.\n\n        # Let's think again: For a given rem, the optimal j is the one that maximizes prefix2[j] + prefix1[rem - 2*j]. Since prefix1 is non-decreasing and prefix2 is non-decreasing, the function may have a single peak, and we can use ternary search to find the optimal j.\n\n        # Ternary search on j in [0, max_j], since the function is unimodal.\n\n        # Let me check if the function is unimodal.
