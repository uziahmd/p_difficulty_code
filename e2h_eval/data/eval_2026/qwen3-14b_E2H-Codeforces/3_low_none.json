Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum radius d that lanterns need to have so that the entire street is lit. The street is from 0 to l, and there are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up points within a distance d from it. We need to find the smallest possible d such that every point on the street is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. So the approach here is probably to look for the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would be the point that requires the largest d to cover.\n\nWait, but also we need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end of the street. Because the first lantern might be at some position a1, and then the area from 0 to a1 - d needs to be covered. Wait no, the lantern's light covers up to d distance. So if a lantern is at position a, then it covers from a - d to a + d. But since the street is from 0 to l, the coverage is clamped to that.\n\nSo for example, if the first lantern is at position a (a > 0), then the area from 0 to a - d must be covered by the lantern. Wait, no. The lantern's coverage starts at a - d. If that's less than zero, then the coverage starts at 0. So for the very beginning of the street, the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo here's an idea: sort the lantern positions. Then, check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each gap between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance that needs to be covered is half of that gap. Because if you have two lanterns separated by distance g, then the midpoint between them is at g/2 away from each. So the minimal d needed for that gap is g/2. But wait, that's only if the lanterns are placed optimally. Because if you have two lanterns, their coverage areas must overlap in such a way that the entire street between them is covered. So the maximum distance between two adjacent lanterns divided by two would be the required d for that segment.\n\nBut then there's also the first part of the street. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The required d for that part would be a1, because the lantern's coverage starts at a1 - d. To cover 0, we need a1 - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. But wait, if the lantern is at a1, then the leftmost coverage is a1 - d. So for 0 to be covered, a1 - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a1. But if the lantern is at a1, then the coverage extends to a1 + d. But if the next lantern is at a2, then the gap between a1 and a2 is a2 - a1. The maximum required d for that gap is (a2 - a1)/2, as before. Similarly for the end of the street. So the last lantern's position is a_n. The distance from a_n to l is l - a_n. So d must be at least that.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the first lantern's position. The initial required d is a[0] (since the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0], and d must be at least that to cover 0).\n3. Check the last lantern's position. The required d is l - a[-1].\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them (current a[i] - previous a[i-1]). The required d for that gap is (gap)/2. Because the middle of the gap is (gap)/2 away from each lantern.\n5. The maximum of all these values (initial, end, and gaps) is the minimal required d.\n\nWait, but why? Let me think again. Suppose two consecutive lanterns are at positions x and y (x < y). The maximum distance between them is y - x. The worst case is the middle point between x and y. The distance from x to that point is (y - x)/2. So d must be at least that. Because the lantern at x can cover up to x + d. The lantern at y can cover down to y - d. So for the entire interval between x and y to be covered, the distance between x and y must be <= 2d.",
