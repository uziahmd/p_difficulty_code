Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance d from their position. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to approach this problem. The key idea is probably to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the radius needs to cover half of that gap (since each lantern can cover up to d on either side). But also, we have to consider the ends of the street. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would determine the required d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they are not sorted, the consecutive ones can't be considered properly. For example, if the lanterns are at positions 5 and 3, then the gap between them is 2, but when sorted, it's 3 and 5, so the gap is 2. So sorting is necessary.\n\n2. After sorting, check the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a candidate for d. Similarly, the distance from the last lantern to l is another candidate. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap divided by 2 is another candidate for d. Because, for example, if two lanterns are 4 units apart, then each covers up to d from their positions. So the middle point between them would require d to be at least 2 units (so that each covers half the gap).\n\nWait, right. Let's say two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b). The maximum distance between them is b - a. The worst case is the midpoint between them. The distance from a to the midpoint is (b - a)/2. So the required d must be at least (b - a)/2. So for each consecutive pair, we calculate that value and take the maximum.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial maximum d as the maximum between the first lantern's position (since the start of the street is 0) and (l - last lantern's position).\n- Then, for each consecutive pair in the sorted list, compute the gap between them, divide by 2, and compare with the current maximum. The overall maximum is the required d.\n\nWait, but why? Because for the first lantern, if it's at position a1, then the area from 0 to a1 is covered by the first lantern's left side. So the required d must be at least a1. Because if the lantern is at a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. So the lantern's light must reach that. Similarly for the end.\n\nBut for the gaps between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns is (current - previous). The maximum of (current - previous) / 2 is the required d for that gap. Because the middle point between them is (previous + current)/2. The distance from previous to that point is (current - previous)/2. So the d must be at least that. So the maximum among all these values is the answer.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for i from 1 to n-1:\n\ngap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_candidate = gap / 2\n\nif current_candidate > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nAt the end, return max_d.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1, l=5, and the lantern is at 0. Then the max_d is max(0, 5-0) = 5. Which is correct because the lantern has to cover from 0 to 5, so d must be 5. Similarly, if the lantern is at 2.5, then the max_d is max(2.5, 5-2.5) = 2.5, which is correct.\n\nYes, that seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCheck the first and last positions.\n\nCheck the gaps between consecutive positions.\n\nTake the maximum between those.\n\nSo let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, the array is [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nFirst lantern is 0, so the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ such that all points on a street of length $ l $ are illuminated by lanterns placed at various positions along the street. Each lantern can illuminate points within a distance $ d $ from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check the Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position $ l $).\n3. **Compute Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap divided by 2 gives the minimum radius required to cover that gap.\n4. **Determine the Maximum Radius**: The required radius $ d $ is the maximum value among the distances from the ends of the street and the gaps between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the first lantern\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n    # Check the last lantern\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting ensures that we can easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Ends of the Street**: The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street are critical because these areas might not be covered by any other lanterns.\n- **Gaps Between Lanterns**: The maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns determines the minimum radius needed to ensure that the entire street is illuminated. This is because the worst-case scenario for coverage between two lanterns is the midpoint between them, which requires a radius equal to half the gap between the lanterns.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius $ d $ by considering all critical points on the street, ensuring that the entire length is covered with minimal $ d $. The algorithm runs in $ O(n \\log n) $ time due to sorting, which is efficient given the constraints.",
