The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given number n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such graphs.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement to make sure I get the construction rules right. \n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must have k new vertices connected to them. And this step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the process is like building layers. \n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's consider the example given: for k=4, the smallest snowflake. Let's see:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then add 4 nodes connected to it. Now, each of those 4 nodes is a leaf. Then, each of those leaves must have k new nodes connected. So each of the 4 nodes gets 4 new children. So total nodes would be 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? But the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nWait the problem says: the initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., the leaves) is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the process is:\n\n- Step 0: 1 node.\n- Step 1: add k nodes connected to the root. Now, the total nodes is 1 + k. But then, the next step (step 2) is to add k nodes to each of the leaves (the ones added in step 1). So after step 2, the total is 1 + k + k * k. But this step (adding to the leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake for k=4 would be 1 +4 +4*4 = 21? But in the sample input, when n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm, that suggests that there's a different way of constructing the snowflake. Maybe the steps can be done multiple times?\n\nWait, perhaps the construction allows for varying numbers of steps. Let me think again. The process is:\n\nInitially, there's one node. Then, we add k nodes connected to it. Then, each time, any node that is a leaf (connected to only one other) must have k new nodes added. And this step (of adding to leaves) must be done at least once. So the process could be:\n\nLet me model the number of nodes as a function of the number of steps. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as a tree. The root has k children. Each of those children has k children, and so on. But the process requires that each time you add layers. However, the steps are done in a way that after the initial step (adding the first layer), you must perform at least one more step of adding layers. So the minimal snowflake would be when you do the initial step (adding first layer) and then one more step (adding second layer). But perhaps the steps can be done more than once.\n\nSo for example, the number of nodes would be:\n\nLet’s say that the snowflake is built with m layers. The root is layer 0. Then layer 1 has k nodes, each connected to the root. Then layer 2 has k^2 nodes, each connected to a node in layer 1. Then layer 3 has k^3 nodes, etc. But the construction requires that the step of adding layers (after the initial step) is done at least once. So the minimal number of layers is 2 (since the initial step is adding the first layer, then adding the second layer once).\n\nSo the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of layers minus 1. But wait, the initial step is adding the first layer (layer 1). Then, the step of adding to leaves is done once (layer 2). So for m layers, the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, but with the constraint that m >= 2? Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k nodes (layer 1). Then, the step of adding to leaves (each leaf is in layer 1) is done once. So each node in layer 1 adds k children. So layer 2 has k * k = k² nodes. Then, the total number of nodes is 1 (root) + k (layer 1) + k² (layer 2) = 1 + k + k². But the problem says that the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. So this would be allowed. However, if we do another step, adding to leaves again (layer 2 nodes are leaves now), then each of the k² nodes would get k children. So the total becomes 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nSo the snowflake can be represented as a tree where the number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once). Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes). Then the step of adding to leaves (the first layer's nodes) is done once. That gives us m=2 layers. So the sum is 1 +k +k². So m is the number of layers, which is at least 2. Wait, the sum from i=0 to m is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. For example, if m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But that would be the case where we added the first layer but didn't do the step of adding to leaves. Which is not allowed. Therefore, the snowflake's total number of nodes must be equal to (k^{d} - 1)/(k-1), where d is the number of layers (d ≥ 2). Because for d layers, the sum is (k^d -1)/(k-1). Wait, the sum from i=0 to d-1 of k^i is (k^d -1)/(k-1). So if the snowflake has d layers, then the total number of nodes is S = (k^d -1)/(k-1), and d must be at least 2. Because for d=2, S = 1 +k. But wait, according to the problem statement, the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. So for the initial step (adding the first layer) and then adding to leaves once (second layer). So the sum would be 1 +k +k². Which would be for d=3 layers. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express.\n\nLet me think of the process as follows:\n\nThe initial node is layer 0. Then, we add layer 1 (k nodes). Then, each node in layer 1 must have k children (layer 2). Then, each node in layer 2 must have k children (layer 3), etc. However, the process requires that after the initial step (adding layer 1), the step of adding to leaves (which is adding layer 2) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have layers 0, 1, 2. The total number of nodes is 1 +k +k². So for this case, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) - but wait, the sum from i=0 to 2 is 1 +k +k² = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So the formula for the sum of a geometric series is correct.\n\nBut then, for any number of layers, say d layers (starting from 0), the total number of nodes is S = (k^d -1)/(k-1). But the constraints are that d ≥ 2 (since the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once). Wait, no. Because for d=2, the sum is 1 +k. Which would be the case where we have layer 0 and 1. But according to the problem statement, after adding layer 1 (the initial step), the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. So that would require adding layer 2. Hence, the minimal number of layers is 3 (layers 0, 1, 2). Therefore, the minimal sum is 1 +k +k². So for the snowflake to exist, the number of nodes must be equal to (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some integer k ≥2 and d ≥3? Or perhaps d ≥2?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting the layers wrong. Let me think again. The initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the step of adding to leaves (each of the k nodes in the first layer) is done once. So that's adding k *k nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k². So for this case, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². So d is 3. So the formula is S = (k^d -1)/(k-1) where d ≥ 3? Or maybe d ≥ 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of layers can be considered as the depth. For example, the root is depth 0. Then, the first layer (children of root) is depth 1. Then, their children are depth 2. So the snowflake must have at least two layers (depth 0 and 1, but that would be 1 +k nodes, which is not allowed because the step of adding to leaves must be done once. So adding to leaves once would require adding a second layer. So the snowflake must have at least depth 2. Therefore, the total nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m is the maximum depth. And m must be ≥2. So the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for m ≥2, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for example, m=2 (depth 2), the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥2 and d ≥3. Or wait, perhaps d is the number of layers. Let me rephrase:\n\nEach snowflake is a tree where each node (except leaves) has exactly k children. And the tree has depth at least 2. Because the step of adding to leaves must be done once. So the depth is at least 2. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d is the depth. Wait, no. The sum from i=0 to depth. For example, if depth is 2, then sum is 1 +k +k². So the formula is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So for the snowflake to exist, n must be equal to that expression for some k≥2 and d≥2 (since depth is at least 2). Wait, but if depth is 2, then the sum is 1 +k +k². But for depth 2, the step of adding to leaves was done once. So yes, that's allowed. So the formula is (k^{d} -1)/(k-1) where d ≥3? Or d ≥2? Let me check with the example.\n\nIn the sample input, n=13 is a YES. Let's see. Let's try possible values. For example, if d=3 (so the formula is (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k²). Let's see for k=3: 1+3+9=13. Yes! So 13 is allowed. So that's why the sample input says YES for 13.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6, output is NO. Let's see. For k=2, d=3: (2^3 -1)/(2-1) =7. Which is larger than 6. For d=2, (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. So for k+1=6, k=5. But then d=2. But wait, earlier analysis said that d must be at least 2. Wait, if d is the exponent in the formula (k^d -1)/(k-1) = sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i. So if d is 3, then sum is 1 +k +k². So for the snowflake to exist, the sum must be equal to n, and the depth (d-1) must be ≥2. So d-1 ≥2 → d ≥3. Therefore, the formula is (k^d -1)/(k-1) where k≥2, d≥3. So the sum is for d ≥3. So for example, for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². For d=4, it's 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written in the form (k^d -1)/(k-1) for integers k ≥2 and d ≥3. But how do we check this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 1e18?\n\nNow, the question is for each test case n, determine whether there exists k ≥2 and d ≥3 such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how can we check this?\n\nFirst, note that (k^d -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nSo for each n, we need to check if there exists a pair (k, d) with k≥2, d≥3 such that this sum equals n.\n\nNow, considering that d can be up to log_2(n) (since for k=2, the sum for d is 2^d -1, which grows exponentially). For example, for n=1e18, the maximum d is around 60, since 2^60 is ~1e18.\n\nSo for each n, we can iterate over possible d (from 3 up to log_2(n)+1), and for each d, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to find k for a given d?\n\nFor a fixed d, the sum S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1} = (k^d -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation as:\n\nk^d -1 = n*(k-1)\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nk^d -n*k + (n-1) = 0.\n\nBut solving this equation for k is not straightforward. However, for a fixed d, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nBecause for fixed d, the sum increases as k increases. For example, when d is fixed, the sum is a strictly increasing function of k. So for each d, we can perform binary search on k to see if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut what's the range for k?\n\nFor a given d, the minimum possible k is 2. The maximum possible k can be found by noting that the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≤ n. Since for k ≥2, the sum is at least 1 +2 + 2² + ... + 2^{d-1} = 2^d -1. So if n is less than 2^d -1, then there's no solution for this d. Otherwise, the upper bound for k can be found.\n\nBut for each d, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≤n. Since the sum for k is increasing, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper limit. For example, for a given d, the sum is at least 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{d-1} ≤n → k ≤n^(1/(d-1)).\n\nTherefore, for each d, the upper bound for k is n^(1/(d-1)).\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and d can be up to 60, for each d, the binary search would be feasible.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n is 1, output NO (since the minimal snowflake is for k=2, d=3: sum is 1+2+4=7. So n=1 is not possible).\n\n- Else, check for all possible d ≥3, up to log_2(n) +1. For each d, perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper limit to see if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nIf for any d and k, the sum equals n, then output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nFirst, for each n, we need to check for all possible d starting from 3 up to maximum possible d. What's the maximum possible d? For d, the minimal sum for that d is when k=2. So the sum is 2^d -1 (since (2^d -1)/(2-1) = 2^d -1). So for n, the maximum d is such that 2^d -1 ≤n → d ≤ log2(n+1). So for n up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is around 60.\n\nSo for each n, we can iterate d from 3 up to 60 (or until 2^d -1 exceeds n).\n\nFor each d, we perform a binary search for k in [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound can be calculated as floor(n^(1/(d-1))) ), since for k ≥2, the sum is at least 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} (since 1 + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1}).\n\nBut how to compute upper_bound for k? Well, for a given d, the sum S = (k^d -1)/(k-1) =n. We can approximate that for large k, S ≈k^{d-1}. So k^{d-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nThus, for binary search, the upper limit for k is n^{1/(d-1)}.\n\nBut how to compute this in code? For example, in Python, we can compute it as int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2 (to account for possible rounding errors).\n\nOnce we have the binary search range for k, for each candidate k, compute the sum and check if it equals n.\n\nBut computing the sum directly may be problematic for large exponents. For example, for k=2 and d=60, the sum is 2^60 -1, which is manageable as a 64-bit integer. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so it's okay.\n\nBut during the computation, for each k and d, we need to calculate the sum S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}.\n\nBut calculating this sum directly can be done with a loop, but for large d, that could take O(d) time. However, since d is up to 60, and per test case, this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum using the formula (k^d -1)//(k-1), but we need to make sure that this is accurate. However, when k=1, the formula is invalid, but since k ≥2, it's okay.\n\nBut wait, for k=2 and d=3, the formula gives (8-1)/(2-1) =7, which is correct.\n\nBut for large exponents, calculating k^d can be expensive? Well, in Python, exponentiation is efficient, but for k up to 1e6 and d up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nif n < 7 (since the minimal possible sum is 7 for k=2, d=3), then output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nfor d in 3 to max_d (say, 60):\n\n   compute the minimal sum for this d, which is when k=2: sum_min = 2^d -1.\n\n   if sum_min >n: break (since higher d will have even larger sum_min)\n\n   else:\n\n      compute the upper bound for k as upper = int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2\n\n      perform binary search on k between 2 and upper:\n\n         for mid = (low + high)//2:\n\n             compute the sum for mid and d.\n\n             if sum ==n: return YES\n\n             elif sum <n: need to increase k → low = mid +1\n\n             else: high = mid -1\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and d?\n\nImplementing the sum as (k^d -1)//(k-1) ?\n\nYes, but for k=1, this is undefined, but since k ≥2, that's okay.\n\nBut when k is large, k^d can be very big. However, since n is up to 1e18, for d=60, k^d can be up to (1e18)^(1/(d-1)) )^d. For example, for d=3, k can be up to sqrt(n), so k^3 can be up to n^(3/2) which for n=1e18 is 1e27, which is manageable in Python.\n\nBut when computing k^d, we need to be careful with overflow. However, since Python supports arbitrary precision integers, this is not a problem.\n\nBut during the calculation of the sum, if the computed value exceeds n, we can break early. For example, when accumulating the sum term by term (like 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}), once the accumulated sum exceeds n, we can stop and return that the sum is larger than n.\n\nThis is important because for some cases, when calculating (k^d -1)//(k-1), it might be that the actual sum exceeds n, but due to integer division, but perhaps not. Alternatively, we can compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow.\n\nLet me think. For example, when calculating the sum for a given k and d:\n\nsum = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{d-1}\n\nWe can compute this as follows:\n\ncurrent_sum = 0\n\nterm = 1\n\nfor i in 0 to d-1:\n\n   current_sum += term\n\n   term *=k\n\n   if current_sum >n:\n\n       break\n\nreturn current_sum\n\nBut this is O(d) per check. For d up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula (k^d -1) // (k-1) can be done, but we need to be cautious about possible integer division errors. However, since k >=2 and d >=3, the formula is valid.\n\nBut perhaps using the formula is faster. However, for cases where k is large and d is also large, the exponentiation may take longer. However, given that d is small (up to 60), this is manageable.\n\nSo, for the binary search step, for a given k and d, compute the sum via the formula (k^d -1) // (k-1), and check if it equals n.\n\nBut there's a possibility of integer overflow in other languages, but in Python, it's not an issue.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn = input value.\n\nif n ==1: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for d in 3 to 60:\n\n      compute the minimal sum for d, which is when k=2: sum_min = 2^d -1.\n\n      if sum_min >n: break (since higher d will have higher sum_min)\n\n      else:\n\n         compute the upper bound for k as upper = int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2\n\n         perform binary search between low=2 and high=upper.\n\n         during binary search:\n\n             mid = (low + high) //2\n\n             compute sum for mid and d.\n\n             if sum ==n: return YES\n\n             elif sum <n: need to increase k → low = mid +1\n\n             else: high = mid -1\n\n   after checking all d, if no solution found, output NO.\n\nBut how to handle the case where for a certain d, the sum can be achieved with k=2? For example, for d=3 and k=2, sum is 7. So for n=7, it's YES.\n\nBut what about when d is larger than the maximum possible? For example, for n=7, d can be 3, but for d=4, the minimal sum is 2^4 -1 =15, which is larger than 7, so the loop breaks.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case n=13:\n\nCheck for d=3:\n\nsum_min for d=3 is 2^3-1=7 ≤13.\n\nupper bound for k is 13^(1/(3-1)) = sqrt(13) ~3.6 → upper=3+2=5.\n\nbinary search between 2 and 5.\n\nCheck for mid=3: sum is (3^3 -1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 = 13. So yes. So returns YES.\n\nHence, sample input n=13 is YES.\n\nAnother sample input: n=6. Output is NO.\n\nCheck for d=3:\n\nsum_min is 7>6. So loop breaks. So no solution.\n\nAnother sample input: n=255. Output is YES. Let's see. For example, for d=3, k=?\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² =255 → k² +k +1 =255 →k² +k -254=0. Discriminant 1 + 4*254 = 1017. sqrt(1017) is about 31.9. So k=( -1 +31.9)/2 ≈15.45. Not integer. So check for d=4.\n\nFor d=4, sum is (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =255. Try k=4: 64 + 16 +4 +1 = 85. k=5: 125+25+5+1= 156. k=6: 216+36+6+1=259. Close. 259 is larger than 255. So no solution here. How about d=8? For example, k=2, d=8: sum is 2^8 -1 = 255. Oh right! Because (2^8 -1)/(2-1) =255. So d=8, k=2. So yes. So the code would find this.\n\nSo for d=8, sum_min is 2^8 -1=255. So for n=255, when d=8, sum_min is exactly 255. So the code will check for d=8. The upper bound for k is 255^(1/(8-1)) = 255^(1/7). Let's compute that. 2^7 is 128, 3^7 is 2187. So 255^(1/7) is between 2 and 3. So upper is 2 +2=4. Binary search between 2 and 4. For mid=2, the sum is (2^8 -1)/1=255, which matches. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=15. Output is YES. Let's see. For example, d=3, k=3: sum is 1+3+9=13. No. d=3, k=4: 1+4+16=21. No. For d=4, k=2: sum is 1+2+4+8=15. Yes. So for d=4, which is ≥3. So the code would find this.\n\nSo the code needs to check for d=4. For d=4, sum_min is 2^4-1=15. So for n=15, it would check d=4. The upper bound for k is 15^(1/(4-1)) = cube root of 15 ~2.466. So upper is 2+2=4. Binary search between 2 and 4. For mid=2, the sum is (2^4 -1)/(2-1) =15, which matches. So returns YES.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase n=7: YES (k=2, d=3).\n\nCase n=15: YES (k=2, d=4).\n\nCase n=31: YES (k=2, d=5, sum is 31).\n\nCase n=2: NO. Because the minimal is 7.\n\nWhat about n=3? Also NO.\n\nAnother case: n=21. For d=3, k=4: 1+4+16=21. So YES.\n\nNow, what about numbers that can be expressed in multiple ways. For example, n=31 can be achieved with k=2, d=5 (sum is 1+2+4+8+16=31) or with k=5, d=3 (1+5+25=31). So the code would find either way.\n\nNow, the code needs to check for all possible d and k. So the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe need to loop through each test case. For each n, check for d from 3 up to max_d.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible d? For example, for n=1e18, the maximum d is such that 2^d -1 <=1e18. Let's compute log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60 (since 2^60 is 1.15e18). So for d up to 60.\n\nSo in code, for each n, iterate d from 3 to 60:\n\nBut for some n, even for d=3, the sum_min (2^3 -1=7) is larger than n. For example, n=6. So in that case, the loop would break early.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n ==1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    flag = False\n\n    for d in range(3, 61):\n\n        # compute sum_min for k=2\n\n        sum_min = 2**d -1\n\n        if sum_min >n:\n\n            break\n\n        # else, compute upper bound for k\n\n        # upper = int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2\n\n        # but how to compute this in Python?\n\n        # for example, for d=3, exponent is 1/(d-1) = 1/2 → sqrt(n)\n\n        # but for large exponents, we can use n ** (1.0/(d-1))\n\n        # but for exponents, we can use pow(n, 1.0/(d-1)).\n\n        # However, for integers, we can compute this as the integer part.\n\n        # But in code:\n\n        # upper = int(n ** (1/(d-1))) + 2\n\n        # However, in Python, for exponents, we have to be careful with floating point precision.\n\n        # For example, for n=255, d=8, d-1=7 → 255^(1/7) is approx 2. So upper is 2+2=4.\n\n        # So for the binary search, we can set low=2, high= upper.\n\n        # However, sometimes, the upper bound may be too low. So perhaps adding 2 is sufficient.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can set high to something like n, but that would be inefficient.\n\n        # So let's proceed.\n\n        # compute upper:\n\n        # but for cases where d-1 is 0?

For d=3, upper is 7^(1/2) ~2.64 → int(2.64) is 2, plus 2 → 4. So binary search between 2 and 4. For mid=2, the sum is 1 +2 +4 =7. So returns YES.\n\nAnother example: n=15. For d=4, sum_min is 15. So upper is 15^(1/(4-1)) = cube root of 15 ~2.466 → int is 2, +2 →4. binary search between 2 and 4. mid=2: sum is 1+2+4+8=15. So returns YES.\n\nBut what about when the upper bound is not enough? For example, if the actual k is larger than the upper bound computed. For example, suppose n= (k^d -1)/(k-1) where k is larger than the upper bound. How can that happen?\n\nThe upper bound is computed as n^(1/(d-1)) + 2. Because the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} (since all terms are positive). So for the sum to be equal to n, we must have k^{d-1} ≤n →k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}. Thus, the upper bound is correct. So adding 2 is just to account for possible rounding errors in the calculation of the exponent.\n\nBut",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem's construction rules. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single vertex and adding layers of vertices such that each vertex in the previous layer connects to $ k $ new vertices. The challenge is to check if there exists any valid $ k > 1 $ and a sufficient number of layers such that the total number of vertices equals $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph is a tree where each node (except leaves) has exactly $ k $ children. The number of vertices in such a graph with $ d $ layers (depth) is given by the geometric series sum $ S = 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^{d-1} $, which simplifies to $ S = \\frac{k^d - 1}{k - 1} $.\n\n2. **Constraints**: For the snowflake to be valid, $ d $ must be at least 3 (since we need at least two layers after the initial one). We need to check for all possible values of $ d $ starting from 3 up to a reasonable maximum (determined by the exponential growth of the series).\n\n3. **Binary Search for Valid $ k $**: For each valid $ d $, perform a binary search on possible values of $ k $ to check if the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $. This is efficient because the number of possible $ d $ values is logarithmic in $ n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_snowflake_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_d = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for d in range(3, max_d + 1):\n        # Calculate minimal sum for k=2\n        sum_min = (2**d) - 1\n        if sum_min > n:\n            break\n        # Compute upper bound for k\n        exponent = 1.0 / (d - 1)\n        upper = int(n ** exponent) + 2\n        low = 2\n        high = upper\n        found = False\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            sum_val = 0\n            current_term = 1\n            for _ in range(d):\n                sum_val += current_term\n                if sum_val > n:\n                    break\n                current_term *= mid\n            if sum_val == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif sum_val < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_snowflake_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Checking Each Case**: For each test case, we check if the number of vertices $ n $ can be represented as a valid snowflake graph.\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Depths**: For each depth $ d $ starting from 3 up to a maximum of 60, we calculate the minimum possible sum for $ k = 2 $.\n4. **Binary Search for $ k $**: For each depth $ d $, we use binary search to find a valid $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $. The binary search ensures we efficiently check feasible values of $ k $ without exceeding computational limits.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the snowflake graph structure, ensuring correctness and performance even for very large values of $ n $ up to $ 10^{18} $.",
