The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake is built in a certain way, and we need to check if such a graph can have exactly n vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the snowflake. Let me re-read the description.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so those leaves) are connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So, the process is like building layers. \n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's model the construction steps.\n\nLet me consider the example given for k=4. The smallest snowflake would be:\n\nStart with 1 node. Then connect to 4 nodes. Now, each of those 4 is a leaf. Then, each of them must be connected to k new nodes. So after that step, each of the original 4 has 4 new nodes. So total nodes would be 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 +4 +16 = 21? But the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait the sample input includes n=13 as a YES. So let's think about that. How can 13 be achieved?\n\nLet me think of the possible steps. Let's think of the construction steps as layers. Let me think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake construction as follows:\n\nThe initial step is level 0: 1 node.\n\nThen, level 1: add k nodes connected to the root. Now, the total nodes is 1 + k.\n\nThen, each of those level 1 nodes has to be connected to k new nodes. So level 2 adds k * k nodes. Total nodes now is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut according to the problem statement, this step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal case would be when we have two levels: level 0 (root), level 1 (k nodes), level 2 (k² nodes). So total is 1 +k +k². But maybe there are more steps. For example, after adding level 2, perhaps we can add another level. But the problem says that the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first level) is required, and then adding the second level (each of the leaves from the first level) is required once. But maybe there can be more steps. For example, after adding level 2, perhaps we can add level 3 by connecting each of the leaves of level 2 to k new nodes. But how does that affect the total number of nodes?\n\nSo the snowflake can be constructed with m levels, where m ≥ 2. Because the initial step (adding the first level) is required, then adding the second level (the first step of adding to leaves) must be done once. So the minimum is 2 steps of adding.\n\nWait, the initial step is adding the first level (the root's children). Then, the step of adding new nodes to leaves (the first level nodes) must be done at least once. So the minimal structure is root (level 0), level 1 (k nodes), level 2 (k² nodes). So total nodes is 1 + k + k². But maybe there are more levels. For example, after level 2, you can add level 3, which adds k³ nodes. Then total nodes is 1 + k + k² + k³. But then, the process of adding to leaves must have been done at least once. So the process of adding to leaves can be done multiple times. So the snowflake can have any number of levels ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but how? Because after level 2, the leaves are the nodes in level 2. Each of them has only one connection (to their parent). So adding level 3 would involve adding k new nodes per leaf in level 2. So the total number of nodes would be 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first level) is required, and then adding the second level (the first time adding to leaves) is required. But after that, you can add more steps (like level 3, etc.) as many times as you want.\n\nTherefore, the total number of nodes in the snowflake is equal to the sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 2. Wait, no. Wait, because the initial step is adding the first level (k nodes). Then, the step of adding to leaves (the first level) is done once, adding k^2 nodes. Then, adding to leaves again (the level 2 nodes) would add k^3 nodes. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of levels minus one. But m must be at least 2. Because the initial step is level 1 (adding k nodes), and then the first addition is level 2 (adding k^2 nodes). So m is the number of levels. Wait, maybe it's better to model it as:\n\nThe snowflake is constructed with m layers. The first layer (layer 1) is the root's children. Then, each subsequent layer is added by expanding each leaf of the previous layer. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1. Wait, but the problem says that the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes), which is the first expansion. Then, the second expansion (adding to leaves) must be done once. So the minimal is adding two layers. So the total nodes would be 1 +k +k². So for m ≥ 2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Or wait, maybe the sum is 1 +k*(k^m -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, the sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. Which equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) - (k^{m} -1)/(k-1) ? No, wait, the sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So in our case, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. Which is equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But according to the problem's construction, the snowflake must have at least two steps. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nStart with 1 node.\n\nStep 1: add k nodes connected to root. Now, total nodes is 1 + k.\n\nThen, step 2: each of the k nodes (which are leaves) get k new nodes. So adding k *k nodes. Now total is 1 +k +k².\n\nThen, step 3: each of the k² nodes (leaves) get k new nodes. Adding k^3 nodes. Total becomes 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo for the snowflake, the number of nodes can be written as S = 1 + k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Because step 2 must be done once. So the minimal m is 2 (so S is 1 +k +k²).\n\nBut then, for example, when n=13, the sample says it's possible. Let's see:\n\nLooking for k and m such that S = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m =n.\n\nFor example, n=13. Let's try m=2: 1 +k +k² =13 →k² +k -12=0. The solution is k = [-1 ± sqrt(1+48)]/2 → sqrt(49)=7 → ( -1 +7)/2 = 3. So k=3. So yes. So 1+3+9=13. So that's valid. Hence, answer is YES.\n\nAnother example: n=6. The sample output says NO. Let's see. For m=2, 1 +k +k²=6 →k² +k -5=0 → discriminant 1+20=21. sqrt(21) is irrational. So no integer solution. For m=3: 1 +k +k² +k^3 =6. Let's see possible k. Since k>1. Try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15>6. k=1 not allowed. So no solution. Hence, n=6 is impossible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be expressed as S = sum_{i=0}^m (k^i) where m ≥ 2 and k ≥2. Wait, because the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for the snowflake, S must be equal to this sum, and m ≥ 2 (since the step of adding leaves must be done at least once, which corresponds to m being at least 2. For example, m=2 gives sum 1 +k +k^2.)\n\nWait, but m here is the maximum exponent. Let me think again. The sum from i=0 to m is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. So when m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is the case when the construction has two steps (step 1: adding the first level, step 2: adding the second level). So for the snowflake, the sum S must be equal to this for some k ≥2 and m ≥2.\n\nBut how do we check for a given n whether such k and m exist?\n\nThe problem is, given n, check if there exists integers k ≥2 and m ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^m (k^i) = n.\n\nAlternatively, since sum_{i=0}^m (k^i) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for each n, we need to check if there exists k ≥2 and m ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check this.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of possible approaches.\n\nFirst, note that for each possible m ≥2, we can try to find if there's a k such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. Since m can't be too big, because for fixed m, the minimal value of the sum is when k=2. For example, for m=2, the sum is 1+2+4=7. For m=3, it's 1+2+4+8=15. For m=4, 31, etc. So for a given n, the maximum possible m is log_2(n). For example, for n=1e18, log2(n) is around 60. So for each test case, we can iterate m from 2 up to log2(n) (say up to 60), and for each m, check if there's a k ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how do we check for each m whether there's a k?\n\nLet me denote the equation as:\n\nsum_{i=0}^m k^i = n → (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n → k^{m+1} -1 = n (k-1) → k^{m+1} -n k + (n -1) = 0.\n\nThis seems difficult to solve directly. However, for fixed m, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nBecause for fixed m, the function f(k) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing with k. Because as k increases, the sum increases. So for each m, we can binary search on k to see if there's a k where the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think: For each m, starting from 2 up to say 60 (since for m=60, even k=2 would give sum 2^61 -1 over 1, which is 2^61-1 ≈ 2e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum m is about 60.\n\nSo for each test case, for each possible m from 2 up to log2(n), we can perform a binary search on k to see if there's a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how do we compute the sum for a given k and m?\n\nWell, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But calculating this directly could be problematic for large exponents. However, since m is small (up to 60), and k is up to something like n^(1/(m+1)), which for m=2 is sqrt(n), but for m=60, k is 2, since 2^60 is about 1e18.\n\nBut even for m=60, the exponent is manageable with binary search.\n\nBut during binary search, for a given k and m, we need to compute the sum. However, if during computation the sum exceeds n, we can stop early.\n\nAlternatively, for a given k and m, we can compute the sum incrementally. For example, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. Let's compute this as a loop, and if at any point the sum exceeds n, we can break and return that it's too big.\n\nThis approach avoids dealing with very large exponents and potential overflows (though in Python, integers are arbitrary precision).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck if there exists m ≥2 and k ≥2 such that the sum S(m, k) = n.\n\nTo check this, for each possible m (from 2 up to max_m, which is about 60), do the following:\n\n- Find the minimal and maximal possible k for that m.\n\nFor example, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². We need to find if there exists k ≥2 such that 1 +k +k² =n.\n\nWe can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound. What's the upper bound? For fixed m, the sum is at least 1 +2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. So for a given m, the minimal sum is when k=2, and the sum is 2^{m+1} -1. If n is less than that, then for that m, there's no possible k. So for each m, the upper bound for k can be found by considering that for the sum to be equal to n, k must be such that the sum is exactly n. Since for fixed m, the sum increases with k, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper limit. What's the upper limit? Well, the sum for k is 1 +k + ... +k^m. For k >=2, the sum is at least 1 +k + ... +k^m >= 1 +k. So for the sum to be n, k can't be larger than n. But that's a very loose upper bound. However, since m is small, we can compute the upper bound as follows: for the sum S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n → k^{m+1} ≈ n*(k-1) → but for k ≥2, this is roughly k^{m+1} ~ n*k → k^m ~n → k ~ n^(1/m). So for binary search, we can set the upper bound as n^(1/m) +1, but since in code, we can use binary search between low=2 and high= something like 2e5 (but for m=2, n can be up to 1e18, so k can be up to sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. So binary search for each m would take O(log n) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for each m, we can perform a binary search for k. Let's outline the steps for a given m:\n\nCompute the sum for k=2. If sum is larger than n, then no solution for this m. Else, perform binary search between low=2 and high=some upper limit (could be n, but perhaps better to compute the upper limit based on the sum). Alternatively, during binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and check if it's equal to n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and m? Let's think. For example, m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. For m=3, 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So for a given k and m, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to m:\n\n    total += current_term\n\n    current_term *=k \n\nBut this would be O(m) per check. For m up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nBut for large k and m, this may cause the total to overflow. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem. Also, during the calculation, if the total exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's too big.\n\nSo for each m, the steps are:\n\nCheck if the minimal sum for k=2 is <=n. For example, for m, the minimal sum is S_min = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... +2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. If S_min >n, then no solution for this m. Else, perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (say, up to n, but in practice, we can find a better upper bound).\n\nBut what's the upper bound for k? Well, for a given m, the sum S(k, m) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). For k ≥2, this sum is increasing with k. So for a given m, the maximum possible k that could satisfy S(k, m) ≤n is such that k^m ≤n. Because for k ≥2, the sum is at least 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m ≥k^m. So k^m ≤n → k ≤n^(1/m). Therefore, the upper bound for k can be set as n^(1/m) +1. However, computing n^(1/m) can be done using binary search or via math.pow, but since m is small, perhaps we can use binary search for k between 2 and something like 2e5 (but for m=2 and n=1e18, the upper bound is sqrt(1e18) = 1e9, which is a lot for binary search steps. However, given that m is up to 60, and for each test case, the number of m's is about 60, and for each m, the binary search steps are about 30, this is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each m, we can perform a binary search between low=2 and high= some value, say, 2e5, but for larger values, we need to adjust. However, perhaps the best way is to perform the binary search for k between 2 and n, but with early termination when the sum exceeds n.\n\nBut for large m, the upper bound for k is small. For example, m=60, then even k=2 would give sum (2^61 -1)/(2-1) = 2^61 -1 which is about 2e18. For n up to 1e18, this is larger than n. So for m=60, the possible k is 2 only. So for m=60, we can check if the sum for k=2 is equal to n.\n\nSo perhaps, for each m, the binary search can be done with low=2 and high=2, but that's not correct. Wait, for m=2, the upper bound for k could be up to sqrt(n), but for m=60, the upper bound is 2. So perhaps for each m, we can compute the upper bound as follows: the maximum k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^m ≤n. Since the sum is increasing with k, for a given m, the maximum possible k is such that k^m ≤n. So k_max = floor(n^(1/m)).\n\nBut how to compute this? Well, in Python, we can use the pow function with exponents, but since m can be up to 60, and n up to 1e18, n^(1/m) can be calculated as int(n ** (1/m)) + 2, perhaps.\n\nBut even better, during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and check if it's equal to n.\n\nSo here's the plan for each m:\n\nLoop for m from 2 to max_m (say, 60):\n\n   Compute the minimal sum for k=2. If this is greater than n, skip this m.\n\n   Else, perform binary search on k between low=2 and high= upper_bound (like 2e5, but perhaps better to calculate based on n and m).\n\n   For each candidate k during binary search:\n\n      compute the sum S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\n      if S ==n: return YES.\n\n      elif S <n: need to increase k.\n\n      else: decrease k.\n\nBut how to compute S? Let's implement a helper function that, given k and m, computes the sum and returns whether it equals n, or is less than, or greater than.\n\nBut during the calculation, if the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(m+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return 1  # sum exceeds n\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return 0 if total ==n else -1  # 0 means equal, -1 means less than\n\nWait, but for m steps, the loop runs m+1 times (from 0 to m exponents). So for example, m=2, the loop runs 3 times (exponents 0, 1, 2). So the code is correct.\n\nBut for each m, the binary search would be:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = ?\n\nInitially, high can be 2. But for example, for m=2 and n=13, the correct k is 3. So the high needs to be at least 3. So how to find the upper bound for high?\n\nWell, during the binary search, we can start with high=2, and double it until compute_sum(high, m, n) returns 1 (sum exceeds n). Then, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nAlternatively, since for the sum S(k, m) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ≥k^m. So k^m ≤n →k ≤n^(1/m). So high can be set to n^(1/m) + 1. But how to compute n^(1/m)?\n\nIn Python, we can use something like int(n ** (1.0/m)) + 2. But for large exponents, this may not be precise due to floating-point errors. So perhaps, for each m, we can compute the upper bound as follows: start with high=2, and while compute_sum(high, m, n) is -1 (sum <n), multiply high by 2. Once compute_sum(high, m, n) is 1 (sum exceeds n), then we can binary search between low=2 and high.\n\nThis approach ensures that the upper bound is found correctly.\n\nSo the steps for each m:\n\n   Check if the minimal sum (for k=2) is greater than n. If so, skip.\n\n   Else:\n\n      Find upper bound for k by doubling until compute_sum(high, m, n) is 1.\n\n      Perform binary search between low=2 and high.\n\n      For each mid in binary search, compute the sum and compare to n.\n\n      If any mid gives sum ==n, return YES.\n\nOnce all m's are checked, if none found, return NO.\n\nNow, what about the case when m is variable? For example, for n=13, m=2 and k=3. For n=15, the sample says YES. Let's see: 1 +k +k^2 + ... ?\n\nFor example, m=2 and k=3: sum is 1+3+9=13. For m=3 and k=2: sum is 1+2+4+8=15. So yes.\n\nSo the code needs to check all possible m's.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the maximum m we need to check?\n\nThe maximum m is such that the minimal sum for that m is <=n. For example, for m, the minimal sum is when k=2: sum is 2^{m+1} -1. So for this sum to be <=n, we have 2^{m+1} -1 <=n → m+1 <= log2(n+1) → m <= log2(n+1) -1. So for n up to 1e18, log2(n) is about 60, so m can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate m from 2 up to 60 (or until 2^{m+1} -1 >n).\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   if n ==1: output NO (since the minimal snowflake requires at least 1 +k +k^2, which for k=2 is 7. But the sample input includes n=1, which outputs NO.)\n\n   else:\n\n      for m in 2 to 60:\n\n         compute the minimal sum for k=2, which is 2^{m+1} -1. If this is >n, break (since higher m will have even larger minimal sums).\n\n         else:\n\n             perform the binary search for k as discussed.\n\n             if any k is found, return YES.\n\n      if no m found, return NO.\n\nBut also, there's another possibility: when the sum is for m=1. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. Which implies that m must be at least 2. Because m=1 would correspond to sum 1 +k, which is the case where the initial step (adding k nodes) is done, but the step of adding to leaves is not done. Hence, m must be at least 2.\n\nBut what about cases where the sum is 1 +k? For example, n=3. Then, 1 +k =3 →k=2. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once. So that case is invalid. Hence, for n=3, the answer is NO. Which matches the sample input (third test case is 3, output is NO).\n\nSo the code needs to check for m≥2.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase n=1: no, since the snowflake must have at least 1 +k +k^2. For k=2 and m=2, sum is 7. So n=1 is impossible.\n\nCase n=7: 1+2+4=7. So m=2, k=2. So answer is YES. But according to the sample input, for n=2, output is NO. Let's check:\n\nSample input includes 2, output is NO. Because for m=2, the minimal sum is 7. So n=2 is less than that. For m=1, sum is 1 +k. For k=1, but k must be >1. So no solution. Hence, answer is NO.\n\nAnother case: n=7 → YES.\n\nAnother case: n=15. As discussed, for m=3, k=2: sum is 1+2+4+8=15 → YES.\n\nNow, let's think about how to handle the binary search for each m.\n\nImplementing the helper function compute_sum(k, m, n) as discussed.\n\nBut for very large exponents, even for m=60 and k=2, the sum would be 2^61 -1, which is 2,305,843,009,213,693,951. Which is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 59, since 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 which is about 1e18. So for m=59, the minimal sum is 2^60 -1, which is about 1e18.\n\nSo the code can loop m from 2 up to 60.\n\nNow, let's proceed to code.\n\nBut first, handling the case when n is 1, 2, 3, etc.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\n   if n < 7 → output NO (since minimal sum is 7 for m=2, k=2).\n\n   else:\n\n      check for all m from 2 to 60:\n\n         compute the minimal sum for m (k=2): s_min = 2^{m+1} -1.\n\n         if s_min >n: break (since higher m will have higher s_min).\n\n         else:\n\n             perform binary search for k in this m.\n\n             if found, return YES.\n\n      if no m found, return NO.\n\nBut wait, for example, for m=2, the minimal sum is 7 (when k=2). For n=7, it's valid. But for n=1+2+2^2 =7. So code should return YES.\n\nBut for n=7, the code will check m=2, and find that for k=2, sum is 7.\n\nBut how to compute s_min? For m, the minimal sum is 2^{m+1} -1.\n\nBut for m=2, 2^3 -1=7.\n\nYes.\n\nBut how to compute this in code?\n\nIn Python, for m, we can compute s_min as (2 ** (m+1)) -1. However, for m up to 60, 2^61 is manageable.\n\nBut for m=60, 2^61 is 2,305,843,009,213,693,952. Which is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, when m is 59, 2^60 is 1,152,921,504,606,846,976, which is about 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, m can be up to 59.\n\nBut in code, we can loop m from 2 to 60, and for each m, compute s_min = (2 ** (m+1)) -1. If s_min >n, then break the loop, since higher m will have higher s_min.\n\nBut for m=2 to 60, even for n=1e18, the loop will check m up to 59.\n\nNow, the code for each m:\n\nOnce we have m, and s_min <=n, then perform binary search for k.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k?\n\nAs discussed earlier, we can start with low=2, and high=2, then keep doubling high until compute_sum(high, m, n) returns 1 (sum exceeds n). Once that's done, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nSo for example, for m=2, n=13, initial high=2. compute_sum(2, 2, 13) is 1+2+4=7 <13. So we double high to 4. compute_sum(4, 2, 13) is 1+4+16=21>13. So binary search between 2 and 4.\n\nNow, during binary search, mid=(2+4)//2=3. compute_sum(3, 2, 13) is 1+3+9=13 → yes. So return YES.\n\nSo the code for the binary search part:\n\ndef check_for_m(m, n):\n\n    # Check if there exists k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i =n.\n\n    # compute minimal sum for k=2\n\n    s_min = (2 ** (m+1)) -1\n\n    if s_min >n:\n\n        return False\n\n    # find upper bound for k.\n\n    low =2\n\n    high =2\n\n    while True:\n\n        res = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n\n        if res ==1: # sum exceeds n\n\n            break\n\n        elif res ==-1: # sum <n\n\n            high *=2\n\n        else: # res ==0, which is sum ==n. So return True.\n\n            return True\n\n    # Now binary search between low and high.\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        res = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n\n        if res ==0:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif res ==-1:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut the compute_sum function needs to be implemented.\n\nImplementing compute_sum(k, m, n):\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n\n    total =0\n\n    current =1\n\n    for _ in range(m+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total >n:\n\n            return 1\n\n        current *=k\n\n    if total ==n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1\n\nBut for m up to 60, and k up to something like 1e9, this loop is acceptable.\n\nNow, putting this into code.\n\nBut in Python, for very large exponents, even for k=2 and m=60, the loop runs 61 times. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1 → NO\n\n2 → NO\n\n3 → NO\n\n6 → NO\n\n13 → YES (m=2, k=3)\n\n15 → YES (m=3, k=2)\n\n255 → YES ?\n\nLet's see for 255. Let's think:\n\nPossible options.\n\nFor m=2:\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² =255 →k² +k -254=0. Discriminant is 1 + 4*254 = 1 + 1016=1017. sqrt(1017) is ~31.89. So k is (-1 +31.89)/2 ≈ 15.44. Not integer. So no solution here.\n\nFor m=3: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ =255. Let's try k=5: 1+5+25+125= 156. k=6: 1+6+36+216= 259. Close. 259 is larger than 255. So no solution here.\n\nFor m=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k³ +k^4 =255.\n\nTry k=3: 1+3+9+27+81 = 121. k=4: 1+4+16+64+256= 341>255. So no.\n\nFor m=7: sum is 1 +k + ... +k^7. For k=2: sum is 2^8 -1 =255. Yes! Because sum for m=7 is (2^8 -1)/(2-1) =255. So m=7, k=2. So yes. Hence, 255 is YES.\n\nSo sample output for 255 is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 10101 → YES.\n\nSo the code would find for m= some value and k.\n\nAnother sample is 1e18 → output is NO. Let's see why. For example, for m=59, the minimal sum is 2^60 -1 = 1,152,9",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed based on specific rules. The snowflake graph is built in layers, starting from a single vertex and expanding outward in a structured manner.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers. Each layer adds `k` new vertices to every leaf node from the previous layer. The number of vertices in such a graph can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: $ S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m $, where `m` is the number of layers minus one and `k` is the number of new vertices added per leaf node.\n\n2. **Constraints Check**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists integers `k > 1` and `m ≥ 2` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: For each possible number of layers `m` (from 2 up to 60, as higher values would exceed the maximum possible `n`), we perform a binary search on `k` to check if the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return 1\n        current *= k\n    if total == n:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return -1\n\ndef check_for_m(m, n):\n    s_min = (2 ** (m + 1)) - 1\n    if s_min > n:\n        return False\n    low = 2\n    high = 2\n    # Find upper bound\n    while True:\n        res = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n        if res == 0:\n            return True\n        elif res == 1:\n            break\n        else:\n            high *= 2\n    # Binary search between low and high\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        res = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n        if res == 0:\n            return True\n        elif res == -1:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if n < 7:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        for m in range(2, 61):\n            if (2 ** (m + 1)) - 1 > n:\n                break\n            if check_for_m(m, n):\n                found = True\n                break\n        print(\"YES\" if found else \"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible number of layers `m` (from 2 to 60), we check if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n3. **Binary Search for `k`**: For each `m`, we use binary search to efficiently determine if there exists a valid `k` that results in the required number of vertices.\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Directly handle cases where `n` is too small to form a valid snowflake graph, ensuring quick rejection of invalid inputs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations of the snowflake graph within the problem constraints, leveraging geometric series properties and binary search for optimal performance.",
