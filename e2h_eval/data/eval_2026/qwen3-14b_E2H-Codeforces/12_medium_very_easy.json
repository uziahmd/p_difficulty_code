The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. Let's say she's currently at position current_pos. For each task in order, she needs to move from current_pos to a_i. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the time between current_pos and a_i depends on their positions.\n\nWait, for example, if current_pos is 3 and the next task is at 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But if the next task is at 3, then no movement needed. If the next task is at 4, then 1 step.\n\nSo the time between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because if current_pos is 3 and a_i is 2, then (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. But if current_pos is 3 and a_i is 4, then (4-3) mod 4 is 1. Correct. So the formula would be (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Which can be written as (a_i - current_pos) % n, but wait, because if a_i is less than current_pos, then (a_i - current_pos) is negative. But modulo n would give the correct positive value.\n\nWait, for example, current_pos is 3, a_i is 2. (2-3) is -1. Mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the time between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, no. Because if current_pos is 1 and a_i is 3, then (3-1) is 2, which is correct. So yes, the time is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Which is equivalent to (a_i - current_pos) % n. But since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the movement is along the ringroad, which is clockwise. So, for example, moving from 1 to 3 in a 4-house setup would take 2 steps (1→2→3). If she's moving from 3 to 1, then she has to go 3→4→1, which is 2 steps. So the time between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Which is the same as (a_i - current_pos + n) % n. But since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct calculation.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1 (starting point). Then, for each task in the list a_1 to a_m, compute the time needed to get from current_pos to a_i, add that to the total time, then update current_pos to a_i.\n\nWait, but the tasks are given in order. For example, the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So Xenia must do them in order. So for each task in the list, we have to compute the time from the previous position to this task's position, then accumulate that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Read n and m.\n\n- Read the list of a's (m elements).\n\n- Initialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\n- For each a_i in the list:\n\n   - compute the distance from current_pos to a_i (clockwise), which is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos else (a_i - current_pos + n). Or (a_i - current_pos) % n, but since the movement is clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\n   - add that distance to total_time.\n\n   - set current_pos to a_i.\n\n- Output total_time.\n\nWait, but let's check the example.\n\nFirst example input: 4 3, and the a's are 3, 2, 3.\n\nLet's walk through it.\n\nInitial current_pos = 1.\n\nFirst task is 3.\n\ndistance from 1 to 3 is 2 (1→2→3). So total_time += 2. Now current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. So distance from 3 to 2 is (2 -3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. So add 3. Total is 5. Now current_pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3 is 1. Add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that works.\n\nAnother sample input: 4 3, a's are 2,3,3.\n\nInitial current_pos is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: distance is 1 (1→2). total is 1. current_pos is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: distance is 1 (2→3). total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: distance is 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the second example.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nIn Python, read n and m from input. Then read the list of a's. Then loop through each a_i, compute the distance, accumulate.\n\nBut note that the list may have multiple consecutive same elements. Like in the second example, the third task is same as previous. So the code should handle that.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list of m integers.\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each a in the list:\n\n   delta = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += delta\n\n   current_pos = a\n\nThen print total_time.\n\nWait, but why does (a - current_pos) % n work?\n\nBecause when a is greater than current_pos, (a - current_pos) is positive. For example, current_pos is 1, a is 3, n=4: (3-1) = 2 mod 4 is 2. Correct.\n\nIf a is less than current_pos, like current_pos is 3, a is 2: (2-3) is -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nBut let's test the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2. total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond a is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod4 is 3. total is 5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]. The code gives:\n\ncurrent_pos=1.\n\nFirst a=2: (2-1) mod4=1. total=1. current_pos=2.\n\nSecond a=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total=2. current_pos=3.\n\nThird a=3: (3-3) mod4=0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about when the list is empty? Well, according to input constraints, m is at least 1. Because the input says m is between 1 and 1e5. So no problem.\n\nWhat about when a_i is 1? For example, if current_pos is 1, then delta is 0. So no time added.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then time is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Time is (1-1) mod2=0, then (2-1) mod2=1. Total 1. Which is correct: start at 1, move to 2 (1 step).\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nRead input: first line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as two separate cases. Wait, but the user provided two examples. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as two lines. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would produce output 6. The second example is:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nWhich outputs 2.\n\nSo the code must read from standard input. So in Python, the code can read via input().split().\n\nBut for cases where the input is given as multiple lines, perhaps via reading from stdin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m from first line.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have multiple lines, but for the problem, the second line is m integers.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += delta\n\n    current_pos = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operation with negative numbers returns a positive result. For example, (-1) %4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nThe code processes 3, 2, 3. As discussed, total is 6.\n\nAnother test case: input 4 3, 2 3 3. The code returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. The code returns 0 + 1 =1.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when the a list has elements that are same as previous. For example, n=5, m=3, a=[3,3,3]. Then the time is (3-1) mod5=2, then 0, then 0. Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, check the constraints. n and m can be up to 1e5. So the code is O(m), which is acceptable.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to complete tasks in the given order. Each task is located at a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes one unit of time.\n2. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving from one house to another in a clockwise direction can be calculated using modular arithmetic. Specifically, the time to move from the current house to the target house is given by `(target_house - current_house) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in the sequence, compute the time required to move from the current position to the task's house, accumulate this time, and update the current position to the task's house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current_pos = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for num in a:\n        delta = (num - current_pos) % n\n        total_time += delta\n        current_pos = num\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially given the potentially large input size.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the task's house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n- **Accumulate Time**: Add the computed time for each move to the total time and update the current position to the task's house.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle circular movements, resulting in an optimal O(m) time complexity where m is the number of tasks.",
