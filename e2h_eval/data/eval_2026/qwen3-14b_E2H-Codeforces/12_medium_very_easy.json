The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. Let's say she's currently at position current_pos. For each task in order, she needs to move from current_pos to a_i. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the time between current_pos and a_i depends on their positions.\n\nWait, for example, if current_pos is 3 and the next a_i is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But if the next a_i is 3, then no steps needed. If it's 4, then 1 step.\n\nSo the distance between current_pos and target is (target - current_pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because if target is larger than current_pos, then moving clockwise would be target - current_pos steps. But if target is smaller, then it's (n - current_pos + target) steps. So the total steps between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). But wait, that's equivalent to (target - current) % n? No, because if target is less than current, then (target - current) is negative, but mod n would give the correct positive value. For example, if current is 3, target is 2, n=4. (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3, which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and target is (target - current) mod n. But since we are moving clockwise, that's the correct way to compute steps.\n\nBut wait, when current is 3 and target is 2, the steps are 3 →4 →1 →2: 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) = 3. So yes, (target - current + n) % n gives the correct steps. So for each step from current to target, the time is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Or equivalently (target - current) % n, but since in Python modulo can return negative values, maybe better to compute as (target - current + n) % n. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, target=2, current=3, n=4: (2-3) is -1. Adding n (4) gives 3, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the formula (target - current) % n would work here. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, (-1) % 4 is 3. So yes, (target - current) % n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nSo for each task, we need to compute the steps from the current position to the target, add that to the total, and then update the current position to the target.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if the tasks are [3,3], then moving from 3 to 3 takes zero steps. So the code should handle that.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1 (since she starts at house 1).\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   compute the distance from current_pos to a_i, add to total_time.\n\n   set current_pos to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the tasks must be done in order. So for example, the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So the code needs to process the list in order.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nInitial current_pos = 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Add 2 to total. Now current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance from 3 to 2 is (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod4 = 3 steps. So add 3. Total is 5. Now current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3 is 1 step. Add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So that's how the calculation works.\n\nSo the code needs to process each a_i in order, and accumulate the steps between current position and the next a_i.\n\nNow, the problem is to read n and m, then the list of a_i's, then compute the total time as described.\n\nNow, let's think about the input. The input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m. The second line has m integers. So for example, the first sample input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich gives output 6.\n\nAnother sample input is 4 3 with 2 3 3, output is 2.\n\nLet's check that. Let's see:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2. distance from 1 to 2 is 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3. distance 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3. distance 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nWe need to read n and m, then the list of a's.\n\nThen, initialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nLoop through each a in the list:\n\n   compute delta = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += delta\n\n   current_pos = a\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nWait, but what about when the list is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because in the input description, m is given as 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of m integers.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor each ai in the list:\n\n    delta = (ai - current) % n\n\n    time += delta\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(time)\n\nWait, but let's test the first sample:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2 → time is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod4 = 3 → time is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1 → time 6. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: 4 3, [2,3,3]. \n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1 → time 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1 → time 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3) mod4 = 0 → time remains 2. Correct.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nWhat about when the list has multiple same elements?\n\nLike n=5, m=2, a = [1,1]. Then the time is (1-1) mod5 =0, then (1-1) mod5=0. Total 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. So initial current is 1.\n\nFirst step: 2-1 mod2 is 1 → time 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond step: 1-2 mod2 is -1 mod2 =1. So total is 2. Which is correct: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this logic seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is read from stdin. So the code needs to read two lines. The first line is n and m. The second line is m integers.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading inputs, there may be leading or trailing spaces, but in Python, splitting on whitespace is handled by split().\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait, in the first sample input, the first line is '4 3' and the second line is '3 2 3'.\n\nYes, which would be read correctly.\n\nBut what if the second line has more or less than m numbers? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nThis code should work.\n\nLet me check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]. The code gives 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]. The code gives 1+1+0=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The code gives (2-1) mod2 =1 → total 1, then (1-2) mod2 = 1 → total 2. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=3, a=[1,5,1]. The steps:\n\ncurrent is 1. first a is 1: delta (1-1) mod5=0 → total 0. current is 1.\n\nsecond a is 5: (5-1) mod5 =4 → total 4. current is 5.\n\nthird a is 1: (1-5) mod5 = -4 mod5 = 1 → total 4+1=5. So total time is 5. Which is correct: 1→5 (4 steps), then 5→1 (1 step). So total 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the edge cases?\n\nCase where m=1, a=[1]. Then total is 0.\n\nAnother case where m=1, a=[n]. Then delta is (n-1) mod n → n-1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the Python code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order, moving clockwise between houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving from one house to another clockwise can be calculated using modular arithmetic. The time taken to move from the current house to the target house is determined by the difference in their positions modulo the number of houses.\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the target house of the task. Accumulate these times to get the total time required.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By iterating through each task in sequence and updating the current position after each move, we ensure that we efficiently compute the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        delta = (num - current) % n\n        total += delta\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of house numbers where each task needs to be completed.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with an initial total time of 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. Update the total time and the current position after each move.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
