And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all those sums. The output needs to be precise with at least six decimal digits.\n\nSo, the input gives me n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output is the average of all the sums of consecutive k-day periods.\n\nFirst, let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to compute the sum for each window of size k and then take the average. However, if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach that checks each window by adding up k elements each time would result in O(n*k) time complexity, which would be too slow for large n and k. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 1e5, then each window takes 1e5 operations, leading to 2e10 operations total. That's way beyond acceptable time limits.\n\nSo, we need a more efficient way. The standard approach for such sliding window sum problems is to use a prefix sum array. Let me think about that.\n\nThe prefix sum array allows us to compute the sum of any subarray in O(1) time after O(n) preprocessing. For each window starting at position i (0-based?), the sum would be prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]. Then, we can compute all these sums and take their average.\n\nYes. So, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sums array.\n2. For each possible starting index i (from 0 to n - k), compute the sum of the window starting at i and of length k.\n3. Sum all those window sums and divide by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nBut how to handle the prefix sums? Let's think about the indices. Let's assume the array is 0-based. The prefix sum array can be 1-based for easier calculations. For example, prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = a[0], prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. Then, the sum from index i to j (inclusive) is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].\n\nWait, for a window starting at index i (0-based) and of length k, the last index is i + k - 1. So the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i].\n\nYes. So, for each i in 0 <= i <= n -k, the sum is prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]. Then, we can compute all those sums and add them up.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is the average of all these sums. So, the total sum of all window sums divided by the number of windows.\n\nSo, the total sum of all window sums can be calculated by summing (prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]) for each i from 0 to (n -k). Then divide by (n -k + 1).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think: the sum over all windows is sum_{i=0}^{m} (prefix[i + k] - prefix[i]) where m = n -k.\n\nThis can be rewritten as sum_{i=0}^m prefix[i +k] - sum_{i=0}^m prefix[i].\n\nBut sum_{i=0}^m prefix[i +k] is sum_{i=k}^{m +k} prefix[i], but m is n -k. So m +k = n -k +k = n. So the first sum is sum_{i=k}^n prefix[i].\n\nThe second sum is sum_{i=0}^m prefix[i].\n\nSo the total sum of all window sums is [sum_{i=k}^n prefix[i]] - [sum_{i=0}^{m} prefix[i]].\n\nBut m is n -k. So the total sum is sum_{i=k}^n prefix[i] - sum_{i=0}^{n -k} prefix[i}.\n\nBut how to compute these sums efficiently?\n\nWell, we can precompute the prefix array, then compute the sum of the prefix array from index k to n, and subtract the sum from 0 to n -k.\n\nBut how to compute these sums? Well, if we have a prefix sum array of the prefix array, then we can compute these ranges quickly. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the original array as a, and the prefix sum array as P, where P[0] = 0, P[1] = a[0], P[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. So P has length n + 1.\n\nThen, the sum of P from index k to n is sum_{x=k}^n P[x], and the sum from 0 to m (where m = n -k) is sum_{x=0}^m P[x].\n\nSo, if we have another prefix sum array, say Q, where Q[i] = sum_{x=0}^i P[x], then the sum from k to n is Q[n] - Q[k-1], and the sum from 0 to m is Q[m].\n\nSo the total sum of all window sums is (Q[n] - Q[k-1]) - Q[m], where m = n -k.\n\nBut then, the average is this value divided by (number of windows), which is (n -k + 1).\n\nSo this approach would allow us to compute the total sum of all window sums in O(1) time once we have the prefix sums and the Q array.\n\nBut let's think about the time and space complexity. The original prefix array is O(n), and the Q array is O(n). So for n up to 2e5, this is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to avoid building the Q array. Let's think again.\n\nThe sum of P from k to n is sum_{x=k}^n P[x] = sum_{x=0}^n P[x] - sum_{x=0}^{k-1} P[x}.\n\nSimilarly, the sum from 0 to m is sum_{x=0}^m P[x}.\n\nSo, if we have the prefix sum of the prefix array, which is Q, then yes. But maybe we can compute these sums using the same prefix array.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum of P from index a to b as (sum_P_b - sum_P_a_prev), where sum_P_b is the sum up to index b.\n\nBut regardless, the idea is that we can compute the total sum of all window sums in O(1) time once we have the prefix sum array P.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the prefix sum array P of the original array a. P has length n+1, with P[0] = 0, P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1].\n\n2. Compute the sum_total_windows = sum_{each window} (sum of the window) = sum_{i=0}^{m} (P[i +k] - P[i]) where m = n -k.\n\n   Which equals sum_{i=0}^m P[i +k] - sum_{i=0}^m P[i].\n\n   Now, sum_{i=0}^m P[i +k] is sum_{i=k}^{k + m} P[i]. Since m = n -k, k + m = n. So it's sum_{i=k}^n P[i].\n\n   And sum_{i=0}^m P[i] is sum_{i=0}^{n -k} P[i].\n\n   So sum_total_windows = (sum_{i=k}^n P[i]) - (sum_{i=0}^{n -k} P[i]).\n\n   Now, how to compute these two sums?\n\n   For sum_{i=k}^n P[i], that's equal to (sum_{i=0}^n P[i]) - sum_{i=0}^{k-1} P[i}.\n\n   Similarly, sum_{i=0}^{n -k} P[i} is sum_{i=0}^m P[i}, where m = n -k.\n\n   So, if we have a prefix sum array of the P array, say Q, where Q[i] is the sum of P[0] to P[i], then:\n\n   sum_{i=k}^n P[i} = Q[n] - Q[k-1]\n\n   sum_{i=0}^{n -k} P[i} = Q[n -k]\n\n   Therefore, sum_total_windows = (Q[n] - Q[k-1]) - Q[n -k]\n\n   Then, the average is sum_total_windows / (number_of_weeks), where number_of_weeks is (n -k + 1).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute P, then compute Q, then compute the sum_total_windows as (Q[n] - Q[k-1]) - Q[n -k], then divide by (n -k + 1).\n\nBut how to compute Q? Well, Q can be computed as a prefix sum array of P.\n\nBut for that, the time complexity is O(n) for P, and O(n) for Q. Which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to compute the required sums without building Q. Let's think.\n\nFor example, sum_{i=0}^x P[i} can be computed as the sum of the prefix sums up to x. But how to compute that?\n\nBut if we have P already, then building Q is straightforward. Let's proceed with that.\n\nLet me take an example from the problem's sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nOriginal array a is [3,4,7]\n\nCompute P:\n\nP[0] = 0\n\nP[1] = 3\n\nP[2] = 3 +4 =7\n\nP[3] =7 +7=14\n\nsum_total_windows is sum_{i=0}^{1} (P[i + 2] - P[i} )\n\ni=0: P[2] - P[0} =7 -0=7\n\ni=1: P[3] - P[1} =14-3=11\n\nTotal sum is 7+11=18. Number of weeks is 3-2+1=2. Average is 18/2 =9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nNow according to the formula:\n\nsum_{i=k}^n P[i} = sum from i=2 to 3 of P[i} =7 +14=21.\n\nsum_{i=0}^{n -k} P[i} = sum from i=0 to 1 (since n-k is 3-2=1) of P[i} =0 +3=3.\n\nsum_total_windows = 21 -3 =18. Correct.\n\nNow, how to compute Q?\n\nQ is the prefix sum of P. So Q[0] =0, Q[1] =0+3=3, Q[2] =3 +7=10, Q[3] =10 +14=24.\n\nsum_{i=k}^n P[i} = Q[3] - Q[1] =24 -3=21.\n\nsum_{i=0}^{n-k} P[i} is Q[1] =3. So 21-3=18.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nAnother sample: input is 1 1, array [10].\n\nn=1, k=1. So number of weeks is 1.\n\nsum_total_windows is sum_{i=0}^0 (P[i+1] - P[i}) = P[1] - P[0} =10 -0=10. Average is 10/1=10. Correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n8 2\n\narray is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nn=8, k=2. So number of weeks is 8-2+1=7.\n\nEach week is sum of two consecutive days.\n\nThe sum of all weeks is:\n\n(1+2) + (2+4) + (4+100000) + (100000+123) + (123+456) + (456+789) + (789+1) \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n3 +6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 \n\nAdding all:\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n+100004 = 100013 \n\n+100123 = 200136 \n\n+579 = 200715 \n\n+1245 = 201,960 \n\n+790 = 202,750 ?\n\nWait, but the sample output says the average is 28964.2857142857.\n\nWait, the sum of all weeks is 202750?\n\nThen divided by 7 gives 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the formula would work.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut how to compute the prefix sums and the Q array.\n\nFirst, read n and k from input.\n\nThen read the array a.\n\nCompute P as a list where P[0] =0, and P[i] = P[i-1] + a[i-1].\n\nOnce P is computed, compute Q, which is the prefix sum of P. So Q[0] =0, Q[1] = P[0], Q[2] = Q[1] + P[1], etc.\n\nWait, no. Q is the prefix sum of P. So Q[i] = sum_{j=0}^i P[j} ?\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, Q is built as follows:\n\nQ = [0]*(len(P)) \n\nQ[0] = P[0]\n\nfor i in 1 to len(P)-1:\n\nQ[i] = Q[i-1] + P[i]\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nCompute P as a list of length n+1.\n\nThen compute Q as a list of length n+1, where Q[0] = P[0], and Q[i] = Q[i-1] + P[i].\n\nWait, no. Because Q[i] is the sum of P[0] to P[i]. So Q[0] = P[0], Q[1] = P[0] + P[1], etc.\n\nBut in code:\n\nWe can compute P first.\n\nThen compute Q as a prefix sum array of P.\n\nOnce that is done, then:\n\nsum_k_to_n = Q[n] - Q[k-1]\n\nsum_0_to_m = Q[n -k]\n\nsum_total_windows = sum_k_to_n - sum_0_to_m\n\naverage = sum_total_windows / (n -k + 1)\n\nBut wait, what if k is 0? No, because constraints say 1 ≤k ≤n.\n\nSo, for example, when k =n, then m =n -k =0. So sum_0_to_m is Q[0] = P[0] =0. sum_k_to_n is Q[n] - Q[k-1] = Q[n] - Q[n-1] = P[n].\n\nSo sum_total_windows = P[n] - 0 = P[n], which is the sum of the entire array. Divided by 1, which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nIn Python, for n up to 2e5, building P and Q arrays is manageable.\n\nBut for large n, it's important to use efficient code.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nRead the input. Wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, the user provided input examples like:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, it seems that the user provided multiple test cases. However, in the actual programming problem, the input is for a single test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code must read one test case. But in the sample input provided, there are multiple test cases. However, that's probably part of the example for the problem. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input shows three different inputs and outputs. But that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, the original problem's input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem shows three different test cases. However, the user may have formatted it that way for illustration. So perhaps the actual code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, for example, the first input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich outputs 9.0000000000.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem is written as a list of strings, which may be for multiple test cases. But perhaps the user made a mistake here. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So for the code, the input is one test case.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem, the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. But that's not clear. However, the problem's original description says that the input is two lines: first line with n and k, second line with the array.\n\nSo the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input given in the problem seems to have multiple test cases. However, looking at the problem's original statement, perhaps that's a formatting error. For example, the problem's sample input might have been presented as multiple test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input and output are:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nAnother sample input is 1 1 and 10, output 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample input is 8 2 with array [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1], output 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the user wrote:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich is three separate test cases. But that's probably an error in the problem's formatting. However, the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from stdin. So the code should read the first line as n and k, then the second line as the array. So for the code, the input is one test case.\n\nBut perhaps in the problem, the user is supposed to process multiple test cases, but that's not mentioned. However, looking at the problem's original statement, the input is for one test case. So I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo, the code will read n and k, then the array.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and k from input. Then read the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the prefix sum array P.\n\nCompute the prefix sum of P, which is Q.\n\nThen compute sum_k_to_n = Q[n] - Q[k-1]\n\nsum_0_to_m = Q[n -k]\n\nsum_total = sum_k_to_n - sum_0_to_m\n\naverage = sum_total / (n -k + 1)\n\nThen, print the average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut how to handle the precision? In Python, when you print floating points, you need to format it properly.\n\nBut for example, in the first sample, sum_total is 18, divided by 2 gives 9.0, which is printed as 9.0000000000.\n\nIn Python, we can format the output with 10 decimal places using something like \"{:.10f}\".format(average).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So, printing with 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nBut how to compute the sum_total accurately?\n\nBut since all the numbers are integers, the sum_total is an integer, and the average is a rational number. So, in Python, when we do division, it will be a float, but we need to make sure that the division is precise enough.\n\nBut with Python's floating point numbers, which are double-precision, this should be okay for the required precision.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nBut for large n, say 2e5, the code must be efficient. But with O(n) time, it's acceptable.\n\nBut let's code.\n\nSample code:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nThen read the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute P:\n\np = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    p[i] = p[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nThen compute Q:\n\nq = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    q[i] = q[i-1] + p[i]\n\nBut wait, q[0] is p[0], which is 0. Then q[1] is q[0] + p[1], which is 0 + p[1]. Then q[2] = q[1] + p[2], etc.\n\nYes.\n\nThen:\n\nsum_k_to_n = q[n] - q[k-1]\n\nsum_0_to_m = q[n -k]\n\nsum_total = sum_k_to_n - sum_0_to_m\n\nnumber_of_weeks = n -k +1\n\naverage = sum_total / number_of_weeks\n\nprint(\"{:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut let's test with the first sample.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\na = [3,4,7]\n\np is [0, 3, 7, 14]\n\nq is [0, 0+3=3, 3+7=10, 10+14=24]\n\nsum_k_to_n = q[3] - q[1] = 24 -3 =21.\n\nsum_0_to_m is q[3-2] = q[1] =3.\n\nsum_total = 21 -3 =18.\n\naverage = 18/(3-2+1) =18/2=9.0. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: n=1, k=1. a=[10].\n\np is [0, 10]\n\nq is [0, 0+10=10]\n\nsum_k_to_n is q[1] - q[0] =10 -0=10.\n\nsum_0_to_m is q[1-1] =q[0] =0.\n\nsum_total is 10-0=10. divided by 1 → 10.0. Correct.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\narray is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nCompute p:\n\np[0] =0\n\np[1] =1\n\np[2] =1+2=3\n\np[3] =3+4=7\n\np[4] =7 +100000 = 100007\n\np[5] = 100007 + 123 = 100130\n\np[6] = 100130 +456 = 100586\n\np[7] = 100586 +789 = 101375\n\np[8] = 101375 +1 = 101376\n\nThen, q is the prefix sum of p:\n\nq[0] =0\n\nq[1] =0 + p[1] =0 +1 =1\n\nq[2] =1 +3 =4\n\nq[3] =4 +7=11\n\nq[4] =11 +100007=100018\n\nq[5] =100018 +100130 = 200148\n\nq[6] =200148 +100586 = 300734\n\nq[7] =300734 +101375 = 402109\n\nq[8] =402109 +101376 = 503485\n\nsum_k_to_n = q[8] - q[1] (since k=2, k-1=1). q[8] is 503485, q[1] is 1. So 503485 -1 =503484.\n\nsum_0_to_m = q[n -k] = q[8-2] = q[6] = 300734.\n\nsum_total = 503484 - 300734 = 202750.\n\nnumber_of_weeks = 8-2+1=7.\n\naverage = 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857... which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for large n, say 2e5, creating two arrays of size n+1 is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for n up to 2e5, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and k from input. Then the array.\n\nBut how to read input? For example, in Python, the input can be read via input().split().\n\nBut sometimes, for multiple lines, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the problem, the code can read the first line as n and k, then the second line as the array.\n\nBut for cases where the input is read as multiple lines, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut need to ensure that the second line has exactly n numbers.\n\nOnce that is done, compute P and Q.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, lists are dynamic, so creating P and Q as lists of size n+1 is possible.\n\nBut for n=2e5, n+1 is 200001, which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute P:\n\np = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    p[i] = p[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nThen compute q:\n\nq = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    q[i] = q[i-1] + p[i]\n\nThen compute sum_k_to_n = q[n] - q[k-1]\n\nsum_0_to_m = q[n -k]\n\nsum_total = sum_k_to_n - sum_0_to_m\n\nnumber_of_weeks = n -k +1\n\naverage = sum_total / number_of_weeks\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but what if n -k is negative? No, since k ≤n, n -k ≥0.\n\nBut for example, when k =n, then n -k =0. So q[0] is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's check for n=1, k=1. sum_0_to_m is q[0], which is 0. sum_k_to_n is q[1] - q[0] = p[1] - 0 =10. sum_total =10 -0 =10. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what about the case when k=0? Well, the constraints say that 1 ≤k ≤n, so no need to handle that.\n\nNow, testing the code with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput: 9.0000000000\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOutput: 10.0000000000\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nOutput: 28964.2857142857\n\nWhich is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nYes.\n\nBut when we print with 10 decimal digits, the code will output that.\n\nBut in Python, when you format with .10f, it rounds the number. However, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So, printing with 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the division is not exact? For example, in the third sample, 202750 divided by 7 is 28964.285714285714..., which when printed with 10 decimals would be 28964.2857142857, which is what the sample shows.\n\nBut the code uses the division and the format string, which should handle that.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, the sum_total could be very big, but since Python uses arbitrary precision integers, it's okay.\n\nBut when you divide by number_of_weeks, which is an integer, the division is done as a float.\n\nBut for very large numbers, perhaps the sum_total could be up to (sum of all possible window sums), which for n=2e5 and k=1e5, each window sum is sum of 1e5 elements. But with a[i] up to 1e5, each sum is up to 1e10, multiplied by 1e5 windows, sum_total could be up to 1e15, which fits into a 64-bit integer, which Python handles fine.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut let me code this.\n\nBut also, note that in some cases, the sum_total can be zero, but the code handles that.\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nBut in Python, for the case when n=0? No, since n ≥k ≥1, so n ≥1.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n and k, then a.\n\nBut what if the input is given with multiple lines? Like, for example, the second line may be split into multiple lines? Well, the problem says that the second line contains n integers, so the code can read the entire line as a single input.\n\nBut in practice, using input().split() may not work if the input is split into multiple lines. However, in programming competition, the input is usually given correctly, and the code can read the second line as a single line.\n\nThus, the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    # Compute prefix sums P\n\n    p = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n\n        p[i] = p[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\n    # Compute prefix sums of P, which is Q\n\n    q = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n\n        q[i] = q[i-1] + p[i]\n\n    sum_k_to_n = q[n] - q[k-1]\n\n    sum_0_to_m = q[n - k]\n\n    sum_total = sum_k_to_n - sum_0_to_m\n\n    number_of_weeks = n - k + 1\n\n    average = sum_total / number_of_weeks\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut let's test this code with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n10 → output is 10.0000000000.\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1 → output is 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut let's compute 202750 /7:\n\n202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714...\n\nSo when printed with 10 decimals, it's 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut in Python, when you format with .10f, it rounds the number. Let's check:\n\nFor example, 28964.285714285714 → the 10th decimal digit is the 7th in the decimal part.\n\nBut let me see:\n\nThe number is 28964.285714285714...\n\nSo the first 10 decimals are 2857142857. So the output is 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n =k. So only one week. The average is the sum of the entire array.\n\nFor example, n=2, k=2, a = [1,2]. sum_total is sum of the entire array (3) divided by 1 →3.0.\n\nEdge case 2: k=1. Each week is a single day. The average is the average of all elements. Because each day is considered as a week. So the sum of all weeks is sum(a) and the number of weeks is n. So average is sum(a)/n.\n\nWhich the code should compute correctly.\n\nLet me test this case.\n\nn=3, k=1. a = [1,2,3].\n\nsum_total is sum of all windows (each window is one element). sum_total =1 +2 +3 =6. number of weeks is 3. average 6/3=2.0.\n\nLet's see what the code does.\n\np = [0, 1, 3, 6]\n\nq = [0, 0+1=1, 1+3=4, 4+6=10]\n\nsum_k_to_n = q[3] - q[0] (since k=1, k-1=0) →10 -0=10.\n\nsum_0_to_m is q[n -k] = q[3-1] = q[2] =4.\n\nsum_total =10 -4 =6 → correct.\n\naverage 6/3 = 2.0 → correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, k=1. a = [5, 5]. average is (5 +5)/2 =5.0. Code computes:\n\np = [0,5, 10]\n\nq = [0, 5, 15]\n\nsum_k_to_n = q[2] - q[0] =15 -0 =15.\n\nsum_0_to_m is q[2 -1] = q[1] =5.\n\nsum_total =15-5=10. divided by 2 →5.0. Correct.\n\nSo the code",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of `k` days from a list of `n` recorded sleep times. The solution must be efficient to handle large input sizes up to 200,000 elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Compute a prefix sum array `P` where each element at index `i` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the input array. This allows us to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.\n2. **Prefix Sum of Prefix Sums**: Create another prefix sum array `Q` from the prefix sum array `P`. This helps in efficiently calculating the sum of sums of all possible subarrays of length `k`.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Using the prefix sum arrays, compute the total sum of all valid subarrays of length `k` and then determine the average by dividing this total by the number of such subarrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums P\n    p = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        p[i] = p[i-1] + a[i-1]\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums of P to get Q\n    q = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        q[i] = q[i-1] + p[i]\n    \n    sum_k_to_n = q[n] - q[k-1]\n    sum_0_to_m = q[n - k]\n    sum_total = sum_k_to_n - sum_0_to_m\n    \n    number_of_weeks = n - k + 1\n    average = sum_total / number_of_weeks\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read using standard input functions, which is efficient for large datasets.\n2. **Prefix Sum Array (P)**: This array helps in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray. For example, the sum of elements from index `i` to `j` can be found using `P[j+1] - P[i]`.\n3. **Prefix Sum of Prefix Sums (Q)**: This array allows us to compute the sum of sums of all valid subarrays efficiently. By leveraging the properties of prefix sums, we avoid recalculating sums repeatedly.\n4. **Sum Calculation**: Using the prefix sum arrays, we compute the total sum of all valid subarrays of length `k` and then divide by the number of such subarrays to get the average. This ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n).\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle large inputs efficiently, adhering to the constraints and providing the required precision in the output.",
