Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality holds. So for any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe there's a way to simplify that.\n\nWait, the problem says x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z. Wait, no. Wait, the constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y starts from B (since B ≤ y) and up to C, and z starts from C up to D. But how are x, y, z ordered? Let me think. Since x is up to B, and y is at least B, so x ≤ B ≤ y. So x ≤ y. And y is up to C, and z is at least C. So y ≤ C ≤ z. Therefore, y ≤ z. Therefore, in any valid triplet (x,y,z), x ≤ y ≤ z. So the triangle inequalities require that x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides a ≤ b ≤ c, the condition is a + b > c. Because if that holds, then the other inequalities (a + c > b and b + c > a) are automatically satisfied since c ≥ b ≥ a.\n\nSo the main condition here is x + y > z. So our task reduces to counting all triplets (x, y, z) where A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D, and x + y > z.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently, given that the numbers can be up to 5e5?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Brute-forcing all possible x, y, z would be O(B * (C-B+1) * (D - C + 1)), which for large values would be way too slow. For example, if all are 5e5, then B is 5e5, C-B is 0, D-C is 0. But in general, for cases where B and C are large, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nWe need a smarter way. Let's think about iterating over possible x and y, and for each pair (x, y), compute the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ D and z < x + y. But since z must be ≥ C, the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. However, if x + y -1 < C, then there are no such z's. So for each (x, y), the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. So for each x and y, we can calculate the lower bound for z (which is C) and upper bound (which is min(D, x + y - 1)). The number of valid z's is max(0, upper - C + 1) if upper >= C.\n\nBut considering that B and C can be up to 5e5, the total number of (x, y) pairs is (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1). If A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, then (B - A + 1) is 5e5, and (C - B + 1) is 1. So total pairs would be 5e5, which is manageable. But if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then it's 5e5 * 1 = 5e5 pairs. For each pair, the calculation is O(1), so overall O( (B - A + 1) * (C - B + 1) ) operations. Let's check the worst case.\n\nThe worst case is when B is large, and C is large. For example, if A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5. Then the number of pairs is (5e5) * 1 = 5e5. Which is acceptable. But if A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5, then for each x (from 1 to 5e5) and y (fixed at 5e5), the z must be between C=5e5 and D=5e5. So z",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key constraint for a triangle to be non-degenerate is that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Given the ordering constraints $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the critical condition simplifies to $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: The problem constraints ensure that $x \\leq y \\leq z$. Therefore, the only necessary condition to check for a valid triangle is $x + y > z$.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Values**: Iterate over all possible values of $x$ from $A$ to $B$ and $y$ from $B$ to $C$.\n3. **Count Valid $z$ Values**: For each pair $(x, y)$, determine the valid range of $z$ values such that $C \\leq z \\leq D$ and $z < x + y$. The number of valid $z$ values for each $(x, y)$ is calculated as $\\max(0, \\min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)$ if $\\min(D, x + y - 1) \\geq C$, otherwise 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    A = int(input[0])\n    B = int(input[1])\n    C = int(input[2])\n    D = int(input[3])\n    \n    count = 0\n    \n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        for y in range(B, C + 1):\n            min_z = C\n            max_z = min(D, x + y - 1)\n            if max_z < min_z:\n                continue\n            count += max_z - min_z + 1\n    \n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n- **Iterating Over $x$ and $y$**: We iterate over all possible values of $x$ from $A$ to $B$ and $y$ from $B$ to $C$.\n- **Calculating Valid $z$ Values**: For each pair $(x, y)$, we compute the valid range of $z$ values that satisfy both $C \\leq z \\leq D$ and $z < x + y$. This is done using the formula $\\max(0, \\min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1)$.\n- **Counting Valid Triangles**: The count of valid triangles is accumulated by iterating through all valid pairs $(x, y)$ and summing the number of valid $z$ values for each pair.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible triangles under the given constraints, ensuring we count only non-degenerate triangles while adhering to the problem's requirements.",
