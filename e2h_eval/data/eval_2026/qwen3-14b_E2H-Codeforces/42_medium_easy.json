    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. The two progress bars are calculated differently: one for the current file, and one for the total data copied so far.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the setup: there are n files being copied sequentially. For each byte copied, after copying that byte, the first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file completed (x / a_i * 100, floored). The second shows the total bytes copied divided by the total size of all files, also floored.\n\nWe need to find all percentages p where there exists a moment when both bars show p. Then output those p's in order.\n\nSo the approach is to simulate all possible moments when the progress bars update and check for equality between the two percentages.\n\nBut how do I model all these moments?\n\nEach byte copied is a possible moment. However, since the files can be up to 1000 bytes each, and n is up to 100, the total number of bytes is up to 100*1000 = 10^5. So for each byte, we can compute the two percentages and check if they are equal. But since for each byte, we need to track which file it's in and how much has been copied so far.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after each byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. So for every byte x in file i (where x ranges from 1 to a_i), we can compute the current percentage for that file and the total percentage.\n\nBut considering all possible bytes would be O(total_bytes) time. Since total_bytes can be up to 1e5, that's manageable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the total size of all files, let's call it total_size.\n\n2. For each file i, iterate through each byte x from 1 to a_i (since after copying each byte, the progress is updated). For each such x:\n\n   a. Compute current_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n   b. Compute total_bytes_so_far = sum of sizes of previous files + x\n\n   c. total_percent = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_size)\n\n   d. Check if current_percent == total_percent. If yes, add this value to a set of possible p's.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the initial state where both bars are 0. Because before any bytes are copied, both are zero. But according to the note, the initial state is considered. For example, in the first sample input, the output includes 0, which is the initial state.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the initial state is when both bars are 0. However, the problem says that the values are updated after each byte is copied. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is considered as well. However, the first byte copied will trigger the first update.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают 0 процентов.\" So the initial state is included. However, when you copy the first byte, the progress bars are updated. So the initial state is a moment when both are 0. But how do we capture that?\n\nIn our simulation, for each byte x in the files, we check after that byte is copied. However, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is not covered by any of those checks. So we need to handle that case separately.\n\nWait, the problem says that the values are updated after copying each byte. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. Then, after the first byte is copied, the progress bars are updated. So the initial state is a valid moment. Therefore, we need to check whether 0 is present. How?\n\nBecause when no bytes are copied, the total_bytes_so_far is 0. So for the initial state, the two percentages are 0. So perhaps in our simulation, we should include that.\n\nBut how? Because in the simulation steps above, for each byte x in each file, we process after that byte is copied. However, the initial state (0 bytes copied) is not processed in that loop.\n\nTherefore, we need to check if 0 is a valid value. How?\n\nWell, the initial state is always a moment where both are 0. So 0 is always present. But what if the total size is zero? No, the problem says that each a_i is at least 1. So total_size is at least 1. So the initial state is 0% for both. Therefore, 0 is always part of the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example's output includes 0, which is correct. However, in the second example's output, 0 is also present. So the initial state is always a valid case.\n\nBut in our simulation, when we process all the bytes, the initial state is not covered. So we need to include 0 in the result. However, perhaps during the simulation, the initial state is not captured, but the code must include 0 as a possible value.\n\nWait, but maybe when the first byte is copied, the current_percent is floor(100 * 1 / a_1). For example, if a_1 is 6, then after first byte, current percent is 16 (100 * 1 /6 is ~16.666... floored to 16). The total percent is 100 * 1 /6 = 16.666..., floored to 16. So both are 16. So in the first sample input, the output includes 0, 16, 33, etc. But the initial state is 0. So in that case, the code needs to include 0 as a possible value.\n\nTherefore, the code should start with a set containing 0, and then check all the other possible moments.\n\nBut how to make sure that 0 is included? Because when the first byte is copied, the total bytes so far is 1, which may not be 0. But the initial state is 0, which is before any bytes are copied. Therefore, we need to include 0 in the answer unless there's some condition where even that is not allowed. But according to the problem statement, the initial state is considered. So 0 is always in the answer.\n\nWait, but what if the total_size is 1, and the first byte is copied. Then, after copying that byte, the total percent is 100. But the initial state is 0. So 0 is present.\n\nTherefore, the code must include 0 in the answer. However, in the simulation steps, when processing all bytes, we might not capture that initial 0. So perhaps we need to add 0 to the set of possible values, and then check all the other possibilities.\n\nBut how to confirm that?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the output includes 0. So the code must include 0. However, during the simulation of all bytes, when x=1, the current percent is 16 (for a_i=6), and the total percent is 16. So 16 is added. But the initial 0 is not captured in that simulation. So the code must explicitly check for 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial state is considered as a moment where both are 0. So the code needs to check that.\n\nTherefore, the approach would be:\n\nInitialize a set with 0.\n\nThen, for each byte in all files, compute the two percentages and check if they are equal. If yes, add to the set.\n\nFinally, collect all elements in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, what about the moment when all bytes are copied? At that moment, the total percent is 100. Also, for the current file, after the last byte is copied, the current percent is 100. So that's another moment when both are 100. So the code would capture that.\n\nBut in the simulation, for each byte, including the last one, the code checks whether the two percentages are equal. So for the last byte, the code would check that.\n\nBut the initial state (before any bytes) is not covered in that loop. So adding 0 to the set is necessary.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the initial state is considered. So for example, in the first sample input, the output includes 0. So in the code, we need to make sure that 0 is included. However, when all files are copied, the total percent is 100. So that's also included in the simulation.\n\nBut what if there is a moment where both bars are 100? Well, when the last byte is copied, the current percent is 100 (since x is a_i, so 100 * a_i /a_i = 100). And the total percent is 100 * total_size / total_size = 100. So that's a moment when both are 100. So that would be captured in the simulation.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read n and the list a.\n\n2. Compute total_size = sum(a).\n\n3. Initialize a set called result with 0.\n\n4. For each file index i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n   a. For each byte x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n      i. current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n      ii. total_bytes_so_far = sum of a[0..i-1] + x\n\n      iii. total_percent = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_size\n\n      iv. if current_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\n5. After processing all bytes, collect all elements in the set, sort them, and print them.\n\nBut how to compute the sum of a[0..i-1] for each x in the current file?\n\nWe can precompute the prefix sums. For example, prefix_sum[i] is the sum of the first i files. So for the i-th file (assuming 0-based), the prefix_sum[i] is the sum of a[0] to a[i-1]. Then, for the current file i, when x is copied, the total_bytes_so_far is prefix_sum[i] + x.\n\nSo let's compute prefix_sum as follows:\n\nprefix_sum[0] = 0\n\nprefix_sum[1] = a[0]\n\nprefix_sum[2] = a[0] + a[1]\n\nand so on.\n\nSo for the i-th file (starting from 0?), let's think. Let's say the files are 0-based. For the i-th file, the sum of previous files is prefix_sum[i], and when we copy x bytes in this file, total_bytes_so_far is prefix_sum[i] + x.\n\nSo the code can precompute the prefix sums.\n\nNow, for example, for the first sample input:\n\nn=1, a=[6]. total_size is 6.\n\nprefix_sum is [0, 6].\n\nFor the first (and only) file, i=0. For x from 1 to 6:\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 0 + x = x.\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * x) // 6.\n\ntotal_percent is (100 * x) // 6.\n\nSo they are equal. So all the values generated during this process would be added. But the initial 0 is already added to the set. However, when x=6, the current_percent is 100, and total_percent is 100. So 100 is added to the set. So the set would have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample's output.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case when the total_bytes_so_far is exactly 100%? Like, when the total is 100% and the current file is also 100%? That's handled.\n\nBut what about the initial state? For example, in the first sample, the initial 0 is added to the set. Then, during processing, when x=1, the current_percent is 16, and total_percent is 16. So 16 is added. So the set includes 0 and 16, etc. So the code would collect all the required values.\n\nBut why not check the initial state (0) as part of the simulation?\n\nBecause during the simulation, when x is 0, but that's not part of any byte. Because the bytes are from 1 to a_i. So the initial state is not covered in the loop. Hence, the code must add 0 to the set.\n\nBut what about the case when the initial state is the only moment when both bars are 0? For example, if there is a single file of size 1. Then, after copying the first byte, the current percent is 100, and total is 100. So the set would have 0 and 100. So the code would output 0 and 100.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: when the total_size is 100, and a single file of size 100. Then, during the simulation, for each x from 1 to 100, current_percent and total_percent are same. So all the percentages from 1 to 100 would be added. But the initial 0 is also added. So the output would be 0, 1, 2, ..., 100. But that's not possible because for x=1, current percent is 1, total percent is 1, etc. So the code would generate all numbers from 0 to 100.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output should include all numbers that are present at some moment. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nImplementing in Python:\n\nRead n from input, then the list a.\n\nCompute total_size = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums: prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for x in 1..a[i]:\n\n      current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n      total_bytes_so_far = prefix_sums[i] + x\n\n      total_percent = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_size\n\n      if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n          add to the set.\n\nAlso, add 0 to the set.\n\nThen collect all elements in the set, sort, and print.\n\nBut how to compute the prefix_sums?\n\nIn Python, for a list a, the prefix_sums can be computed as follows:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nCompute total_size = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize a set, say 'result = set()'.\n\nAdd 0 to the result.\n\nThen for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n      compute current_percent.\n\n      compute total_bytes_so_far = prefix_sums[i] + x.\n\n      compute total_percent.\n\n      if equal, add to result.\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list.\n\nBut wait, for the case when the total_size is 0? But according to the input constraints, a_i >=1. So total_size is at least 1.\n\nNow, let's test the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nprefix_sums is [0,6]\n\nFor i=0, a[i]=6. x runs from 1 to 6.\n\nFor each x:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) //6.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 0 +x =x. total_percent is (100 * x) //6.\n\nSo they are equal. So all those percentages are added. Also, the initial 0 is added.\n\nSo the result set includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\ntotal_size is 600.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 100, 600].\n\nFor i=0 (file size 100):\n\nfor x in 1..100:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 100 = x // 1.\n\nWhich is x.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 0 +x =x.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * x) // 600.\n\nSo for example, when x=1, current is 1, total is 0. So not equal. When x=6, total is (600 * 100)/600 = 1%? Wait:\n\nWait 100 * x / 600 = 100 * x / 600 = x/6. So for x=6, it's 1. So total_percent is 1. current is 6. So not equal. So during this phase, the current_percent is higher than the total_percent. So when does current_percent equal total_percent?\n\nLooking for x where x = floor(100 * x / 600). Let's see:\n\nx = floor( (100x)/600 )\n\nWhich is x = floor(x/6). But x is between 1 and 100.\n\nBut for x=0, it's 0. For x=1, 1/6 is 0.166, floor is 0. So x=1 is not equal to 0. So no matches here except when x=0, which is already handled.\n\nSo during the first file's processing, there are no matches except possibly when x=0 (which is already in the set). So nothing is added during this phase.\n\nThen, for the second file (i=1), prefix_sums[i] is 100. So for x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 500.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 100 +x.\n\ntotal_percent = (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nWe need to find x where (100x)//500 == (100*(100 +x ))//600.\n\nLet me compute for some x.\n\nFor example, when x=500 (the last byte of the second file):\n\ncurrent_percent is 100*500 /500 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 100 +500 = 600. 100 * 600 /600 = 100. So both are 100. So 100 is added.\n\nBut during the processing of the second file, there may be other points where the two percentages match.\n\nFor example, let's take the sample output for the second input, which is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nSo during processing the second file, when x is such that the total is 599 (for example), then total_percent is (100 * 599) // 600 = 99. Because 100 * 599 /600 = 99.833..., floored to 99. And current_percent is (100 * x) // 500. Let's see, when x is 499.5? Well, x is integer. Let me think for x= 599 - 100 = 499?\n\nWait, the total_bytes_so_far is 100 + x. So for total_bytes_so_far = 599, x is 499. So current_percent is (100 * 499) //500 = (49900) //500 = 99.8 → 99. And total_percent is (100 * 599) // 600 = 99.833 → 99. So both are 99. So that's added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 499, 500, etc. So during the processing of the second file, various values are added.\n\nSo the code should capture those.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these steps.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n from stdin. Then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the examples. For example, in the first sample input, the input is ['1\\n6', ...], but in practice, the user will input via stdin.\n\nBut for the code, the code should read from stdin. So in Python, read n from input(). Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen compute prefix_sums.\n\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal_size = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        total_bytes_so_far = prefix_sums[i] + x\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_size\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nprint('\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the output is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100' — which is the sorted list of the set.\n\nBut let's test the code for the first sample input. For the first sample, the code adds 0, and then for each x in 1-6, the current_percent and total_percent are same. So for x=1: 100*1//6 = 16. So 16 is added. Similarly for x=2: 200//6=33. So 33 is added. x=3: 300//6=50. x=4: 400//6=66. x=5: 500//6=83. x=6: 600//6=100. So the set is {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100}, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's look at the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nThe output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nBut according to the code, during processing of the first file (size 100), for x from 1 to 100, current_percent is x, and total_percent is (100 * x) // 600. For x= 599? No, during first file, x is up to 100. So for x=100, the total_bytes_so_far is 100, and total_percent is (100 * 100)/600 = 16.666... floored to 16. current_percent is 100. So no match. So during processing of first file, nothing is added except maybe when x is 0 (already added).\n\nThen during processing of the second file (size 500). For each x from 1 to 500:\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 +x.\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) //500 = x//5.\n\ntotal_percent = (100*(100 +x )) //600.\n\nWe need to find x where x//5 == (100*(100 +x )) //600.\n\nLet me see for x= 499:\n\ncurrent_percent = 499//5 = 99.8 → 99.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 + 499 = 599. 100 * 599 /600 = 99.833... → 99. So equal. So added.\n\nSimilarly, x= 495:\n\ncurrent_percent is 495//5=99.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 595. 100 * 595 /600 = 99.166... → 99. So equal. So added.\n\nSo during processing of the second file, many values are added.\n\nAt the end, the set includes 0, 100, and all the percentages that match during processing of the second file.\n\nBut how do we get 95, 96, etc.?\n\nLet me think for some x:\n\nLet me find when current_percent equals total_percent.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncurrent_percent = floor( (100x)/500 ) = floor( x/5 )\n\ntotal_percent = floor( (100*(100 +x )) / 600 )\n\nWe need to find x where these two are equal.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s call the current_percent as p.\n\nSo p = floor(x/5).\n\ntotal_percent is floor( (100*(100 + x )) / 600 ) = floor( ( (100 + x ) * 100 ) / 600 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n( (100 + x ) * 100 ) / 600 = (100 + x ) / 6 ≈ 16.666... + x/6.\n\nSo floor( (100 + x)/6 )\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nfloor(x/5) = floor( (100 + x)/6 )\n\nWe need to find x in 1..500 where this holds.\n\nLet me think for x where this is true.\n\nLet me try to find x such that:\n\nLet’s denote p = floor(x/5) = floor( (100 + x)/6 )\n\nLet’s suppose that p is some integer between 0 and 100.\n\nFor example, let's take p=95.\n\nWe need:\n\n95 ≤ x/5 < 96 → 475 ≤ x < 480.\n\nAlso, 95 ≤ (100 +x)/6 < 96 → 570 ≤ 100 +x < 576 → 470 ≤ x < 476.\n\nSo x must be in the intersection of [475, 480) and [470, 476). Which is [475, 476). So x is 475.\n\nCheck for x=475:\n\ncurrent_percent = 475//5 = 95.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 + 475) = 575 → 575 * 100 / 600 = 575 / 6 = 95.833..., floor is 95. So yes. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly for p=96:\n\nWe have:\n\nfloor(x/5) = 96 → 480 ≤x <485.\n\nfloor( (100 +x)/6 ) = 96 → 96*6 ≤ 100 +x < 97*6 → 576 ≤ 100 +x < 582 → 476 ≤x < 482.\n\nSo x must be in [480, 485) ∩ [476, 482) → [480, 482). So x can be 480, 481.\n\nCheck x=480:\n\ncurrent_percent = 480//5=96.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 +480=580 → 580 * 100 /600 = 580/6 = 96.666..., floor 96. So yes. So 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x=481:\n\ncurrent_percent is 481//5=96.2 → 96.\n\ntotal is 581 → 581/6 = 96.833... → 96. So yes.\n\nSo for x=480 and 481, 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly for p=97:\n\nfloor(x/5)=97 → 485 ≤x <490.\n\nfloor( (100 +x)/6 )=97 → 582 ≤ 100 +x < 588 → 482 ≤x < 488.\n\nSo x must be in [485,490) and [482, 488) → [485, 488). So x=485, 486, 487.\n\nCheck x=485:\n\ncurrent is 485/5=97.\n\ntotal is 585 → 585/6= 97.5 → 97. So yes.\n\nSame for others.\n\nSimilarly for p=98:\n\nfloor(x/5) =98 → 490 ≤x <495.\n\nfloor((100 +x)/6) =98 → 588 ≤ 100 +x < 594 → 488 ≤x <494.\n\nIntersection is [490, 494) → x=490, 491, 492, 493.\n\nCheck x=490:\n\ncurrent is 98. total is 590 → 590/6 = 98.333... → 98. So yes.\n\nSame for others.\n\np=99:\n\nfloor(x/5) =99 → 495 ≤x <500.\n\nfloor( (100+x)/6 ) =99 → 594 ≤ 100 +x < 600 → 494 ≤x < 500.\n\nSo x is in [495,500) and [494,500) → [495, 500). So x=495, 496, 497, 498, 499.\n\nCheck x=495: total is 595 → 595/6 = 99.166... → 99. current is 495/5=99. So yes.\n\nx=499: total is 599 → 599/6 = 99.833... → 99. current is 499/5=99.8 → 99. So yes.\n\nSo for all these x's, 99 is added.\n\nAnd for x=500: current is 500/5=100. total is 600 → 600/6=100. So added.\n\nThus, the code would add 95,96,97,98,99,100. Plus 0. So the output is as per the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, let's think about the third sample input:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998\n\nSample Output: 0 50 99 100.\n\nLet me think. The total size is 1000 +2 +2 +998 = 2002.\n\nThe code would process each byte in each file.\n\nBut during processing, for example, when the first file (size 1000) is being copied, the current_percent is (100x)/1000 = x/10. The total_percent is (100*(x))/2002. So for x=1000, the current is 100, total is 100*1000/2002 = 49.95... → 49. So no match. However, during the first file, perhaps there are some points where current and total match.\n\nBut perhaps during the third file (the 2nd and 3rd files are small, 2 and 2 bytes). Let's see.\n\nBut the sample output includes 50. How is that achieved?\n\nPossibly during the copying of the first file. For example, when x is 1000 bytes, but that's not. Wait, but maybe during the third file or fourth.\n\nAlternatively, during the copying of the fourth file (size 998). Let me think.\n\nBut perhaps during the copying of the first file, when x is 1001 bytes? No, because the first file is 1000 bytes. So during the first file, x ranges up to 1000.\n\nBut during the first file, the total_bytes_so_far is x. So total_percent is (100 * x) // 2002.\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 *x )//1000 = x//10.\n\nSo when is x//10 = (100x) //2002 ?\n\nLet me find x such that x//10 = floor( (100x)/2002 )\n\nLet me take x= 1001? No, because x is up to 1000.\n\nLet me try x= 1000. Then:\n\ncurrent_percent = 1000//10 = 100.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * 1000)/2002 = 100000 / 2002 ≈ 49.95 → 49. Not equal.\n\nWhat about x= 1001? No, not in the first file.\n\nBut maybe during the second file (size 2). For example, when x=1 (second file):\n\ncurrent_percent = 100 * 1 /2 = 50.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 1000 +1 = 1001.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * 1001)/2002 = 50.0... ?\n\nWait 100 * 1001 = 100100. Divided by 2002: 100100 / 2002 = 50. Exactly. So 50. So current_percent is 50, total_percent is 50. So 50 is added.\n\nAh! So this is the case. So during the second file, x=1, the current_percent is 50, and the total_percent is 50. So 50 is added to the set.\n\nSo that's why the sample output includes 50.\n\nSo the code would capture that.\n\nSimilarly, during the fourth file (size 998), when x is 998, the current_percent is 100, and total_bytes_so_far is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002. So total_percent is 100. So 100 is added.\n\nAlso, during the copying of the fourth file, there may be other points where the percentages match.\n\nBut according to the sample output, 99 is also present. How?\n\nMaybe when total_bytes_so_far is 1999. Let's see:\n\ntotal_percent is (100 * 1999) // 2002 = 199900 // 2002 = let's calculate:\n\n2002 * 99 = 198198. 199900 - 198198 = 1702. So 99. So floor(199900 / 2002) = 99.\n\ncurrent_percent would be for the fourth file. Let's see:\n\nThe fourth file is the fourth one. The prefix_sums for i=3 (since the files are 0-based) is 1000 + 2 + 2 = 1004",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer percentages between 0 and 100 inclusive that are simultaneously shown on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar indicates the percentage of the current file copied, while the second indicates the percentage of the total data copied so far.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input:** Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation:** Compute prefix sums to efficiently determine the total bytes copied up to each file.\n3. **Simulate Copying Process:** For each byte copied in each file, calculate the current progress percentage for the file and the total progress percentage for all files combined.\n4. **Track Matching Percentages:** Use a set to track all unique percentages where both progress bars show the same value.\n5. **Initial State Consideration:** Include the initial state (0%) as a valid percentage since both bars start at 0%.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total_size = prefix_sums[-1]\n    result = {0}\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_file_size = a[i]\n        for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n            current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n            total_bytes = prefix_sums[i] + x\n            total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n            if current_percent == total_percent:\n                result.add(current_percent)\n    \n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    print('\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read using standard input functions. The first line gives the number of files, and the second line provides the sizes of these files.\n2. **Prefix Sums:** We compute prefix sums to quickly determine the cumulative size of files up to each point, which helps in calculating the total bytes copied so far efficiently.\n3. **Progress Calculation:** For each byte copied in each file, we calculate both the current file progress and the total progress. These values are compared, and if they match, the percentage is added to a set to ensure uniqueness.\n4. **Initial State:** The initial state where both progress bars show 0% is explicitly included in the result set.\n5. **Output:** The results are sorted and printed in ascending order as required.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible moments when both progress bars show the same percentage are considered efficiently, leveraging the constraints provided in the problem statement.",
