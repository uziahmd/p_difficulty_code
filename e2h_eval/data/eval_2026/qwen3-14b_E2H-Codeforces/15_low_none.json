They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about determining which team skill levels can win a tournament based on the given string s that dictates the rules for each phase. \n\nFirst, let me understand the setup. There are 2^n teams, each with a unique skill level from 1 to 2^n. The tournament is structured in phases. Each phase halves the number of teams. For example, in the first phase, there are 2^{n-1} games, then 2^{n-2}, and so on until one remains. \n\nThe string s has n characters. Each character corresponds to a phase. For the i-th phase (starting from 0?), during that phase, each match is decided by the higher or lower skill level, depending on whether s[i] is '1' or '0'. \n\nOur task is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\nSo, how do we model this? Well, for a given x, can we determine if it's possible to arrange the tournament structure such that x ends up as the champion?\n\nLet me think recursively. The tournament structure is like a binary tree. Each round, teams are paired, and the winners proceed. The rules for each round are determined by the corresponding character in s. \n\nFor example, if n=3, then there are 3 phases. The first phase is the first round, with 4 games (since 2^3 teams, first phase has 2^(3-1) = 4 games). Then the second phase has 2 games, then the third phase has 1 game. \n\nThe key idea is that for each phase, the way teams are paired and which ones advance depends on the rule for that phase. \n\nBut since the permutation p is arbitrary (as long as it's a permutation), we need to find for each x, whether there's a way to assign the other teams' skill levels such that x can reach the final by winning each round according to the rules.\n\nWait, but how does the pairing work? In each phase, the teams are paired in the order they were arranged in the previous rounds. For example, in the first phase, the teams are paired as 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. Then in the next phase, the winners are arranged in the same order, so the first two winners play each other, then the next two, etc. \n\nBut since the permutation p is arbitrary, the initial arrangement of teams can be chosen. Wait no, the problem says that the permutation p is given, but we are to find x such that there exists some permutation p where x is the winner. So, the permutation p can be arranged in any way, but the tournament structure (pairing) is fixed based on the initial order of the teams. Wait, no. Wait, the initial pairing is based on the order of the teams. For example, the first phase pairs team 1 vs team 2, etc. But the permutation p defines which team is which. So, for example, if the permutation p is such that the first team (position 1) has skill level 5, the second team (position 2) has skill level 3, then in the first phase, those two would play. \n\nBut since we can choose any permutation p, we can arrange the initial positions of the teams in such a way that x can win. So our goal is to find all x for which there exists a way to arrange the initial positions (i.e., the permutation) such that x can win through each round according to the rules in s.\n\nSo, how can we model the possible ranges of x's that can be champions?\n\nAn approach is to think about for each round, what is the minimal and maximal possible skill level that can reach the next round. But since the rules vary per round, perhaps we can model for each round (level) what the possible range of values is that can reach that level.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Let's consider that in order for x to be the champion, it must win in each of the n rounds. Each round has a certain rule (higher or lower skill wins). For each round, the x must be able to beat its opponent in that round, given the rule.\n\nBut the opponents depend on how the teams are arranged. However, since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can model for each round what constraints are on x's value.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of rounds. Let's say the tournament has n rounds. For example, when n=3, there are 3 rounds. The first round (phase 1) has 4 games, the second (phase 2) has 2, the third (phase 3) has 1.\n\nIn each round, the teams are grouped into pairs, and the winner proceeds. For each round, the rule (s[i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can win a tournament based on the given string `s` that dictates the rules for each phase of the tournament. The tournament structure is such that each phase halves the number of teams until a single champion remains.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of `n` phases, each with `2^(n-i)` games where `i` is the phase index (starting from 1). Each phase determines the winner based on whether the higher or lower skill level wins, as specified by the string `s`.\n\n2. **Range Calculation**: For each phase, we calculate the range of possible skill levels that can reach the final round. This involves considering both the minimum and maximum values that can progress through each phase based on the rules provided in `s`.\n\n3. **Recursive Range Adjustment**: Starting from the last phase and moving backwards, we adjust the ranges of possible values. If a phase requires the higher skill level to win, the range is adjusted to include higher values. Conversely, if a phase requires the lower skill level to win, the range includes lower values.\n\n4. **Determine Winning Skills**: After processing all phases, the valid skill levels that can be champions are those within the final adjusted range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    # Initialize the range for the final round (last phase)\n    # Initially, the range is [1, 2^n]\n    low = 1\n    high = (1 << n)  # 2^n\n    \n    # Process each phase from last to first\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        phase_rule = s[i]\n        num_teams = (1 << (n - i))  # 2^(n - i) teams in this phase's bracket\n        # For each round, the number of teams is halved, so the number of matches is half\n        # We need to find the range of values that can survive this phase\n        if phase_rule == '1':\n            # Higher skill wins.

If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), the range is adjusted to the upper half. If the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), the range is adjusted to the lower half.\n4. **Result Collection**: After processing all phases, the valid skill levels that can be champions are those within the final adjusted range, which is printed as the result.",
