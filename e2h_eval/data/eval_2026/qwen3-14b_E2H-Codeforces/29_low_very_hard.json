Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If we naively process each query by replacing all occurrences of di in the string, that could be O(n * len(s)) which might be too slow for large cases. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, right. Because each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can track how each original digit contributes to the final value. Because if a substitution is done later, it might override earlier ones. Wait, no. The queries are processed in order. So, for example, if first we replace '2' with '00', then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's would become '00' and then those 0s become '11'. So the order matters.\n\nBut trying to simulate the substitutions directly on the string would be too slow if the string is large and there are many substitutions. For example, if each substitution replaces a digit with a long string, after several steps, the string could become very long, leading to O(n * m) time where m is the length of the string, which might be impossible for 1e5 operations.\n\nSo we need a way to represent the transformations without actually expanding the string each time. Let me think about using some kind of mapping for each digit, tracking what it expands to. But since substitutions can be applied multiple times, we need to track for each digit, what it's currently mapped to. However, when a substitution is applied, it's replacing all instances of a digit with another string. So, for example, if we have a mapping where '2' maps to 'a', and then later 'a' is replaced (but wait, the queries are only replacing digits, not other characters. So the queries are only replacing single digits with some string. So, the substitutions are only for digits. So, if during substitution, a digit is replaced by a string that contains other digits, which may be replaced in future queries.\n\nAh, so the key here is that each substitution replaces a digit (say, d) with a string (t). So, when processing the queries, for each digit, we can track what it's currently expanded to. However, since substitutions can be applied in sequence, we need to track for each digit, the expansion that would result from applying all the substitutions up to that point.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of it as a dynamic process. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a query comes in, say 'd -> t', we need to update the mapping for d. But if t contains other digits that have their own mappings, then when expanding, those digits would also be expanded. Wait, but the substitutions are applied in order. So, when a query is processed, all instances of d in the current string are replaced with t. However, t can contain digits that were previously substituted. But the problem is that when we do substitutions, they affect the current state of the string. So, if we have a mapping for each digit, which represents what it would expand to when all substitutions up to that point are applied, then perhaps we can model this with some kind of memoization.\n\nWait, here's an idea: for each digit, we can keep track of what it expands to. But when a substitution is made, we need to replace the current mapping for that digit. However, if the new substitution's ti contains digits that have their own mappings, then when we expand, those digits would be replaced as well. So, for example, suppose we have:\n\nInitially, all digits map to themselves.\n\nFirst query: 2 → 00. Now, the mapping for 2 is '00'.\n\nSecond query: 0 → '1'. Now, when we look at the mapping for 2, it's '00', but since 0 is now mapped to '1', the expansion of 2 would be '11'.\n\nSo, the problem is that when we update the mapping for a digit, we need to ensure that any existing mappings that include that digit are updated accordingly. But that seems complex. However, if we process substitutions in reverse order, perhaps we can find a way to compute the final value. Wait, no. Because substitutions are processed in order. For example, if we have a substitution for 0, then a substitution for 2 that uses 0, then the substitution for 2 would use the current value of 0. So, the order is important.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model for each digit, the expansion as a string, but whenever we perform a substitution, we replace the digit's expansion with the",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle multiple substitution queries on a string and compute the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The challenge is to avoid directly expanding the string repeatedly, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Mapping**: Maintain a mapping for each digit (from '0' to '9') that represents what it expands to after all substitutions applied so far.\n2. **Reverse Processing**: Instead of processing substitutions in the given order, we process them in reverse.
