Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is to take the first two strings, concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in the concatenated string matches exactly with the count in the third string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to use the Counter class from collections. For example, for the guest and host names, combine them into one string, create a Counter for that. Then create a Counter for the pile. Then compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each character. So if the counts are same, then it's possible to rearrange the letters.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Create a Counter for this concatenated string.\n4. Create a Counter for the third line (the pile).\n5. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length of guest and host is different from the pile's length? For example, if guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → yes. But if pile is \"A\", then lengths differ, so automatically no.\n\nSo, perhaps first check if the total length of guest + host equals the length of the pile. If not, immediately return NO. Otherwise, proceed to check the counts.\n\nBut even if the lengths are same, the counts may differ. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" → yes. But if pile is \"AB\", then lengths are same but counts differ.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCheck if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n\nElse, check if the combined counts of guest and host match the counts of pile.\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead three lines: guest, host, pile.\n\nThen:\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    check if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile)\n\nBut for Python, the Counter is from collections.\n\nSo, code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nThen, read the three lines.\n\nBut how to read them? The input is three lines. So, perhaps:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where the combined string has a certain count, but the pile has the same count? For example, if combined is \"AAB\" and pile is \"ABA\", then the Counters would be same. So yes.\n\nYes, this approach should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines are:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's check the length. Let me count:\n\nFirst line: SANTACLAUS is 10 letters? Let's see:\n\nS A N T A C L A U S → 10 letters.\n\nSecond line: DEDMOROZ → D E D M O R O Z → 8 letters. Total combined is 18 letters.\n\nThird line: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let's count letters. Well, the sample says that it's correct. So the code would check that the Counter of combined equals that of the pile.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's see the length.\n\nPAPAINOEL is 9 letters. JOULUPUKKI is 10 letters. Total 19. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count letters. Let me see:\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters. Let me think:\n\nBut perhaps the code would catch that. For example, the combined string has a certain count. Let's say the pile has an extra L and missing a P.\n\nIn the note, it says that in the second sample, the pile is missing a P and has an extra L. So the code would compare the counts and find they are different, thus outputting NO.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nBABBONATALE\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nCombined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. Let's check the length. Let me count:\n\nBABBONATALE is 10 letters (B A B B O N A T A L E → 11? Wait, let me count again. B A B B O N A T A L E → that's 11 letters. FATHERCHRISTMAS is F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → 14 letters. Total 25 letters. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nBut the note says that there's an extra L. So the code would check that the counts are different.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nTest case where all are empty? But according to the problem statement, all lines are non-empty. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when the combined string is empty? No, since the input lines are non-empty.\n\nAnother case: guest and host have same letters as pile, but in different order. The code would return yes.\n\nAnother case: pile has same letters but with different counts. For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" → yes. If pile is \"A\", then len is different, so no.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut need to read three lines. However, sometimes when reading input via input(), there might be trailing newlines or spaces? But the problem says that all lines are not empty and consist of uppercase letters. So the .strip() is not needed? Or perhaps better to use .strip() to remove any leading/trailing whitespace, but according to the problem statement, the input lines are correct. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input may have trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, the input consists of three lines with only uppercase letters. So perhaps using input().strip() is safe.\n\nWait, but in the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nBut in reality, the input is three lines. So for example, the first test case's three lines are:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo, when reading via input(), each input() call would read a line, and the \\n is stripped. So using input().strip() may be unnecessary. However, perhaps the problem's input may have leading or trailing whitespaces? But according to the problem statement, the input lines consist of only uppercase letters and are not empty. So perhaps using input().strip() is redundant. However, perhaps better to read the lines as input().strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespaces, even though the problem says they are not present.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps just read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut in Python, the input() function reads until the newline, which is stripped. So for example, if the line is \"ABC\\n\", input() would return \"ABC\".\n\nSo perhaps, the code can be written as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nBut maybe even without the .strip(), but perhaps better to use it.\n\nNow, code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the combined string has the same length as the pile, but different characters? For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"C\". Then the code would check the Counter, which would have {'A':1, 'B':1} vs {'C':1}, which are different, so output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nThis code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's check the length.\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S) → 10 letters.\n\nDEDMOROZ is D E D M O R O Z → 8 letters. Total 18 letters.\n\nThe pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's count letters:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → Let me count the letters. Let me check:\n\nBut perhaps the code will compare the counts correctly. So the code returns YES.\n\nSample 2:\n\nPAPAINOEL (length 9?), JOULUPUKKI (length 10?), pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI (length 20? Let me check:\n\nPAPAINOEL is 9 letters: P A P A I N O E L → 9 letters?\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nP A P A I N O E L → that's 9 letters. JOULUPUKKI is J O U L U P U K K I → 10 letters. Combined length is 19. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → Let's count letters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → Let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nBut perhaps the length is 19? Let me count:\n\nJ (1), O (2), U (3), L (4), N (5), A (6), P (7), A (8), O (9), I (10), L (11), E (12), L (13), U (14), P (15), U (16), K (17), K (18), I (19). Yes, 19 letters. So the code proceeds to compare the counts.\n\nIn the note, it says that the pile is missing a P and has an extra L. So in the combined string, the count of P is 2 (from PAPAINOEL: P appears twice, and JOULUPUKKI has one P?), let me check:\n\nOriginal guest is PAPAINOEL. Let's count letters:\n\nP: 2 (positions 0 and 2)\n\nA: 2 (positions 1 and 3)\n\nI: 1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nHost is JOULUPUKKI:\n\nLetters: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nSo P appears once here. So combined P count is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nIn the pile, the sample says that there is a missing P. So the pile's count for P is 2? Let me see the pile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the number of P's in the pile:\n\nLooking at the string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nLooking for P's: there is a P at position 6 (assuming 0-based), then another P at position 14. So two P's. So combined has 3, pile has 2. Therefore, the Counter would differ, hence output NO.\n\nThus, the code would return NO for sample 2.\n\nSample 3: the pile has an extra L. So the code would detect that.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code-wise, this should be correct.\n\nBut in Python, the Counter is a subclass of dict, so comparing two Counters with == would check if all counts are same.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's write the code as per the problem's instructions.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three lines. So the code reads three lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of three elements, but that's probably for the example. The actual input is three lines.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, and read from stdin, output to stdout.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces? But according to the problem statement, the input lines are not empty and consist of uppercase letters only. So the .strip() is not needed. But perhaps using it is safer. For example, if there's a trailing newline or space, but the problem says that the input lines are correct. However, in programming competitions, sometimes the input may have trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, the input is correct. So perhaps it's better to not use .strip().\n\nWait, but the input is given as three lines. For example, if the guest's name is \"A\", then input().strip() would return \"A\", which is correct. But if the input line has leading or trailing whitespace, then the problem statement says that it's not the case. So perhaps the code can read as:\n\nguest = input()\n\nBut in practice, when you read via input(), it reads the entire line except the trailing newline. So if the line is \"SANTACLAUS\\n\", then input() returns \"SANTACLAUS\".\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input lines are correct. So perhaps using input().strip() is unnecessary. However, perhaps the problem's input may have leading or trailing whitespaces. But according to the problem statement, the input consists of only uppercase letters and no other characters. So, perhaps the code can read as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input is correct. So maybe the code can read without stripping. However, to avoid any issues, perhaps using .strip() is better.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ...]\n\nWhich suggests that each line is read as a separate input. So for example, the first line is 'SANTACLAUS', the second is 'DEDMOROZ', etc.\n\nBut in code, the input is read as three lines. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be as written.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFor the first sample input, the code returns YES, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when the pile is exactly the combination. So code returns YES.\n\nAnother test case where the lengths are same but counts differ. For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES. If pile is \"AA\", then len is same, but counts differ → NO.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Length Check**: First, check if the combined length of the guest and host names matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Character Count Comparison**: Use a character counter to compare the frequency of each character in the combined string of the guest and host names with the frequency of characters in the pile. If both counters match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, ensuring that each line is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Combined Length Check**: By concatenating the guest and host names, we check if their combined length matches the length of the pile. This is a quick check to eliminate cases where the number of characters does not match.\n- **Character Frequency Comparison**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile. If these counts match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, otherwise, it cannot.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both the length and character composition, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
