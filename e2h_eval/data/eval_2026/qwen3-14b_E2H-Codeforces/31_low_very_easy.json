Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we want the minimal number of cards to reach the total sum of zero.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. Then, the required sum from the new cards is -S. Because the total sum (original sum plus new sum) should be zero. So the new cards must add up to -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimal number of cards needed to get a sum of T = -S, where each card can contribute between -x and x. \n\nSo how do we find the minimal number of cards? Let's think about the maximum possible sum per card. For example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute at most x. So the minimal number of cards would be ceiling(T / x). But wait, since each card can be as high as x, but also as low as -x. However, since we want to reach T, which is a certain value, we need to find the minimal number of cards that can sum up to T. \n\nWait, but the problem allows us to use any combination of numbers. So for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then each card can contribute up to 2. So 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2+2+1=5. But since the cards can be any numbers, but each can be between -x and x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but considering that if T is exactly divisible by x, then it's T/x. Otherwise, it's (T//x) + 1. Wait, but that's for when T is positive. Similarly, if T is negative, then the same applies, because you can use negative numbers. But since the absolute value is what matters here.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take T as the target sum. The minimal number of cards required is the minimal k such that k * x >= |T|. Because each card can contribute up to x in absolute value. So for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 2*2=4 <5, but 3*2=6 >=5. So k=3. Similarly, if T is 4 and x is 2, then 2 cards are enough. \n\nSo the formula is ceil( |T| / x ). But since T can be positive or negative, but we take absolute value. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n2. Compute T = -S. This is the sum that the new cards must contribute.\n3. If T is zero, then no cards are needed. So answer is 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach T, which is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, let me check with examples.\n\nLet's look at the first sample input. \n\nSample Input 1:\n3 2\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum S is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. Divided by x=2 gives 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 3\n-2 -2\n\nSum S is -4. T is 4. |T|=4. x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333..., so ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: suppose T is 5 and x is 2. Then 5/2 is 2.5, ceil is 3. So 3 cards. Correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 0. Then 0 cards. \n\nBut what if T is 3 and x is 3? Then 3/3 is 1. So one card. Correct.\n\nWhat if T is 1 and x is 1? Then 1/1 is 1. So one card.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards. Then compute T as -sum. If T is zero, return 0. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( abs(T) / x )\n\nBut how to compute ceil in Python?\n\nIn Python, for positive numbers, ceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b - 1) // b.\n\nSo for example, 5 / 2 is",
