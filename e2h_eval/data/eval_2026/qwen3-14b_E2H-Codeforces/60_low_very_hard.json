Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find, after each modification to the string S, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code. And we have to consider that certain Morse code strings are invalid (the four given ones). \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the substrings translate into valid letters. Each substring of S that is of length between 1 and 4 (since Morse codes for letters are up to 4 characters) can be checked if it's a valid code. But since the problem says that all possible 30 codes except those four are valid, we can check if the substring is in the set of allowed codes.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each string of 0s and 1s of length 1-4 translates into a distinct letter except those four. So for any substring of S that has length between 1 and 4, if it's not one of those four, then it's a valid letter. So for each possible substring of S (of length 1-4), we need to count how many times it appears as a substring, but considering that some of them are invalid.\n\nBut the problem isn't just counting the number of valid substrings. Because the question is about the number of non-empty sequences of letters. For example, if a substring is valid, then each occurrence of it contributes to a single sequence (like \"T\" for the substring \"1\"). But also, when multiple valid substrings are present in overlapping ways, like \"11\" can be split as \"1\" followed by \"1\", or as \"11\" itself. So each such split would contribute to different sequences. So the total number is the sum over all possible ways to split the string into valid Morse code letters.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the answer is the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S. Oh, wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read the note.\n\nIn the first sample, S is \"111\". The valid substrings are \"1\", \"11\", \"111\", and their combinations. But the note lists all possible sequences. For example, \"TT\" is considered because the substring \"11\" can be split into two 'T's (each 'T' is \"1\"), but also as one 'M' (which is \"11\"). So each occurrence of a valid substring is considered as a possible sequence. However, the problem says that the answer counts all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by some substring of S. So for example, every valid substring (i.e., a substring that is a valid Morse code) contributes to the count once. But also, any way to split a longer substring into multiple letters. Wait, no. Wait the note says that the answer is the number of non-empty sequences of letters that are represented by some substring of S. So each such sequence is a concatenation of Morse code letters. For example, the substring \"111\" can be split into \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\", or \"1\" + \"11\", or \"11\" + \"1\", or \"111\". So each of these splits corresponds to a different sequence of letters. But the problem says that the answer counts all such possible sequences. But how?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the note says that for the first sample, there are 7 sequences. Let's look at the note's explanation. The sequences are:\n\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\"TT\" (from \"11\")\n\"TM\" (from \"111\")\n\"MT\" (from \"111\")\n\"TTT\" (from \"111\")\n\nSo the count is 7. How does this come about? Because each occurrence of a substring that is a valid code is considered as a possible sequence. But also, when there are multiple ways to split a longer substring into valid codes. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split into \"1\"+\"1\", which is a sequence of two letters. So the count is not just the number of valid substrings, but the number of ways to split the entire string into valid Morse codes. Wait, no. Because the problem states that the sequences are represented with some substring of S. So for example, the substring \"11\" can be split into two letters (two Ts) or one M. Each of these is a different sequence. Therefore, each valid substring (like \"11\") contributes to the count once for each possible way of splitting it into valid Morse codes. Wait, no. Because the problem says that the sequences are represented with some substring of S. So for example, the substring \"11\" is a valid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code. The Morse code strings are represented using '0' for dots and '1' for dashes, with certain invalid codes given.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: Maintain a set of valid Morse code strings. These are all binary strings of length 1 to 4, excluding the four invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid sequences that can be formed up to each position in the string `S`.\n3. **Efficient Updates**: After each character is appended to `S`, update the DP array to reflect new valid sequences that can be formed by considering substrings ending at the current position.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the numbers can be very large, use modulo $10^9 + 7$ to keep results within bounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    operations = input[1:]\n    \n    # Precompute valid Morse codes\n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    valid = set()\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        for bits in range(2**length):\n            s = bin(bits)[2:].zfill(length)\n            if s not in invalid:\n                valid.add(s)\n    \n    S = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # dp[i] is the number of valid sequences up to i-th character\n    dp[0] = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        c = operations[i - 1]\n        S.append(c)\n        current_len = len(S)\n        \n        # Check all possible substrings ending at current position\n        # which have lengths from 1 to 4\n        total = 0\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if current_len - l >= 0:\n                substring = ''.join(S[current_len - l:current_len])\n                if substring in valid:\n                    total += 1\n                    # Add the number of ways to form sequences ending before this substring\n                    if current_len - l > 0:\n                        total += dp[current_len - l]\n                    total %= MOD\n        \n        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + total) % MOD\n        print(dp[i])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations and the sequence of operations.\n2. **Valid Morse Codes**: A set of valid Morse codes is precomputed by generating all binary strings of lengths 1 to 4 and excluding the four invalid ones.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array keeps track of the number of valid sequences up to each position in the string `S`.\n4. **Updating DP Array**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible substrings ending at the current position (lengths 1 to 4). If a substring is valid, update the count of valid sequences by considering both the new valid substring and sequences formed by extending previous valid sequences.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Results are taken modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of valid sequences after each modification to the string `S`, leveraging dynamic programming for optimal performance.",
