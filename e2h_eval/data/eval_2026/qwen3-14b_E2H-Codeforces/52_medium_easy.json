Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burnt-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take 'b' of them to make a new one. And this new candle can be used again, right? So it's like a process where we have to keep track of how many candles are available to burn, including those made from the remains.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break that down:\n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He burns them all, which takes 4 hours. Now he has 4 burnt candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So he burns those 2, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burnt ones. He can make 2 / 2 = 1 new candle. Burn that, adding 1 hour. Now he has 1 burnt candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Output is 8. Let's see:\n\nStart with 6. Burn them all: 6 hours. Now 6 burnt. Make 6/3 = 2 new. Burn those: 2 hours. Now 2 burnt. Can't make any more (since 2 < 3). Wait, but wait. Wait, 2 is less than 3, so no. But the total is 6+2=8. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of burnt candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nThe idea is that each time you burn a candle, you get a burnt one. Then, whenever you have enough burnt ones, you can make new ones. But each time you make a new candle, you use up 'b' burnt ones and get 1 new candle. Which, when burned, will add another hour and produce another burnt one.\n\nSo perhaps the way to model this is:\n\n- Start with 'a' candles. The total hours is initially 'a'.\n\n- Then, we have 'a' burnt candles. Then, while we can make new candles:\n\n   - Take as many as possible from the burnt ones. For example, if we have 'c' burnt candles, then the number of new candles is c // b. \n\n   - Add that number to the total hours.\n\n   - Then, the new number of burnt candles is (c % b) + (number of new candles). Because each new candle is burned, adding 1 to the burnt count.\n\nWait, no. Because when you make new candles, you take 'b' burnt ones to make 1 new. So the number of burnt ones after making is (original burnt count) - (number of new candles * b) + (number of new candles). Because each new candle is burned, so after being made, they are burned, adding 1 to the burnt count.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\nEach time you have some number of burnt candles. Let's say you have 'c' burnt candles. You can make 'c // b' new candles. Each of those new candles is then burned, which adds 'c//b' hours. But when you burn those new candles, they become burnt again. So the new number of burnt candles is (c % b) + (c//b).\n\nBecause:\n\nOriginal burnt candles: c.\n\nWe take (c // b) * b of them to make (c//b) new candles. So remaining burnt is c - (c//b)*b = c % b. Then, after burning the new candles, you have (c//b) more burnt ones. So total is (c % b) + (c//b).\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burnt // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new_candles\n\nSo this loop continues until the burnt count is less than b.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo for example, in the first case:\n\na = 4, b = 2.\n\ntotal_hours starts as 4.\n\nburnt = 4.\n\nLoop:\n\nburnt >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 = 2. total becomes 4+2=6.\n\nburnt is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2.\n\nAgain, loop:\n\nnew_candles = 2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7.\n\nburnt is 0 + 1 = 1. Now less than 2. Exit loop.\n\nTotal is 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal starts as 6. burnt=6.\n\nLoop: 6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. burnt is 6%3=0 + 2 = 2. Now 2 <3. Exit. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose a=5, b=5. Then:\n\ntotal starts at 5. burnt=5.\n\nloop: 5//5=1. total becomes 6. burnt is 0 + 1 =1. exit. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3.\n\nInitial total is 5. burnt=5.\n\nFirst iteration: 5//3=1. total becomes 6. burnt is 5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nAgain, 3//3=1. total becomes 7. burnt is 0 +1=1. exit. So total is 7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. So the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead a and b. Then, total is a. burnt is a. Then loop while burnt >=b. In each step, compute new_candles = burnt // b. add to total. Then burnt = (burnt % b) + new_candles.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the input line as two integers a and b.\n\nThen:\n\ntotal = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burnt // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nFor example, a=1, b=2. Then total is 1. Since burnt is 1, which is less than 2. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Then total starts as 2. burnt is 2. new_candles is 1. total becomes 3. burnt is 0 +1 =1. exit. So output is 3.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=3. total is 3. burnt is 3. new_candles=1. total 4. burnt is 0 +1=1. exit. So output is 4.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5. As before, output 6.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=3. Let's see:\n\nInitial total is 10. burnt=10.\n\nFirst iteration: 10//3=3. total is 13. burnt is 10%3=1 +3=4.\n\nSecond iteration: 4//3=1. total is 14. burnt is 4%3=1 +1=2. exit. So total 14.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read from stdin. The input is a single line with two integers. So for example, the sample input is ['4 2', '6 3'] but in the problem description, the input is given as a single line. Wait, the input is two integers. Wait, the input is a single line containing two integers. So for example, for the first sample input, the input is \"4 2\", and the output is 7. So the code should read a line, split into two integers.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen proceed as above.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute total = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nloop while burnt >=b:\n\n   new_candles = burnt // b\n\n   total += new_candles\n\n   burnt = (burnt % b) + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: input 4 2:\n\ntotal =4, burnt=4.\n\nLoop:\n\nburnt >=2: yes.\n\nnew_candles=4//2=2. total becomes 6. burnt is 0 +2=2.\n\nAgain loop: new_candles=2//2=1. total 7. burnt is 0 +1=1. exit. Output 7. Correct.\n\nSample 2: input 6 3.\n\ntotal=6, burnt=6.\n\nnew_candles=6//3=2. total=8. burnt is 0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=3. Output is 7. Correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input, process, etc.\n\nSo the Python code is:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nburnt = a\n\nwhile burnt >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burnt // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    burnt = (burnt % b) + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n\nThat's it. That should work.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n",
