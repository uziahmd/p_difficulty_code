There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the task is to build houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. The profit for each house is the square of its height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that the tallest house in a certain interval [l_i, r_i] must be at most x_i. I need to maximize the total profit under these constraints.\n\nHmm. How to approach this? Since n, h, m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible. But even with n=50, trying all possibilities for each house would be h^50, which is way too big. So brute force isn't feasible here.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem where we need to find the maximum sum of squares under constraints that for each restriction, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. How can we model this?\n\nAnother thought: For each position, the maximum possible height is h, but some restrictions may lower that. However, the problem is that the restrictions are about ranges. For example, a restriction on [1,3] saying max is 2 would mean that all three houses in that range can't exceed 2. But if there's another restriction on [2,2] with a higher x, then that's okay.\n\nBut how do we find the maximum heights for each house that satisfy all the constraints?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each house, the maximum possible height it can have is the minimum of h and all the x_i's from restrictions that cover that house. But that's not correct because the restrictions apply to ranges. For example, a restriction that says the max in [1,3] is 2 would imply that each of the houses 1,2,3 can't be higher than 2. But if there's a restriction on [1,1] with x=3, then house 1 can be up to 3, but the other two can't be higher than 2. But how to find for each house the maximum possible value that it can take, considering all the restrictions that apply to it.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not sufficient. Because a restriction on a range [l, r] says that the maximum in that range is <= x. Which means that each individual house in that range can be at most x. Because if any house in the range is higher than x, then the max would be higher than x. So, for each restriction, all the houses in [l_i, r_i] can't have a height higher than x_i. So, for each house j, the maximum possible height it can have is the minimum between h and all x_i's from restrictions where j is in [l_i, r_i]. But that's not entirely accurate. Because suppose there are two restrictions: one on [1,2] with x=3, and another on [2,3] with x=2. Then for house 2, the maximum allowed is min(3, 2) = 2. For house 1, only the first restriction applies, so x=3. For house 3, only the second restriction applies, so x=2. So, in this case, the maximum for each house is determined by the minimum of all x_i's that cover that house.\n\nBut that seems to be the case. Because for any house j, if there is a restriction that covers j (i.e., j is in [l_i, r_i]) with x_i, then the maximum height of j can't exceed x_i. Therefore, the maximum possible height for j is the minimum of h and all x_i's from restrictions that include j in their interval. Because if there are multiple restrictions that cover j, each of them imposes an upper bound on j's height. So the tightest of those bounds is the minimum of all those x_i's. But also, the global h is an upper bound. So for each house j, the maximum possible height is min( h, min{ x_i | restrictions that include j } )\n\nWait, but that's only if the restrictions are applied directly to the house. However, perhaps there's a scenario where the restrictions don't directly apply to the house but still affect it. For example, consider a restriction that says the max in [1,3] must be <= 2. Then, house 2 can be 2, but if there's no restriction on house 2 itself, but if there's another restriction on [2,2] with x=3, then house 2 can be 3. But that would violate the first restriction. Because the max in [1,3] would be 3, which is higher than 2.\n\nAh, right! So my previous reasoning is incorrect. Because if there's a restriction on a range, that implies that all houses in that range can't exceed x_i. Because if any of them does, then the maximum would be higher than x_i. Therefore, for each restriction [l_i, r_i, x_i], all houses in l_i to r_i must have height <= x_i. So for each house j, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between h and all x_i's from restrictions that include j in their interval. Because each such restriction requires that j's height is <= x_i.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute for each house j, the maximum possible height it can have, given all the restrictions that cover it, then I can set each house to that maximum possible height, and that would give the maximum total profit.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that for each house j, I compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that cover j. Let's call this value cap[j]. Then, the maximum height for j is min(h, cap[j]). But if there are no restrictions covering j, then cap[j] is h. Then, setting each house to that maximum would satisfy all restrictions. Because for any restriction [l_i, r_i, x_i], all houses in that interval are capped at x_i (since that restriction is part of the ones considered for their cap). Therefore, the maximum in that interval would be <= x_i.\n\nSo that seems correct. So the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each house j, compute the minimum x_i among all restrictions that include j in their interval. Then, the maximum possible height for j is min( h, that minimum ). Then, the total profit is sum( (height_j)^2 ), where height_j is that value.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple restrictions that cover j. For example, suppose there is a restriction [1,3] with x=2, and another restriction [1,1] with x=3. Then, for j=1, the minimum x_i is 2 (from the first restriction), so the cap is 2. So even though the second restriction allows x=3, the first restriction requires that j=1's height is <= 2. So yes, the cap for j=1 is 2. So the approach is correct.\n\nBut then why in the first example, the answer is 1+3^2 + 2^2 = 14. Let's check.\n\nIn the first example input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1-1: x=1\n\n2-2: x=3\n\n3-3: x=2.\n\nSo for each house:\n\nHouse 1: cap is 1 (from restriction 1). So height is 1.\n\nHouse 2: cap is 3 (from restriction 2). So height 3.\n\nHouse 3: cap is 2 (restriction 3). So 2. Sum squares is 1 +9 +4 =14. Which matches the example. So that works.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2-3: x=8\n\n3-4: x=7.\n\nSo for each house:\n\nHouse 1: no restrictions. So cap is h=10.\n\nHouse 2: covered by restriction 1 (x=8). So cap is 8.\n\nHouse 3: covered by both restrictions. So min(8,7) =7.\n\nHouse 4: covered by restriction 2 (x=7). So cap is 7.\n\nSo the heights are [10,8,7,7]. Sum squares is 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Which matches the example. So this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each house, find the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include that house. Then, the maximum height for that house is min( h, that minimal x_i ). Then sum the squares.\n\nWait, but how do I compute that minimal x_i for each house?\n\nSo for each house j (from 1 to n), collect all restrictions where l_i <= j <= r_i. Then take the minimum x_i among those. If there are no such restrictions, then the cap is h.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Initialize for each house j, cap[j] = h.\n\n- For each restriction (l_i, r_i, x_i):\n\n   - For each house j in l_i to r_i:\n\n      - if x_i is less than current cap[j], update cap[j] to x_i.\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, the cap for each house is the minimal x_i that applies to it. Then the maximum profit is sum( (cap[j])^2 for j in 1..n )\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because for a restriction [l_i, r_i, x_i], the maximum in that interval must be <= x_i. However, if for each house in that interval, their cap is <= x_i, then the maximum in the interval is <= x_i. So the approach of taking for each house the minimal x_i across all restrictions that cover it ensures that for each restriction, all houses in its interval have cap <= x_i. Therefore, the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. So the constraints are satisfied.\n\nYes. So this approach is correct.\n\nSo the problem is straightforward once you realize that each restriction imposes that all houses in [l_i, r_i] can't be higher than x_i. Therefore, for each house, the cap is the minimum between h and all x_i's of the restrictions that cover it. Then, the answer is sum of squares of these caps.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize an array caps of size n, initialized to h.\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions:\n\n   l, r, x = ... \n\n   for j in l-1 to r-1 (assuming zero-based array):\n\n      if caps[j] > x:\n\n          caps[j] = x\n\nThen sum the squares of the elements in caps.\n\nWait, but why does this work? Because for each restriction, we are making sure that all houses in [l_i, r_i] have their cap set to the minimum between their current cap and x_i. So, after processing all restrictions, each house's cap is the minimal x_i among all restrictions that cover it. So that's correct.\n\nYes. So this approach should work.\n\nLet me test it against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\ncaps = [3,3,3]\n\nProcess first restriction (1,1,1):\n\nfor j=0 (since l=1, r=1):\n\ncaps[0] = min(3, 1) = 1.\n\ncaps now [1,3,3]\n\nSecond restriction (2,2,3): j=1. caps[1] is 3, which is same as x=3. No change.\n\nThird restriction (3,3,2): j=2. caps[2] = min(3, 2) = 2. So caps [1,3,2]. Sum squares 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\ncaps = [10,10,10,10]\n\nFirst restriction: l=2, r=3, x=8. So j=1 and 2 (since 2-1=1, 3-1=2? Wait, depends on how the code is written. Let's think:\n\nIf the code uses 0-based indexes, then for l_i and r_i, which are 1-based, the code would loop from l_i-1 to r_i-1.\n\nSo for l=2, r=3, the indexes are 1 and 2 (since 2-1=1, 3-1=2). So for j in 1 to 2 (inclusive). So for those positions, set caps[j] to min(current value, 8).\n\nOriginal caps is [10,10,10,10]. After processing this restriction, caps becomes [10, 8, 8, 10].\n\nThen the next restriction is l=3, r=4, x=7. So indexes 2 and 3. For j=2 and 3. So:\n\ncaps[2] = min(8,7) =7.\n\ncaps[3] = min(10,7) =7.\n\nSo caps becomes [10,8,7,7]. Sum squares is 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps:\n\nRead input. The input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first line says:\n\nInput is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m.\n\nThen m lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nWait, the input seems to be two separate test cases. So the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, but looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then, the output is the desired result.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two examples. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of two test cases. But how is the input structured?\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement's sample input:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['14', '262']\n\nSo this suggests that the actual input is multiple test cases. But how is that structured? Like, the first line is the number of test cases? Or is it that each test case is given as a separate input?\n\nWait, the original problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the input is for a single test case. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases, but the problem statement's input description is for a single test case.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases. But the actual input for the problem is a single test case. However, in the sample input, the user has given two test cases. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each of which is given as per the input format.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. So maybe the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description doesn't mention that. So perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list of test cases, but the actual input for the code is a single test case.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow.\n\nSample input shows:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nWhich seems to be two test cases. But how is that possible? Because the problem says that the input is for one test case. So perhaps the sample input is in a format that is not the actual input. Maybe the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case.\n\nBut in the problem's note, the first example's input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich is the first test case. The second example's input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nSo the sample input is two separate test cases. However, the problem statement's input format is for a single test case. So the code is supposed to process a single test case. But how does the sample input show two test cases? That's confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases for the code to process. However, the problem's input description says that the code should read a single test case. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem statement's input description is incomplete. Or perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the user's instruction says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. So in the sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how to know?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is given as two separate test cases, and the output is two answers. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each of which is processed as per the input format.\n\nBut the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m. So perhaps the code should read until EOF, processing each test case.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nSo, for example, the code could read all lines from stdin, split into test cases. But perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. This is a bit confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output, the first sample input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nThe output is 14.\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput is 262.\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWell, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. But the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m. So perhaps the code should read one test case. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. However, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. For example, perhaps the sample input is given as two separate test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each with their own n, h, m, etc.\n\nBut the problem statement's input description doesn't mention that. However, given the sample input, it's likely that the code needs to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. For example, the first line is the number of test cases T, then T test cases follow. But in this problem's sample input, there is no such T. So perhaps the code should read until EOF.\n\nSo, for example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing n, h, m. Then m lines of restrictions.\n\nBut how to split them? For example, in the sample input, the first test case has 3+1 lines (the first line is n,h,m, then 3 lines for m=3). The second test case has 1+2 lines (n=4, h=10, m=2, then two lines). So the code can read all lines, and process them in groups.\n\nBut in practice, for the code to read from stdin, perhaps the code can read all the lines, and process each test case by reading the first line, then m lines, then the next test case, etc.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, the standard way to read from stdin is using input() or sys.stdin.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, perhaps the code can read all the input at once, split into tokens, and process them accordingly.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the code should read a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But the problem's example shows that the code should output two lines for the two test cases.\n\nSo perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. So, the code needs to read all test cases, each of which is given as per the input format.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in the sample input, the first line is \"3 3 3\", then three lines of restrictions, then the next line is \"4 10 2\", then two lines of restrictions.\n\nSo the code can read all the lines, and process them as follows:\n\nRead all lines from input. Then, for each test case:\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m.\n\nThen read the next m lines as the restrictions.\n\nThen process the test case.\n\nThen repeat until all lines are processed.\n\nBut how to implement that in Python.\n\nOne way is to read all the input into a list, and process it step by step.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nimport sys\n\ndata = list(map(str.split, sys.stdin.read().splitlines()))\n\nThen, process data as a list of tokens.\n\nBut for each test case, the first element is the n, h, m. Then, the next m elements are the restrictions.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead all lines into a list. Then, process each test case by taking the first line as n, h, m. Then take the next m lines as the restrictions. Then, process and output, and then proceed with the remaining lines.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n, h, m from lines[idx]\n\n        n, h, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        # Now read m lines for restrictions\n\n        caps = [h] * n\n\n        for _ in range(m):\n\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n            idx +=1\n\n            # For each position in [l, r], update caps\n\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n\n                if caps[j] > x:\n\n                    caps[j] = x\n\n        total = sum( [c*c for c in caps] )\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case has m=3, and the next three lines are the restrictions. Then, for the next test case, idx is pointing to the next line.\n\nYes. This code would process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n, h, m. So this code would work for multiple test cases, which is probably what the sample input is showing.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, and the sample output shows two outputs. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should handle multiple test cases, each with their own n, h, m, and m restrictions.\n\nThus, the code above is correct.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample input lines are:\n\nLine 0: '3 3 3'\n\nLine 1: '1 1 1'\n\nLine 2: '2 2 3'\n\nLine 3: '3 3 2'\n\nLine 4: '4 10 2'\n\nLine 5: '2 3 8'\n\nLine 6: '3 4 7'\n\nProcessing first test case:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3. caps = [3,3,3].\n\nProcess each restriction:\n\nFirst restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1. So j ranges from 0 to 0 (since range(0, 1) is 0). caps[0] = 1.\n\nSecond restriction: l=2, r=2. j ranges from 1 to 1. caps[1] is 3, x=3: no change.\n\nThird restriction: l=3, r=3. j ranges from 2 to 2. caps[2] = 2. So caps is [1,3,2]. sum squares is 1+9+4=14. Printed.\n\nThen, idx is now 4. Next line is '4 10 2' → n=4, h=10, m=2. caps is [10,10,10,10].\n\nProcess m=2 restrictions:\n\nFirst restriction: l=2, r=3, x=8. So j from 1 to 2 (since range(2-1=1, 3) → 1, 2. So for j=1 and 2. caps[1] = min(10, 8) → 8. caps[2] = min(10, 8) → 8. So caps is [10,8,8,10].\n\nSecond restriction: l=3, r=4, x=7. j ranges from 2 to 3 (since r=4, so range(3-1=2, 4) → 2, 3. So for j=2 and 3. caps[2] is 8 → min(8,7)=7. caps[3] is 10 → min(10,7)=7. So caps becomes [10,8,7,7]. sum is 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262. Printed.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nTest case where there are no restrictions. Then, caps is [h, h, ...], sum is n * h².\n\nAnother case: overlapping restrictions. For example, a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, and another on [2,2] with x=3. The code will process the first restriction, setting all positions 0,1,2 to 2. Then the second restriction processes [2,2], which is j=1. caps[1] is 2, which is less than 3. So no change. So the caps are [2,2,2]. Which is correct, since the first restriction requires that the max in [1,3] is 2. So even though the second restriction allows 3 for position 2, it's overridden by the first restriction.\n\nAnother edge case: when a restriction's x_i is larger than h. For example, h=3, and a restriction on [1,1] with x=5. Then, caps[0] is min(3, 5) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: multiple restrictions on the same range. For example, two restrictions on [1,2], x=2 and x=3. The code will process both, and the caps for positions 0 and 1 will be min( h, 2 and 3). So the first restriction sets them to 2, and the second does nothing. So the caps are 2, 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a restriction that covers the entire range. For example, n=3, h=5, m=1, restriction [1,3, 4]. Then caps are [4,4,4]. Sum is 3*16=48.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the Python code should be written as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit from building houses on a street with given zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a maximum value h, and each restriction imposes a limit on the maximum height of houses within a specific range. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a given range must not exceed a certain height. This implies that every house within the specified range must be at most the given height.\n2. **Initialization**: Start by initializing the maximum possible height for each house to the global maximum height h.\n3. **Apply Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the maximum allowable height for each house in the specified range to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's height.\n4. **Calculate Profit**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the allowable heights for each house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n, h, m\n        n, h, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        caps = [h] * n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n            idx += 1\n            # Iterate through the range [l, r], 1-based to 0-based\n            for j in range(l-1, r):\n                if caps[j] > x:\n                    caps[j] = x\n        total = sum(c * c for c in caps)\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing. Each test case starts with reading the number of spots (n), maximum height (h), and the number of restrictions (m).\n2. **Initialization of Heights**: An array `caps` is initialized where each element starts with the maximum allowable height `h`.\n3. **Processing Restrictions**: For each restriction, iterate through the affected range of houses and update their maximum allowable height to be the minimum of their current value and the restriction's height.\n4. **Calculating Total Profit**: After applying all restrictions, the total profit is calculated by summing the squares of the values in the `caps` array, which gives the maximum possible profit under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the constraints efficiently. The complexity is manageable given the small input limits (up to 50 spots and restrictions), making this brute-force approach feasible.",
