Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need the minimal number of such cards.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. Then, the required sum for the new cards is -S. Because the total sum (original sum plus new sum) should be zero. So the new cards must sum up to -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimal number of cards needed to reach a sum of T (where T is -S), given that each card can contribute between -x and x.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal number of cards?\n\nLet me think. Let's take T as the target sum. We need to find the minimal k such that there exists some combination of k numbers (each between -x and x) that sum to T.\n\nWhat's the minimal k here?\n\nWell, each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, for the maximum possible contribution per card, the minimal k would be ceil( |T| / x ), but maybe there's some adjustment needed based on whether T is positive or negative.\n\nWait, but since each card can contribute between -x and x, the maximum absolute value per card is x. So, for example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards needed is ceiling(T / x). But wait, if T is exactly divisible by x, then it's T/x. Otherwise, it's (T//x) + 1. Similarly, if T is negative, then each card can contribute up to -x. But since we can take negative numbers, the same logic applies. For example, if T is -5 and x is 2, then the minimal number is 3 (since 2*2=4, which is less than 5, so you need three cards: -2, -2, -1, sum is -5). Wait, but the maximum per card is x. So for T being positive, the maximum per card is x. For T being negative, the maximum per card is x (but in the negative direction).\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if T is not zero. Because, for example, if T is 3 and x is 2, then |T| is 3. Divided by x (2) gives 1.5, so ceiling is 2. Which makes sense: two cards of 2 and 1 (but wait, the maximum is 2. So 2 + 1 is allowed? But the maximum is x. So yes. So the minimal number is 2. But if T is 3, x is 2, then the sum can be achieved with two cards (2 and 1). But if T is 4, then 2 cards (2 and 2). So yes, the formula seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 5 and x is 2. Then |T| is 5. 5/2 is 2.5, so ceil is 3. So 3 cards. Let's see: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. But each card can be up to 2. So yes. So 3 cards. So that works.\n\nBut what about when T is zero? Then no cards are needed. But in the problem statement, the initial sum might already be zero. So the answer is zero in that case.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards needed is:\n\nIf T is zero: 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the absolute value of T, divide by x, take the ceiling. But how to compute that in Python?\n\nBut wait, let's think again. Let me take an example. Suppose T is 5, x is 2. Then 5 divided by 2 is 2.5. Ceiling is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 4, x is 2. Then 4/2 is 2, so 2 cards.\n\nBut what if T is 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, ceil is 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut how to compute this in code?\n\nIn Python, the math.ceil function can be used. However, since we are dealing with integers, perhaps we can compute it as (abs(T) + x - 1) // x. Because for example:\n\nabs(T) = 5, x = 2: (5 + 2-1) // 2 = 6//2=3.\n\nabs(T) = 3, x=2: (3+1)/2=4//2=2.\n\nabs(T)=4, x=2: (4+1)/2=5//2=2.5 floored to 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes, that formula works. So the minimal number of cards is (abs(T) + x - 1) // x. But only if T is not zero.\n\nBut wait, let's check another example. Suppose T is 1 and x is 1. Then (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. Which is correct. One card of 1.\n\nAnother example: T is 0. Then 0 cards.\n\nBut what if T is 0 but the original sum is zero? Then the answer is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCompute the sum of the found cards. Let's call it S. Then T is -S. The required sum for the new cards is T.\n\nIf T is zero, then answer is zero.\n\nElse, compute the minimal number of cards as (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nWait, but what if T is negative? For example, T is -5, x is 2. Then abs(T) is 5. So same calculation as before. So the formula works regardless of the sign of T.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n\n2. Read the list of numbers.\n\n3. Compute S as the sum of the list.\n\n4. T is -S.\n\n5. If T is zero, output 0.\n\n6. Else, compute (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, let's look at the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So the required sum is -2. So the minimal number of cards is (abs(-2) + 2-1 ) // 2 = (2 +1)/2 = 3//2=1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2\n\nSum is -4. T is 4. So (4 +3-1)/3 = (6)/3=2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: if sum is 0, then output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: suppose sum is 5, x is 3. T is -5. So required sum is -5. The minimal cards would be (5 +3-1)/3 = 7/3=2.333 floored to 2? Wait, no, (5 +3-1) is 7, divided by 3 is 2.333, integer division in Python is 2. But 2 *3 =6. So 2 cards can contribute up to 6. But the required is 5. So possible: 3 and 2. So yes, two cards. So the formula works.\n\nBut what if T is 1 and x is 1? Then (1 +1-1)/1 =1, which is correct. So one card.\n\nAnother case: T is 1, x is 2. Then (1 +2-1)/2 = 2/2=1. Which is correct. One card of 1.\n\nBut what if T is 2, x is 2. Then (2 +2-1)/2 =3//2=1. Which is correct. One card of 2.\n\nSo this formula seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 3 and x is 2. Then the formula gives (3 +2-1)/2=4/2=2. Which is correct. Two cards: 2 and 1.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards. Then compute T = -sum.\n\nIf T is zero, return 0.\n\nElse, compute (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nBut why is this the case?\n\nBecause each card can contribute at most x towards the absolute value of T. So the minimal number is the ceiling of (abs(T)/x), which is equivalent to (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nsum_found = sum of the list.\n\ntarget = -sum_found.\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the target is negative? For example, target is -5, x is 2. Then abs(target) is 5, and the calculation is same as before. So yes.\n\nSo the code would handle that.\n\nBut let's check the second sample input.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2\n\nsum is -4. target is 4. So (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: sum is 0. Then target is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother example: sum is 1. Target is -1. So abs(target) is 1. x is 1. (1 +1-1)/1 =1. So 1 card. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if x is larger than the target?\n\nLike target is 3, x is 5. Then (3 +5-1)/5 = 7//5=1. Which is correct. One card of 3.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the target is zero? For example, sum_found is zero. Then the answer is zero. So that's handled.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All found cards sum to zero. Output 0.\n\nCase 2: sum is 0, but x is any value. Output 0.\n\nCase 3: sum is 1, x is 1. Then target is -1. So (1 +1-1)/1 =1. So 1 card. Correct.\n\nCase 4: sum is 1, x is 2. Then (1 +2-1)/2 = 2/2=1. So one card. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 3. target is -5. So abs(target) is 5. (5 +3-1)/3 =7//3=2. Which is correct. 3+2=5.\n\nAnother case: sum is 6, x is 3. target is -6. (6 +3-1)/3 = 8//3=2. 2 cards. 3+3=6. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 7, x is 3. (7 +3-1)/3 =9//3=3. 3 cards. 3+3+1=7. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nSo the code is simple. Now, let's implement it in Python.\n\nRead input: first line has n and x. Second line has n integers.\n\nIn Python, read from stdin. For example, the input could be read as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nsum_found = sum(nums)\n\ntarget = -sum_found\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nWait, but what if the target is zero? For example, sum_found is zero. Then output is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nInput is 3 2, then -1 1 2. Sum is -1 +1 +2 = 2. target is -2. So abs(target) is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: input is 2 3, -2 -2. sum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, 0. sum is 0. output 0.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, 1. sum is 1. target is -1. (1 +1-1)/1 =1. Output 1.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, -1. sum is -1. target is 1. (1 +1-1)/1 =1. Output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the target is zero but the sum is zero?\n\nYes, that's handled.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let's code it.\n",

This is because the total sum of all cards (found and new) must be zero.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula `ceil(|target| / x)`, which can be efficiently calculated using integer arithmetic as `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, x = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    nums = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    sum_found = sum(nums)\n    target = -sum_found\n    if target == 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print((abs(target) + x - 1) // x)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of found cards, the maximum absolute value on a card, and the list of numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine the target sum needed from the new cards.\n3. **Target Adjustment**: The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n4. **Zero Target Check**: If the target sum is zero, it means the sum of found cards is already zero, so no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, we efficiently compute the minimum number of cards required to achieve the target sum by considering the maximum contribution per card (x) and adjusting for ceiling division using `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of cards needed with optimal time complexity, leveraging simple arithmetic operations.",
