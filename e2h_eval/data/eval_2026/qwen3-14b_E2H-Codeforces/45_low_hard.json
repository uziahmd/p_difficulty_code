There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament with certain rules. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, the challenge is to model this and find the maximum possible games for the winner given n players.\n\nLet me think about examples first. For n=2, it's straightforward: one game, so answer 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the first game is between 1 and 2, then the winner (player 1) has 1 game. Then, player 3 hasn't played yet. So the next game is between 1 and 3. The difference in games played is 1-0 = 1, which is allowed. So that's two games. Hence output is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. The note says that the optimal way is to split into two matches first: (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4). Then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner (1) has two games. But why can't there be a scenario where the winner plays three games? Let's see. Suppose the winner plays three games. That would require that in each round, the opponent has a game count differing by at most one. Let's imagine:\n\nFirst game: player 1 vs 2. Player 1 wins (game count 1). Then, player 1 needs to play someone else. But for the next game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. Suppose player 1 plays against player 3. Then player 3 has 0 games. So after that, player 1 has 2 games. Then, the next opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But there's only player 4 left. How would they get to 1 or 2 games? Well, maybe player 4 had to play someone else first. But if there are four players, maybe there's a way to arrange the matches so that the winner plays three times. But according to the example, the answer is 2. So perhaps there's a constraint that makes this impossible.\n\nHmm. So what's the pattern here? Maybe the maximum number of games the winner can play is related to the Fibonacci sequence? Because in some similar problems, like the minimum number of games required for a player to reach a certain number of wins, Fibonacci numbers come into play.\n\nWait, let's think recursively. Suppose we want the winner to play as many games as possible. Each time the winner plays a game, they must have an opponent who has played either the same number of games as them, or one less. Let's say the winner has played k games. Then, the opponent in their k-th game must have played either k-1 or k games. But since the opponent has to have won all their previous games, that implies that the opponent's path to the final game must have been structured in a way that allows this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a binary tree where each node represents a game. The winner's path is the longest possible path from the root to a leaf. But the structure of the tree depends on the constraints.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For the winner to play m games, they must have defeated m opponents. Each of these opponents must have been in a subtree where their own number of games is such that when they faced the winner, the difference was at most one.\n\nLet me think of it as building the tournament in a way that allows the winner to play as many games as possible. For each game the winner plays, they need to have an opponent who has played either the same number of games or one less. So, for the first game, the winner has 0 games, and the opponent also 0. Then, after winning, they have 1 game. For the next game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. If the opponent has 1 game, that means they had to have played once before. So, that opponent must have had their own matches arranged in a way that allows that.\n\nThis seems like a recursive problem. Let's say f(m) is the minimum number of players required for the winner to play m games. Then, for the winner to play m games, they must have played m-1 games before, and then played one more. But the opponent in the m-th game must have played either m-1 or m-2 games. Wait, because the winner has played m-1 games before the m-th game. So, the opponent must have played either m-1 or m-2 games. But the opponent must have won all their previous games, so",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule that two players can only compete if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight here is to recognize that the problem can be approached using a recursive method based on the Fibonacci sequence. The idea is to determine the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games. This leads us to a recursive relation where the number of players needed for the winner to play `m` games is the sum of the players needed for the winner to play `m-1` games and `m-2` games. This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point due to the constraints of the problem.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef max_games(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0\n    # We need to find the maximum m such that f(m) <= n\n    # Where f(m) is the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play m games.\n    # f(1) = 2\n    # f(2) = 3\n    # f(m) = f(m-1) + f(m-2)\n    # So we precompute these values until f(m) exceeds n.\n    \n    # Let's compute the Fibonacci-like sequence\n    fib = [0, 2, 3]  # index 0: dummy, index 1: m=1, index 2: m=2\n    m = 2\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_val > n:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_val)\n        m += 1\n    # Now, find the largest m where fib[m] <= n\n    # The answer is m-1 if fib[m] exceeds n\n    # But check the last value\n    if fib[-1] <= n:\n        return len(fib) - 1\n    else:\n        # Find the largest m where fib[m] <=n\n        # We can binary search here, but since the list is small, linear search is okay\n        for i in range(len(fib)-1, 0, -1):\n            if fib[i] <= n:\n                return i - 1  # because fib[1] corresponds to m=1\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Recursive Relation Insight**: The problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games. This is derived from the constraint that each game the winner plays must have an opponent who has played either the same number of games or one less.\n2. **Precompute Values**: We precompute the sequence values up to the point where the value exceeds the input number `n`. This allows us to efficiently determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n3. **Determine Maximum Games**: By checking the precomputed values, we find the largest number of games `m` such that the minimum number of players required for `m` games does not exceed `n`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the result even for very large values of `n` (up to 10^18), leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence to maintain performance.",
