    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. And the occurrences can overlap. Hmm. So for example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings and track their occurrences. But since the maximum length is 100, maybe that's manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan: For each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. If no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nThe steps would be:\n\n1. Iterate L from min possible (which is 1) up to the maximum possible (which is len(s)//2, but maybe even longer if overlapping is allowed). Wait, no. For example, in a string of length 5, like 'aaaaa', the maximum possible substring that can appear twice is 4 (like 'aaaa' appears starting at 0 and 1). So the maximum possible L is len(s)-1. Because for a substring of length len(s)-1, there are two positions (0 and 1) where it can start, but they can overlap.\n\nSo for L, we can check from the maximum possible value (len(s)-1) down to 1. For each L, check all possible substrings of that length. For each substring, check if it appears at least two times. If any such substring exists, return L as the answer.\n\nBut how do I check if a substring appears at least twice?\n\nFor each L, generate all substrings of length L, and track their counts. For example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (positions 1-3), 'aba' (positions 2-4). So 'aba' appears twice. So for each L, we can collect all substrings of that length, and see if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nWell, for each L, we can loop through all possible starting indices i (from 0 to len(s) - L). For each i, take the substring s[i:i+L]. Then, store these substrings in a dictionary or a set, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nWait, but for checking duplicates, perhaps using a set. For example, for each L, iterate through all substrings of length L, and for each substring, check if it has been seen before. If yes, then return True for this L.\n\nBut for the problem, we need to find the maximum L where this is possible. So the approach would be:\n\nStart from the largest possible L (which is len(s)-1) down to 1. For each L, check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. If found, return that L. If none found after checking all Ls, return 0.\n\nSo for example, for the input 'abcd', the maximum possible L is 3. Let's see:\n\nCheck L=3: substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. Both are unique. So no. Then L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique. Then L=1: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' — all unique. So output 0.\n\nAnother example, 'zzz': len is 3. Check L=2: substrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2). So two occurrences. So answer is 2.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. Wait, the input is given as a list of strings? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait the sample input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and outputs are ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is a single string. Wait, perhaps the original problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. But in the sample input, it's given as a list. Oh, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not the actual input. Like, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single string. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. So for example, for the sample input, perhaps the actual input is three separate test cases. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output the answer. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list for illustration, but the actual input is a single string per test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input is a single string. But the sample input shows three different inputs. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the problem is expecting that the code can handle multiple test cases? Or maybe the sample is written in a way that's confusing.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps that sample is showing three separate test cases, each with their own input string. So the code needs to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, but the original problem says that the input is a single string. Maybe the sample input is written as a list for clarity, but in reality, the input is a single string. For example, perhaps the first input line is the string, and the code is supposed to process one string per run.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different strings, which implies that perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one string from input, and output one number. So the sample input must be three separate test cases, each with their own input string. So the code is supposed to process a single string, and output the answer for that string.\n\nBut then why does the sample input show a list of three strings? Probably, that's just a way to represent multiple test cases. But the actual code should process one string per run.\n\nSo for example, for the first test case, the input is 'abcd', output is 0. For the second, input is 'ababa', output is 3. Third, input is 'zzz', output is 2.\n\nTherefore, the code should read one string from input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code will read a single line, which is the string.\n\nBut perhaps the input is given as a list in the sample, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one string. So the code will read input().strip() and process that.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nFor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   For each possible starting index i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n      collect the substring s[i:i+L]\n\n   Check if any of these substrings appears at least twice.\n\nIf found, return L.\n\nElse, continue.\n\nIf no such L found, return 0.\n\nNow, how to check if any substring of length L appears at least twice.\n\nFor each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if there's any duplicates.\n\nFor example, for L, generate all substrings, and store them in a set. But since we need to check for duplicates, perhaps for each substring, check if it's already been seen.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, create a list of all substrings of length L, then check if the length of the list is not equal to the length of the set. Because if there are duplicates, the set will have fewer elements.\n\nBut that's not sufficient. Because for example, if there are two same substrings, then the set will have one element. So for example, if the list has two same elements, then the set will have size less than the list. So for each L, we can generate all substrings, and check if the number of unique substrings is less than the total number of substrings. If so, then there's at least one duplicate.\n\nBut that's not entirely accurate. Because if there are two same substrings, then the count is 2. So for example, if there are two same substrings, then the set will have one element. So the length of the set is less than the number of substrings. So for each L, if the number of substrings (which is len(s) - L + 1) is greater than the size of the set, then there's a duplicate.\n\nSo for each L, generate all substrings of length L, collect them into a set, and check if the size of the set is less than the number of substrings. If yes, then there's at least one duplicate. So return L.\n\nBut wait, for example, if there are three occurrences of the same substring, then the set will have one element, and the number of substrings is 3. So the size is 1 < 3, which indicates that there are duplicates.\n\nSo this approach would work.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, for a given L, the number of substrings is (n - L + 1), where n is the length of the string.\n\nSo for each L, generate all substrings of length L, collect them into a set, and check if len(set) < (n - L + 1). If yes, then return L.\n\nBut this approach would work. Because if there are at least two same substrings, then the set will have fewer elements than the number of substrings.\n\nBut for example, for the case where there are two same substrings and others unique, the set will have (number of unique substrings) = (number of substrings) - 1. So len(set) is (number of substrings) - 1, which is less than the number of substrings.\n\nSo yes, this approach works.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead s.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    substrings = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        substrings.add(substr)\n\n    if len(substrings) < (n - L + 1):\n\n        print(L)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but this is not exactly correct. Because for example, if there are two same substrings, then len(substrings) is (number of substrings) - 1. So len(substrings) is (n-L+1) - 1. So len(substrings) < (n-L+1) is true. So the code would return L.\n\nYes. So this approach works.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' (n=4). For L=3, n-L+1 = 4-3+1=2. So substrings are 'abc' and 'bcd'. The set has size 2. So 2 == 2, so no. Then L=2: n-L+1 is 3. Substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — set size is 3. So no. L=1: n-L+1 = 4. Substrings are 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' — set size 4. So no. So output 0. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' (n=5). Let's see for L=3. n-L+1 = 5-3+1=3. The substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). The set is {'aba', 'bab'}, size 2 < 3 → yes. So return 3. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' (n=3). For L=2: n-L+1 = 3-2+1=2. Substrings are 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). The set size is 1 < 2 → yes. So return 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' (n=5). For L=4: substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So set size 1 < 2 → yes. So return 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaa' (n=6). Let's see for L=3. Substrings are:\n\ni=0: 'aab'\n\ni=1: 'abb'\n\ni=2: 'bba'\n\ni=3: 'baa'\n\ni=4: 'aaa' ?\n\nWait, n is 6. For L=3, n-L+1 is 6-3+1=4. Wait, i ranges from 0 to 3 (inclusive?), because 0 to 3 gives 4 elements. So for i=0,1,2,3.\n\nWait, the string is 'aabbaa' → indexes 0-5.\n\nFor L=3, substrings are:\n\n0-2: aab\n\n1-3: abb\n\n2-4: bba\n\n3-5: baa.\n\nSo the set is { 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa' }, size 4. So len is 4, which equals n-L+1 (4). So no. Then check L=2. For L=2, n-L+1 is 5. Substrings:\n\naa, ab, bb, ba, aa.\n\nThe set is {aa, ab, bb, ba} → size 4 < 5 → yes. So returns 2. But wait, there is a substring of length 3 that occurs twice? Let me see.\n\nWait for L=3, the substrings are aab, abb, bba, baa. No duplicates. So the code would check L=3, then L=2. So returns 2. But there's a longer substring. Wait, what about 'aa' occurs twice. But maybe there's longer ones. For example, in the string 'aabbaa', the substring 'aa' occurs at positions 0-1, 4-5, and also 0-1 and 3-4? Wait the string is a a b b a a.\n\nSo for L=2, the substrings are:\n\n0-1: aa\n\n1-2: ab\n\n2-3: bb\n\n3-4: ba\n\n4-5: aa.\n\nSo two occurrences of 'aa'. So the code returns 2. But there's also 'aab' occurs once, 'ab' once, etc. So the maximum is 2. But what about L=3? Are there any substrings of length 3 that appear twice? Let's see. The substrings are aab (0-2), abb (1-3), bba (2-4), baa (3-5). No duplicates. So the code returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'abab' (n=4). For L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'ba', 'ab'. So set size is 2 (ab, ba). The number of substrings is 3. So len(set) is 2 < 3 → yes. So returns 2. Which is correct, since 'ab' appears twice.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the string s.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    count = 0\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            # there's a duplicate\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\n    # after checking all substrings for this L, if no duplicates found, continue\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but this approach is slightly different. Instead of collecting all substrings and checking the size of the set, this approach checks for each substring whether it's been seen before. Once a duplicate is found, it returns L. This is more efficient, as it can break early.\n\nBut in the previous approach, for example, when checking for L=3 in 'ababa', the code would collect all substrings and check if the set's size is less than the number of substrings. But in this approach, during the iteration, once a duplicate is found, it returns immediately.\n\nWhich approach is better? Well, for the problem constraints, since n is up to 100, even the worst case is manageable.\n\nBut the first approach (checking the set's size) may have to collect all substrings for each L. Whereas the second approach may break early. For example, if the first two substrings are the same, then it can return immediately.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the second approach is better. Let's think.\n\nBut in the code above, for each L, the code loops through all possible substrings. For each substring, check if it's in the set. If yes, return L. Else, add to the set. So for example, in the 'ababa' case, for L=3, the first substring is 'aba' (i=0), added to the set. Then i=1: 'bab' added. Then i=2: 'aba' which is in the set. So returns 3.\n\nThis approach is correct. So the code would be:\n\nRead s.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but this code may miss some cases. Let's think: suppose there are two substrings that are same, but not the first occurrence. For example, for a string like 'abba', and L=2. The substrings are 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'. But if the code checks for each substring, and adds to the set. So for 'ab' added. Then 'bb' added. Then 'ba' added. No duplicates. But in this case, the code would not return anything. But there are no duplicates. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'abab' with L=2. The substrings are 'ab', 'ba', 'ab'. So during the loop, the first 'ab' is added. Then 'ba' added. Then third substring is 'ab', which is in the set. So returns 2. Correct.\n\nBut what about a case where there are two same substrings, but not consecutive. For example, 'abcab', L=2. The substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'ca', 'ab'. So during the loop, the first 'ab' is added. Then 'bc' added. Then 'ca' added. Then 'ab' is found in the set. So returns 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nBut why is this approach correct? Because for each L, if there exists at least two occurrences of a substring, then during the iteration, when the second occurrence is encountered, the code will detect it and return L. So even if there are multiple occurrences, the code will find it.\n\nBut what about if there are two occurrences, but the first occurrence is not the first one. For example, in 'abba', L=2. The substrings are 'ab', 'bb', 'ba'. No duplicates. So code proceeds. But if the string was 'abba', and L=1. Then the substrings are 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'. So during the loop, the first 'a' is added. Then 'b' added. Then 'b' is in the set (so returns 1). So code returns 1.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nBut why not check for the set size? Because for the code, checking for the presence of a duplicate during the iteration is more efficient, as it can break early.\n\nSo this code is better. So this approach would work.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple duplicates, but the code checks for the first occurrence. For example, in a string with multiple duplicates, but the code returns as soon as the second occurrence is found.\n\nBut regardless, the code returns the maximum possible L. Because we are checking from the largest L down to 1. So once a L is found where there is at least one duplicate substring, we return it immediately. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but what about when the string is of length 1? For example, input is 'a'. Then n is 1. The loop runs for L in range(0, 0, -1) → no iterations. Then print 0. Which is correct, since there's no substring that appears twice.\n\nAnother example: input 'aa'. Then n=2. For L in range(1, 0, -1) → L=1. Then for i in 0 to 2-1+1= 2-1+1= 2? Wait n-L+1 is 2-1+1 = 2. So i ranges from 0 to 1 (inclusive). So substrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). So during the loop, first substr is 'a' added to seen. Then next substr is 'a', which is in seen. So returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about when the same substring appears more than once, but not in consecutive positions. Like 'abacab', and looking for L=2. Let's say the substrings are 'ab', 'ba', 'ac', 'ca', 'ab'. So during iteration, the first 'ab' is added. Then 'ba' added. Then 'ac' added. Then 'ca' added. Then 'ab' is found in the set. So returns 2. Correct.\n\nSo this code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 'abcd' → output 0. The code would check L=3, then 2, then 1. For each, no duplicates. So returns 0.\n\nSample input 2: 'ababa' → L=4? Let's see. For L=4, n is 5. So n-L+1 = 5-4+1=2. So substrings are 'abab' (i=0) and 'baba' (i=1). No duplicates. So proceed to L=3. For L=3, substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). When i=2, substr is 'aba', which is already in the set (added when i=0). So returns 3. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 'zzz' → len is 3. Check L=2. n-L+1 is 3-2+1=2. i ranges 0 and 1. substrings 'zz' (i=0) and 'zz' (i=1). So during the loop, first substr is added. Second is found in the set. returns 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, the code is written in Python, reads from stdin, and outputs the answer. So this should be the solution.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is a string. However, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list. But that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Because in the sample input, the user might have intended that the input is a list of test cases. But according to the problem statement, the code should read a single string. Therefore, the code is written as such.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem expects that the input is read as a list of strings. However, according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. So the code is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem's sample input is written as a list, but the actual input is a single string. For example, in the sample input, the input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but perhaps the actual input is three lines, each being one of those strings. However, according to the problem statement, the first input line contains the string. So the code is supposed to read a single line. But the sample shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem statement is unclear.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. Therefore, the code should read one string from input, and output the answer. So the code is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual input format. For example, the sample input is given as a list, but the actual input is a single string. So the code is correct as written.\n\nSo the code is as written above. Let me write it in Python.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut wait, in Python, the exit() function may not be the best. Using sys.exit() is better. But in code submission, perhaps print and exit. However, in Python, the exit() function is in the sys module. So perhaps the code should import sys and use sys.exit(). But the code as written would raise an error if exit() is not available. However, in Python, exit() is available in the standard environment, but perhaps it's better to use sys.exit().\n\nBut for code submission, perhaps the code would be better written with sys.exit().\n\nBut in the code, for example, in the code submission, the code may be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            sys.exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut in the code, perhaps the code can be written without importing sys, but using return. However, in a script, the code can't return. So the code must use sys.exit() or break and then return.\n\nBut in the code, the code is written as a script. So the code should import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nBut in some coding platforms, using exit() may not work. So perhaps using break and then returning.\n\nBut in the code, the code is written as:\n\nOnce a substring is found, print L and exit. Otherwise, after checking all possibilities, print 0.\n\nThus, the code should import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nBut the code as written in the initial version uses exit(), which may not work. So in Python, exit() is part of the sys module, but in some environments, it's available as a built-in. However, to be safe, perhaps using sys.exit() is better.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            sys.exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut what about when the string is empty? According to the problem statement, the input string is non-empty, so no need to handle that.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nFor example, if the input is 'ababa', the code would output 3.\n\nAnother test case: input 'zzz' → output 2.\n\nAnother test case: input 'a' → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: input 'aa' → output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which allows us to consider overlapping substrings when checking for duplicates.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input string.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible length of a substring (which is one less than the length of the string) and check downwards to 1.\n3. **Check for Duplicates**: For each length, generate all possible substrings of that length and check if any substring appears more than once using a set for efficient lookups.\n4. **Early Termination**: As soon as a valid duplicate substring is found for a given length, print that length and exit the program immediately.\n5. **Edge Cases**: If no such substring is found for any length, return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            sys.exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We start from the largest possible length of a substring (which is `n-1`) and check downwards to 1. This ensures that we find the longest valid substring first.\n- **Set for Tracking Substrings**: For each length, we use a set to track substrings we have seen so far. If a substring is encountered again, it means we have found a duplicate, and we immediately print the length and exit.\n- **Efficiency**: By checking from the largest possible length downwards and using a set for quick lookups, we ensure the solution is efficient and handles all edge cases correctly.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the longest substring that appears at least twice, leveraging the properties of sets for quick membership checks and ensuring early termination upon finding the solution.",
