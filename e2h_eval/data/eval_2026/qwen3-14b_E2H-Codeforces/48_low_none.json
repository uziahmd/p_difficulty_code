He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a, then b (which might be 'R'), and then a number c in base a. My job is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals if needed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Read a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. So the first line is two elements: a is an integer, and b is either an integer or 'R'.\n\n2. Read the next line as the number c in base a. This can have leading zeros, but when converting, we need to ignore leading zeros except when the number is zero. However, the note says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. Also, for other cases, the number isn't greater than 1e15.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Convert c from base a to decimal (integer).\n- Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be Roman numerals.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion steps?\n\nLet's think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. The input c is a string. For example, if a is 10 and c is '1', then it's 1. But if a is 16 and c is 'A', then it's 10 in decimal.\n\nBut what about when a is larger than 10? For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9 and A (for 10), B (for 11). So the input c may contain letters like A, B, etc., depending on the base a. Wait, the problem says that in bases greater than 10, they use letters A for 10, B for 11, etc. So when converting from base a to decimal, the digits in c can be numbers and letters (uppercase?), and we need to parse them correctly.\n\nSo, the first step is to parse the input c as a number in base a, converting it to a decimal integer. How to do that?\n\nFor example, the input 'A' in base 12 would be 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, for each character in the string c, we need to convert it to its corresponding value. For digits, it's straightforward. For letters, like A, B, etc., we need to map them to their respective values. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, up to 'Z' which is 35? Well, since the problem says that a can be up to 25. So the maximum digit in base a is a-1. So for a=25, digits can be 0-24, which would be 0-9, then A (10), B (11)... O (14+?), wait, let me think. Let's see: for digits above 9, letters are used. So for example, 10 is A, 11 is B, ..., 35 would be Z. But since a can be up to 25, the maximum digit is 24. So for base 25, the digits go up to 24, which would be represented as 'O' (since 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 15 is F, 16 G, 17 H, 18 I, 19 J, 20 K, 21 L, 22 M, 23 N, 24 O). So the code needs to handle letters for digits >=10.\n\nSo, during the conversion from base a to decimal, each character in c must be converted to its numeric value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So the code will need to process each character in the input string c.\n\nNow, how to do that in Python. For each character in the string, check if it's a digit or a letter. For letters, convert to uppercase (assuming input is uppercase?), then subtract 'A' to get the value. For example, 'A' is 10, so ord('A') - ord('A') = 0, plus 10? Wait, no. Let me think: if the character is 'A', then its value is 10. So, for a character c:\n\nif it's a digit, then value is int(c).\n\nelse, value is 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A')).\n\nBut need to make sure that the value is less than a. Because the input is valid, according to the problem statement.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which can either be a standard integer base or Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base `b`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: First, convert the input number `c` from base `a` to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of `c`, converting it to its corresponding decimal value, and accumulating the result.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a standard integer or Roman numerals:\n   - For standard integer bases, convert the decimal integer to the target base using division and modulus operations.\n   - For Roman numerals, convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a mapping of values to their corresponding Roman symbols.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = 10 + ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A')\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef from_decimal(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while num >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            num -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        a_part = parts[0]\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        c_str = parts[2]\n        \n        a = int(a_part)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            target_is_roman = True\n        else:\n            target_is_roman = False\n            b = int(b_part)\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        \n        if target_is_roman:\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            # Convert decimal_value to base b\n            if decimal_value == 0:\n                print('0')\n            else:\n                result = from_decimal(decimal_value, b)\n                print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **to_decimal Function**: Converts a string representation of a number in base `a` to its decimal equivalent. Each character is processed to determine its value, considering both digits and letters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **from_decimal Function**: Converts a decimal number to a specified base `b`. This function handles bases up to 25, using letters for values greater than 9.\n3. **decimal_to_roman Function**: Converts a decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating through these pairs to construct the Roman numeral string.\n4. **main Function**: Reads input lines, processes each line to determine the conversion required, and prints the result after converting the input number to the target base or Roman numeral representation.",
