There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to build houses on n spots, each with a height between 0 and h. Each house contributes a^2 dollars. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. We need to maximize the profit.\n\nConstraints are n, h, m up to 50. So, the numbers are small. That suggests that maybe a brute-force approach is possible, but perhaps we need something smarter.\n\nWait, what's the maximum possible number of possibilities? For each of the n houses, there are h+1 choices (from 0 to h). So for n=50, that's 51^50 possibilities. Which is way way way too big for brute force. So we can't check all possibilities directly.\n\nSo we need a better approach. Let's think about how to model the problem.\n\nThe problem is similar to an optimization problem with constraints. The constraints are that for each restriction, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the sum of squares of the heights, under these constraints.\n\nHmm. How can we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach: since the constraints are about maximums in ranges, perhaps we can find for each position the maximum allowed height, considering all the restrictions that apply to it.\n\nBut how? Because a restriction on a range [l_i, r_i] affects all positions in that range. For example, if a restriction says that the maximum in [1,3] is at most 2, then each of the positions 1, 2, 3 can have at most 2. However, if there's another restriction that allows a higher value in some sub-range, but that's not possible because the first restriction would take precedence.\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose there's a restriction that says the max in [1,3] is 2, and another that says the max in [2,2] is 3. Then the second restriction is redundant because the first one already restricts the max in [2,2] to be <= 2. So the second restriction is automatically satisfied.\n\nSo for each position, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all the restrictions that cover that position. Wait, no. Because each restriction applies to a range. For example, a restriction on [l_i, r_i] says that the maximum in that range is <= x_i. So for each position j in [l_i, r_i], the maximum height of j can't be higher than x_i. Because if any position in the range has a higher value than x_i, then the max would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction.\n\nTherefore, for each position j, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i where the restriction's range includes j. But wait, that's not entirely correct. Because suppose there's a restriction that covers a range [1,3], x=2, and another restriction that covers [1,2], x=3. Then, the first restriction requires that all positions 1-3 are at most 2. The second allows positions 1-2 to be up to 3, but since the first restriction is more restrictive, the positions 1-2 can only be up to 2. So, for each position j, the maximum height allowed is the minimum of all x_i from restrictions that include j in their range. Because each such restriction requires that the max in their range is <= x_i. Therefore, for any position j, if there's a restriction that includes j in its range, then the maximum possible height for j is the minimum of all x_i for which j is in [l_i, r_i]. Because if j is part of a range that has a restriction x, then the height of j can't exceed x. Otherwise, the max in that range would be higher than x, violating the restriction.\n\nWait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because suppose there's a restriction that says the maximum in [1,3] is 2. Then, the maximum height for each of positions 1, 2, 3 can be up to 2. However, if there's another restriction that says the maximum in [1,1] is 3. Then, the first restriction requires that the max in [1,3] is 2. So the max in [1,1] is also 2. Therefore, the second restriction is redundant. So, for position 1, the maximum allowed is min(2,3) = 2. So yes, for each position, the maximum allowed is the minimum of all x_i where the restriction includes that position. Because each restriction that includes the position imposes a cap on its maximum height.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit from building houses on a street with specific zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height, and each restriction imposes a constraint on the maximum height in a specified range.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a given range must not exceed a certain height. This implies that for each position on the street, the maximum allowable height is determined by the most restrictive constraint affecting that position.\n2. **Determine Maximum Heights**: For each position, compute the minimum height allowed by all constraints that include that position. This ensures that all constraints are satisfied.\n3. **Maximize Profit**: Once the maximum allowable height for each position is determined, the optimal strategy is to set each house to its maximum allowable height, as the profit function (a^2) is maximized when a is as large as possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    cases = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(input):\n        line = input[i].strip()\n        if not line:\n            i += 1\n            continue\n        parts = list(map(int, line.split()))\n        n, h, m = parts[0], parts[1], parts[2]\n        restrictions = []\n        for j in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input[i + 1 + j].strip().split())\n            restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n        cases.append((n, h, restrictions))\n        i += 1 + m\n    \n    results = []\n    for case in cases:\n        n, h, restrictions = case\n        max_heights = [h] * n  # Initialize with maximum possible height\n        for l, r, x in restrictions:\n            for pos in range(l - 1, r):\n                if max_heights[pos] > x:\n                    max_heights[pos] = x\n        total = sum([h * h for h in max_heights])\n        results.append(str(total))\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into multiple test cases.\n2. **Processing Each Case**: For each test case, initialize the maximum allowable height for each position to the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, update the maximum allowable height for each position within the specified range to be the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After applying all restrictions, compute the total profit by summing the squares of the maximum allowable heights for each position.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the quadratic nature of the profit function, which benefits from higher house heights.",
