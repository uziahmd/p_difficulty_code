The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$. Note that $$$mod$$$ may not be a prime.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$mod$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 500$$$, $$$1\\le mod\\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer, which is the answer modulo $$$mod$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 403458273']\n\n### Output\n['17']\n\n## Note\nThe following are all valid pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ when $$$n=4$$$.  $$$p=[1,3,4,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,2,3]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,4,3]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,3,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,3,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,1,3]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,4,2]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,2,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,2,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,1,2]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,3,2]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,2,1,3]$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q, and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And then return this count modulo mod. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's think about the total number of permutation pairs. Since there are n! permutations, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q is (n!)^2 - n! (since for each permutation, there are n!-1 other permutations). But since we want p to be lex smaller than q, maybe that's half of the total possible pairs where p != q? Wait, because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of pairs where p is lex smaller than q is (total_pairs)/2, where total_pairs is (n!)*(n! - 1). Wait, no. The total number of unordered pairs is (n! * (n! - 1))/2. But since we're considering ordered pairs where p is lex smaller than q, it's exactly (n! choose 2) pairs. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of such pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But how does that relate to our problem?\n\nBut our problem requires that among these pairs, we count those where inv(p) > inv(q). Let me think. Let me denote for each permutation p, the number of inversions as inv(p). Now, for each pair (p, q) where p < q, we need inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut perhaps there's some symmetry here. Suppose that for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, inv(p) can be compared to inv(q). Let me think: if we consider all ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q, then for each such pair, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or they are equal. Let's denote the total number of such pairs as T = n!*(n! - 1). Then, if we can compute the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q), then the answer would be (number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q)).\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nWait, but for the entire set of permutations, the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q), assuming that there are no pairs with inv(p) = inv(q). But that's not the case. Because some permutations have the same number of inversions. However, for the entire set of permutations, the number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) equals the number of pairs where inv(p) < inv(q), plus the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) divided by something? No, wait. For each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). So the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (T - same_count)/2, where same_count is the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q). Because for each pair where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of the two possibilities holds. So the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is (total_pairs - same_count) / 2.\n\nBut how does this help us? Well, the problem wants the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me think: suppose that for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_count)/2 - something? Or maybe there's a way to find the total number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) by considering the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) and then subtracting those where q < p but inv(p) > inv(q)?\n\nAlternatively, think of all pairs (p, q) where p != q. Let's split them into two categories: those where p < q and those where q < p. For each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p is true. So the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of pairs where q < p and inv(p) > inv(q). But in the latter",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$ and the number of inversions in $p$ is greater than the number of inversions in $q$. The result should be computed modulo a given value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Permutations and Inversions**: A permutation of length $n$ is an arrangement of numbers from 1 to $n$. An inversion in a permutation is a pair of indices $(i, j)$ such that $i < j$ and $a_i > a_j$.\n\n2. **Lexicographical Order**: For two permutations $p$ and $q$, $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$ if at the first position where they differ, $p$ has a smaller element.\n\n3. **Inversion Count Symmetry**: For any pair of distinct permutations $p$ and $q$, either $p$ has more inversions than $q$, $q$ has more inversions than $p$, or they have the same number of inversions. Using symmetry, we can derive the number of valid pairs efficiently.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: We precompute the number of inversions for all permutations of size up to $n$. Using dynamic programming, we calculate the number of permutations with each possible inversion count. This helps in efficiently determining the number of valid pairs.\n\n5. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, all operations are performed modulo the given value.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    mod = int(input[1])\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute factorial and inverse factorial\n    max_n = n\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % mod\n    \n    # dp[i][j] = number of permutations of length i with j inversions\n    dp = [[0] * (n * (n + 1) // 2 + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[1][0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1):\n            for k in range(j + 1):\n                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][k]\n                dp[i][j] %= mod\n    \n    total_pairs = fact[n] * fact[n] % mod\n    total_pairs = total_pairs * pow(2, mod - 2, mod) % mod  # divide by 2\n    total_pairs = (total_pairs - fact[n]) % mod  # subtract cases where p == q\n    \n    # Compute same_count: number of pairs (p, q) where p != q and inv(p) == inv(q)\n    same_count = 0\n    for inv in range(n * (n + 1) // 2 + 1):\n        cnt = dp[n][inv]\n        same_count = (same_count + cnt * (cnt - 1)) % mod\n    \n    ans = (total_pairs - same_count) * pow(2, mod - 2, mod) % mod\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Factorial Calculation**: We compute factorials up to $n$ to handle permutations efficiently.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: We use a dynamic programming approach to count the number of permutations of each length with a specific number of inversions. This allows us to quickly determine how many permutations have a certain number of inversions.\n\n3. **Total Valid Pairs Calculation**: We compute the total number of valid pairs $(p, q)$ where $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$ and adjust for pairs with equal inversion counts using symmetry properties.\n\n4. **Modulo Operations**: All calculations are performed modulo the given value to ensure results fit within standard integer limits and meet problem constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation even for the upper constraint of $n = 500$.",
