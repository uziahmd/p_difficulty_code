The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And we have to compute this modulo a given mod value.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem constraints. For n up to 500, which is quite large. So brute force approaches are definitely out of the question. Let's think about how to model this efficiently.\n\nLet me break down the problem into parts. We need to consider all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p < q lex order, and inv(p) > inv(q). The total number of such pairs is what we need to compute.\n\nBut considering all possible pairs directly would be O((n!)^2), which is impossible for n=500. So there must be some mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the total number of permutation pairs where p < q lex. Since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Also, the total number of unordered pairs is (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. But since we're considering ordered pairs where p < q, the count is exactly (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. However, we need to find among these pairs those where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nWait, but perhaps there's symmetry here. Suppose we consider all pairs (p, q) where p != q. For each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Now, for each such pair, either inv(p) > inv(q), inv(p) < inv(q), or inv(p) = inv(q). \n\nBut the problem requires us to count the pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let me think: if we can find for all pairs (p, q) where p != q, how many have inv(p) > inv(q), then subtract those where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q), etc. Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) < inv(q) plus the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) equals the total number of pairs where p < q. Which is T = (n! * (n! - 1 )) / 2.\n\nBut if we can find the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q), then maybe we can find the desired count.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother angle: For all pairs (p, q) where p != q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(q) > inv(p), because for each such pair, swapping p and q gives the opposite. Except when inv(p) = inv(q). So the total number of pairs (p, q) with p != q is S = n!*(n! - 1). Then, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to [S - C]/2, where C is the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nSo, if we can compute C, then the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is (S - C)/2.\n\nBut our problem requires only those pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q). Let's think about how this relates to the above.\n\nThe total number of pairs (p, q) where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of pairs where q < p and inv(p) > inv(q). But since in the latter case, q < p implies inv(q) > inv(p) would be the opposite. Wait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nIf (p, q) is a pair where p != q, then either p < q or q < p. For each such pair, exactly one of them holds. Now, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) plus the number of pairs where q < p and inv(p) > inv(q). But the second term is the same as the number of pairs where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). Because if q < p, then inv(p) > inv(q) is equivalent to inv(q) < inv(p). So the total number of such pairs is equal to the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) regardless of their lex order.\n\nBut according to earlier reasoning, the total number",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lexicographically smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than the number of inversions in q. The solution involves leveraging combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming to efficiently compute the required values given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Inversions**: An inversion in a permutation is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and a[i] > a[j]. We need to count permutations based on their inversion counts.\n2. **Lexicographical Order**: For any two distinct permutations, exactly one of them is lexicographically smaller.\n3. **Symmetry in Inversion Counts**: For all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p ≠ q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(q) > inv(p). This symmetry helps in simplifying our calculations.\n4. **Dynamic Programming for Inversion Counts**: Use dynamic programming to compute the number of permutations of length n with exactly k inversions. This allows us to precompute these values efficiently.\n5. **Combining Results**: Using the precomputed inversion counts, determine the total number of valid pairs by considering the symmetry and subtracting cases where inversion counts are equal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    mod = int(input[1])\n\n    max_n = n\n    # dp[i][j] = number of permutations of length i with j inversions\n    dp = [[0] * (max_n * (max_n + 1) // 2 + 1) for _ in range(max_n + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        for j in range(i * (i - 1) // 2 + 1):\n            for k in range(j + 1):\n                dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][k]\n                dp[i][j] %= mod\n\n    # Compute factorial mod mod\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % mod\n\n    # Compute total number of pairs (p, q) with p != q\n    total_pairs = fact[n] * (fact[n] - 1) % mod\n    total_pairs = total_pairs * pow(2, mod - 2, mod) % mod  # divide by 2\n\n    # Compute C: number of pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) == inv(q)\n    C = 0\n    for inv in range(n * (n - 1) // 2 + 1):\n        cnt = dp[n][inv]\n        C = (C + cnt * (cnt - 1) % mod) % mod\n\n    # The answer is (total_pairs - C) // 2 mod mod\n    ans = (total_pairs - C) % mod\n    ans = ans * pow(2, mod - 2, mod) % mod\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: `dp[i][j]` stores the number of permutations of length `i` with exactly `j` inversions. This is computed using a nested loop approach.\n2. **Factorials Calculation**: Factorials modulo `mod` are precomputed to handle large numbers efficiently.\n3. **Total Pairs Calculation**: The total number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p ≠ q is calculated using factorials.\n4. **Counting Equal Inversion Pairs**: The number of pairs (p, q) where both have the same number of inversions is computed by iterating over possible inversion counts.\n5. **Final Answer Calculation**: Using the symmetry properties and precomputed values, the final answer is derived by adjusting for pairs with equal inversion counts and applying modular arithmetic to ensure results fit within the given constraints.",
