After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the plan is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The input starts with two integers n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters, each representing the marks. So, for example, if the input is '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', then the gradebook is:\n\nStudent 1: [2, 2, 3]\nStudent 2: [2, 3, 2]\nStudent 3: [1, 1, 2]\n\nFor each subject (columns), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if in any of the subjects they have that maximum value. If yes, they are successful.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the next n lines as a list of strings.\n3. For each subject (columns), find the maximum value. Let's think about how to do that. For each column j (from 0 to m-1), iterate through all students' marks in that column and find the max.\n4. Then, for each student, check if in any of the m subjects, their mark is equal to the maximum of that subject. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nSo the main thing is to compute for each column the maximum, then check per student.\n\nLet me think about the data structure. Let's say we have a 2D list, where each row is a student's marks. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nstudents = [\n    [2, 2, 3],\n    [2, 3, 2],\n    [1, 1, 2]\n]\n\nThen, for each column (subject), find the max:\n\nsubject_maxes = [2, 3, 3]\n\nWait, for subject 0 (first column), the values are 2, 2, 1. Max is 2. Subject 1: 2,3,1 → max 3. Subject 2: 3,2,2 → max 3. So subject_maxes is [2,3,3].\n\nThen, for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max of that subject.\n\nFor student 1: marks are 2,2,3. Check each subject:\n\nSubject 0: 2 equals max (2) → yes. So this student is successful. Similarly, subject 2 has 3 which is max. So even if one is true, the student is counted.\n\nSo for each student, we can loop through their marks and check if any of them is equal to the corresponding subject's max.\n\nNow, how to compute the subject_maxes. For each column j, collect all the values in that column across all students and take the max.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string. Then convert each string into a list of integers. So for example, the first line is '223' → [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have the 2D list, then for each column j, compute the max.\n\nOnce we have the subject_maxes, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max of that subject.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines, each line is a string. Then for each line, convert into a list of integers.\n\nThen, for each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_val = max( students[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nStore these max_vals in a list called max_per_subject.\n\nOnce that's done, for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject is equal to the max_per_subject for that subject.\n\nSo for each student in students:\n\nfor j in 0..m-1:\n\nif student[j] == max_per_subject[j], then mark as successful and break.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut how to handle the input?\n\nIn Python, the input can be read via stdin. But since the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Wait, the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then the gradebook. But in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of two examples. However, the actual problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then the gradebook. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m. Then next n lines describe the gradebook.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as two separate test cases, like ['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111'].\n\nBut perhaps the actual problem expects that the code reads from standard input, which for programming competition problems is usually a single test case. Wait, but the sample shows two test cases. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases as input. But in the problem description, the input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of two test cases, but in reality, the code should process a single test case. Because in programming competitions, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for each run is a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m... Then n lines follow. So the code must read a single test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the sample input is showing two separate test cases, but the code must handle one test case per run.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from stdin and output the correct answer. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nWhich outputs 2.\n\nSo the code needs to read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem would be a single test case.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the input is given as a list of two test cases, but perhaps that's just part of the example for the problem. So the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is a single test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should process one test case.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string of m digits.\n\nThen process as discussed.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nIn Python, we can read from stdin using input() function. However, when there are multiple lines, we can read via:\n\nFirst line: n, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, for the next n lines, read each line as a string, then convert into a list of integers.\n\nFor example:\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    # convert each character to int\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(row)\n\nOnce that's done, compute max_per_subject.\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nAlternatively, for each column j, take the max of [students[i][j] for i in range(n)].\n\nOnce we have max_per_subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects equals the max for that subject.\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test this with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nstudents is:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max 2\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max 3\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max 3\n\nso max_per_subject is [2,3,3]\n\nNow, checking each student:\n\nstudent 1: [2,2,3]\n\nCheck each subject:\n\nsubject 0: 2 == 2 → yes → count +=1 and break.\n\nstudent 2: [2,3,2]\n\nsubject 0: 2 == 2 → yes → count +=1.\n\nstudent 3: [1,1,2]\n\nsubject 0: 1 < 2 → no.\n\nsubject 1: 1 <3 → no.\n\nsubject 2: 2 <3 → no. So no. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nstudents:\n\nstudent 1: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 3: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 → max 8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nso max_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow for each student:\n\nstudent 1: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\ncheck each subject:\n\nsubject 0: 9 == 9 → yes → count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nsubject 2: 8 == 8 → yes.\n\nsubject 4: 8 ==8 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 3: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\ncheck each subject:\n\nsubject 1: 1 ==1 → yes. So counted.\n\nThus total 3 → correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all students have same marks. For example, n=2, m=1. All students have 5. Then each student is best in the subject. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Then the student is successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [1, 2], student 2 has [2, 1]. Then max_per_subject is [2, 2]. Both students are successful.\n\nSo the code should handle these.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. For each line, convert into a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_per_subject as a list of m elements.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects is equal to the max_per_subject for that subject.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    students.append(row)\n\nCompute max_per_subject:\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nThen count the successful students:\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes, that's the code.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nOutput is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when a student is best in multiple subjects? Like in the first sample, student 1 is best in subject 0 and 2. But the code counts him once, because once he has one subject where he is best, he is counted.\n\nYes, because in the loop, once any of the subjects is found, the code breaks and increments the count.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nWait, but in Python, for the input reading, sometimes when the input is given with multiple lines, but when using input(), sometimes there could be issues with leading/trailing spaces. However, the problem says that each line is m characters, so the code can safely read each line as a string, and process each character.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, write the code as per the problem's instructions.\n\nThe code should read from stdin and output the correct answer.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m, then read n lines, process as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    students.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That should be it.\n\nTesting with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nProcessing:\n\nstudents is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject is [2,3,3]\n\ncount is 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nstudents:\n\n[9,1,7,2,8], [1,1,8,2,8], [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\ncount is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 followed by 5. Output is 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1 followed by 5 and 5. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then read the grades of each student.\n2. **Determine Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject, find the highest grade achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest grade in any subject. If they do, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    students.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in students:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is split into integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). Each subsequent line is read as a string and converted into a list of integers representing the grades of each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject (column in the gradebook), iterate through all students to find the maximum grade. This is stored in a list `max_per_subject`.\n3. **Counting Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum grade in any subject. If they do, increment the count of successful students and move to the next student.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum grades per subject and checking each student against these values. The complexity is O(n*m) for both determining the maximum grades and checking each student, which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
