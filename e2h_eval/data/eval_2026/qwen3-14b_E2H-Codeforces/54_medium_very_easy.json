Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And we need to output any of the optimal triplets.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to calculate the possible angles that can be formed in a regular polygon. Let's think about the properties of regular polygons. \n\nIn a regular n-gon, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle of the polygon itself. However, the problem here is about angles formed by three vertices, not necessarily adjacent ones.\n\nWait, the angle in question is formed with v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 on the sides. So, for example, if we pick three vertices where v2 is between v1 and v3 in some way. But how do we compute the angle?\n\nLet me recall that in a regular polygon, the central angles are 360/n degrees. Also, when you pick three vertices, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps away v1 and v3 are from v2. For example, if we have a regular polygon and pick two adjacent vertices next to v2, then the angle would be something specific. \n\nLet me think of a regular polygon. Suppose we fix v2 as a vertex. Then, the other two points v1 and v3 must lie on the perimeter such that when connected to v2, they form an angle. Now, in a regular polygon, the angle formed at v2 by two other vertices depends on the number of edges between them. \n\nFor example, in a regular pentagon (n=5), if I take v2 as a vertex, and then take v1 as the next vertex clockwise, and v3 as the one after that. The angle at v2 would be... Well, maybe there's a formula here.\n\nI remember that for a regular polygon, the measure of the angle formed by three vertices can be determined based on the number of sides between them. Let me think: suppose that between v2 and v1, there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3, there are m steps counter-clockwise. Wait, but since the polygon is regular and convex, perhaps the angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. \n\nAlternatively, considering that for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the arcs between them. Let me think of the circle in which the regular polygon is inscribed. Each vertex lies on a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 2π/n radians, or 360/n degrees. \n\nThe angle at v2 (the vertex) when looking at two other points v1 and v3 depends on the arc between v1 and v3. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that subtended at the circumference. \n\nWait, but here, the angle at v2 would be an inscribed angle. Suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps along the perimeter. Then the arc between v1 and v3 is k*(360/n) degrees. But since the angle is formed at v2, which is not on that arc. Wait, maybe I need to think of it as follows:\n\nIf I have three points on a circle, A, B, C. The angle ABC is determined by the arc AC that does not contain B. The measure of angle ABC is half the measure of the arc AC. \n\nSo, in our case, the angle at v2 (vertex B) is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. \n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the arc between v1 and v3 depends on how many edges are between them. Let me think: for example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the arc between them (not containing v2) would be (n-2)* (360/n) degrees? Or maybe not. Wait, if the polygon has n vertices, then the arc between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. So, if between v1 and v3, there are k steps along the perimeter (not passing through v2), then the arc length is k*(360/n) degrees. Then, the angle at v2 is half of that arc. \n\nWait, no. Because the angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. The arc that's opposite to the angle is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. Let me think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a circle. Then, the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2. \n\nSo, if the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is x degrees, then the angle at v2 is x/2. \n\nBut how to compute x? Well, the total circumference is 360 degrees. The arc between v1 and v3 that passes through v2 is y degrees. Then x + y = 360. But since the polygon is regular, the arc between v1 and v3 passing through v2 would be (number of steps between v1 and v3 via v2) * (360/n). \n\nBut how to find the number of steps between v1 and v3 via v2? Well, if v1 and v3 are both adjacent to v2, then the arc between them passing through v2 is 2*(360/n) degrees. Therefore, the arc that doesn't pass through v2 is 360 - 2*(360/n) degrees. Then, the angle at v2 would be (360 - 2*(360/n))/2 = 180 - (360/n) degrees. \n\nWait, for example, in a square (n=4), each interior angle is 90 degrees. But according to this formula, 180 - 360/4 = 180-90=90 degrees. Which matches. So that seems correct. \n\nAnother example: in a regular pentagon (n=5). For the case where v1 and v3 are two steps away from v2 (so the arc between them via v2 is 2*72=144 degrees). Then the arc not passing through v2 is 360-144=216 degrees. The angle at v2 would be 216/2 = 108 degrees. Which is indeed the interior angle of the pentagon. Wait, but the interior angle of a regular pentagon is (5-2)*180/5 = 108 degrees. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo this suggests that the angle at v2 depends on the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. And that arc is equal to (k * 360/n) degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc. \n\nBut how to find k? Well, for any three distinct vertices, there are two possible arcs between v1 and v3. The shorter one and the longer one. However, since the polygon is convex, the arc that does not contain v2 must be the longer arc if the angle is formed in the way described. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose that v2 is fixed, and v1 and v3 are two other vertices. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the arc that is opposite to v2. For example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the arc between them that doesn't contain v2 is the rest of the polygon, which is (n-2) steps. \n\nBut how to compute the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2? Let's say that between v1 and v3, there are m steps in one direction (the arc that contains v2), and (n - m) steps in the other direction. So the arc that does not contain v2 is (n - m) steps. Then the angle at v2 is ( (n - m) * 360 / n ) / 2 = ( (n - m) * 180 ) / n. \n\nBut how to find m? Well, m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 passing through v2. Since v1 and v3 are on the sides of the angle, they must be on different sides of v2. So, for example, if we take v2 as a vertex, then v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is l steps counter-clockwise from v2, then the arc between v1 and v3 passing through v2 is (k + l) steps. Then, the arc not passing through v2 is (n - (k + l)) steps. \n\nBut since the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 on the sides, the positions of v1 and v3 must be such that they are on either side of v2. So, for example, in the case of a square (n=4), if v2 is vertex 2, then v1 could be vertex 1 (adjacent clockwise) and v3 could be vertex 3 (adjacent counter-clockwise). The arc between v1 and v3 passing through v2 is 2 steps (from 1 to 2 to 3), so m = 2. The arc not passing through v2 is 4-2 = 2 steps (from 1 to 4 to 3). The angle at v2 is (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if in the same square, v1 is vertex 1 and v3 is vertex 4. Then the arc passing through v2 would be 3 steps (1->2->3->4). Then the arc not passing through v2 is 4-3 = 1 step (from 1 to 4 directly). The angle would be (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. Which is the case mentioned in the example. \n\nAh! So the angle depends on how many steps are between v1 and v3 along the arc that passes through v2. Let me denote that as m. Then the angle is ( (n - m) * 180 ) / n. \n\nBut since m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 passing through v2, which is (distance between v1 and v3 along that path). However, since v1 and v3 are on either side of v2, the value m is equal to (k + l), where k is the number of steps from v2 to v1 in one direction, and l is the steps from v2 to v3 in the other direction. \n\nBut for the purpose of calculating the angle, perhaps m can be considered as the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that includes v2. However, since the angle is determined by the arc that does not include v2, which is (n - m) steps. \n\nBut how to find m? Well, for any pair of vertices v1 and v3, the minimal distance between them is d steps, but here, since they are on either side of v2, the steps between them passing through v2 is (k + l) steps. But perhaps there's a simpler way. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: For a given n, the possible angles that can be formed at any vertex v2 are determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not include v2. Let's denote this as k steps. Then, the angle is (k * 180) / n. Wait, no. Wait earlier formula said that the angle is ((n - m) * 180)/n, where m is the steps passing through v2. But since m = (steps between v1 and v3 passing through v2) = (steps from v1 to v2) + (steps from v2 to v3). But since v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2, the steps from v1 to v2 is, say, k steps, and steps from v2 to v3 is l steps. Then m = k + l. But the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 is (n - (k + l)) steps. Hence, angle is ((n - (k + l)) * 180) / n. \n\nBut since k and l are at least 1 (because v1 and v3 must be distinct from v2 and each other?), no. Wait, for example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 (k=1), and v3 is adjacent to v2 (l=1), then m = 2 steps. So the arc not passing through v2 is (n-2) steps, leading to angle (n-2)*180/n. \n\nBut what is the possible range of m? Well, m can be from 2 (when v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 on either side) up to (n-1) steps (when one of the points is adjacent to v2, and the other is the diametrically opposite point, but that depends on n). \n\nWait, but m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that passes through v2. So for example, if v1 is one step clockwise from v2, and v3 is (n-1) steps counter-clockwise from v2 (i.e., adjacent to v2 on the other side), then the arc between v1 and v3 passing through v2 is 1 + 1 = 2 steps. But if v3 is two steps counter-clockwise from v2, then m is 1+2=3 steps. \n\nBut in order to find all possible angles, we can note that for any given vertex v2, the possible angles are determined by the possible values of (k + l) steps, where k and l are the steps from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 in opposite directions. However, since the polygon is regular and symmetric, the actual value of the angle depends only on the sum (k + l) steps. \n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. For a given n, the possible angles that can be formed at any vertex v2 are of the form ( (s) * 180 ) / n, where s ranges from 1 to n-2. Wait, how? Because the arc that does not contain v2 has k steps. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe angle is (k * 180) / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2. But since the arc that doesn't contain v2 can be from 1 step (if v1 and v3 are adjacent) up to (n-2) steps (if they are on opposite ends). \n\nWait, for example, in a square (n=4), the possible k values are 1 and 2. \n\nIf k=1, angle is 1 * 180 /4 = 45 degrees. If k=2, 2*180/4= 90 degrees. Which matches the example given. \n\nSimilarly, in a triangle (n=3), the possible k is 1 step (since the arc not containing v2 must be 1 step, because between any two vertices, the arc not containing v2 is 1 step). So the angle is 1 * 180 /3 = 60 degrees, which is correct. \n\nSo the formula for the angle is (k * 180) / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. And k can vary from 1 to (n-2). Because if k is 1, then the arc is minimal, and if k is (n-2), then the arc is maximal (since the other arc would be 2 steps, which is the minimal for n=4). \n\nTherefore, for each possible k (from 1 to n-2), there's a corresponding angle of (k * 180)/n degrees. Our task is to find the value of k that makes this angle as close as possible to a. Once we find the best k, we can choose any triplet of vertices that corresponds to that k. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the integer k in [1, n-2] such that |(k * 180)/n - a| is minimized. Then, select any triplet that corresponds to this k. \n\nOnce we find the optimal k, we need to construct a valid triplet of vertices. How?\n\nFor example, let's say we have chosen k. Then, we need to find three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is exactly k steps. \n\nHow to choose such vertices? Let's fix v2 as vertex 1. Then, v1 can be vertex 2 (adjacent clockwise), and v3 can be vertex (2 + k) steps away from v1 along the arc that doesn't contain v2. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. \n\nIf the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is k steps, then the arc between them that does contain v2 is (n - k) steps. So the distance between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (n - k) steps. \n\nBut how to arrange v1 and v3 relative to v2. Let's imagine that v2 is vertex 1. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 must be (n -k) steps. So, for example, if v1 is vertex 2 (next to v2), then v3 must be (n -k) steps away from v1 along the arc that includes v2. But since the arc that includes v2 is (n -k) steps, then the position of v3 would be vertex 2 + (n -k) steps. \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is: for a given k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is m = n - k steps. \n\nBut since v1 and v3 are on opposite sides of v2, the steps from v2 to v1 is some x steps, and steps from v2 to v3 is y steps, such that x + y = m. \n\nBut since m = n -k steps, and for the angle calculation, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is m steps. \n\nBut for simplicity, to construct a triplet, we can choose v2 as vertex 1. Then, choose v1 as vertex 2 (adjacent clockwise), and v3 as vertex (1 + (m) steps in the other direction). Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of an example. \n\nTake n=4, a=67. The optimal k is 1, leading to angle 45 degrees. For this, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step. So, the arc that contains v2 is 4-1=3 steps. So, the steps between v1 and v3 along the arc containing v2 is 3 steps. \n\nLet's take v2 as vertex 1. Then, v1 is vertex 2 (adjacent), and v3 is vertex 2 + 3 steps along the arc that contains v2. But since the arc that contains v2 is 3 steps, and starting from v1 (vertex 2), moving 3 steps along the arc that contains v2 (which is the same as moving clockwise, since v2 is vertex 1). Wait, perhaps I need to think of the positions. \n\nIn a square with vertices numbered 1,2,3,4 clockwise. If v2 is vertex 1, and the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 3 steps. Then, if v1 is vertex 2, then moving 3 steps along the arc that contains v2 (which is the arc going through vertex 1) would reach vertex 2 → 1 → 4 → 3. So v3 is vertex 3. Thus, the triplet is 2,1,3. Which is one of the sample outputs. \n\nYes, that's the second sample input (4 67) where the output is 2 1 3. \n\nSo the way to construct the triplet is: choose v2 as vertex 1. Choose v1 as vertex 2 (adjacent clockwise), and v3 as vertex (2 + (m)) mod n? Wait, m is the number of steps along the arc containing v2. \n\nWait, m is n -k steps. For example, in the case where k=1, m = n -k = 4 -1=3 steps. So, from v1 (vertex 2), moving m steps along the arc that contains v2 (which is the arc that goes through v2). But since v2 is vertex 1, and v1 is vertex 2, moving along the arc that contains v2 (which is the arc going clockwise from v1 to v2 and then further). \n\nWait, perhaps the easiest way is to have v1 be adjacent to v2 (say, vertex 2), and v3 be vertex (v2 + m) steps away. But since the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is m steps, which equals (n -k) steps. \n\nBut how to find the position of v3. Let me think: if v2 is vertex 1, and v1 is vertex 2 (adjacent clockwise), then the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 must be m steps. So, starting from v1 (vertex 2), moving m steps along the arc that includes v2. Since v2 is vertex 1, which is adjacent to v1, the arc that includes v2 would be the clockwise direction. \n\nSo, moving m steps from v1 (vertex 2) in clockwise direction would reach vertex (2 + m) mod n. However, since the polygon is numbered from 1 to n, we need to adjust for that. \n\nBut for example, in the case where n=4, m=3. Starting from vertex 2, moving 3 steps clockwise: 2 → 3 → 4 → 1. So vertex 1. But that's v2. But that's not allowed. Wait, but the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 must be m steps. So in this case, m steps from v1 (vertex 2) would reach vertex (2 + m) mod n. But if m is 3 steps, then 2+3=5 mod 4 is 1. Which is v2. But then v3 is v2, which is invalid. \n\nHmm, this suggests that my approach is wrong. \n\nWait, what's the correct way to find v3? Let's think again. The arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is m steps. So, the distance between v1 and v3 along that arc is m steps. Which means that the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc containing v2 is m steps. \n\nBut since v2 is part of that arc, then v1 and v3 are on either side of v2. So, for example, if v2 is vertex 1, v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex (1 + l), where l is the number of steps from v2 to v3. \n\nBut then, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (steps from v1 to v2) + (steps from v2 to v3) = 1 + l steps. This should equal m steps. \n\nSo, 1 + l = m → l = m - 1. \n\nThus, v3 is located l steps from v2. So, for example, in the case where m = 3 steps, l = 3-1 = 2 steps. So v3 is two steps from v2 (vertex 1). So, moving two steps clockwise from v2 (vertex 1) gives vertex 3. \n\nSo, the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=3. Which is the correct example. \n\nSo the general approach is: for a given k, compute m = n -k. Then, choose v2 as vertex 1, v1 as vertex 2 (adjacent to v2), and v3 as vertex (1 + (m - 1)) mod n? Wait, no. Because l = m -1 steps from v2. So, if v2 is vertex 1, and l steps from v2 in the clockwise direction, then v3 is vertex 1 + l. But since the numbering is 1-based and in clockwise order, adding l steps from v2 (vertex 1) would give vertex 1 + l, unless that exceeds n. \n\nWait, for example, if l is 2 steps from v2 (vertex 1) in clockwise direction, then v3 is vertex 1 + 2 = 3. \n\nYes. So, for general case, once we have m = n -k, then l = m -1. Then, v3 is 1 + l steps. \n\nBut wait, why m -1? Because the steps from v1 to v2 is 1 step (since v1 is adjacent to v2), and steps from v2 to v3 is l steps. So total m steps = 1 + l → l = m -1. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the triplet is v1=2, v2=1, v3=1 + l = 1 + (m -1) = m. \n\nSo, v3 is vertex m. \n\nBut m = n -k. So v3 is vertex (n -k). \n\nBut since the polygon is numbered from 1 to n, this needs to be adjusted. \n\nWait, for example, in the case where n=4, k=1, m =4 -1 =3. So v3 is vertex 3. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=4, k=2. Then m=4-2=2. v3 is vertex 2. But then, v3 is vertex 2, which is same as v1 (which is 2). That's invalid. Wait, but that can't happen. \n\nWait, when k=2, the angle would be 2 * 180 /4 = 90 degrees. Which is the case for the square. So in that case, how to find the triplet. \n\nIf k=2, then m = n -k =4-2=2. Then l = m-1=1. So v3 is 1 +1=2. Which is same as v1. That's not allowed. So there's a mistake here. \n\nAh! What's wrong here. Let me re-examine. \n\nWhen k=2, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 2 steps. The arc that contains v2 is m = n -k = 4-2 = 2 steps. \n\nSo, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 2 steps. \n\nWhich implies that the steps from v1 to v2 plus steps from v2 to v3 equals 2 steps. \n\nBut if v1 is adjacent to v2 (1 step), then steps from v2 to v3 is 1 step. So v3 is adjacent to v2. \n\nThus, the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=4 (since adjacent counter-clockwise to v2). \n\nWait, but according to the earlier calculation, v3 is 1 + l =1 + (m-1) = 1 + (2-1) = 2. Which is wrong. \n\nSo, the mistake is in the assumption that v3 is located in the clockwise direction. Perhaps I should have considered that the steps from v2 to v3 can be in either direction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should choose v3 to be (v2 + l) mod n, but ensuring that it's not overlapping with v1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for v3 is (v2 + (m - steps from v1 to v2))? \n\nThis suggests that the approach of choosing v1 as vertex 2 and v3 as vertex m may not always work. \n\nSo, perhaps another approach is needed. \n\nLet me think again. For a given k, the angle is (k * 180)/n. We need to find the triplet. \n\nOnce we have the correct k, the triplet can be constructed by selecting three vertices such that between v1 and v3, along the arc that does not contain v2, there are k steps. \n\nAn easy way to construct such a triplet is to take v2 as vertex 1, v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (1 + k + 1). Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, if the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is k steps, then the arc between them that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. \n\nSo, for example, in the case of k=2, n=4, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 4-2=2 steps. \n\nIf we take v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex 4, then the arc between them that contains v2 is 2 steps (2→1→4). So that's correct. \n\nSo, how to find v3 given that the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n-k) steps. \n\nAssuming v1 is vertex 2, then v3 is located (n-k) steps away from v1 along the arc that contains v2. \n\nSince the arc that contains v2 is the arc that goes through v2, which is the shorter path from v1 to v3 passing through v2. \n\nSo, for example, in the case of n=4, k=2, m =n -k = 2 steps. Starting from v1=2, moving 2 steps along the arc that contains v2 (which is the clockwise direction, passing through v2 (vertex 1)), then the steps would be 2 →1 →4. So v3 is 4. \n\nThus, the formula for v3 is (v1 + (m - 1)) mod n? No, because for this example, v1 is 2, m is 2 steps. So adding m-1 steps (1 step) to v1 would get to 3. Which is not correct. \n\nWait, but how to compute the position of v3 given that from v1, moving m steps along the arc that contains v2. \n\nAlternatively, since the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is m steps, and since v1 is adjacent to v2, then the steps from v1 to v2 is 1 step, and steps from v2 to v3 is (m -1) steps. \n\nSo, if v2 is vertex 1, then v3 is (1 + (m-1)) steps clockwise from v2. \n\nIn the case where m=2, this would be 1 + (2-1) = 2 steps from v2. Which would be vertex 1 + 2 steps = 3? Or 1 + 2 steps clockwise. \n\nWait, for n=4, vertex numbers are 1,2,3,4. From vertex 1, moving 2 steps clockwise would be 2 steps: 1→2→3. So vertex 3. But earlier example said that v3 should be 4. \n\nThis suggests that this approach is incorrect. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's imagine that the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is m steps. Since v1 is adjacent to v2, and the arc between them contains v2, then the steps from v1 to v3 along that arc is m steps. \n\nSo, for example, in the case where v1 is vertex 2, and the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 2 steps: 2 →1 →4. Which is 2 steps. So from v1 (2), moving 2 steps along the arc that contains v2 (which is the arc going through v2, i.e., clockwise direction) gives us vertex 4. \n\nSo how to compute this? The number of steps from v1 to v3 along the arc that contains v2 is m steps. Since v1 is adjacent to v2, the first step is to v2, then the remaining (m-1) steps from v2. \n\nSo, v3 is located (m-1) steps from v2 in the same direction as from v1 to v2. \n\nIn this example, v2 is vertex 1. The direction from v1 (vertex 2) to v2 (vertex 1) is counter-clockwise. Wait, but the arc that contains v2 is the one that goes from v1 through v2 to v3. So the direction from v1 to v2 is counter-clockwise, but to go from v2 to v3 along that arc, it's clockwise? \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to generate the triplet once we know k. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: For any k, the optimal triplet can be constructed as follows. Choose v2 as vertex 1. Choose v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (k + 2). Wait, no. For example, in the case of n=4 and k=1, the correct v3 is 3. k+2 is 3. Yes. For k=2, n=4, k+2=4. Which is correct (v3 is 4). \n\nBut wait, what if k+2 exceeds n? For example, n=5, k=3. Then k+2=5. Which is valid. For k=4, n=5, k+2=6, which is 1 mod 5. But that would be vertex 1, which is v2. Not allowed. \n\nHmm. So this approach works only for certain cases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula for v3 is (v2 + k + 1) mod n? Or something similar. \n\nWait, for the case where k=1, n=4, v2 is 1. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step. So, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 3 steps. So, m = 3 steps. \n\nIf v1 is vertex 2, then v3 is 2 + m steps along the arc that contains v2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is k steps. So, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. \n\nNow, assuming that v1 is vertex 2, and v2 is vertex 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. So, the distance between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n -k) steps. \n\nTo find v3, we can think that from v1 (vertex 2), moving (n -k) steps along the arc that contains v2. Since the arc contains v2, which is adjacent to v1, this path would go from v1 to v2 (1 step), then from v2 onward. \n\nSo, the number of steps from v2 to v3 along that arc is (n -k) - 1 steps. \n\nThus, v3 is located at v2 + (n -k - 1) steps in the clockwise direction. \n\nFor example, n=4, k=1: n-k-1 = 4-1-1=2. v2 is 1. Adding 2 steps clockwise gives 1+2=3. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example, n=4, k=2: n-k-1=4-2-1=1. v2=1, add 1 step clockwise gives 2. Which is v1. That's not allowed. \n\nWait, but in this case, for k=2, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 2 steps. So, the arc that contains v2 is 4-2=2 steps. \n\nIf v1 is 2, then moving 2 steps along the arc that contains v2 (which is the arc that goes from v1 through v2 to v3) would be 2 → 1 → 4. So v3 is 4. \n\nBut according to the formula above, v3 is v2 + (n-k-1) steps clockwise. n-k-1 is 1. So from v2 (1), adding 1 step clockwise gives 2, which is v1. That's wrong. \n\nWhat's wrong here? \n\nAh, the formula assumes that from v2, we move (n-k-1) steps clockwise. But in this case, we need to move (n-k-1) steps in the direction that allows us to reach v3. \n\nBut in this case, the steps from v2 to v3 along",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves calculating the closest possible angle using geometric properties of regular polygons and constructing the appropriate triplet of vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed by three vertices can be determined based on the number of steps between the vertices along the polygon's perimeter. The angle at a vertex can be derived from the arc length opposite to it.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For a given number of steps `k` between two vertices (not containing the vertex of interest), the angle formed is `(k * 180) / n` degrees. We need to find the `k` that minimizes the absolute difference between this calculated angle and the target angle `a`.\n3. **Constructing Vertices**: Once the optimal `k` is found, we construct the triplet of vertices using a systematic approach ensuring the vertices are distinct and form the required angle.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n    \n    # Calculate the possible k values\n    # The angle for k steps is (k * 180) / n\n    # We need to find k in [1, n-2] that minimizes |(k*180/n) - a|\n    # Also, handle the case when multiple k's have the same minimal difference\n    \n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    \n    for k in range(1, n - 1):\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k or any, since any is acceptable\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    \n    # Now construct the triplet\n    # Choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as (best_k + 2) mod n?\n    # Let's think again: for best_k steps not containing v2, the arc containing v2 is (n - best_k) steps\n    # So from v1 (vertex 2), moving (n - best_k) steps along the arc that contains v2 (which is clockwise)\n    # So from v1=2, moving (n - best_k) steps clockwise gives v3\n    # But how to compute that?\n    \n    # The steps from v1 to v3 along the arc containing v2 is (n - best_k)\n    # Since v1 is 2, and moving (n - best_k) steps clockwise from v1\n    # The position of v3 is (2 + (n - best_k - 1)) % n + 1\n    # Because starting from 2, adding (n - best_k) steps would be 2 + (n - best_k) steps, but since it's 1-based, adjust accordingly\n    \n    m = n - best_k\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = (v1 + m - 1) % n\n    if v3 == 0:\n        v3 = n\n    else:\n        v3 = v3\n    \n    # Ensure that v3 is not equal to v1 or v2\n    v2 = 1\n    if v3 == v1 or v3 == v2:\n        # This should not happen, but just in case, adjust\n        # Try another configuration, e.g., v1 = n, v2 = 1, v3 = 2\n        v1 = n\n        v3 = 2\n    \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (target angle).\n2. **Finding Optimal `k`**: Iterate through possible values of `k` (from 1 to n-2) to find the one that minimizes the difference between the calculated angle and the target angle `a`.\n3. **Constructing Vertices**: Using the optimal `k`, determine the vertices such that the angle formed is closest to `a`.
