Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And we need to output any of the optimal triplets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me think. In a regular polygon, each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. But how does that relate to the angles formed by three vertices?\n\nLet me recall that in a regular polygon, the measure of an internal angle can be calculated. Wait, but here the angle is not the internal angle of the polygon. Instead, it's an angle formed by three vertices where the middle one is the vertex of the angle. So for example, in a square (n=4), if you take vertices 1, 2, 3, the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if you take vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 would be 45 degrees. Oh right, because the sides are along the diagonals.\n\nSo the key is to find, for each possible choice of v2 and the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2, what is the angle formed. Then find the one closest to a.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the angle at v2. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's fix v2 as some vertex. Then, the other two vertices v1 and v3 are located k steps away from v2 in either direction. For example, if there are k steps between v2 and v1 in one direction, and m steps in the other direction. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, the angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to model the polygon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Let's consider the regular polygon with n sides. Each vertex is placed on a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 2π/n radians, which is 360/n degrees.\n\nNow, for a given vertex v2, let's consider two other vertices v1 and v3. Let's assume that between v2 and v1, there are k edges in the clockwise direction, and between v2 and v3, there are m edges in the counter-clockwise direction. Or maybe the other way around. But the angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\nWait, but in order for the angle to be formed with v2 as the vertex, v1 and v3 must lie on different sides of the angle. So, for example, in the case of a square, if v2 is vertex 2, then v1 could be vertex 1 (adjacent clockwise) and v3 could be vertex 3 (adjacent counter-clockwise). The angle at 2 is 90 degrees. Alternatively, if v1 is vertex 1 and v3 is vertex 4 (two steps away from v2 in the counter-clockwise direction), then the angle would be 45 degrees.\n\nSo perhaps the angle at v2 depends on the number of edges between v2 and v1, and between v2 and v3. But since the polygon is regular, the angle depends only on the number of steps between them.\n\nLet me think about the formula for the angle. Suppose that between v2 and v1, there are k steps in one direction, and between v2 and v3, there are l steps in the other direction. Then, the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter would be k + l. But since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 can be determined based on the arc lengths between the points.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle can be calculated using the formula for the inscribed angle. Wait, but the angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. The angle between these two chords can be found using the formula involving the arcs they subtend.\n\nIn a circle, the measure of an angle formed by two chords that meet at a point on the circumference is equal to half the measure of the arc between the two points. Wait, no. Wait, the central angle is equal to the arc measure. The inscribed angle subtended by the same arc is half of that. But here, the angle at v2 is formed by two chords. Let me think: if I have three points A, B, C on a circle, with B being the vertex of the angle. Then the angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. Wait, that's correct. Because the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it.\n\nSo, in this case, the angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. But since the polygon is regular, the arc length between v1 and v3 depends on how many steps apart they are.\n\nBut how many steps are between v1 and v3? Let's say that when you go from v1 to v3 through the arc that doesn't contain v2, there are m steps. Then the arc length is m * (360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of that. So angle = (m * 360/n)/2 = m * 180 / n degrees.\n\nBut wait, in the case of a square (n=4), if we take v1 as 1, v2 as 2, and v3 as 3, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is 2 steps (from 1 to 3 via the other side of the square?), but that's not right. Wait, in the square, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc that goes from 1 to 3 through the other two vertices. But that's two edges, so 2*(360/4) = 180 degrees. The angle at v2 would be half of that, 90 degrees. Which matches the example. \n\nAnother example: if in the square, v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2 is 1 step (from 1 to 4 through the other side?), but wait, in the square, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is 1 edge (since going from 1 to 4 is one step counter-clockwise, but the other way is three steps). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. The arc that does not contain v2. So, in the case of v2 being 2, and v1 being 1 and v3 being 4. The arc from v1 to v3 that does not contain v2 would be the arc that goes from 1 to 4 passing through 3. That's two steps (from 1 to 3 to 4?), but wait, in a square, 1 is connected to 2 and 4. So between 1 and 4, the arc that doesn't pass through 2 is just one edge (from 1 to 4). Wait, but that's only one edge. So the arc length is 360/4 * 1 = 90 degrees. Then the angle at v2 (which is 2) would be half that, 45 degrees. Which matches the example where the angle was 45 degrees. So that seems correct.\n\nSo, in general, the angle at v2 is equal to (m * 180)/n degrees, where m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. \n\nBut how to compute m? Well, considering that the polygon has n vertices, and that for any two vertices v1 and v3, the arc between them that does not contain v2 would have m steps. However, since the polygon is regular, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is (n - k - l), where k is the steps from v2 to v1 in one direction and l is steps from v2 to v3 in the other direction. Or perhaps another approach.\n\nWait, let's think: if we fix v2 as the vertex, then for any other two vertices v1 and v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the arc that is opposite to v2. So, if v1 is k steps away from v2 in one direction, and v3 is l steps away in the other direction, then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be (k + l) steps. Because if you go from v1 to v2 (k steps), then from v2 to v3 (l steps), but the other arc between v1 and v3 is the rest of the polygon. Wait, the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the entire polygon is (k + l) steps? No. Wait, the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter is (k + l) steps if you go through v2. But the other arc between v1 and v3 would be (n - (k + l)) steps. \n\nAh, right. So the arc that does not contain v2 is (n - (k + l)) steps. But since the angle is half the measure of that arc, the angle is ( (n - (k + l)) * (360/n) ) / 2 = (n - (k + l)) * 180 / n. \n\nBut wait, in the previous example where n=4, k=1 (steps from v2 to v1), l=1 (steps from v2 to v3 in the other direction). Then, the arc that does not contain v2 is (4 - (1+1)) = 2 steps. Then angle would be 2 * 180 /4 = 90 degrees. Which is the case for the angle at 2 with v1=1 and v3=3. But in the other example where v3 is 4, then steps from v2 (2) to v3 (4) in the other direction is 2 steps? Wait, maybe I need to re-express this.\n\nWait, perhaps k and l are the number of steps between v2 and v1, and between v2 and v3, respectively. But since the polygon is circular, the steps can be considered in either direction. However, for the angle calculation, the important thing is that the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is (n - (k + l)) steps. But how do we get k and l?\n\nAlternatively, since the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2, which is m steps. Then, the angle is m * (180 / n) degrees. Because the arc length is m * (360/n) degrees, and the angle is half that.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding m such that m * (180 /n) is as close as possible to a. But m can vary based on the selection of v1 and v3.\n\nBut what are the possible values of m?\n\nSince the polygon has n vertices, and we need to choose v1 and v3 such that they are on different sides of v2. For example, for any v2, the minimal steps between v1 and v3 (in terms of the arc not containing v2) is 2 steps (since you can't have them adjacent to v2 on the same side). Wait, no. Let's think: For example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 in one direction, and v3 is adjacent to v2 in the other direction. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is (n - 2) steps. Because the arc that goes through the rest of the polygon. But that seems like a lot. However, the angle would be (n-2)*180/n degrees. Which for n=3, gives (1)*180/3 = 60 degrees. Which matches the first sample input.\n\nBut what's the range of possible m?\n\nFor any valid choice of v1 and v3 (distinct from v2 and each other), m can be from 2 to (n-2). Wait, why? Because m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Let's think: the minimal possible m is 2. For example, if v1 is adjacent to v2 in one direction, and v3 is adjacent to v2 in the other direction. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is n - 2 steps. Wait, that's not m. Wait, earlier I said that m is the steps between v1 and v3 along that arc. So in that case, the arc is (n-2) steps. Which would make the angle (n-2)*180/n. But that's for that case. But what about other cases?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2. Wait, no. Because earlier example shows that the angle is half the arc that does not contain v2. So the m is the steps of that arc. So, for example, in the square example, when v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 on opposite sides, the arc between them not containing v2 is two steps (from v1 to v3 through the other side). For n=4, that's 2 steps. So m=2, angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nBut how to find all possible m values?\n\nAnother example: if n=5, and m=2 steps. The angle is 2*180/5 = 72 degrees. If m=3, 3*180/5= 108 degrees. So possible angles depend on m. The possible m values are from 2 to n-2. Because:\n\n- The minimal m is 2: when v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 on opposite sides. Then the arc between them not containing v2 is 2 steps. Because the arc that contains v2 is (k + l) steps, where k and l are 1 each. So the other arc is n - (k + l) = n - 2 steps. Wait, but earlier I thought m was that. Wait, but in that case, m would be n-2. Which for n=4 would be 2 steps. Which matches the earlier example. So m is n - (k + l) steps. But how to find possible m?\n\nAlternatively, for any triplet (v1, v2, v3), the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. Which is m steps. So m can range from 2 to n-2. Because, for example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent (so steps between them along the arc not containing v2 is 1 step?), but that would require that the arc containing v2 is n-1 steps. But then, that would imply that v1 and v3 are adjacent, but that would mean that they are on the same side of v2, which is not allowed. Because the angle is formed with v1 and v3 on different sides of v2.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's think again. The angle is formed with v2 as the vertex. So v1 and v3 must be on different sides of v2. So, for example, if you have v2, then v1 is k steps away in one direction, and v3 is l steps away in the other direction. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is (k + l) steps? Or is it (n - (k + l))? \n\nLet me think of the square example again. Let's take v2 as 2. v1 is 1 (k=1 step in clockwise direction?), v3 is 3 (l=1 step in counter-clockwise direction). The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be the arc that goes from 1 to 3 via 4. That's 2 steps (1 to 4, then 4 to 3). So that's 2 steps. Which is k + l = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. So the arc length is 2 steps. Then the angle is 2 * 180 / 4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: in the square, if v1 is 1 and v3 is 4. Then, v1 is adjacent to v2 (k=1 step) and v3 is two steps away from v2 in the other direction (since from 2 to 4 is two steps counter-clockwise). So k=1, l=2. Then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 would be k + l = 1 + 2 = 3 steps? Wait, but the arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain 2 is 1 step (from 1 to 4 directly). That contradicts the earlier idea. Hmm, this suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, what's the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2? For v1=1, v3=4, and v2=2. The arc that does not contain v2 is the arc from 1 to 4 that passes through 3. That's two steps (1 to 3 is one step, then 3 to 4 is another). So that's two steps. But according to k and l, which are 1 and 2, the sum is 3. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to re-express the relationship between k, l, and m. Let me think again.\n\nThe total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that passes through v2 is (k + l) steps. Because from v1 to v2 is k steps, and from v2 to v3 is l steps. Therefore, the arc that passes through v2 is (k + l) steps. The other arc (not passing through v2) is (n - (k + l)) steps. So m = n - (k + l) steps. \n\nSo in the example where v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4. Then, k is 1 (steps from v2 to v1 in one direction?), or is it steps from v1 to v2? Wait, I think k is the number of steps from v2 to v1 in one direction. Let me clarify:\n\nIf v1 is adjacent to v2 in the clockwise direction, then k is 1. If v3 is two steps away from v2 in the counter-clockwise direction, then l is 2. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 through v2 is k + l = 3 steps. The other arc is n - (k + l) = 4 - 3 = 1 step. Which would be the arc from 1 to 4 directly, which is one step. But earlier I thought that the arc between 1 and 4 not passing through v2 is two steps. What's the problem here?\n\nWait, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the arc that skips v2. So for v1=1, v3=4, and v2=2, the arc that does not contain v2 would be the arc from 1 to 4 that goes through 3. Which is two steps. But according to the calculation, it's 1 step. So clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nThis suggests that my formula for m is incorrect. Let me try to find the correct formula.\n\nLet me think of the square again. n=4. For v1=1, v2=2, v3=4. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 to 4 via the other side. But in the square, the vertices are arranged as 1, 2, 3, 4. So from 1 to 4, the arc that doesn't pass through 2 is the direct edge between 1 and 4 (if it exists). But in a square, each vertex is connected to its adjacent vertices. So there is no direct edge between 1 and 4. The edges are 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1. Oh right! So the arc from 1 to 4 that doesn't pass through 2 is the edge from 1 to 4 (which is one step). But in that case, the arc length is 1 step. Which would mean that the angle at v2 is 1 * 180 / 4 = 45 degrees. Which is correct as per the example where choosing v1=1, v2=2, v3=4 gives 45 degrees. So the formula m = n - (k + l) seems to hold here. Let me check:\n\nIn this case, k is the steps from v2 to v1 in one direction (say, clockwise). Since v1 is 1 and v2 is 2, moving clockwise from v2 (2) to v1 (1) would require going backwards, but perhaps k is the minimal steps in one direction. Or maybe I should think of k as the number of steps between v2 and v1 in the clockwise direction. So for v2=2 and v1=1, the clockwise steps from v2 to v1 would be 3 steps (2 → 3 → 4 → 1). But that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps k is the minimal number of steps between v2 and v1, but that's not helpful for our purpose.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps k and l are the numbers of steps between v2 and v1 and v2 and v3, but in such a way that the arc between v1 and v3 through v2 is k + l steps. So for example, if v1 is k steps away from v2 in one direction, and v3 is l steps away from v2 in the other direction, then the arc between v1 and v3 through v2 is k + l steps. Then, the arc not passing through v2 is n - (k + l) steps. \n\nIn the example where v2 is 2, v1 is 1 (1 step counter-clockwise from v2?), and v3 is 4 (2 steps clockwise from v2?), then k is 1 (steps from v2 to v1 in counter-clockwise direction?), l is 2 steps from v2 to v3 in clockwise direction. So the arc through v2 is 1 + 2 = 3 steps. The other arc is 4 - 3 = 1 step. Which gives m=1. Then the angle is 1 * 180 / 4 = 45 degrees. Which is correct. But how does that correspond to the actual arc between v1 and v3 not passing through v2? It's one step, which is the direct edge between 1 and 4. So that makes sense. \n\nSo the formula for the angle is m * 180 / n, where m = n - (k + l). But since k and l are the steps between v2 and v1 and between v2 and v3 in opposite directions, then k and l can be any positive integers such that k + l ≤ n-2. Because, for example, if k + l is larger than n-2, then the arc through v2 would be longer than the arc not through v2. But since we're considering the arc not containing v2, which is m steps, then m must be ≥ 2? Or not?\n\nWait, when k + l is 1, then m = n - 1 steps. Which would be the case when v1 and v3 are adjacent, but that's impossible because then they would be on the same side of v2. So I think that for valid choices of v1 and v3 (on different sides of v2), k and l must be at least 1. Therefore, k + l can range from 2 (when k=1, l=1) to n-2 (when k + l = n-2). Thus, m ranges from n - (n-2) = 2 steps to n - 2 steps. \n\nWait, no. Let's see:\n\nk and l are ≥1. So k + l ≥ 2. So m = n - (k + l) ≤ n - 2. Also, since k + l can be as small as 2, then m can be as large as n - 2. And when k + l is as large as possible (n-2), then m = n - (n-2) = 2. So m ranges from 2 to n-2. \n\nTherefore, for any valid triplet, the angle is (m * 180)/n degrees, where m is an integer between 2 and n-2, inclusive. \n\nSo our goal is to find m such that |(m * 180)/n - a| is minimized. Once we find the optimal m, we can construct any triplet that corresponds to that m.\n\nBut how to find m?\n\nLet me think: For a given n and a, we can compute the target m. Let's denote the desired angle as a. We want to find m such that (m * 180)/n is as close as possible to a. \n\nRearranging, m ≈ (a * n)/180. Since m must be an integer between 2 and n-2, we can compute the ideal m as (a * n)/180, then check the floor and ceiling of this value, and pick the one that gives the minimal difference. \n\nBut wait, for example, in the first sample input: n=3, a=15. The possible m values are 2 (since n-2=1, but wait n=3, so m ranges from 2 to n-2=1? That can't be. Wait, earlier analysis said m ranges from 2 to n-2. But for n=3, n-2=1. Which is less than 2. This suggests a mistake in my previous reasoning.\n\nOh! Oh no, this is a critical error. Let me re-examine the m range. \n\nFor n=3, the regular triangle. For any triplet, the angle at v2 must be formed by two vertices on different sides of v2. But since there are only three vertices, if v2 is fixed, the other two vertices are adjacent to it. So for example, v1 is adjacent to v2 in one direction, and v3 is adjacent in the other direction. Then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step (since the arc that contains v2 is 2 steps: from v1 to v2 to v3). So m = n - (k + l) = 3 - (1 + 1) = 1. Which is less than 2. But earlier I thought m ranges from 2 to n-2. Which is clearly not the case here. \n\nThis suggests that my earlier conclusion about m's range was wrong. So I need to re-express the correct range of m.\n\nLet me re-express the formula. The angle is (m * 180)/n degrees, where m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. For that arc to exist, v1 and v3 must be on different sides of v2. So, for example, in the case of n=3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step (the direct edge between v1 and v3). Thus, m=1. Which gives an angle of 1 * 180 / 3 = 60 degrees. Which matches the first sample input. So for n=3, m can be 1. \n\nBut earlier I thought m ranges from 2 to n-2. Which is clearly wrong. So where did I go wrong?\n\nThe mistake was in assuming that k and l are ≥1. But for n=3, k=1 and l=1 gives k + l = 2 steps. Then m = n - (k + l) = 3 - 2 = 1. Which is correct. So m can be as low as 1 (when k + l = n-1). \n\nSo the correct range for m is from 1 to n-2. Because:\n\nWhen k + l is 2 steps (minimum possible), m = n - 2.\n\nWhen k + l is n-1 steps (maximum possible), m = 1.\n\nWait, but how can k + l be up to n-1 steps?\n\nBecause k is the steps between v2 and v1 in one direction, l is steps between v2 and v3 in the other direction. So the maximum possible k + l would be when v1 is as far as possible from v2 in one direction, and v3 as far as possible in the other direction. For example, in a polygon with n=5, v2 is fixed. v1 is 2 steps away in one direction (so k=2), and v3 is 2 steps away in the other direction (l=2). Then k + l = 4 steps, which is n-1 = 5-1=4. Thus, m = 5 - 4 = 1. \n\nSo m can range from 1 to n-2. Because:\n\n- Minimum m is 1 (when k + l = n-1)\n- Maximum m is n-2 (when k + l = 2)\n\nSo the formula for the angle is m * 180 / n, where m is an integer between 1 and n-2 inclusive.\n\nAh, this changes everything. Now, for the sample input where n=3, m can be 1, which is allowed.\n\nSo now, the problem becomes: find m in [1, n-2] such that |(m * 180)/n - a| is minimized. Once we find this m, we can construct a triplet of vertices that corresponds to this m.\n\nOnce we find the best m, we need to find any triplet of vertices that forms this m. How to do that?\n\nLet me think. For example, given m, we can choose any v2, and then find v1 and v3 such that the arc between them not containing v2 is m steps. \n\nHow to select v1 and v3 for a given m and v2? Let's take v2 as any vertex, say vertex 1. Then, to have the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 be m steps, we need that the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n - m) steps. Which implies that the sum of k and l (steps between v2 and v1 in one direction, and v2 and v3 in the other) is (n - m) steps. \n\nBut since k and l are steps in opposite directions, their sum is (k + l) = (n - m). \n\nWe need to choose k and l such that k + l = n - m. Also, since k and l are ≥1 (because v1 and v3 are on different sides of v2), then n - m ≥ 2. Which implies that m ≤ n - 2. Which holds as per the range of m. \n\nSo for example, for a given m, n - m = k + l. We can choose k=1, l = (n - m) - 1. \n\nSo, for example, if v2 is fixed as vertex 1, then v1 can be vertex 2 (k=1 step in one direction), and v3 can be vertex (1 + l) steps in the other direction. Wait, how to compute the position of v3?\n\nLet me think of the polygon as being numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Let's choose v2 as vertex 1. Then, for k=1 steps in one direction (say, clockwise), v1 is vertex 2. Then, l = (n - m) - 1 steps in the other direction (counter-clockwise). So, from v2 (vertex 1), moving counter-clockwise l steps. Since counter-clockwise is equivalent to clockwise direction with steps (n - l) mod n. \n\nAlternatively, to find the position of v3, which is l steps away from v2 in the counter-clockwise direction. So for example, if the current vertex is 1, then moving counter-clockwise l steps would be vertex (1 - l) mod n. But since the numbering is from 1 to n, perhaps we can compute it as follows: \n\nIf we move counter-clockwise l steps from v2 (vertex 1), then the new vertex is (1 - l + n) % n. But since the vertices are numbered from 1 to n, we need to adjust for that. For example, if l=1, then vertex is 1 -1 = 0 → mod n (say n=4) would be 0 mod 4 = 0, but adding n gives 4. So the vertex would be 4. \n\nSo for v2 = 1, v1 = 2 (k=1 step clockwise), and v3 is (1 - l) mod n, where l = (n - m) - 1. \n\nBut l is (n - m) - 1 = n - m - 1. \n\nBut since k + l = n - m, and k=1, then l = n - m - 1. \n\nSo for example, if m=1 (as in the first sample), n=3. Then n - m = 3 -1 = 2. So l = 2 -1 = 1. So v3 is 1 - 1 = 0 mod 3 → 0 → 3. So the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=3. Which gives the angle of 1 * 180 / 3 = 60 degrees, which is correct. \n\nThus, for any m, we can choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as (1 - l) mod n, where l = n - m - 1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to choose the triplet once m is determined. For example, for any m, the triplet can be (v2, v1, v3) where v2 is 1, v1 is 2, and v3 is (v2 + (n - m - 1) + 1) mod n? Not sure. \n\nBut regardless, once m is determined, we can construct such a triplet. \n\nSo the plan for solving the problem is:\n\n1. Compute the desired m that minimizes the absolute difference between (m * 180 /n ) and a.\n\n2. Once m is found, construct a triplet (v1, v2, v3) that corresponds to this m.\n\nNow, the first step is to compute m. Let's think about how to compute m.\n\nGiven a, n, we can compute the ideal m as (a * n)/180. But since m must be an integer between 1 and n-2, we need to find the closest integer(s) to this value within the allowed range.\n\nBut since a can be up to 180, and m can be up to n-2, for example, when a is 180 degrees, the ideal m would be (180 * n)/180 = n. But since m can't be more than n-2, the maximum possible m is n-2. \n\nSo steps for finding m:\n\n- Calculate the ideal m as (a * n) / 180. Let's call this value m_ideal. \n\n- Since m must be integer, we check floor(m_ideal) and ceil(m_ideal), and also check if they are within the allowed range [1, n-2]. \n\nBut there may be multiple candidates. For example, if m_ideal is exactly between two integers, we need to compare both.\n\nBut also, we have to consider that m can't be less than 1 or greater than n-2. So, for example, if m_ideal is less than 1, then m=1 is the best option. Similarly, if m_ideal is larger than n-2, then m = n-2 is the best.\n\nOnce we find the candidate m values, we compute the absolute difference between (m * 180 /n) and a, and select the one with the minimal difference. If there's a tie, any of them can be chosen.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think of code steps. Let's say:\n\nCompute m_ideal = a * n / 180.0\n\ncandidates = list of possible m values around m_ideal.\n\nBut since m must be integer, we can check m_floor = floor(m_ideal), m_ceil = ceil(m_ideal). Also, need to handle cases where m_ideal is integer.\n\nBut also, need to clamp these values to the [1, n-2] range.\n\nOnce we have the candidates, compute for each the absolute difference and choose the best one.\n\nBut since m can be in the range [1, n-2], and for some cases, there",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves calculating the optimal angle using geometric properties of regular polygons and then determining the corresponding vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Angle in Regular Polygon**: The angle formed at a vertex `v2` by two other vertices `v1` and `v3` can be determined using the number of steps between these vertices along the arc that does not contain `v2`. This angle can be calculated using the formula: `angle = (m * 180) / n`, where `m` is the number of steps between `v1` and `v3` along the arc not containing `v2`.\n\n2. **Finding Optimal m**: The value of `m` that minimizes the difference between the calculated angle and the given angle `a` is found by checking values around the ideal value derived from `a`. This ideal value is calculated as `(a * n) / 180`.\n\n3. **Constructing Vertices**: Once the optimal `m` is determined, we construct the vertices such that the angle formed is closest to `a`. The vertices are chosen based on the calculated `m` and the constraints of the polygon.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Compute the ideal m\n    m_ideal = (a * n) / 180.0\n    \n    # Determine candidate m values\n    candidates = []\n    m_floor = int(m_ideal)\n    m_ceil = m_floor + 1\n    for m in [m_floor - 1, m_floor, m_floor + 1, m_ceil - 1, m_ceil]:\n        if 1 <= m <= n - 2:\n            candidates.append(m)\n    \n    # Also check boundaries if needed\n    if m_ideal < 1:\n        candidates.append(1)\n    elif m_ideal > n - 2:\n        candidates.append(n - 2)\n    \n    # Now find the best m among the candidates\n    best_m = None\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    for m in set(candidates):\n        angle = (m * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_m = m\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            if best_m is None or m < best_m:\n                best_m = m\n    \n    # Now construct the triplet\n    v2 = 1\n    k = 1  # steps from v2 to v1 in one direction\n    l = (n - best_m) - k  # since k + l = n - best_m\n    v1 = 2  # since v2 is 1, moving 1 step clockwise is 2\n    # v3 is l steps counter-clockwise from v2 (1)\n    v3 = (1 - l + n) % n\n    if v3 == 0:\n        v3 = n\n    \n    # Output the triplet v1, v2, v3\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Ideal m Calculation**: The ideal value of `m` is calculated based on the given angle `a` and the number of vertices `n`. This value is adjusted to find the closest integer values within the valid range [1, n-2].\n\n2. **Candidate Evaluation**: Potential values of `m` around the ideal value are evaluated to find the one that results in the smallest difference between the calculated angle and the target angle `a`.\n\n3. **Vertex Construction**: Once the optimal `m` is found, vertices are constructed such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is closest to `a`.
