String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, we need to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. The beautiful string has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's a catch: the string must be obtainable by modifying some original string through certain operations. \n\nWait, the problem says that we can perform modifications on the string. Each modification replaces the last two characters with one character. For example, if the string ends with two 0s, replacing them with a 1. Or if it ends with a 0 and 1, replace them with a 0? Wait, the description says: \"replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" Oh right. So, when you replace two characters, the new character is 1 if both were 0s, else 0. So, for example, replacing two 0s gives 1, replacing two 1s gives 0, replacing a 0 and 1 (in any order?) gives 0. Wait, the problem says \"two last characters\" so their order is fixed. But regardless of their order, if they are not both 0s, then the replacement is 0. So, for example, replacing '01' would become 0, same as replacing '10'?\n\nSo, the process of modifying the string reduces its length by one each time. And we can do this any number of times (including zero) as long as the string's length is at least two. \n\nBut the question is about the original string s. Wait, no. The problem says that the string s is beautiful if we can obtain character g from it with some number of modifications. Wait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications.\" So, the string s is considered beautiful if after performing some number of modifications (possibly zero), the final string (which would have length 1, since each modification reduces the length by 1) is equal to g. \n\nWait, but how? Because each modification reduces the length by 1. So starting with a string of length L, after k modifications, the length is L - k. To end up with a single character, the original string must have length k + 1, where k is the number of modifications. So the original string s must have a length such that after some number of modifications, it becomes a single character. But the problem says that the string s is beautiful if it meets the criteria of having exactly n zeros and m ones, and that we can obtain g from it via modifications. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the string s is beautiful if it meets the first condition (n zeros and m ones) and that we can get g from s via some modifications. So the question is to count all possible strings s with exactly n zeros and m ones such that after applying some number of modifications, the final string is g. \n\nBut how does the modification process work? Let's think about what the final character would be. Because each modification reduces the string's length by one, and the process continues until the string is length 1. So, for example, if the original string is of length l, then after l-1 modifications, you end up with one character. So for any string s, the process of applying all possible modifications (until it's length 1) will give a certain character. But the problem allows us to perform any number of modifications (not necessarily until the end). However, the problem says that we can perform some number of modifications (possibly zero) to obtain the character g. \n\nWait, but if you can perform any number of modifications, including stopping before reaching length 1. But then, how can you get g? Because if you stop at some step, you have a string of length >=1. But the problem says that the character g is obtained. So maybe the problem is that after performing some modifications, the final string has exactly one character (i.e., you applied enough modifications to reach length 1), and that character is g. Because otherwise, if you stop earlier, you have a longer string, but the problem says that the character g is obtained. So I think that the correct interpretation is that the final result after applying as many modifications as possible (until the string is length 1) must be equal to g. Because otherwise, if you can stop earlier, then for example, a string of length 2 could be modified once to get a single character. But if you don't modify it, then the string is length 2, which can't be considered as a single character. Therefore, the problem probably requires that the final character after applying all possible modifications (until length 1) is equal to g. \n\nSo the problem reduces to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of \"beautiful\" strings that can be formed using exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones such that after applying a series of allowed modifications, the final character is `g`. The key insight is understanding how the modifications affect the final character based on the initial string's structure.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Modifications**: Each modification reduces the string length by 1 by replacing the last two characters with a single character. If the two characters are both '0', they are replaced with '1'; otherwise, they are replaced with '0'.\n2. **Final Character Determination**: The final character after all possible modifications depends on the parity (even or odd) of the number of '0's and '1's in the string. Specifically:\n   - If the total number of characters (n + m) is even, the final character is determined by the parity of the number of '0's.\n   - If the total number of characters is odd, the final character is determined by the parity of the number of '1's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef comb(n, k, fact, inv_fact):\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    return fact[n] * inv_fact[k] % MOD * inv_fact[n - k] % MOD\n\ndef precompute_factorials(max_n, MOD):\n    fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_n + 1)\n    inv_fact[max_n] = pow(fact[max_n], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_n-1, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    return fact, inv_fact\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        m = int(input[idx+1])\n        g = int(input[idx+2])\n        cases.append((n, m, g))\n        idx += 3\n    \n    max_nm = 0\n    for n, m, _ in cases:\n        max_nm = max(max_nm, n + m)\n    \n    # Precompute factorials up to max_nm\n    fact, inv_fact = precompute_factorials(max_nm, MOD)\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, m, g in cases:\n        total = n + m\n        if total == 0:\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Determine the required parity\n        if total % 2 == 0:\n            # The final character is determined by the parity of the number of 0s\n            # Because total is even, the result is 1 if the number of 0s is odd, else 0\n            required = 1 if (n % 2 == 1) else 0\n        else:\n            # The final character is determined by the parity of the number of 1s\n            required = 1 if (m % 2 == 1) else 0\n        \n        if required != g:\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Now compute the number of ways to arrange n 0s and m 1s\n        res = comb(n + m, n, fact, inv_fact)\n        results.append(res)\n    \n    for r in results:\n        print(r)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Factorials**: We precompute factorials and their modular inverses up to the maximum possible value of `n + m` to efficiently compute combinations using modular arithmetic.\n2. **Combination Calculation**: For each test case, we calculate the number of ways to arrange `n` zeros and `m` ones using combinations.\n3. **Determine Validity**: Based on the parity of the total length of the string and the required final character `g`, we determine if the string can be modified to end with `g`. If not, the result is 0; otherwise, we use precomputed combinations to get the count of valid strings.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle large values of `n` and `m` while adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
