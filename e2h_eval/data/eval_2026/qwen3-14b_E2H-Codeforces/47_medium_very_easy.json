    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest k.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. So, the LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, for x = a +k and y = b +k. But since x and y are both increasing as k increases, maybe there's a way to find the optimal k by looking at the difference between a and b?\n\nWait, let's consider that when you add k to both a and b, the difference between them remains the same. Because (a +k) - (b +k) = a - b. So, the difference between the two numbers is fixed. Let me call this difference d. So d = a - b. Wait, but if a is bigger than b, then d is positive. But maybe I should take absolute value. Let me think: Let's say that d is the absolute difference between a and b. So, d = |a - b|.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, a=6 and b=10. The difference is 4. So, when we add k to both, the two numbers become 6 +k and 10 +k. Their difference is still 4. Now, the LCM of two numbers with a fixed difference. How can we minimize their LCM?\n\nWell, the LCM of two numbers x and y is minimized when they are as small as possible and have a large GCD. Since their difference is fixed, perhaps the optimal is to find x and y such that they are multiples of each other? Or perhaps when they share a common divisor as large as possible.\n\nWait, for example, if the two numbers are equal, then their LCM is themselves. Which would be the minimum possible. But that's only possible if a +k = b +k, which implies a = b. So if a and b are equal, then k=0 is the answer. But if they are not equal, then we can't have them equal. So the next best thing is to make them have the maximum possible GCD.\n\nSo, suppose that the difference between the two numbers is d. Let me assume that a < b. Then, the two numbers are x and x + d, where x = a +k. Then, the LCM of x and x +d is (x*(x +d))/gcd(x, x +d). But the gcd of x and x +d is the same as gcd(x, d). So, the LCM is (x*(x +d))/g, where g is gcd(x, d).\n\nSo, to minimize this, we need to maximize g, and also have x as small as possible. Because for a fixed d, the product x*(x +d) increases as x increases. However, if we can find a larger g, that could compensate for a larger x.\n\nBut how do we find the optimal x?\n\nAlternatively, since the difference is d, the optimal x is such that x is as small as possible and divides d. Because if x divides d, then the GCD of x and x +d is x. Because x +d = x +d, and since x divides d, then x divides x +d. So the GCD is x. Then, the LCM would be (x*(x +d))/x = x +d. Which is x +d. But since x is as small as possible, this would be minimized.\n\nWait, but x is (a +k). So, for example, if d is fixed, then the optimal x is the smallest possible divisor of d. But wait, x must be such that x >= a -k? No, wait, x is a +k. So, since k is non-negative, x is at least a. But if a is less than b, then d is b -a. So, x is a +k, and x +d = a +k + (b -a) = b +k. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the idea is that if we can find x such that x divides d, then the LCM is x +d. Which is (x +d) = (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k. But since x is a +k, and x divides d, then x must be a divisor of d. So, the minimal possible x is the minimal divisor of d that is >= a (since x = a +k, and k >=0 implies x >=a). Wait, no. Because if a is smaller than b, then x is a +k, which can be anything >=a. But d is b -a.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the minimal x >= a (since k is non-negative) such that x divides d. Then, the LCM will be x +d. But x is the minimal possible, so the LCM is minimized.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple divisors of d that are >= a? Then, the minimal x is the smallest such divisor. But then, the LCM is x +d. Which is minimized when x is as small as possible.\n\nBut wait, what if d is zero? That's when a = b. Then, the LCM is (a +k) because both numbers are the same. So the minimal LCM is achieved when k is zero. So, the answer is zero.\n\nSo, the approach seems to be:\n\nIf a == b, then return 0.\n\nElse, compute d = |a - b|. Let's assume that a < b, so d = b -a. Then, we need to find the minimal x >= a such that x divides d. Then, k = x - a. But wait, x is a +k, so k = x -a. So, the minimal x is the minimal divisor of d that is >= a. Then, the minimal k is x -a.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because in that scenario, the LCM of x and x +d is x +d, which is (a +k) +d = a +k + (b -a) = b +k. But since x divides d, then x divides (x +d) as well, so the LCM is (x +d) / (x) * x? No, wait, the LCM of x and x +d is (x * (x +d)) / gcd(x, x +d). Since x divides d, then x divides (x +d) (because x +d = x +d, and d is a multiple of x). So, gcd(x, x +d) = x. Therefore, LCM is (x * (x +d))/x = x +d. Which is the same as (x +d) = (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k. But since x is the minimal possible divisor of d that is >=a, then this gives the minimal possible LCM.\n\nBut what if there are no such divisors of d that are >=a? Well, since d is fixed, and x can be any number >=a. But for example, if a is larger than d, then the minimal x that divides d and is >=a would be d itself. Wait, no. For example, suppose d is 4, and a is 5. Then, the divisors of d are 1, 2, 4. All of which are less than 5. So, the minimal x is 5, but it's not a divisor of d. So, what's the approach here?\n\nIn this case, since x has to be >=a, which is larger than d. So, the minimal x is a. But then, x is a, which is not a divisor of d. So, then, the LCM would be (a * (a +d)) / gcd(a, d). But since d is (b -a), and a is larger than d, then a is larger than d. So, the GCD of a and d is the same as GCD(d, a mod d). But perhaps this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, but in this case, since x is a, and d is b -a. So, the two numbers are x = a +k = a (so k=0) and x +d = a +d = b. So, the LCM of a and b. But perhaps there's a better k. Like, for example, if a is 5, d is 4, then the numbers are 5 and 9. Their LCM is 45. But if we take x = 5 +k, and try to find a k that makes x divide d. But since d is 4, and x >=5, there's no such x. So, the minimal x is 5, which is not a divisor of 4. Then, the LCM is (5 * 9) / gcd(5,9) = 45/1 = 45.\n\nBut perhaps there's another k where the LCM is smaller. Let's see. Let's say k=1. Then x is 6, and x +d is 10. The LCM of 6 and 10 is 30. Which is smaller. So, in this case, choosing k=1 gives a better LCM. So, the previous approach of looking for x that divides d is not sufficient. Hmm, that suggests that my initial reasoning was wrong. So, I need to rethink.\n\nSo, what's the problem here? The initial idea was that making x divide d would give the minimal LCM. But in this example, x is 6 (which is not a divisor of d=4). But the LCM is 30, which is smaller than 45. So, the approach of finding x that divides d may not be sufficient.\n\nSo, why is that? Because the LCM is (x * (x +d)) / gcd(x, x +d). Which is (x * (x +d)) / gcd(x, d). Because x +d = x +d, and since d is fixed, the difference between the two numbers is d. So, the GCD of x and x +d is the same as GCD(x, d). So, the LCM is (x * (x +d)) / GCD(x, d).\n\nSo, the problem becomes to find x >= a (if a < b) such that this value is minimized. How to find x?\n\nBut since x is a +k, and k is non-negative, x can be any value >= a. But given that d is fixed, how can we find the x that minimizes the LCM?\n\nHmm. Let's think again. Let me take the example where a=5, b=9. Then, d=4. So, the two numbers are x and x+4, where x >=5.\n\nWe need to find x such that LCM(x, x+4) is minimized.\n\nFor x=5: LCM(5,9)=45.\n\nx=6: LCM(6,10) = 30.\n\nx=7: LCM(7,11) = 77.\n\nx=8: LCM(8,12)=24.\n\nx=9: LCM(9,13)= 117.\n\nx=4: but x must be >=5. So, the minimal is 24 when x=8. So, k is 8-5=3.\n\nSo the answer here would be 3. But according to the previous approach, since d=4, the divisors of d are 1, 2, 4. None of which are >=5. So, the approach would suggest x=5 (the minimal x >=a). But that gives a higher LCM than other possibilities.\n\nSo, the previous approach is incorrect. So, what's the right approach?\n\nAlternative idea: For the numbers x and x +d, their LCM is minimized when the GCD(x, x +d) is maximized. Because the LCM is (x*(x +d))/g, where g is the GCD. So, maximizing g would minimize the LCM. So, for a given x, the larger the GCD, the better.\n\nBut since the GCD(x, x +d) is the same as GCD(x, d), then for each x, the GCD is GCD(x, d). So, to maximize this, we need to find x such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding x >= a (assuming a < b) such that GCD(x, d) is maximized. Once we find that maximum possible GCD, then we can find the minimal x that achieves this, and then compute the LCM.\n\nBut how to find such x?\n\nLet me think. Let me denote that the maximum possible GCD(x, d) is m. Then, m must be a divisor of d. Because GCD(x, d) divides d.\n\nSo, the maximum m is the largest divisor of d such that there exists an x >= a where x is congruent to 0 mod m. Because x must be a multiple of m. So, for each divisor m of d, we can check if there exists an x >=a such that x is a multiple of m. Then, the largest such m would be the best.\n\nOnce we find the maximum possible m, then the minimal x is the smallest multiple of m that is >=a. Then, the corresponding k is x -a.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute d = abs(a -b). If d is zero, then return 0.\n\n2. Else, find all the divisors of d.\n\n3. Find the maximum m among the divisors of d such that there exists x >=a (if a <b) or x >=b (if b <a) where x is a multiple of m. Wait, but how does that work?\n\nWait, suppose that a < b. Then, x is a +k, which is >=a. So, x can be any value >=a. We want x to be a multiple of m, which is a divisor of d. So, the minimal x that is a multiple of m and >=a is ceiling(a/m)*m. But if a is already a multiple of m, then x =a.\n\nBut for m to be possible, there must be some x >=a. Since m divides d, and x can be as large as needed, there is always such x. So, the maximum m is the maximum divisor of d. But wait, the maximum divisor of d is d itself. So, for example, if d is 4, then the maximum m is 4. So, then, x must be a multiple of 4. The minimal x >=a is the first multiple of 4 >=a. For example, if a=5, then the first multiple is 8. Which is what happened in the example earlier. So, for m=4, x=8, which gives LCM(x, x +d) = (8 * 12)/4 = 24. Which is indeed the minimal possible.\n\nSo, in this case, the approach would be to find the maximum possible m (divisor of d), then find the minimal x that is a multiple of m and >=a. Then, the corresponding k is x -a.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute d = |a -b|.\n\nIf d is zero, then return 0.\n\nElse, find the maximum divisor m of d such that m is as large as possible. Then, compute x as the minimal multiple of m that is >=a (if a <b) or >=b (if b <a). Then, k = x -a (if a <b) or x -b (if b <a).\n\nWait, but why is the maximum m the best choice? Because m is the maximum possible GCD(x, d), which leads to the maximum possible denominator in the LCM formula. So, the LCM would be (x*(x +d))/m. Since x is the minimal multiple of m >=a, then x is as small as possible. So, the combination of x being small and m being large would lead to minimal LCM.\n\nSo, the key is to find the maximum possible m, which is the maximum divisor of d. But what is the maximum divisor of d? It's d itself. So, the maximum m is d. Then, we need to find the minimal x that is a multiple of d and >=a (if a <b). Let's see.\n\nIn the example where a=5, b=9, d=4. The maximum m is 4. So, the minimal x is the first multiple of 4 >=5. Which is 8. Then, k =8-5=3, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: in the first sample input, a=6, b=10. d=4. The maximum m is 4. So, x must be a multiple of 4 and >=6. The minimal x is 8. So, k is 8-6=2. Which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=10. d=5. Then, maximum m is 5. The minimal x is 5 (since a=5). So, k is 0. Which is the sample input's third example. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=21, b=31. d=10. The maximum m is 10. The minimal x is 21 +k = x, which must be a multiple of 10. The smallest multiple of 10 >=21 is 30. So, k is 30-21=9. Which matches the sample output. So this seems to work.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nCompute d = |a -b|. If d is 0, return 0.\n\nElse, find the maximum divisor of d, which is d itself. Then find the minimal x that is a multiple of d and >= min(a,b). Wait, no. Because if a <b, then x is a +k, which must be >=a. But the minimal x is the first multiple of d that is >=a. But if a is already a multiple of d, then x is a, and k=0.\n\nBut wait, in the case where a=6, b=10, d=4. The minimal x is 8. But why not take x=4? Because x must be >=a=6. So, the first multiple of d (4) that is >=a is 8.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nCompute d = |a -b|. If d is zero, return 0.\n\nElse, compute m =d. Then compute the minimal x which is the smallest multiple of m that is >= the smaller of a and b. Let me call the smaller one 's' (s = min(a,b)). Then, x = ((s + m -1) // m) * m. Then, k is x - s. But wait, if a is the smaller one, then x is a +k, so k = x -a. Similarly, if b is the smaller one, then k is x -b.\n\nWait, but in the case where a and b are swapped. Suppose that a=10, b=6. Then, d=4. Then, s =6. So x is the first multiple of 4 >=6, which is 8. Then, k is 8 -6 =2. So, the new a +k is 10 +2=12, and b +k is 6 +2=8. The LCM of 12 and 8 is 24. Which is same as before. So regardless of which is larger, the approach is to take the smaller of a and b as s, compute x as the first multiple of d >=s, then k is x -s.\n\nYes, because in that case, the two numbers are s +k and (the other) +k. But since d is the difference between the two, adding k to both gives numbers that are s +k and s +k +d. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nIf a == b: return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nd = abs(a -b)\n\ns = min(a, b)\n\nm =d\n\nx = the smallest multiple of m that is >=s.\n\nk =x -s.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because m is the maximum possible divisor of d, which gives the maximum possible GCD(x, d) = m. Which would give the minimal possible LCM.\n\nBut what if there is a larger m? No, because m is d, which is the maximum possible divisor of d.\n\nBut wait, what if d is not the maximum possible m? For example, if d is 4, then the maximum divisor is 4. So yes.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nBut let's test another case. Suppose a=7, b=11. d=4. s=7. The minimal multiple of 4 >=7 is 8. So k=8-7=1. Then, the numbers are 8 and 12. LCM is 24. What if there is a smaller LCM?\n\nLet's see. For example, if k=0, numbers are 7 and 11. LCM is 77. For k=1, 24. For k=2, 9 and 13: 117. For k=3, 10 and 14: LCM is 70. Which is higher than 24. So, the approach gives the correct answer.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=9. d=4, s=5. x is 8. k=3. Which gives LCM 8*12 /4 = 24. Which is the best possible.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=15. d=10. s=5. x is 10 (since 10 is the first multiple of 10 >=5). k=5. Then, numbers are 10 and 20. LCM is 20. Which is better than other options. For example, k=0: 5 and 15, LCM is 15. Oh wait! Wait, that's better. Wait, what's going on here?\n\nWait, this contradicts the approach. Let me check this example.\n\na=5, b=15. So d=10. s=5. According to the approach, m is 10. x is the first multiple of 10 >=5, which is 10. So k=10-5=5. Then the numbers are 5+5=10 and 15+5=20. LCM is 20. However, if k=0, then the numbers are 5 and 15. LCM is 15. Which is smaller than 20. So the approach gives a wrong answer here. Oh no! So there's a problem with the approach.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nIn this case, the approach says that the maximum m is 10. But the GCD(x, d) for x=5 is GCD(5, 10) =5. Which is larger than the GCD(x, d) when x is 10. Because GCD(10,10) is 10. So, why is the LCM for x=5 (which is 5) and x +d =15, which is 15. LCM(5,15) is 15. Which is better than 20.\n\nSo, the approach of taking m as d is not correct. Because in this case, even though m is 10 (the maximum divisor of d), the x chosen is 10, but there exists a smaller x (5) which is a multiple of m'=5 (a divisor of d=10) which gives a better LCM.\n\nSo, the previous approach is flawed. So, the mistake was in assuming that taking the maximum possible m (d) is the best option. However, in this case, taking a smaller m (like 5) gives a better result.\n\nSo, the problem is that the maximum m is not necessarily the best. Because the x for that m may be larger than another x for a smaller m, leading to a higher overall LCM.\n\nSo, the approach needs to be modified. How?\n\nWe need to find, among all possible divisors of d, the one that gives the minimal LCM when x is chosen as the minimal multiple of m >=s.\n\nSo, for each divisor m of d, compute the minimal x (>=s) which is a multiple of m. Then compute the LCM of x and x +d. Then select the m that gives the minimal LCM. If there are multiple m's with the same LCM, choose the one with the smallest x (and thus the smallest k).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to checking all divisors of d, and for each, compute the corresponding LCM, then pick the one with the minimal LCM, and minimal k in case of ties.\n\nBut how to find all divisors of d efficiently?\n\nFirst, let's think about the steps.\n\nGiven that d can be up to 1e9 (since a and b are up to 1e9), finding all divisors of d can be done in O(sqrt(d)) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, for each divisor m, we compute the minimal x (>=s) which is a multiple of m. Then compute the LCM of x and x +d. Then compare all these values and choose the best one.\n\nIn the example where a=5, b=15, d=10, s=5.\n\nThe divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.\n\nFor each m in [1,2,5,10], compute x and LCM:\n\nFor m=1: x is 5 (since 5 is >=5 and multiple of 1). x +d =5 +10=15. LCM(5,15)=15.\n\nFor m=2: x is 6 (the first multiple of 2 >=5). x +d=16. LCM(6,16) = 48.\n\nFor m=5: x is 5. x +d=15. LCM is 15.\n\nFor m=10: x is 10. x +d=20. LCM is 20.\n\nSo, the minimal LCM is 15. Which occurs for m=1 and m=5. For those, the x is 5 and 5. So, the corresponding k is 5 -s =0 (since s=5). So, k=0 is the answer. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to generate all the divisors of d, and for each, compute the corresponding x and LCM, then choose the one with the minimal LCM, and minimal k in case of tie.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors of d?\n\nYes. So, the plan is:\n\nCompute d = |a -b|. If d=0, return 0.\n\nElse, generate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor m of d, compute x as the smallest multiple of m that is >=s (where s is min(a,b)).\n\nThen compute the LCM of x and x +d.\n\nCompare all these LCMs, and choose the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple m's have the same LCM, choose the one with the smallest x (since x is s +k, so smaller x implies smaller k).\n\nOnce the best m is found, compute k = x -s.\n\nSo, the problem now is to generate all the divisors of d, and for each, compute x and the LCM.\n\nNow, how to generate all the divisors of d?\n\nFirst, factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all combinations. However, for d up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, we can find all the divisors by checking up to sqrt(d).\n\nLet me think of code for generating all the divisors of d.\n\nFunction to get all divisors of d:\n\nInitialize a list.\n\nfor i from 1 to sqrt(d):\n\n   if d %i ==0:\n\n      add i to the list.\n\n      if i != d//i, add d//i to the list.\n\nThen, after collecting all divisors, sort them.\n\nBut in our case, we need to process all divisors. However, for the case of d=0, but that's handled earlier.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, we can loop through each of them, compute x and the LCM.\n\nBut note that for each divisor m, we can have x as the minimal multiple of m that is >=s. So x = ((s + m -1) // m) * m.\n\nOnce x is computed, compute the LCM of x and x +d.\n\nBut since x +d = x + (b -a) if a <b, etc. But since d is |a -b|, and x is s +k, where s is min(a,b), then x +d is max(a,b) +k. So, the two numbers are x and x +d, which are (s +k) and (max(a,b) +k).\n\nBut the LCM of these two numbers is (x * (x +d)) / gcd(x, x +d) = (x * (x +d)) / gcd(x, d).\n\nBut since m is a divisor of d, and x is a multiple of m, then gcd(x, d) is at least m. Because x is a multiple of m, and d is a multiple of m (since m is a divisor of d). So, the GCD(x, d) is m * GCD(x/m, d/m). But since d/m is an integer.\n\nBut regardless, the LCM is (x * (x +d)) / g, where g is the GCD(x, d). However, since m divides d and x, then g is at least m.\n\nBut for the purposes of comparing different m's, perhaps we can compute the LCM as (x * (x +d)) // gcd(x, d).\n\nBut in code, this can be calculated using math.gcd.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nif a == b:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   d = abs(a -b)\n\n   s = min(a, b)\n\n   generate all divisors of d.\n\n   for each divisor m in divisors:\n\n       x = ((s + m -1) // m) * m\n\n       y = x + d\n\n       current_lcm = (x * y) // gcd(x, y)\n\n       keep track of the minimal current_lcm, and the corresponding k.\n\n   among all possible m's, select the one with minimal current_lcm. If tie, choose the one with minimal k.\n\nBut wait, how do we handle the case when multiple m's give the same LCM? For example, in the earlier example where m=1 and m=5 both give LCM of 15. In that case, the x for m=1 is 5, and for m=5 is 5. So k is 0 for both. So, the same k.\n\nBut what if two different m's give the same LCM but different k's? For example, suppose m1 and m2 generate x1 and x2 with same LCM but different k's. Then, we need to choose the one with the smaller k.\n\nSo, in the code, for each divisor m, compute x and the LCM. Then, collect all (current_lcm, k) pairs, and select the pair with the smallest current_lcm, and then the smallest k.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors? Also, note that the same m can be generated multiple times (for example, when d is a square, like 4, then 2 is generated once, but when i is 2 and d//i is 2, but we add it once). So, the code to generate the divisors must avoid duplicates.\n\nSo, the code for generating the divisors can be written as follows:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n\n        if n %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut for n=0, but in our case, d is non-zero.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, we can iterate over them, compute x and the LCM for each, and then find the best.\n\nBut in the example where a=5, b=15, the divisors of d=10 are 1, 2, 5, 10. For each, compute x and LCM.\n\nSo, the code would find the minimal LCM (15) and choose the corresponding k (0).\n\nThus, this approach would work.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut what about the case where d is zero? Well, handled by the initial check.\n\nNow, considering the example where a=5, b=15, the code would generate the divisors of 10, which are 1, 2, 5, 10, and then for each:\n\nm=1:\n\nx = ((5 +1 -1)//1) *1 = 5. y=5+10=15. LCM(5,15)=15.\n\nm=2:\n\nx = ((5 +2-1)//2) *2 = (6//2)*2= 3*2=6. y=6+10=16. LCM(6,16)=48.\n\nm=5:\n\nx= ((5 +5-1)//5)*5 = (9//5) *5= 1*5=5. y=5+10=15. LCM is 15.\n\nm=10:\n\nx= ((5+10-1)//10)*10 = (14//10)*10=1*10=10. y=20. LCM(10,20)=20.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 15, and for both m=1 and m=5, the k is 0. So the answer is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=9. d=4. divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\nCheck each:\n\nm=1: x=5. y=9. LCM(5,9)=45.\n\nm=2: x=6. y=10. LCM=30.\n\nm=4: x=8. y=12. LCM=24.\n\nSo the minimal is 24, which corresponds to k=3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=10. d=4. divisors 1,2,4.\n\nm=1: x=6. y=10. LCM=30.\n\nm=2: x=6 (since 6 is multiple of 2). y=10. LCM=30.\n\nm=4: x=8. y=12. LCM=24. So minimal is 24, k=2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=21, b=31. d=10. divisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\ns=21.\n\nfor m=1: x=21. y=31. LCM(21,31)= 651.\n\nm=2: x=22. y=32. LCM(22,32) = 352.\n\nm=5: x=25 (smallest multiple of 5 >=21 is 25). y=35. LCM(25,35) = 175.\n\nm=10: x=30. y=40. LCM is 120.\n\nSo the minimal is 120, which is for m=10. k=30-21=9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nif a == b: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\nd = abs(a -b)\n\ns = min(a, b)\n\ngenerate all divisors of d.\n\nfor each divisor m in divisors:\n\n   compute x = ((s + m -1) // m) * m\n\n   compute y = x +d\n\n   compute current_lcm = lcm(x, y)\n\n   keep track of the minimal current_lcm and the corresponding k.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, select the k with the minimal current_lcm, and if tie, the smallest k.\n\nBut how to compute lcm(x, y)? Well, in Python, math.gcd exists, and lcm can be computed as x * y // gcd(x, y).\n\nBut note that in Python 3.9+, there is math.lcm, but perhaps for compatibility, better to use the formula.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(x, y):\n\n    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)\n\nNow, for each m, compute x and y, then compute the LCM.\n\nOnce all divisors are considered, select the best.\n\nNow, the code for generating the divisors.\n\nBut note that the code for generating the divisors must include all divisors, including 1 and d.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut in Python,",
