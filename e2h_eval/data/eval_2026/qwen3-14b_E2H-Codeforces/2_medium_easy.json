Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. The problem says that the X is formed when both diagonals have the same letters, and all other squares have the same letter different from the diagonals. So, how do I check this?\n\nFirst, let me think about the structure. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonals are from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left. All the cells on these diagonals must be the same. Also, all the other cells (non-diagonal) must be the same, but different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Check all the cells on the two diagonals. They should all be the same character. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check all the other cells (not on the diagonals) and ensure they are all the same character, say 'o_char', and that 'o_char' is not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how do I check the diagonals and the other cells?\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through the cells. For each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n- It's on the main diagonal if i == j.\n- It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo for all cells, check if they are on either of these diagonals. If they are, they must be equal to d_char. Otherwise, they must be equal to o_char, which is different from d_char.\n\nBut first, I need to collect all the characters on the diagonals and check they are the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are the same and different.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple different characters on the diagonals? Like, suppose some cells on the diagonals have different letters. Then it's invalid.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Collect all the diagonal characters. Check they are all the same. Let's say the first diagonal character is d_char. Then all others must be equal to it.\n\nSimilarly for the non-diagonal characters. Collect all non-diagonal characters, check they are all same, and different from d_char.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think. For each cell in the grid:\n\nLoop through each row and column. For each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's part of the diagonals. Else, it's part of the others.\n\nSo first, collect all diagonal characters. Check that they are all the same. Then collect all non-diagonal characters, check they are all same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping cells? For example, the center cell of an odd-sized square is part of both diagonals. But that's okay, since it's counted once. So when collecting the diagonal characters, we can collect all cells that are on either diagonal, but make sure that each cell is considered once. However, for checking, if the cell is on either diagonal, it must be equal to d_char.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead the grid as a list of lists.\n\nCheck for all cells:\n\n- For each cell (i,j):\n\n   if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1):\n\n       add to diagonal_chars\n\n   else:\n\n       add to other_chars\n\nThen:\n\nCheck that all elements in diagonal_chars are the same. Let's call that d_char.\n\nCheck that all elements in other_chars are the same. Let's call that o_char.\n\nCheck that d_char != o_char.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no other_chars? Like when n=1? But according to input constraints, n is at least 3. So for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells (since the center is counted in both). So other_chars would be 9-5=4 cells. So for n=3, the other_chars is 4 cells.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n, then n lines follow. Each line is a string of length n.\n\nSo for example, for the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe diagonals are positions where i == j or i + j = 4 (since n=5, n-1=4).\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (i==j) and i + j = 0+0=0 !=4. So it's on the main diagonal. So the cell is x.\n\nSimilarly, for i=0, j=4: i + j = 4, so it's on the anti-diagonal. So that's x.\n\nBut for i=2, j=2: i==j and i+j=4 (since 2+2=4). So it's part of both diagonals. So the cell is x.\n\nBut in the third row (i=2), the cell (2,2) is 'x', but the other cells in the row may not be part of the diagonals. Let's see for the sample input.\n\nBut in the third row, the row is 'soxoo'. So for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2 !=4. So not part of diagonals. So that's 's' which is part of other_chars. So in this case, the other_chars includes 's', which would be different from the diagonal's 'x' (assuming that all diagonals are x). But in this case, the sample output is NO. Because in the third row, the cell (2,0) is 's' which is part of other_chars. But the other_chars would have to be all same. But in this case, there are other_chars that are not same. So the code would detect that.\n\nSo the code needs to collect all the diagonal characters and check they are same, and collect all others and check same and different.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line as a string. Let's store them in a grid variable, which is a list of lists.\n\nThen, collect diagonal_chars and other_chars.\n\nInitialize diagonal_chars as empty list, other_chars as empty list.\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen, check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1: return NO\n\nelse:\n\n   d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n\nif len(set(other_chars)) != 1: return NO\n\nelse:\n\n   o_char = other_chars[0]\n\nif d_char == o_char: return NO\n\nelse: return YES\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, since n is at least 3, for n=3, the number of other_chars is 9 - 5 = 4. So other_chars is not empty. So no problem.\n\nBut for n=1, but n is >=3. So no problem.\n\nSo this logic should work.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nLooking at the diagonals:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: yes, diagonal. x.\n\ni=0, j=4: yes, diagonal. x.\n\ni=1, j=1: yes, x. i=1, j=3: yes, x.\n\ni=2, j=2: yes, x. i=2, j=2 is part of both diagonals.\n\ni=3, j=1: yes, i + j = 3+1=4 (n-1=4). So yes. x.\n\ni=3, j=3: yes, i==j. x.\n\ni=4, j=0: i + j = 4+0=4: yes. x.\n\ni=4, j=4: yes, x.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars would be all x's except for the cell (2,0) ?\n\nWait no. Wait, for i=2, j=0: i=2, j=0. i + j = 2+0=2 !=4. So not part of the diagonals. So the cell (2,0) is 's' which is in other_chars. So in the diagonal_chars, the cells are:\n\nLooking for all (i,j) where i ==j or i +j =4.\n\nFor i=0, j=0, 4.\n\ni=1, j=1, 3.\n\ni=2, j=2, 2.\n\ni=3, j=1, 3.\n\ni=4, j=0, 4.\n\nWait, for i=0, j=0, 4.\n\nSo the cells in the diagonals are:\n\n(0,0) x\n\n(0,4) x\n\n(1,1) x\n\n(1,3) x\n\n(2,2) x\n\n(3,1) x\n\n(3,3) x\n\n(4,0) x\n\n(4,4) x\n\nWait, that's 9 cells. Because for n=5, each diagonal has 5 cells, but the center cell (2,2) is part of both. So total is 5 + 5 -1 =9 cells.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars would be all x's except for (2,2)? Wait no. In the sample input, row 2 is 'soxoo'. So (2,2) is x. So all the diagonal cells are x. So diagonal_chars is all x's. Then, other_chars includes the 's' in (2,0). So other_chars would have 's' and others. So the other_chars are not all same. So the code would return NO, which matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'.\n\nLet's parse that. n=3.\n\ngrid:\n\nrow 0: w s w\n\nrow 1: s w s\n\nrow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells where i==j or i +j =2.\n\ni=0, j=0: yes. w.\n\ni=0, j=2: yes. w.\n\ni=1, j=1: yes. w.\n\ni=2, j=0: yes (i +j = 2+0=2). w.\n\ni=2, j=2: yes. w.\n\nSo diagonal_chars is [w, w, w, w, w]. All same.\n\nOther chars are the cells not on diagonals. Let's see:\n\nFor i=0, j=1: not on diagonals. So cell is s.\n\ni=1, j=0: cell is s.\n\ni=1, j=2: cell is s.\n\ni=2, j=1: cell is s.\n\nSo other_chars is [s, s, s, s]. All same. And s != w. So output is YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe.\n\nn=3. grid:\n\nrow0: x p x\n\nrow1: p x p\n\nrow2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells (i==j or i +j=2).\n\ncells:\n\n(0,0) x\n\n(0,2) x\n\n(1,1) x\n\n(2,0) x (i=2, j=0: 2+0=2)\n\n(2,2) e.\n\nSo diagonal_chars are [x, x, x, x, e]. So set is {x, e} → len is 2. So condition fails. So output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are same, others are same and different.\n\nLike:\n\nxxx\n\nxax\n\nxxx → here, the diagonals are all x. other chars are a. So output YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are all x, but other chars have two different letters. So output NO.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to read the input.\n\nIn Python, the input is read from stdin. The first line is n, then n lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings, but in actual code, the input is read via input() function.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Then n lines of n letters.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string. For example, in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut then, for each row, grid[i][j] is the j-th character of the i-th row.\n\nSo the code can proceed as:\n\nCollect diagonal_chars and other_chars.\n\nSo:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\n\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelif diagonal_chars[0] == other_chars[0]:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, the number of other_chars is 3*3 - 5 = 4. So no problem.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? For example, n=1, but n is not allowed. So no problem.\n\nNow, code-wise, what about the case when other_chars is empty? Well, since n is at least 3, and for n=3, other_chars is 4 elements. So no problem.\n\nNow, let's test for the case where the diagonals have all same, others have all same, but same as diagonals. For example:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa → diagonals are a, others are a. So the code will check that other_chars is same, but then check if diagonal and other are different. Since they are same, output NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are a, others are b. Then output YES.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, when you read input, sometimes there might be leading or trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. So input().strip() would be okay, but perhaps better to use input().strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespace.\n\nBut in the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the input lines are exactly of length n. So perhaps using input().strip() is safe. But if the input is given with leading or trailing spaces, but according to problem statement, it's not. So perhaps just read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut perhaps, in some cases, the input lines may have leading or trailing spaces. However, according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. So perhaps it's better to read each line as input().strip(), but maybe even just input() would be okay. But in practice, for programming competition problems, the input is exactly as given. So for example, for the first sample input, the lines are like 'xooox', which is 5 characters.\n\nThus, the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is input().strip().\n\nThen process as above.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif diagonal_chars[0] == other_chars[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, other_chars has 4 elements. So no problem.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? For example, n=1. But n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut what if n=3, and all cells are on diagonals? No, for n=3, there are 5 cells on diagonals, and 4 others. So other_chars is 4 elements.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\ndiagonal_chars is all x's except for cell (2,2) ?\n\nWait, the third row is 'soxoo'.\n\nAt i=2, j=2, which is part of the diagonals. So grid[2][2] is 'x' (since the third row is 'soxoo' → indexes 0: 's', 1: 'o', 2: 'x', 3: 'o', 4: 'o'. So yes, (2,2) is x. So diagonal_chars is all x's. Then other_chars includes the 's' (i=2, j=0) and others. So other_chars would have 's' and other letters. So len(set(other_chars)) is more than 1. So code returns NO.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3, input:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ngrid:\n\nrow 0: 'wsw' → indexes 0: 'w', 1: 's', 2: 'w'\n\nrow 1: 'sws' → indexes 0: 's', 1: 'w', 2: 's'\n\nrow 2: 'wsw' → indexes 0: 'w', 1: 's', 2: 'w'\n\ndiagonal_chars:\n\ncells (0,0) → w, (0,2) → w, (1,1) → w, (2,0) → w, (2,2) → w. So all w. So set is {w}.\n\nother_chars: cells (0,1) → s, (1,0) → s, (1,2) → s, (2,1) → s. So set {s}. So check if w != s. So output YES.\n\nSample 3:\n\nn=3, input:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ngrid:\n\nrow0: x p x\n\nrow1: p x p\n\nrow2: x p e\n\ndiagonal_chars:\n\ncells (0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So set is {x, e} → len 2 → print NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all x's. Then diagonals are x, others are x. So code checks that other_chars is same. But then diagonal and other are same → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are x, others are y. Output YES.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same but different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Character Collection**: Separate the characters into two groups:\n   - Characters on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).\n   - Characters on the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n   - Characters not on either diagonal.\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Check if all characters on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Check if all non-diagonal characters are the same.\n   - Ensure the characters on the diagonals are different from the non-diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif diagonal_chars[0] == other_chars[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first input line is the integer `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Character Classification**: We iterate through each cell in the grid.
