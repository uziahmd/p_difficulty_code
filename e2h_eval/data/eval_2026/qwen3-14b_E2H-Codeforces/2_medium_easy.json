Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. Let me think about the requirements.\n\nSo, the problem says that the letters form an X if two conditions are satisfied. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to check the diagonals. The main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All the cells in these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping cells? Like, in a square with odd length, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the middle cell is on both diagonals. So when checking the diagonals, we need to make sure that all cells in both diagonals are the same. But since the center is part of both, that's okay as long as all the cells in both diagonals are the same.\n\nSo first step: collect all the characters in the two diagonals and check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how do I check that?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the input. The first line is n, then n lines each with n characters.\n\n2. For each cell in the grid, determine if it's on either of the two diagonals.\n\nFor a cell at (i, j), where i and j are 0-based indices:\n\n- Main diagonal: i == j.\n\n- Anti-diagonal: i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo any cell that is on either of these two conditions is part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, for all cells not on these diagonals, they should be the same character, say 'c', and the diagonals should be a different character, say 'd'.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Collect all characters from the diagonals. Check that they are all the same. Let's call this diagonal_char.\n\n- Collect all characters not on the diagonals. Check that they are all the same and not equal to diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to collect those?\n\nFirst, iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal. If yes, add to diagonal_chars. Else, add to other_chars.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So all the characters in both diagonals must be the same. So for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti-diagonal has 'x', then that's okay. But if one of them has a different character, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the first thing is to check that all characters in the diagonals are the same. So, collect all the characters from both diagonals and check that they are all the same.\n\nOnce that is done, check that all the other characters are the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst example input is:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nLet me visualize this. The diagonals would be:\n\nRow 0: x (0,0), then row 1: o (1,1), row 2: x (2,2), row 3: o (3,3), row 4: x (4,4). Wait, no. Wait for the main diagonal. For a 5x5 grid, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). The anti-diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). So the diagonals include (2,2) which is part of both.\n\nSo for the first example:\n\nLooking at the diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: first row's first character is x, second row's second is o, third row's third is x, fourth row's fourth is o, fifth row's fifth is x. So the characters here are x, o, x, o, x. So they are not all the same. Therefore, the first example output is NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the first step is to collect all the diagonal characters and check if they are all the same. Then collect the others and check if they are all same and different.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of n characters. Let's store it as a grid, perhaps a list of lists.\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == n-1. If yes, it's part of the diagonal.\n\nSo, collect all the diagonal characters. Then check if all are same.\n\nThen collect all the non-diagonal characters. Check if all are same and not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to check if all elements in a list are same?\n\nFor example, for the diagonal_chars list, check that all elements are equal to the first element.\n\nSimilarly for the other_chars.\n\nBut what if there are no other characters? Well, since n is odd and >=3, for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 cells (since the center is counted once). The total number of cells is n^2. So for n=3, 9 cells. The diagonals have 5 cells, so other cells are 4. So in that case, other_chars would have 4 elements. So in general, for n odd, the number of diagonal cells is 2n -1 (since for each of the n rows, the main diagonal has one cell, and the anti-diagonal has one cell, but the center is counted twice. So total is n + (n-1) = 2n -1? Because for the anti-diagonal, there are n cells, but the main diagonal has n cells. However, the overlapping cell is counted once. So total is n + n -1 = 2n-1.\n\nSo the number of non-diagonal cells is n² - (2n-1) = (n² - 2n +1) = (n-1)^2. Which for n=3 is 4, which is correct.\n\nSo, for the other_chars, if there are any, they must all be same and different from diagonal_char.\n\nBut what if the other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no, for n >=3, other_chars is (n-1)^2, which for n=3 is 4, so there are some cells.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nRead grid.\n\nCollect diagonal_chars and other_chars.\n\nCheck that all diagonal_chars are same. If not, return NO.\n\nCheck that all other_chars are same. If not, return NO.\n\nCheck that the diagonal_char is different from other_char. If not, return NO.\n\nElse, return YES.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line as a string. Let's say grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif diagonal_chars[0] == other_chars[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, other_chars has 4 elements. For n=3, (n-1)^2 is 4. So no, other_chars can't be empty.\n\nBut for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? Well, the code would have len(set(...)) as 1, but that's not possible. But since n >=3, other_chars is not empty.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nNow, the diagonals:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\ni == j or i +j = 4 (since n-1 is 4).\n\nLooking at i=0, j=0 (yes), i=0, j=4 (yes). For i=1, j=1 (yes), j=3 (yes). i=2, j=2 (yes), j=2 (since i +j = 2+2=4? Yes. So for i=2, j=2 is in both diagonals. So for the diagonals, the characters are:\n\nRow 0: x (0,0), x (0,4)\n\nRow 1: x (1,1), o (1,3)\n\nRow 2: x (2,2)\n\nRow 3: o (3,1), x (3,3)\n\nRow 4: x (4,4), x (4,0)\n\nWait, let me collect all the diagonal characters:\n\nFor i from 0 to 4:\n\ni=0, j=0: x; j=4: x. So two entries.\n\ni=1, j=1: x; j=3: o.\n\ni=2, j=2: x.\n\ni=3, j=1: o; j=3: x.\n\ni=4, j=0: x; j=4: x.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars list would be:\n\nx, x, x, o, x, o, x, x, x, x ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should list all the cells:\n\nFor each i and j:\n\ni=0:\n\nj=0: yes (i==j). So add x.\n\nj=1: no.\n\nj=2: no.\n\nj=3: no.\n\nj=4: yes (i+j=0+4=4). Add x.\n\ni=1:\n\nj=0: no.\n\nj=1: yes (i==j). Add x.\n\nj=2: no.\n\nj=3: yes (i+j=1+3=4). Add o.\n\nj=4: no.\n\ni=2:\n\nj=0: no.\n\nj=1: no.\n\nj=2: yes. Add x.\n\nj=3: no.\n\nj=4: no.\n\ni=3:\n\nj=0: no.\n\nj=1: yes (i+j=3+1=4). Add o.\n\nj=2: no.\n\nj=3: yes (i==j). Add x.\n\nj=4: no.\n\ni=4:\n\nj=0: yes (i +j =4+0=4). Add x.\n\nj=1: no.\n\nj=2: no.\n\nj=3: no.\n\nj=4: yes (i==j). Add x.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars are:\n\nx, x, x, o, x, o, x, x, x, x ?\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nFor each cell:\n\n(0,0) x\n\n(0,4) x\n\n(1,1) x\n\n(1,3) o\n\n(2,2) x\n\n(3,1) o\n\n(3,3) x\n\n(4,0) x\n\n(4,4) x\n\nWait, that's 9 elements? Wait for n=5, 2n-1 = 9 elements. So yes.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars list is [x, x, x, o, x, o, x, x, x]. Wait, let me check again:\n\ni=0, j=0: x.\n\ni=0, j=4: x.\n\ni=1, j=1: x.\n\ni=1, j=3: o.\n\ni=2, j=2: x.\n\ni=3, j=1: o.\n\ni=3, j=3: x.\n\ni=4, j=0: x.\n\ni=4, j=4: x.\n\nSo that's 9 elements. So the list is [x, x, x, o, x, o, x, x, x]. So the set of this is {x, o}, so len(set(...)) is 2. So the first condition fails. Hence output is NO. Which matches the first sample.\n\nSecond sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (w), j=2 (w).\n\ni=1, j=1 (w).\n\ni=2, j=0 (w), j=2 (w).\n\nSo the diagonal characters are:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w, (1,1) w, (2,0) w, (2,2) w. So all are w. So diagonal_chars is [w, w, w, w, w]. So set is size 1.\n\nOther chars are the non-diagonal cells. Let's see:\n\nFor each cell not on diagonals.\n\nFor i=0, j=1: s.\n\ni=1, j=0: s, j=2: s.\n\ni=2, j=1: s.\n\nSo other_chars is [s, s, s, s]. All same. And different from w. So output YES. Which matches sample.\n\nThird sample input is 3:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x.\n\n(1,1) x.\n\n(2,0) x, (2,2) e.\n\nSo diagonal characters are x, x, x, x, e. So the set is {x, e} → len is 2. So first condition fails. Hence output NO. Which matches sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are same, others same and different.\n\nLike:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nWait, diagonals are (0,0) a, (0,2) a, (1,1) b, (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal_chars are a, a, b, a, a. So set is {a, b} → len is 2. So returns NO. So that's correct.\n\nAnother case where diagonals are same, but other_chars are same but same as diagonal. Like:\n\nall cells are same. Then, diagonals are same, other_chars same, but same as diagonal. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case where diagonals are same, other_chars are same but same as diagonal. So, for example, all cells are 'a'. Then, the code checks that other_chars are same (they are) but then compares diagonal_char (a) with other_char (a). So returns NO.\n\nAnother case where diagonals are same, other_chars are same and different. So returns YES.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut need to read the input. However, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the input is given as first line n, then n lines. So for example, in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo in code, read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen process as before.\n\nBut need to make sure that each line is exactly n characters. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nSo, code:\n\nRead n, then read n lines.\n\nNow, collect diagonal and other chars.\n\nThen check the conditions.\n\nNow, code:\n\nSo:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = []\nothers = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            others.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check diagonals are all same\nif len(set(diagonal)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Check others are all same and different from diagonal\n    if len(set(others)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if diagonal[0] == others[0]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but what if others is empty? Well, for n=3, others has 4 elements. So no.\n\nBut for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=5, grid as above. The diagonal has multiple characters. So first check len(set(diagonal)) is not 1 → print NO.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ndiagonal is [w, w, w, w, w]. set is size 1. others is [s, s, s, s]. set size 1. and w != s → YES.\n\nSample input 3:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiagonal is [x, x, x, x, e]. set size is 2 → print NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all 'a's. Then, diagonals are all 'a's, others are all 'a's. So the code checks that others are same (yes), but then compares diagonal[0] (a) and others[0] (a) → same, so print NO.\n\nAnother test case where diagonals are 'a' and others are 'b'. Then code returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, what about when others is empty? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, others is 4 elements. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, diagonals are all 'a', others are all 'a' → output NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are all 'a', others are all 'b' → output YES.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria.
