The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all tasks before it), we need to process them in sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The explanation is that she moves 1→2→3 (time 2), then from 3 to 4→1→2 (time 3 more, total 5?), then from 2 to 3 (time 1 more, total 6). Wait, the total steps are 6. Oh right, because each move between adjacent houses is 1 unit. So the total steps are the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, considering the direction (clockwise only).\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, where each distance is the minimal steps needed to get from the current position to the next task's house, moving clockwise.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nLet's think about the movement between two consecutive tasks. Suppose Xenia is currently at position current_pos, and the next task is at target_pos. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the ringroad is a circle, moving clockwise, the distance between current_pos and target_pos is (target_pos - current_pos) mod n if we take the clockwise direction. Wait, no. Wait, if current_pos is 3 and target is 2, and n is 4. Then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But (target - current) is (2-3) = -1. But mod 4, that would be 3. So yes, (target - current) mod n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, if target is larger than current, then (target - current) is positive, which is the correct steps. If target is smaller, then (target - current) is negative, but mod n gives the correct steps. For example, (2-3) mod 4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nWait, but for example, if current is 1 and target is 3, then the distance is 2 steps (1→2→3). Which is (3-1) = 2. Which is correct. So yes, the formula for the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which is equivalent to (target - current) % n. But since in Python, modulo can return negative values, but perhaps in our case, since target and current are between 1 and n, maybe we can compute it as (target - current) if target >= current else (target - current + n). Or perhaps (target - current + n) % n. Let me check.\n\nFor example, current is 3, target is 2, n=4. (2-3 +4) = 3. Which is correct. If current is 2, target is 3, then (3-2) = 1, which is correct. So yes, the formula (target - current) if target >= current else (target - current + n) would work. Alternatively, (target - current + n) % n. Because for example, (2-3 +4) mod 4 is 3 mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. So the distance between current and target is (target - current + n) % n. But since in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result when the denominator is positive, so (target - current) % n would give the correct value. Wait, let me test:\n\nIf current is 3, target is 2, n=4. (2-3) = -1. -1 % 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between current and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, what if current is 1, target is 1? Then the distance is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nWe need to process the tasks in order. We track Xenia's current position. Initially, it's 1. Then, for each task in the list, we compute the distance from current position to the task's position, add that to the total time, and update the current position to the task's position.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given as a list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. But the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So, for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the distance between them is zero. So, the code should process all tasks in order, and for each task, compute the distance from the previous position (which is the position of the previous task) to the current task's position.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nInitialize total_time = 0\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\nfor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n    distance = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    current_pos = a_i\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but let's test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=4, m=3, tasks are [3,2,3]\n\nInitial current_pos = 1.\n\nFirst task is 3:\n\ndistance = (3-1) mod 4 = 2 mod4 = 2. total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2: (2-3) mod4 = (-1) mod4 = 3. total_time becomes 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1. total_time is 5+1=6. Which matches the example. So yes.\n\nAnother example: the second input is '4 3\\n2 3 3'. Output is 2.\n\nLet's compute:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1. total_time is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1. total_time is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-3) mod4 = 0. total_time remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: process each task in order, compute the distance from the previous position to the current task's position, add to the total, and update the current position.\n\nBut why is this correct? Because the problem requires that all tasks before i must be completed before i. So the order of processing is exactly the order of the tasks. So, for each task in order, we have to move from the previous task's position to the current one.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the input is read as two lines. The first line is n and m. The second line is m integers.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first input is given as ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']? Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user provided two examples. The first input is:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nOutput: 6\n\nSecond input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nOutput: 2.\n\nSo the code needs to read from standard input. So in Python, the code will read the first line as n and m, then the second line as a list of m integers.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the list of a_i's.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nIn Python, the code can be:\n\nRead the first line as n, m.\n\nThen read the second line as list of integers.\n\nThen, initialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nLoop through each a in the list:\n\n   distance = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_pos = a\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nWait, but what if n is 1? Well, according to the constraints, n is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nBut let's check for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All tasks are in the same house.\n\nFor example, n=5, m=3, tasks [1,1,1]. Then the total time is 0.\n\nYes, because initial position is 1, and each step is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: tasks require moving around the ring multiple times.\n\nLike n=5, m=2, tasks [1, 5]. Then the first step is (1-1) mod5=0. Then second step is (5-1) mod5=4. So total time is 4.\n\nBut moving from 1 to 5 is 4 steps (clockwise: 1→2→3→4→5).\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, tasks [1, 2]. Then the first step is (1-1) mod2=0. Then (2-1) mod2=1. Total is 1.\n\nWhich is correct: moving from 1 to 2 is one step.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, tasks [2,1]. Then first step is (2-1) mod2=1. Then (1-2) mod2= ( -1 ) mod2=1. Total is 2. Which is correct: from 1→2 (1 step), then from 2→1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive value. For example, (-1) % 4 is 3. So (a - current_pos) % n will correctly compute the distance.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is read from stdin. So for example, the first line is read as n and m. The second line is read as m integers.\n\nIn Python, the code can be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n\n    diff = (a - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = a\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's test with the first example:\n\nSample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 3. (3-1) mod4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond a is 2. (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4 = 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird a is 3. (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond a is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-3) mod4 = 0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut what about when the list is empty? Well, according to the constraints, m is at least 1. Because m is given as 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test another case where the tasks are in reverse order. For example, n=5, m=2, tasks [5,1]. Then the first step is (5-1) mod5 = 4. Then (1-5) mod5 = ( -4 ) mod5 = 1. So total is 4 + 1 =5. Which is correct: moving from 1 to 5 (4 steps), then from 5 to 1 (1 step). Total 5 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently calculate the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to move to a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time.\n2. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving from one house to another can be calculated using modular arithmetic. The distance between two houses `current_pos` and `target_pos` on a ringroad with `n` houses is given by `(target_pos - current_pos) % n`. This formula ensures that the movement is always calculated in the clockwise direction.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task, compute the distance from Xenia's current position to the target house of the task, accumulate the total time, and update her current position to the target house.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for a in a_list:\n        diff = (a - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = a\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of task positions.\n- **Initialization**: Xenia starts at house 1, and we initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task position in the list, compute the distance from the current position using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. Update the total time and current position after each task.\n- **Output Result**: The accumulated total time is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time with a linear pass through the list of tasks, ensuring an optimal time complexity of O(m), which is suitable given the problem constraints.",
