The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks in certain houses arranged in a ringroad. The goal is to calculate the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. \n\nSo, the problem says that each task i requires her to be in house ai, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. Oh right, so the order of tasks is important. Also, moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. And the houses are arranged in a circle, clockwise. \n\nThe input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks), followed by a list of m a_i's. The output is the total time needed.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, Xenia starts at house 1. For each task, she needs to move from her current position to the required house for that task, but considering that the tasks must be done in order. So, for each consecutive task, we need to compute the time it takes to get from the previous position to the current task's house, considering the ringroad's circular nature.\n\nWait, but how do we calculate the movement between two houses? Let's say she is at position prev and needs to go to curr. Since the movement is clockwise, the time is (curr - prev) mod n? Wait, no. Because if prev is 3 and curr is 2, then moving clockwise would require going through 4, 1, 2. Which is (n - prev + curr) steps? Or maybe (curr - prev) if curr is larger than prev, else (curr + n - prev). \n\nYes. So for example, moving from 3 to 2 in a 4-house setup: 3 →4 →1 →2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 -3 +4) = 3. So the formula is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr + n - prev). Alternatively, (curr - prev) % n? Wait, no. Because if curr is less than prev, then (curr - prev) would be negative. But modulo n would give the correct positive value. Let's see: for example, 2-3 = -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the time between prev and curr is (curr - prev) % n. But wait, if prev is 1 and curr is 3, then (3-1) mod 4 is 2, which is correct. If prev is 3 and curr is 2, (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3, which is correct. So yes, the time between two positions is (curr - prev) mod n. But wait, what if the movement is allowed to go the other way? No, because the traffic is one-way clockwise. So Xenia can't move counter-clockwise. So the movement must be clockwise. Therefore, the time between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr + n - prev). Which is equivalent to (curr - prev) % n if we take the modulo as positive. \n\nBut in code, how to compute that? Well, in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, (curr - prev) % n would give the correct number of steps. Let me check:\n\nFor prev=3, curr=2, n=4: (2-3) = -1, mod 4 is 3. Correct. For prev=1, curr=3: 3-1=2 mod4 is 2. Correct. So yes, the time between prev and curr is (curr - prev) % n. \n\nSo the idea is: we need to process each task in order, and for each task, compute the time from the previous position to the current position, and accumulate that. \n\nBut the initial position is 1. So for the first task, we compute the time from 1 to a1. Then, for the second task, from a1 to a2, and so on. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the tasks must be done in order. So the i-th task can only be done after all tasks before it are done. So the order of the a_i's is important. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a:\n\n    compute time from current_position to task's position (ai)\n\n    add that to total_time\n\n    set current_position to ai\n\nSo for example, the first example input is:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nLet's walk through:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Time from 1 to 3: (3-1) = 2 steps. total_time is 2. Now current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Time from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod4 = 3. So total_time is 2+3=5. Now current position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Time from 2 to 3: 1 step. total_time is 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output. \n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [2,3,3]. Output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial position is 1. First task is 2: time is 1 step. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: time is 1 step. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: time is 0 steps. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo that's the approach. \n\nNow, the problem is to read the input, process each a_i in order, compute the steps between consecutive positions, sum them up.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each ai in the list:\n\n    delta = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += delta\n\n    current_pos = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nBecause for each task, you have to move from the previous position to the current ai. And since the tasks are processed in order, the movement is accumulated.\n\nBut what about when the same house is visited multiple times? Like in the second sample, the third task is same as previous. So the code adds zero steps. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So this seems straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. So initial position is 1. Time is 0. Output is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, m=2, a=[1, 2]. Time is (1-1) = 0, then (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Total is 1. \n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[5, 1]. \n\nFirst step: from 1 to 5. (5-1) mod5 = 4 steps. Then from 5 to 1: (1-5) mod5 = -4 mod5 = 1. So total 4+1=5 steps. Which is correct. Because moving clockwise from 5 to 1 is one step (since it's a ringroad).\n\nYes. So the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, considering that m can be up to 1e5, and n up to 1e5, this approach is O(m), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list of a's. Then loop through each a in the list, compute the delta, add to total.\n\nBut wait, the input for the first sample is given as:\n\nInput is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nSo the code would read n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]. Then process as explained.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen, initialize current_pos as 1, total_time as 0.\n\nLoop through each ai in the list:\n\n   delta = (ai - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += delta\n\n   current_pos = ai\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values? Wait, no. Because in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So the calculation is correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n, m from input. Then read the list of a's. Then process as above.\n\nNow, let's test the first sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) %4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) %4 = -1%4=3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 6. Which is correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [2,3,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 =1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3) mod4 =0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: when the same house is visited multiple times. Like a = [1,1,1]. Then the total time is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=3, a = [5,1,5]. \n\nFirst step: 1 to 5: (5-1) mod5 =4. total 4. current 5.\n\nSecond step: 1-5 mod5 is (1-5) mod5 is -4 mod5=1. total 4+1=5. current 1.\n\nThird step: 5-1 mod5 is 4. total 5+4=9. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m, the second line has m integers.\n\nIn Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if the list a is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. Because in the input constraints, m is 1<=m<=1e5. So no problem.\n\nBut let's check for m=0. Well, the problem says m is at least 1. So the code is safe.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nLet me check the sample input again. For the first sample input, the code would process the list [3,2,3], and compute 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example, which gives 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo I think this code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. Each task must be completed in sequence, and moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the houses are arranged in a ringroad, moving from one house to another in a clockwise direction can be calculated using modular arithmetic. The time taken to move from house `prev` to house `curr` is given by `(curr - prev) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This formula ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, as Xenia initially resides there.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task in the given list, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house for the task, accumulate this time, and update the current position.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        delta = (num - current) % n\n        total += delta\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is read to get the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of tasks.\n2. **Initialization**: We start at house 1, and initialize the total time to 0.\n3. **Processing Each Task**: For each task in the list, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic. This ensures that the movement is correctly calculated in a circular manner. The total time is accumulated, and the current position is updated to the target house after each task.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required time in O(m) complexity, which is optimal given the constraints.",
