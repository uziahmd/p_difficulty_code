    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. Let me first understand what's happening here. The LCM of two numbers x and y is minimized when x and y are as small as possible, but also when they have a high GCD. Because LCM(x,y) = x*y / GCD(x,y). So, for example, if x and y are equal, their LCM is x, which is the smallest possible for that pair.\n\nWait, so maybe the optimal k is such that a +k and b +k are as close as possible? Or maybe even equal?\n\nLet me think. Suppose a and b are such that a +k = b +k. Well, that would require a = b, but then any k would make them equal. But if a and b are different, then maybe we can find a k that makes them have a large GCD. For example, in the first sample input: 6 and 10. If we take k=2, then they become 8 and 12. Their GCD is 4, LCM is 24. If we take k=1, then 7 and 11, which are coprime, LCM is 77, which is worse. If k=3, then 9 and 13, LCM is 117. So the minimal is indeed 24.\n\nSo the idea is that the minimal LCM occurs when the two numbers (a +k and b +k) are as small as possible and have a high GCD. But how do we find that k?\n\nLet me think: Let's denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since x and y differ by (a - b), or (b - a) depending on which is bigger. Let's suppose a < b. Then, x = a +k, y = b +k. So y - x = b -a. Let me call this difference d. So d = |a -b|. So for any k, the difference between the two numbers is fixed. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding two numbers x and y such that their difference is d, and their LCM is minimized. Then, x and y must be such that they are as small as possible, and their GCD is as large as possible.\n\nBecause LCM(x, y) = x * y / GCD(x, y). Since x and y differ by d, perhaps the best way is to find a GCD that divides both x and y, which would mean that x and y are multiples of some g. Let's say that GCD(x, y) = g. Then, x = g * m, y = g * n, where m and n are coprime. Since y -x = d, then g*(n -m) = d. Therefore, g must be a divisor of d. So, the possible values of g are divisors of d.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, we can find m and n such that n -m = d/g, and m and n are coprime. Then, the LCM of x and y is g*m*n. Since m and n are coprime, their LCM is m*n. So the LCM is g * m * n. But since n = m + (d/g), then substituting gives us m*(m + (d/g)) * g. Wait, but how do we choose m here?\n\nBut since x and y are positive integers, and x = g*m, y = g*n, and since x and y must be as small as possible, perhaps the minimal m and n would be m=1 and n = 1 + (d/g). But wait, m and n must be coprime. So for each divisor g of d, we can check if there exists m and n such that n - m = (d/g), and GCD(m, n) = 1. But since n = m + (d/g), then GCD(m, m + (d/g)) = GCD(m, d/g). So to have this equal to 1, we need that m and (d/g) are coprime. But since m can be chosen as 1, then if we set m=1, then n = 1 + (d/g), and GCD(1, anything) is 1. So that's valid. So for each divisor g of d, the minimal LCM is g * m * n = g * 1 * (1 + d/g) = g *",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. The key insight is that the optimal $ k $ will make $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ as close as possible and have a high greatest common divisor (GCD).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Difference Calculation**: Calculate the absolute difference $ d $ between $ a $ and $ b $. This difference remains constant for any $ k $.\n2. **Divisors of Difference**: Find all divisors of $ d $, as these divisors help in determining potential values of $ k $ that can minimize the LCM.\n3. **Check Potential Values of $ k $**: For each divisor $ g $ of $ d $, calculate potential values of $ k $ that can make $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ multiples of $ g $. This helps in ensuring that the GCD of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is maximized, thus minimizing the LCM.\n4. **Select Optimal $ k $**: Among all potential values of $ k $, select the one that results in the smallest LCM. If there are multiple values of $ k $ yielding the same minimal LCM, choose the smallest $ k $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n // i)\n    return divisors\n\ndef find_optimal_k(a, b):\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        return 0\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        # We want to find m and n such that n - m = d/g, and m and n are coprime\n        # Let's take m = 1, then n = 1 + (d/g)\n        # So x = g * m, y = g * n\n        # Then x = g * 1 = g, y = g * (1 + d/g)\n        # But since x = a + k and y = b + k, we can solve for k\n        # Let's assume a < b, then b = a + d\n        # So y = a + k + d = x + d\n        # Which is already satisfied by the way we set up the problem\n        # Now, we need to find k such that a + k = g * m and b + k = g * n\n        # Since m = 1, then a + k = g => k = g - a\n        # But we need to ensure that k >= 0\n        # Also, since b + k = g * n = g * (1 + d/g) = g + d\n        # Which is equal to a + k + d = g + d, so that's correct\n        # So k_candidate = g - a if a < b, but need to check if it's non-negative\n        \n        # Let's handle both cases when a < b or a > b\n        # Let's compute k_candidate such that a + k = g * m, where m is chosen to be 1\n        # But m must be such that the resulting k is non-negative\n        \n        # Let's compute the candidate k for both possibilities\n        # For x = g * m and y = g * n, with n - m = d/g\n        # Let's take m = 1, then n = 1 + (d//g)\n        # So x = g * 1 = g, and a + k = g => k = g - a\n        # Similarly, if a > b, then k = g - b\n        # However, this k must be non-negative\n        \n        # Let's compute k_candidate for the case where a < b\n        if a < b:\n            k_candidate = g - a\n            if k_candidate >= 0:\n                x = a + k_candidate\n                y = b + k_candidate\n                current_lcm = x * y // compute_gcd(x, y)\n                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n                    min_lcm = current_lcm\n                    best_k = k_candidate\n        else:\n            k_candidate = g - b\n            if k_candidate >= 0:\n                x = a + k_candidate\n                y = b + k_candidate\n                current_lcm = x * y // compute_gcd(x, y)\n                if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n                    min_lcm = current_lcm\n                    best_k = k_candidate\n        \n        # Also consider m = something else? Wait, maybe not. Because taking m=1 gives us the minimal possible x and y.\n        # Also, we need to check other possibilities where m is such that x and y are minimized.\n        # Alternatively, perhaps there's another candidate k which is (g - (a + b) % g) ? Not sure.\n        # Wait, but the approach above may miss some candidates. For example, if the optimal k is not derived from m=1.\n        # Let me think again: For each divisor g of d, the minimal LCM would be achieved when x and y are multiples of g, and their difference is d. So, the minimal x and y would be when x = g and y = g + d, but that may not be possible if a + k = g requires k to be negative.\n        # So perhaps the code above is incomplete. What about other possible values of m?\n\n        # Another approach: For each divisor g of d, the optimal k would be such that a +k and b +k are multiples of g. Let me find the minimal k >= 0 such that (a +k) mod g == 0 and (b +k) mod g == 0. But since b -a = d, which is divisible by g, because g is a divisor of d. So (a +k) mod g == 0 implies (b +k) mod g == (a +k + d) mod g == (a +k) mod g + d mod g == 0 + 0 == 0. Therefore, it's sufficient to find k such that a +k is divisible by g. So k = (g - (a % g)) % g. That gives the minimal non-negative k to make a +k divisible by g. But also, we need to ensure that this k makes b +k divisible by g as well, which is automatically true.\n\n        # So, for each divisor g of d, compute k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g. But this could be 0. Then, check if this k_candidate is non-negative, and compute the LCM for (a +k_candidate, b +k_candidate). Compare with the current minimum.\n\n        # So, let's do that. Because the previous approach only considered m=1, but perhaps the optimal k is not that. Let's adjust the code.\n\n        # Compute k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g. This ensures that a +k_candidate is divisible by g.\n        # Let's compute this k_candidate and check it.\n\n        k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g\n        x = a + k_candidate\n        y = b + k_candidate\n        # Check if x and y are positive (they should be, since k_candidate >=0 and a >=1)\n        current_lcm = x * y // compute_gcd(x, y)\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate\n\n    # Also check k=0, in case all divisors' k_candidates are worse\n    # For example, if a=5, b=10, then d=5. Divisors are 1,5. For g=5, k_candidate is (5 - 5%5) mod 5 = 0. Then x=5, y=10, LCM is 10. Which is better than any other option. So the code would pick k=0, which is correct.\n\n    # Also, check the case where k_candidate is zero. For example, in the third sample input (5,10), the optimal is k=0.\n\n    # But what about when d=0? Then a = b, so any k will make LCM(a+k, a+k) = a +k. So minimal is when k=0.\n\n    # Also, need to check the case where k_candidate is (g - (b % g)) % g? Or no, because since d is divisible by g, and a +k_candidate is divisible by g, then b +k_candidate is also divisible by g.\n\n    # So the code above now considers for each divisor g of d, the k_candidate that makes a +k divisible by g, and computes the LCM.\n\n    # But wait, in the first sample input: a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\n    # For g=2: a=6, 6%2=0, so k_candidate is 0. Then x=6+0=6, y=10+0=10. LCM is 30. But the optimal is k=2. So why is that not being considered?\n\n    # Oh, because the code above is missing something. Because the approach of considering k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g may not capture all possibilities. For example, in the first sample input, the optimal k=2 makes x=8 and y=12. Their GCD is 4, which is a divisor of d=4. So why isn't this captured in the code?\n\n    # Let's see: for g=4, which is a divisor of d=4. Then a=6, a%g = 6%4=2. So k_candidate = (4 - 2) %4 = 2. So this is exactly the k=2 that we need. Then x=6+2=8, y=10+2=12. LCM(8,12) = 24. Which is better than the previous candidate for g=2 (which was 30). So the code would capture this.\n\n    # So the code as modified now would include that. So the original code had an error in only considering m=1, but the corrected approach now considers for each divisor g, the k_candidate that makes a +k divisible by g, which includes the optimal case.\n\n    # So the code needs to be updated to use this approach.\n\n    # So let's rework the code accordingly.\n\n    # Let's re-initialize min_lcm and best_k.\n\n    # Also, need to consider the case where d=0, which is handled at the start.\n\n    # Let's re-code the function:\n\n    # Let's try again:\n\n    def find_optimal_k(a, b):\n        d = abs(a - b)\n        if d == 0:\n            return 0\n        divisors = get_divisors(d)\n        min_lcm = float('inf')\n        best_k = float('inf')\n        \n        for g in divisors:\n            # Compute k_candidate such that a + k_candidate is divisible by g\n            remainder = a % g\n            k_candidate = (g - remainder) % g  # ensures it's non-negative\n            x = a + k_candidate\n            y = b + k_candidate\n            current_gcd = compute_gcd(x, y)\n            current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n            if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n                min_lcm = current_lcm\n                best_k = k_candidate\n\n        # Also, check k=0, in case the above loop didn't find it (but it should be covered)\n        # For example, when a and b are already such that their LCM is minimal at k=0.\n\n        # But in the code above, for g = d, which is a divisor of d, the k_candidate is computed. For example, if a=5, b=10, d=5. The divisors are 1,5. For g=5, a=5, remainder is 0, k_candidate is 0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10. Which is the correct answer.\n\n        # Also check for the case where k_candidate is negative? No, because (g - remainder) mod g is always between 0 and g-1.\n\n        return best_k\n\n    # However, this code might miss some cases where the optimal k is not derived from any of the divisors. For example, what if the optimal k is such that the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is not a divisor of d?\n\n    # Wait, earlier reasoning says that the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) must divide d. Because (a +k) and (b +k) differ by d. Let me explain: Let x = a +k, y = b +k. Then y -x = d. So, any common divisor of x and y must divide their difference, which is d. Hence, the GCD of x and y must be a divisor of d. Therefore, the optimal k must be such that the GCD is a divisor of d. Therefore, the code above, which considers all divisors of d, will find the optimal k.\n\n    # Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    # Let's test the first sample input:\n\n    # a=6, b=10, d=4.

Not sure.\n        # Wait, but the approach above may miss some candidates. For example, if the optimal k is not derived from m=1.\n        # Let me think again: For each divisor g of d, the minimal LCM would be achieved when x and y are multiples of g, and their difference is d. So, the minimal x and y would be when x = g and y = g + d, but that may not be possible if a + k = g requires k to be negative.\n        # So perhaps the code above is incomplete. What about other possible values of m?\n\n        # Another approach: For each divisor g of d, the optimal k would be such that a +k and b +k are multiples of g. Let me find the minimal k >= 0 such that (a +k) mod g == 0 and (b +k) mod g == 0. But since b -a = d, which is divisible by g, because g is a divisor of d. So (a +k) mod g == 0 implies (b +k) mod g == (a +k + d) mod g == (a +k) mod g + d mod g == 0 + 0 == 0. Therefore, it's sufficient to find k such that a +k is divisible by g. So k = (g - (a % g)) % g. That gives the minimal non-negative k to make a +k divisible by g. But also, we need to ensure that this k makes b +k divisible by g as well, which is automatically true.\n\n        # So, for each divisor g of d, compute k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g. But this could be 0. Then, check if this k_candidate is non-negative, and compute the LCM for (a +k_candidate, b +k_candidate). Compare with the current minimum.\n\n        # So, let's do that. Because the previous approach only considered m=1, but perhaps the optimal k is not that. Let's adjust the code.\n\n        # Compute k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g. This ensures that a +k_candidate is divisible by g.\n        # Let's compute this k_candidate and check it.\n\n        k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g\n        x = a + k_candidate\n        y = b + k_candidate\n        # Check if x and y are positive (they should be, since k_candidate >=0 and a >=1)\n        current_lcm = x * y // compute_gcd(x, y)\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = k_candidate\n\n    # Also check k=0, in case all divisors' k_candidates are worse\n    # For example, if a=5, b=10, then d=5. Divisors are 1,5. For g=5, k_candidate is (5 - 5%5) mod 5 = 0. Then x=5, y=10, LCM is 10. Which is better than any other option. So the code would pick k=0, which is correct.\n\n    # Also, check the case where k_candidate is zero. For example, in the third sample input (5,10), the optimal is k=0.\n\n    # But what about when d=0? Then a = b, so any k will make LCM(a+k, a+k) = a +k. So minimal is when k=0.\n\n    # Also, need to check the case where k_candidate is (g - (b % g)) % g? Or no, because since d is divisible by g, and a +k_candidate is divisible by g, then b +k_candidate is also divisible by g.\n\n    # So the code above now considers for each divisor g of d, the k_candidate that makes a +k divisible by g, and computes the LCM.\n\n    # But wait, in the first sample input: a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\n    # For g=2: a=6, 6%2=0, so k_candidate is 0. Then x=6+0=6, y=10+0=10. LCM is 30. But the optimal is k=2. So why is that not being considered?\n\n    # Oh, because the code above is missing something. Because the approach of considering k_candidate = (g - (a % g)) % g may not capture all possibilities. For example, in the first sample input, the optimal k=2 makes x=8 and y=12. Their GCD is 4, which is a divisor of d=4. So why isn't this captured in the code?\n\n    # Let's see: for g=4, which is a divisor of d=4. Then a=6, a%g = 6%4=2. So k_candidate = (4 - 2) %4 = 2. So this is exactly the k=2 that we need. Then x=6+2=8, y=10+2=12. LCM(8,12) = 24. Which is better than the previous candidate for g=2 (which was 30). So the code would capture this.\n\n    # So the code as modified now would include that. So the original code had an error in only considering m=1, but the corrected approach now considers for each divisor g, the k_candidate that makes a +k divisible by g, which includes the optimal case.\n\n    # So the code needs to be updated to use this approach.\n\n    # So let's rework the code accordingly.\n\n    # Let's re-initialize min_lcm and best_k.\n\n    # Also, need to consider the case where d=0, which is handled at the start.\n\n    # Let's re-code the function:\n\n    # Let's try again:\n\n    def find_optimal_k(a, b):\n        d = abs(a - b)\n        if d == 0:\n            return 0\n        divisors = get_divisors(d)\n        min_lcm = float('inf')\n        best_k = float('inf')\n        \n        for g in divisors:\n            # Compute k_candidate such that a + k_candidate is divisible by g\n            remainder = a % g\n            k_candidate = (g - remainder) % g  # ensures it's non-negative\n            x = a + k_candidate\n            y = b + k_candidate\n            current_gcd = compute_gcd(x, y)\n            current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n            if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and k_candidate < best_k):\n                min_lcm = current_lcm\n                best_k = k_candidate\n\n        # Also, check k=0, in case the above loop didn't find it (but it should be covered)\n        # For example, when a and b are already such that their LCM is minimal at k=0.\n\n        # But in the code above, for g = d, which is a divisor of d, the k_candidate is computed. For example, if a=5, b=10, d=5. The divisors are 1,5. For g=5, a=5, remainder is 0, k_candidate is 0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10. Which is the correct answer.\n\n        # Also check for the case where k_candidate is negative? No, because (g - remainder) mod g is always between 0 and g-1.\n\n        return best_k\n\n    # However, this code might miss some cases where the optimal k is not derived from any of the divisors. For example, what if the optimal k is such that the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) is not a divisor of d?\n\n    # Wait, earlier reasoning says that the GCD of (a +k) and (b +k) must divide d. Because (a +k) and (b +k) differ by d. Let me explain: Let x = a +k, y = b +k. Then y -x = d. So, any common divisor of x and y must divide their difference, which is d. Hence, the GCD of x and y must be a divisor of d. Therefore, the optimal k must be such that the GCD is a divisor of d. Therefore, the code above, which considers all divisors of d, will find the optimal k.\n\n    # Therefore, the code is correct.\n\n    # Let's test the first sample input:\n\n    # a=6, b=10, d=4. Divisors are 1,2,4.\n\n    # For g=1:\n    # remainder = 6%1=0, k_candidate=0. x=6, y=10. LCM is 30.\n\n    # For g=2:\n    # remainder = 6%2=0, k_candidate=0. x=6, y=10. LCM is 30.\n\n    # For g=4:\n    # remainder = 6%4=2, k_candidate = 4-2=2. x=8, y=12. LCM is 24. So this is better. So best_k is 2.\n\n    # So code returns 2, which is correct.\n\n    # For the third sample input: a=5, b=10. d=5. Divisors are 1,5.\n\n    # For g=1: k_candidate = 0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10.\n\n    # For g=5: remainder = 5%5=0. k_candidate=0. x=5, y=10. LCM is 10. So best_k is 0.\n\n    # Which is correct.\n\n    # For the second sample input: a=21, b=31. d=10. Divisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\n    # Let's check for g=5:\n\n    # remainder = 21%5 = 1. k_candidate = 5-1=4. x=21+4=25, y=31+4=35. LCM(25,35) = 175.\n\n    # For g=10: remainder=21%10=1. k_candidate=9. x=30, y=40. LCM is 120.\n\n    # For g=2: remainder=21%2=1. k_candidate=1. x=22, y=32. LCM is 352.\n\n    # For g=1: k_candidate=0. x=21, y=31. LCM is 651.\n\n    # So the minimal is 120 for k=9.
