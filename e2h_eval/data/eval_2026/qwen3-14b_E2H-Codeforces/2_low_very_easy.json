Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Valera's paper forms an X if certain conditions are met. Let me think about the requirements.\n\nThe problem says that the paper forms an X if two conditions are met. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All the cells in these two diagonals must be the same. Also, the other cells (non-diagonal) must all be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n, then n lines each with n characters.\n\nSo for each test case, I need to process the grid.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on the two diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same, and that they are different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check the diagonals?\n\nFor the main diagonal, the positions are (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal, the positions are (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut since n is odd, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking, we need to make sure that all the cells in both diagonals are the same. However, since the center cell is part of both, perhaps we can collect all the cells from both diagonals and check if they are all the same.\n\nWait, but for example, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the center cell (1,1) is in both. So when collecting all the diagonal cells, we need to collect all positions from both diagonals, but make sure that duplicates are allowed. But since the condition requires that all cells on both diagonals are the same, then the entire set of diagonal cells (including overlapping ones) must be the same.\n\nSo, for example, for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, collect all their cells. Then check that all of them are the same.\n\nBut how to collect them? For each cell in the grid, check if it's on either diagonal. Then collect all those cells and check if they are all the same.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. So for all such cells, check that they are equal to the same character.\n\nBut how to find the character for the diagonals. Let's take the first cell of the main diagonal (0,0) as the reference. Then check that all other diagonal cells are equal to this. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. Wait, but the main and anti-diagonal must have the same character. So for example, the main diagonal's cells must all be same, and the anti-diagonal's cells must all be same, and also the main and anti's characters must be same.\n\nWait, no. The first condition says that on both diagonals all letters are the same. So the main diagonal has all same letters, and the anti-diagonal has all same letters. But the problem says that the two diagonals must have the same letters. Because the problem says \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". So maybe the main diagonal has all same letters, and the anti-diagonal has all same letters, but they can be different? No, no. Wait, the problem says that the letters on the diagonals are the same. So for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then it's okay. But if the main is 'x' and the anti is 'y', then it's invalid. So the two diagonals must be the same.\n\nSo the first step is to check that all cells in the main diagonal are same, all cells in the anti-diagonal are same, and that the main and anti have the same character.\n\nBut perhaps there's an easier way. Let's collect all the cells that are on either of the diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Because if all of them are same, then both diagonals are same.\n\nYes. Because the main diagonal and anti-diagonal's cells are all part of the same set. For example, in a ",
