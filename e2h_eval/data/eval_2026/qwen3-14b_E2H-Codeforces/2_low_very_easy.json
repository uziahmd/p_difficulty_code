Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the grid is n x n where n is odd. The diagonals are the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). All cells in these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check if all elements in both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check if all other elements (non-diagonal) are the same and not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, let's collect all the diagonal elements. For each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell in the grid, check if it is on either of these diagonals.\n\nSo for all cells in the grid:\n\n- If it's on either diagonal, check that they are all equal to the same character.\n- Else, check that they are all equal to another character, different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. Let's first collect all the diagonal elements and check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal elements and check they are all same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut wait, the diagonals may have overlapping cells. For example, in a grid with odd n, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when collecting the diagonal elements, we need to make sure that we check all cells in either diagonal, but avoid duplicates. But for checking that all are same, even if there are duplicates, it's okay. Because if all elements in the diagonals are same, then even if some cells are counted twice, it's still valid.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\n- Collect all the characters in the diagonals. Check that all are same. Let's say the diagonal character is d_char.\n\nThen collect all the non-diagonal characters. Check that all are same and not equal to d_char.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonals?\n\nFor each row i, and column j:\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo for all cells in the grid, check if they are on the diagonals. For those cells, collect their characters. Then check that all are same.\n\nSimilarly, for non-diagonal cells, collect their characters and check they are same and different.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For example, n=3: the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the middle. So the total number of diagonal cells is 2n - 1. For n=3: 5 cells. The total cells is 9, so non-diagonal is 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Check all diagonal cells (i ==j or i +j = n-1) are same. Let's call this d_char.\n\n- Check all non-diagonal cells are same and not equal to d_char.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal. For those cells, collect their characters. Then check if all are same. Then for the rest, collect their characters and check same and different.\n\nBut how to collect these characters?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n. Let's store them as a list of lists, maybe.\n\nThen:\n\nCheck for diagonals:\n\nd_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            d_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(d_chars) != 1: then return NO.\n\nElse, d_char is the only element in d_chars.\n\nThen check the non-diagonal cells:\n\nother_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if not (i == j or i + j == n -1):\n\n            other_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(other_chars) != 1: return NO.\n\nElse, check that other_chars is not",
