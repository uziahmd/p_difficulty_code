He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, which could be Roman numerals. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the next line is the number c in base a. So the steps are:\n\n1. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals.\n\nSo the main parts are: converting from base a to decimal, then converting decimal to base b (or Roman).\n\nLet's think about the first part: converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have letters like A, B, etc., if a is greater than 10. For example, if a is 12, then digits can go up to 'B' (11). Wait, but the problem says that for bases greater than 10, we use A for 10, B for 11, etc. So when converting from base a, the digits are in the standard way. So for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nBut the input c is given as a string. So I need to process each character of c, converting them into their respective values. For example, for 'A', it's 10, 'B' 11, etc. So for the first step, I need a function that takes a string and base a, and converts it to a decimal integer.\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros? Well, the problem says that the input may have leading zeros, but when converting to base b, we have to omit leading zeros. But during conversion to decimal, leading zeros don't affect the value, so that's okay.\n\nNow, the second part: converting the decimal number to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b, using letters for digits above 9 (like A for 10, etc.)\n\nSo let's split into two cases.\n\nCase 1: b is not R. Then, convert the decimal number to base b. How to do that? Well, for numbers up to 1e15, which is manageable. For example, for base 2, the number can be up to 1e15, but converting it to base 2 would take O(log n) steps. So the process is:\n\n- If the number is zero, output 0. But according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number isn't zero. But for other cases, maybe c can be zero? Wait, the input says that c is a non-negative integer. But in the note, it says that if Roman is included, the number is not zero. So for other cases, maybe c can be zero?\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input says that for other cases, the number won't be greater than 1e15. So when converting to base b (non-R), we need to handle zero.\n\nBut the output requires to omit leading zeros. So for example, if the converted number is zero, output '0'.\n\nSo the steps for converting decimal to base b (non-R):\n\n- Handle zero case: if the number is zero, output '0'.\n- Else, repeatedly divide the number by b, collect the remainders. Then reverse the collected digits. Also, for digits >=10, convert them to letters (A for 10, B for 11, etc.)\n\nCase 2: b is R. Then convert the decimal number to Roman numerals. But according to the problem statement, the number is guaranteed to be <= 3000 (decimal) and not zero. So how to convert decimal to Roman numerals?\n\nThe standard approach for Roman numerals is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, the standard list is:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, while the number is >= value, append the symbol and subtract the value.\n\nSo that's the approach for Roman conversion.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nFirst, parse the input. The first line is a and b. But b can be 'R'. So for example, the first line could be '16 R', which means a=16, b=R.\n\nThen, the second line is the number c in base a. So the code needs to read the first line, split into a and b, then read the second line as the string c.\n\nSo for the first step, converting c from base a to decimal. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nFor example, if c is '10' in base 2, that's 2 in decimal. Or if c is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo for each character in the string c, we need to get its value. For digits 0-9, it's straightforward. For letters, uppercase? Well, the input may have letters in uppercase or lowercase? The problem says that in the input, the c may contain letters, but the examples have 'A' in input. The problem says that for bases greater than 10, A is used for 10, etc. So probably, the input uses uppercase letters. But the problem says that the input is given as a string, but perhaps the code should handle both upper and lower case? Well, the problem says that the input is given in the format where the digits are as per the standard, so perhaps the input uses uppercase letters. So the code can assume that the input is in uppercase.\n\nBut perhaps the code should handle lowercase as well? Well, the problem says that the input is given as per the standard. So the input for c will have digits in the correct format. So we can process the characters as follows: for each character in the string, if it's a digit, convert to int. Else, convert to its value (like 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, etc.)\n\nSo for example, for a character ch:\n\ndigit_value = int(ch) if ch is a digit else ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n\nBut wait, for example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So for a base a, the digits must be less than a. So for example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (10), B (11). So the code must check that each digit is valid. However, the problem says that the input is correct. So no need to validate.\n\nSo the code can process each character in the string c as follows.\n\nNow, converting the string c to decimal. Let's implement that.\n\nFor example, the code can loop through each character in the string, and compute the value. For example:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nBut wait, for leading zeros, this is okay. For example, if s is '001' in base 2, then it's 1 in decimal. Which is correct.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then proceed to convert to base b or Roman.\n\nNow, handling the case where b is R. So for that, we need to convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert to base b.\n\nSo for converting decimal to base b (non-R):\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    # Now reverse the digits and convert to characters\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    result = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            result.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            # For example, 10 is A, 11 is B, etc.\n            result.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(result)\n\nWait, but what if the number is zero? Well, the code handles that with the first condition.\n\nBut in the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So for other cases, when converting to base b (non-R), the code needs to handle zero. For example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0. Then output is 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input c may be zero. So the code must handle that.\n\nNow, the code for Roman numerals:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nThis should work. For example, 4 becomes IV, 5 is V, etc.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead a and b. Then read c.\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal (n).\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert n to roman.\n\nElse, convert n to base b.\n\nBut need to handle the case where the converted number is zero. For example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0. Then output is '0'.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nLet's take the first input line:\n\na=10, b=2. c is '1'. So converting to decimal is 1. Then converting to base 2 is '1'. Correct.\n\nSecond input line: a=16, b=R. c is 5. So decimal is 5. Convert to Roman: V. Correct.\n\nThird input line: a=5, b=R. c is 4. Decimal is 4. Roman is IV. Correct.\n\nFourth input line: a=2, b=2. c is 1111001. Which is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Converting to base 2 again gives 1111001. So output is same as input. Correct.\n\nFifth input line: a=12, b=13. c is 'A' which is 10 in decimal. Convert to base 13. 10 in base 13 is 'A'. So output is 'A'.\n\nSo all sample cases are handled correctly.\n\nNow, some edge cases to think about.\n\nWhat if the decimal number is zero? For example, input a=10, b=2, c=0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: converting to base higher than 10. For example, decimal 10 in base 11 is 'A'.\n\nAnother case: converting to base 1? Wait, but according to the input constraints, a and b are between 2 and 25. So no, the code doesn't need to handle base 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting from base a where a is 2 and c is a long string of 1s. But the code can handle it as long as the decimal value is computed correctly.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input c can be up to 10^3 characters long. So converting that to decimal may be a problem for very large numbers. For example, if a is 25 and c is 1000 characters of 'Z' (but wait, in base 25, the digits can be up to 24, which is represented as 'O' (since 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 24 is O). So for a 1000-digit number in base 25, the decimal value could be up to 25^1000, which is way beyond the maximum for Python's integers. But Python can handle big integers, so that's okay.\n\nBut for the code, the to_decimal function is correct. Let's see.\n\nYes, because in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large. So even for a 1000-digit number in base 25, the code can compute the decimal value.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the first line as a and b. But note that the first line is split into two parts. For example, the first line could be '16 R' which is a=16, b='R'.\n\nSo in Python, for each test case, perhaps the input is read as follows:\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line contains a and b, the second line contains c.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is presented as a list of multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps as a list of inputs. Wait, no. The sample input shows that the user provided multiple test cases, but the actual problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is written as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut that's probably a list of multiple test cases, each with their own input. However, in reality, the program should process a single test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. So the sample input is probably a list of multiple test cases, each with their own input. But the actual code should read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is one test case per run.\n\nWait, the problem says that the user should write a Python script that reads input from stdin and outputs to stdout. So for example, the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample shows that for the given input, the outputs are as listed. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? No, that's not the case. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is two lines. So for each run, there is one test case. The sample shows multiple test cases as examples. But the code should process one test case. So the code should read two lines from stdin.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of multiple test cases. But in practice, each test case is given as two lines. So for example, the first test case's input is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich outputs '1'.\n\nSo the code should read two lines from standard input. So the code will read the first line (a and b), then the second line (c).\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of multiple test cases. However, in programming competition problems, the code is supposed to process one test case. So perhaps the sample input is showing multiple test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case. Therefore, the code should read two lines from stdin.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the first line, split into a and b. Then read the second line as c.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the code can be:\n\nimport sys\n\na_b_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nc_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut sometimes, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nParse a and b from the first line. For example, split into parts. But since b can be 'R', the code can split into parts as follows:\n\nparts = a_b_line.split()\na = int(parts[0])\nb = parts[1]\n\nThen, the second line is c_line.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to convert c_line from base a to decimal.\n\nNow, code for converting c_line to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input c may contain letters, but in the case where the base is 10, for example, the letters would be invalid. However, the problem states that the input is correct, so the code can assume that the digits are valid for the base.\n\nOnce the decimal value is obtained, then process it.\n\nNow, the code for converting to base b or Roman.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead a and b, then c.\n\nConvert c to decimal (n).\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert n to roman.\n\nElse, convert n to base b.\n\nBut need to handle leading zeros. For example, if the converted number is zero, output '0'. Otherwise, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nBut in the case of converting to base b (non-R), the code returns the correct string without leading zeros. Because when converting, the code starts with the highest digit. For example, if the number is 0, returns '0'. Else, the digits are collected in reverse order, then reversed again, so leading zeros are not present. Because the code processes the number as follows:\n\ndigits = [ ... ] (remainders). Then reversed. For example, for n=0, returns '0'.\n\nBut for numbers like 0, the code returns '0', which is correct.\n\nNow, code for the decimal to base.\n\nNow, code for the Roman conversion.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut first, handle the case when the decimal number is zero. For example, when converting to base b (non-R), and the number is zero. The code returns '0'.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    a_b_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    c_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    # Parse a and b\n    parts = a_b_line.split()\n    a = int(parts[0])\n    b = parts[1]\n    # Convert c to decimal\n    n = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n    # Now process based on b\n    if b == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(n))\n    else:\n        base = int(b)\n        print(decimal_to_base(n, base))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the converted number is zero and the base is not R? For example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0. Then the code returns '0'.\n\nBut what if the input is a=10, b=10, c=0? The code returns '0'.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nFirst line: '10 2' → a=10, b=2. c is '1' → decimal is 1 → converted to base 2 is '1'.\n\nSample output is '1'.\n\nSample input 2: '16 R' → a=16, b=R. c is '5' → decimal is 5 → Roman is 'V'.\n\nSample input 3: '5 R' → a=5, c is '4' → decimal is 4 → Roman is 'IV'.\n\nSample input 4: '2 2' → c is '1111001' → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nSample input 5: '12 13' → c is 'A' → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nAll sample outputs match.\n\nAnother test case: input a=2, b=10, c=0 → output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c=255 → decimal is 255 → converted to hex is 'FF'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c=0 → output is 0.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=10, c=0 → output 0.\n\nWhat about when the number is zero and b is R? According to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So the code does not need to handle that case.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the converted number is 0, output is '0'. Otherwise, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nIn the decimal_to_base function, when n is zero, returns '0'. Otherwise, the code generates digits in the correct order, without leading zeros.\n\nBut what about when the number is zero and the base is not R? For example, the code returns '0'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: converting 0 to base 10 → '0'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\n- What if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, the input is a non-negative integer, which may have leading zeros, but the length is up to 10^3. So the input is not empty.\n\n- What if the input c is '0'? Then the code converts to decimal 0, and outputs 0.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting from base a, the code uses uppercase letters. For example, if the input c is 'a', then the code converts it to lowercase? No, in the code, the code does ch.upper(), so regardless of the case of the input, it's handled. For example, 'a' is converted to uppercase 'A', then processed. So the code is case-insensitive for letters.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is correct. So the code can assume that the input uses uppercase letters for letters. But the code can handle lowercase letters as well.\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nAnother possible error is when converting to base b, which is larger than 10. For example, if the decimal number is 10, and base is 11, the code returns 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nAnother test case: input is '5 R\\n4' → decimal is 4 → Roman is 'IV'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: input is '2 10\\n1010' → decimal is 10 → output is '10'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal number is zero and the base is not R? The code returns '0', which is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the decimal_to_base function returns '0' for n=0. But what if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0? The output is '0', which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code may have to handle very large numbers, but Python's integers can handle that.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer, and then converting this decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in a specific base `a`. We need to convert this number to a decimal integer. This conversion handles both digits and letters (for bases greater than 10).\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**: Depending on whether the target base is Roman numerals (`R`) or another base, we convert the decimal integer accordingly:\n   - **Roman Numerals Conversion**: Use a list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral representation.\n   - **Base Conversion**: Convert the decimal integer to the specified base, using letters for digits greater than 9.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = []\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res.append(str(d))\n        else:\n            res.append(chr(ord('A') + d - 10))\n    return ''.join(res)\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'), (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    a_b_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    c_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    parts = a_b_line.split()\n    a = int(parts[0])\n    b = parts[1]\n    n = to_decimal(c_line, a)\n    if b == 'R':\n        print(decimal_to_roman(n))\n    else:\n        base = int(b)\n        print(decimal_to_base(n, base))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, with the first line containing the original base `a` and the target base `b` (which could be 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input number from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character of the input string and computing its value.\n3. **Base Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal integer to a specified base, handling digits greater than 9 by converting them to corresponding letters (e.g., 10 to 'A', 11 to 'B', etc.).\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal integer to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, ensuring correct representation according to Roman numeral rules.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion processes and ensures correctness for both numerical bases and Roman numerals.",
