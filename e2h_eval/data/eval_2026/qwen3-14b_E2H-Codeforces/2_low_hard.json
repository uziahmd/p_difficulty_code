Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps to solve:\n\n1. Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same and not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut wait, what about overlapping cells? Since n is odd, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking, we need to make sure that all cells in both diagonals are same. But for the overlapping cell, it's counted once.\n\nSo first, collect all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal cells and check if they are all same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect those cells?\n\nFor each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the other diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, check if it is on either of the two diagonals.\n\nSo, first, iterate through all cells. For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal. If yes, check if it's equal to the first diagonal character. But wait, what's the first diagonal character? Well, the first cell (0,0) is part of the main diagonal. So perhaps, we can take the first diagonal's character as the value of (0,0), then check all other diagonal cells against that. But what if the other diagonal has a different character? For example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the other diagonal is all 'y'? Then the condition fails.\n\nWait, the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So all cells in both diagonals must be the same. So the entire diagonal (both main and anti) must be same. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x', and the anti-diagonal is also all 'x', then that's okay. But if the anti-diagonal has any other character, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the first step is to check that all cells in both diagonals are the same. Let's collect all the diagonal cells and check their values.\n\nOnce that's done, check all the non-diagonal cells. They must all be the same, and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Read the grid.\n- Collect all the diagonal cells (main and anti).\n- Check if all of them are the same. If not, return NO.\n- Collect all the non-diagonal cells. Check if all are same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal cells?\n\nLet me think. For each cell (i, j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid, check if it's on a diagonal. For those cells, collect their characters. Then check if all are same.\n\nSimilarly for the non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut for the non-diagonal cells, they must all be same and not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Read n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n. So grid is a list of lists.\n\n2. Check for all diagonal cells:\n\n   a. Take the first diagonal cell (0,0) as the reference. Then check all other diagonal cells to see if they are same as this.\n\n   Wait, but what if the first cell is part of the main diagonal and the other diagonal? For example, in n=3, (0,0) is on main diagonal, and (0,2) is on the other. But for the first cell, it's on the main diagonal. So for all cells in the two diagonals, check if they are same as the first diagonal cell.\n\nBut maybe there's a case where the first cell is part of both diagon",
