Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So Valera needs to check if the letters on his square paper form an 'X' according to specific rules. Let me think about what those rules are.\n\nThe problem says that the paper forms an 'X' if two conditions are met. First, both diagonals have the same letters. Second, all other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to check the diagonals. Let's think about the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (where n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All the cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same, but different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nWait, but what about overlapping cells? Like, in the case where n is odd, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So for example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is on both diagonals. So when checking the diagonals, we need to make sure that all cells in both diagonals are the same. But since the center is part of both, it's okay as long as all the diagonal cells are the same.\n\nSo first step: collect all the cells in the two diagonals and check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal cells and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how do I check that?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read the input. The first line is n, then n lines each with n characters.\n\n2. For each cell in the grid, determine if it's on either of the two diagonals.\n\nFor a cell at (i, j) (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), let's clarify. Let's say rows and columns are 0-based.\n\nIn a square matrix, the main diagonal is where i == j. The anti-diagonal is where i + j == n - 1. So for example, in a 5x5 grid, the anti-diagonal cells are (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals. Otherwise, it's part of the non-diagonal.\n\nSo first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's collect all the characters from both diagonals. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are all same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, the diagonals might have overlapping cells (like the center cell). So when collecting the diagonal characters, we need to collect all cells from both diagonals, but make sure that duplicates are allowed. But since the problem says that all the diagonals must be same letters, even if overlapping, that's okay.\n\nSo for example, for the 3x3 grid, the diagonals are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Wait, no. Wait, the main diagonal is (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the cell (1,1) is part of both. So when collecting all the diagonal cells, we need to collect all cells that are in either of the diagonals. So for the 3x3 case, the diagonals include (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). So five cells. But when checking, all of them must be same. So for example, if the center cell (1,1) is different from others, then it's invalid.\n\nSo the first step is to collect all the diagonal cells. Then check that all of them are the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal cells and check that they are all same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo how to do this in code.\n\nFirst, read n. Then read n lines, each line being a string of length n. So for example, for the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nNow, the diagonals are:\n\nMain diagonal: positions (0,0) = x,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: Collect all characters from both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Ensure all these characters are the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Collect all characters that are not on either of the diagonals. Ensure all these characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Validation**: If both checks pass, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Collect diagonal characters\ndiag_chars = set()\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check if all diagonal characters are the same and non-diagonal are same and different\nif len(diag_chars) == 1 and len(non_diag_chars) == 1 and diag_chars != non_diag_chars:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings, each representing a row of the grid.\n2. **Collecting Characters**: We use sets to collect characters from the diagonals and non-diagonal positions. This helps in efficiently checking if all characters in a set are the same.\n3. **Validation Checks**: \n   - The set of diagonal characters should have exactly one unique character.\n   - The set of non-diagonal characters should also have exactly one unique character.\n   - The diagonal character must be different from the non-diagonal character.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both conditions required for the grid to form the letter \"X\" using set operations, which are optimal for membership and uniqueness checks.",
