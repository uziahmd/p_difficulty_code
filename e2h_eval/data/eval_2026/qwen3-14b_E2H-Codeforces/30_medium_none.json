Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize is maximized. The input is a number A with 2n digits, and each player takes exactly n turns. Each turn, the leftmost digit is taken by the current player, added to their number, and removed from A. The goal is to maximize the sum of S1 and S2.\n\nHmm. The key here is to decide, at each step, whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit. But since both players have to take exactly n digits each, we need to make sure that the choices made along the way don't lead to a situation where one of them can't take their required number of moves.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. For a brute-force approach, considering all possibilities would be O(2^36), which is way too big. That's impossible. So we need a dynamic programming approach here.\n\nWait, but what's the state here? Let's see. At any point, the number of digits remaining is 2n - k, where k is the number of digits taken so far. But more importantly, the state depends on how many digits each player has taken so far. For example, if Homer has taken h digits and Marge has taken m digits, then the current state can be represented by (h, m). Since each player must take exactly n digits, h can range from 0 to n, and m can range from 0 to n. Also, since h + m = k (the number of digits taken so far), and the total digits is 2n, the state can be represented with h and m. However, since h + m can be determined from h and m, maybe we can just track h and m. But since h + m can't exceed 2n, and for each step, the next move is either H or M, but only if the counts allow it.\n\nSo, for the DP state, we can use (current position in the string, h, m). Wait, but the current position can be derived from h and m. Because the initial length is 2n. After taking h + m digits, the current position is h + m digits into the string. So the current digit is A[h + m]. So perhaps the state can be represented by (h, m), where h is the number of digits Homer has taken so far, and m is the number of digits Marge has taken. Then, the current digit is at index h + m.\n\nThe idea is that, for each state (h, m), we can decide whether to take the next digit as H or M, provided that h < n and m < n respectively. Then, we can compute the maximum total sum possible from that state onwards.\n\nBut how do we compute the maximum sum? Well, for each state (h, m), the next digit is A[h + m], and if we take it as H, then the sum will be the value of that digit (converted to integer) plus the result of the subproblem (h+1, m). Similarly for taking it as M, add the digit to the sum and proceed with (h, m+1). Wait, but the total sum is S1 + S2, which is the sum of all digits taken by both players. Wait, no! Wait, S1 is the number formed by Homer's digits, and S2 is the same for Marge. The total prize is S1 + S2. But S1 is the number formed by the digits taken by Homer in order. For example, if Homer takes digits d1, d2, then S1 is d1*10^{n-1} + d2*10^{n-2} ... etc. Similarly for S2. So the sum isn't simply the sum of all digits, but the actual numeric values of S1 and S2.\n\nOh, that complicates things. Because the value of each digit depends on its position in the player's number. For example, the first digit Homer takes is the most significant digit in his number. So, when he takes a digit at step i (where i is the number of digits he's already taken), that digit contributes digit * 10^{n - i - 1} to S1. Wait, let's think: if Homer takes n digits, then the first digit he takes is the first digit of his number, which is multiplied by 10^{n-1}, the second by 10^{n-2}, etc. So for each digit taken by Homer at the time when he has already taken h digits (so this is his (h+1)th digit), the contribution to S1 is digit * 10^{n - h - 1}.\n\nSimilarly for Marge. So the problem is not about maximizing the sum of digits, but the sum of the numbers formed by their digits. Therefore, the choice of who takes which digit affects the value of the numbers in a way that depends on the position in which the digit is taken by the player.\n\nThis makes the problem more complex. How can we model this in DP?\n\nLet me think. The DP state needs to track not only how many digits each player has taken, but also the current value of S1 and S2. However, for n=18, each player's number can be up to 18 digits long, which is way too big to track in the state. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each state (h, m), which represents that Homer has taken h digits, Marge m digits, we can calculate the maximum possible total value (S1 + S2) that can be achieved from this state onward. The key is that when making a decision (H or M), the current digit is added to the respective player's number, contributing a certain value based on the position in their number.\n\nFor example, suppose the current state is (h, m). The current digit is A[h + m]. If we choose to take it as Homer, then this digit is the (h+1)th digit of Homer's number. So its contribution to S1 is digit * 10^{n - h - 1}. Then, the remaining problem is to compute the maximum value from state (h+1, m). Similarly for Marge.\n\nSo the DP recurrence would be:\n\ndp[h][m] = max(\n   (digit * 10^{n - h - 1} ) + dp[h+1][m], \n   (digit * 10^{n - m - 1} ) + dp[h][m+1]\n)\n\nBut wait, the digit is the same in both cases, but added to different players. So for the current state, the digit is added to either Homer's or Marge's number, contributing accordingly. Then, the rest of the digits are processed recursively.\n\nYes. And the base case is when h == n and m == n, then the total is 0. Also, for the state (h, m), the next digit is at position h + m in the original string. So the DP can be memoized based on h and m.\n\nBut for n=18, the number of states is (n+1)*(n+1) = 19*19 = 361. Which is manageable. Because for each state, we have to compute two possibilities. So the total time complexity is O(n²), which is acceptable.\n\nWait, but for each state, we need to compute the value of the digit multiplied by the appropriate power of 10. How do we compute that quickly?\n\nWe can precompute the powers of 10 for each possible position. For example, for Homer, when he takes his k-th digit (i.e., when he has taken h = k-1 digits before this step), then the contribution is digit * 10^{n - k} (since after taking this digit, he has k digits, and the new digit is the k-th one, which is multiplied by 10^{n -k} ? Wait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose Homer has to take exactly n digits. The first digit he takes is the first digit of his number. Its weight is 10^{n-1}, because for example, if n=2, then the first digit is multiplied by 10^1, the second by 10^0. So when Homer takes his (h+1)th digit (because he has already taken h digits), the weight is 10^{n - (h+1)} ?\n\nWait, for example, h is the number of digits he has already taken. So when he takes the next digit, it's the (h+1)th digit. So the position in his number is (h+1), and the weight is 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nYes. So for the current state (h, m), if we take the next digit as Homer, the contribution is digit * 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nSimilarly for Marge, when she takes the next digit, it's her (m+1)th digit, so the contribution is digit * 10^{n - (m+1)}.\n\nWait, but the exponents depend on the number of digits each player has. So for Homer, when he has taken h digits, and takes another, he now has h+1 digits. The new digit is the (h+1)th digit of his number. So the weight is 10^{n - (h+1)}.\n\nYes. So for the DP, the value of choosing H is the digit multiplied by 10^{n - h - 1} plus the DP value of (h+1, m). Similarly for M.\n\nSo the DP approach is feasible. Now, the question is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut for n up to 18, the exponents can be up to 10^17, but Python can handle big integers, so no problem.\n\nNow, the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the powers of 10 for all possible positions. For example, for Homer's h-th step (when he takes his (h+1)th digit?), no, for h being the number of digits he has already taken, then the next digit is the (h+1)th, so the exponent is n - (h+1) = n - h - 1. So for each h and m, when considering the next digit, the exponent for Homer is n - h - 1, and for Marge is n - m - 1.\n\nBut how to compute this? For example, for a given h and m, the current digit is A[h + m], which is the next digit to take. Let's say the original string is stored as a list of digits (as integers).\n\nSo, the DP function can be memoized using memoization, perhaps via lru_cache, but for Python, with n up to 18, and h and m up to 18, the number of states is manageable.\n\nBut for memoization, since Python's recursion stack may be an issue, perhaps an iterative DP approach is better. Let's think about how to compute this.\n\nWe can create a memo table, dp[h][m], which stores the maximum total value achievable from state (h, m).\n\nThe base case is when h == n and m == n. Then dp[n][n] = 0.\n\nFor other states, we need to check if we can take H or M. For example, if h < n, then we can take H. Similarly for M.\n\nSo for each state (h, m), we can compute dp[h][m] as follows:\n\ncurrent_digit = A[h + m]\n\nif h < n and m < n:\n\n   option1 = current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp[h+1][m]\n\n   option2 = current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp[h][m+1]\n\n   dp[h][m] = max(option1, option2)\n\nBut if h == n, then we can't take H, so we have to take M. Similarly, if m == n, we have to take H.\n\nSo the transitions are:\n\nfor h in range(n, -1, -1):\n\n   for m in range(n, -1, -1):\n\n      if h + m == 2n: \n\n          dp[h][m] = 0\n\n      else:\n\n          if h < n and m < n:\n\n              ... compute both options\n\n          elif h < n:\n\n              take H\n\n          else:\n\n              take M\n\nWait, but the order of processing the states is important. Since dp[h][m] depends on dp[h+1][m] and dp[h][m+1], we need to process the states in reverse order, starting from h + m = 2n - 1 down to 0.\n\nSo, for example, for h and m such that h + m is larger, we compute their dp values first.\n\nSo, the way to iterate is for the sum s = h + m, from 2n-1 down to 0. For each s, we can loop through possible h and m where h + m = s. For each such (h, m), compute dp[h][m].\n\nBut how to loop through h and m? Well, for each s, h can range from max(0, s - n) to min(n, s), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for each s, h can be from 0 to n, and m = s - h. But m must be between 0 and n. So for each s, h can be from max(0, s - n) to min(n, s), and m is s - h. But since h + m = s, and m must be <=n, then s - h <=n => h >= s -n. So yes.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to iterate s from 2n-1 down to 0, and for each s, iterate h from 0 to n, and m = s - h. Then check if m is between 0 and n. If not, skip.\n\nBut for each h and m, we can compute the value.\n\nOnce we have the dp table filled, then we can reconstruct the path. For that, we need to know, for each state (h, m), whether we took H or M, which gives the maximum value. So during the DP computation, we can also store a parent table that records the choice made (H or M) at each state.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the digits of A as a list of integers.\n\n- Precompute the powers of 10 up to n digits. For example, pow10[k] = 10^k. But for each possible exponent, like n - h - 1, which can be up to n-1 (when h=0) down to 0 (when h = n-1).\n\n- Initialize a dp table of size (n+1) x (n+1), and a choice table of the same size.\n\n- Fill the dp table in reverse order, for each state (h, m), compute the maximum value and the choice.\n\nOnce the dp table is filled, we can start from (0, 0) and follow the choices to build the sequence of H and M.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation details.\n\nFirst, reading the input. The input is n and a string A of 2n digits. For example, for the first sample input, n is 2 and A is '1234'. So the digits are [1,2,3,4].\n\nThen, for the DP, for each state (h, m), the current digit is A[h + m], which is the (h + m)th character of the string. Wait, but strings are 0-based or 1-based? The problem says that the input is given as a string. So for example, in the first sample input, the digits are 1, 2, 3, 4. The first move takes the leftmost digit, which is 1. So in code, the digits are stored as a list, say, digits = [int(c) for c in A].\n\nSo for h and m, the index is h + m. For example, if h=0 and m=0, the index is 0, which is the first digit.\n\nNow, the pow10 array. For example, for Homer's choice, when he takes the (h+1)th digit, the exponent is (n - (h+1)) = n - h - 1. So the value is digit * 10^{n - h - 1}.\n\nSo for each h, we can compute this exponent. Similarly for Marge's choice.\n\nBut for exponents up to n-1, which for n=18 is 17, so 10^17 is manageable as a Python integer.\n\nSo, precomputing pow10 up to 18 digits would be helpful. For example, pow10[i] = 10^i. So for exponents up to 18, we can precompute this.\n\nBut wait, the exponent for Homer is (n - h -1). So for h ranging from 0 to n-1, the exponent ranges from (n-1) down to 0. So for n up to 18, the maximum exponent is 17. So precompute pow10 up to 18.\n\nSo, in code:\n\npow10 = [1] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\nBut wait, for exponents up to n-1. So for n=18, we need exponents up to 17. So pow10 should be up to 18 elements, where pow10[0] is 1 (10^0), pow10[1] is 10^1, etc. So the code is correct.\n\nOnce that is done, for each state (h, m), the current digit is digits[h + m], and for the options:\n\nif choosing H, then the contribution is digits[h + m] * pow10[n - h - 1]\n\nSimilarly for choosing M: digits[h + m] * pow10[n - m - 1]\n\nSo, with that, the DP can be filled.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n and A.\n\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\nprecompute pow10.\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1), and choice as a 2D array of size (n+1) x (n+1) storing 'H' or 'M'.\n\nThen, fill dp and choice:\n\nfor s in range(2n - 1, -1, -1):\n\n    for h in 0 ... n:\n\n        m = s - h\n\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n\n            continue\n\n        if h == n and m == n:\n\n            dp[h][m] = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            current_digit = digits[s]\n\n            if h < n and m < n:\n\n                option_h = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] + dp[h+1][m]\n\n                option_m = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] + dp[h][m+1]\n\n                if option_h > option_m:\n\n                    dp[h][m] = option_h\n\n                    choice[h][m] = 'H'\n\n                else:\n\n                    dp[h][m] = option_m\n\n                    choice[h][m] = 'M'\n\n            elif h < n:\n\n                # must choose H\n\n                dp[h][m] = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] + dp[h+1][m]\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'H'\n\n            else:\n\n                # must choose M\n\n                dp[h][m] = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] + dp[h][m+1]\n\n                choice[h][m] = 'M'\n\nWait, but s is h + m. So for each h and m, the current digit is digits[s]. But when filling the dp table, for a given s, the h and m are varying such that h + m = s. So for each state (h, m), the current digit is digits[s], where s = h + m.\n\nBut the code above loops s from 2n-1 down to 0. For example, when s is 2n-1, then h + m = 2n-1. Since h can be up to n, and m up to n, but for h + m = 2n-1, possible combinations are h = n-1, m = n; or h = n, m = n-1. But in those cases, one of h or m is already at n, so the code would have to choose the other.\n\nBut in the code, for each s, we loop through possible h and m.\n\nOnce the dp and choice tables are filled, then the path can be reconstructed by starting at (0, 0), and for each step, appending the choice (H or M) and moving to the next state (h+1, m) or (h, m+1).\n\nBut how to reconstruct the path? Let's see:\n\nInitialize h = 0, m = 0. The result string is empty.\n\nFor each step, append the choice for (h, m), then update h or m accordingly. Repeat until h + m = 2n.\n\nSo, for example, for the first sample input:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\ndigits = [1,2,3,4]\n\npow10 for n=2 is [1, 10, 100]\n\nSo for each state:\n\nLet me try to compute the dp table manually for the sample input.\n\nBut maybe that's tedious. Let's proceed with code.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut for the DP, in Python, we can use a 2D list for dp and choice. Since n can be up to 18, the 2D list is manageable.\n\nBut for the loops, the code would be:\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\nlength = 2 * n\n\npow10 = [1] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    pow10[i] = pow10[i-1] * 10\n\n# Initialize dp and choice\ndp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\nchoice = [['']*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor s in range(2*n -1, -1, -1):\n    for h in range(0, n+1):\n        m = s - h\n        if m < 0 or m > n:\n            continue\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            dp[h][m] = 0\n        else:\n            current_digit = digits[s]\n            if h < n and m < n:\n                # can choose H or M\n                val_h = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] + dp[h+1][m]\n                val_m = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] + dp[h][m+1]\n                if val_h > val_m:\n                    dp[h][m] = val_h\n                    choice[h][m] = 'H'\n                else:\n                    dp[h][m] = val_m\n                    choice[h][m] = 'M'\n            elif h < n:\n                # must choose H\n                dp[h][m] = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] + dp[h+1][m]\n                choice[h][m] = 'H'\n            else:\n                # must choose M\n                dp[h][m] = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] + dp[h][m+1]\n                choice[h][m] = 'M'\n\nOnce that's done, reconstruct the path.\n\nNow, reconstructing the path:\n\nh = 0\nm = 0\nresult = []\nfor _ in range(2*n):\n    c = choice[h][m]\n    result.append(c)\n    if c == 'H':\n        h += 1\n    else:\n        m += 1\n\nprint(''.join(result))\n\nWait, but for the first sample input, let's see.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2, A=1234.\n\ndigits = [1,2,3,4]\n\npow10 for n=2 is [1, 10, 100]\n\nLet's think about the dp table.\n\nThe s starts from 3 (since 2n-1 = 3) down to 0.\n\ns=3:\n\nh can be 0, m=3 (invalid), or h=1, m=2 (valid?), since m=2 is <=n=2.\n\nWait, for s=3, h can be from 0 to 3.

So total 4. choice is H.\n\nSo dp[1][2] = 4.\n\nFor h=2, m=1:\n\nh=2 == n, so must choose M. current_digit is digits[3] = 4. m=1 < 2. So contribution is 4 * 10^(2 - 1 -1) = 4 * 10^0 =4. Add dp[2][2] (0). So dp[2][1] = 4. choice is M.\n\nNow s=3 is processed.\n\nThen s=2:\n\nh ranges from 0 to 2.\n\nh=0: m=2. valid.\n\nh=1: m=1. valid.\n\nh=2: m=0. valid.\n\nFor h=0, m=2:\n\nh < 2, m ==2. So must choose H. current_digit is digits[2] = 3. contribution is 3 * 10^(2 - 0 -1) = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then add dp[1][2] which is 4. Total 34. choice is H.\n\nFor h=1, m=1:\n\ncan choose H or M. current_digit is digits[2] =3.\n\nval_h is 3 * 10^(2 -1 -1) = 3 * 1 =3 + dp[2][1] (which is 4) → 7.\n\nval_m is 3 * 10^(2 -1 -1) = 3 * 1 =3 + dp[1][2] (which is 4) → 7. So equal. So choice can be H or M. According to the code, it would choose H if equal? No, the code chooses H if val_h is greater than or equal to val_m? Wait, in the code, the condition is if val_h > val_m, then choose H. Else choose M. So for equal values, it would choose M. Wait, no. Because in the code, when val_h is not greater than val_m, it takes the else clause, which is val_m. So in case of equality, it chooses M. But the problem says that if there are multiple solutions, output any of them. So the code's choice here is arbitrary.\n\nIn this case, for the sample input, the correct answer is HHMM or HMHM. Let's see what the code would choose here.\n\nBut perhaps the code's choice in this case would affect the final path. However, the problem allows any correct solution.\n\nContinuing with the example. For h=1, m=1, the code would choose M if val_h is equal to val_m.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nFor h=1, m=1, the code would choose M. Then, the dp[1][1] is 3 + 4 = 7. choice is M.\n\nThen for h=2, m=0: must choose M. current digit is digits[2] =3. m is 0 < 2. contribution is 3 * 10^(2 -0 -1) = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then add dp[2][1] which is 4. Total 34. choice is M.\n\nSo for s=2, the dp entries are filled.\n\nProceeding further, but perhaps this is getting too detailed. The code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input would generate the correct output.\n\nBut there's a problem in the code. For the pow10 array, when n is 2, pow10 is [1, 10, 100]. So for n - h -1, when h is 0, it's 2 - 0 -1 = 1, so pow10[1] is 10. Which is correct. For example, when Homer takes his first digit (h=0), the contribution is digit * 10^(n-0-1) = digit * 10^(n-1). Which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: the pow10 array is precomputed up to n. But for exponents up to n-1, which is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input would generate the correct output.\n\nAnother test case is the second example in the input:\n\nInput is n=2, A=9911. Output is HMHM.\n\nBut according to the code, let's see.\n\ndigits = [9,9,1,1]\n\npow10 is [1, 10, 100].\n\nLet's think about the steps.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly choose the best options.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. But in Python, for the loops, the code would need to process s from 2n-1 down to 0. For each s, loop h from 0 to n, and check if m = s - h is between 0 and n.\n\nBut in Python, for the loops:\n\nfor s in reversed(range(2*n)):\n\nWait, 2n is the length of the digits. So 2n is 4 for n=2. The range(2n) is 0..3. So reversed(range(2n)) is 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor s in range(2*n - 1, -1, -1):\n\nBut 2n-1 is 3 for n=2, which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the loops:\n\nfor s in range(2 * n - 1, -1, -1):\n\nBut for n=2, 2n is 4, 2n-1 is 3. So yes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nOnce the dp and choice tables are filled, then reconstructing the path.\n\nBut what about the case when there are multiple choices (like when val_h == val_m)? The code would choose M, as per the code's logic. However, the problem allows any of the possible correct sequences. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=2\n\nA=1234 → digits [1,2,3,4]\n\nThe code's choice for (0,0) is 'H' or 'M'? Let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the code would generate 'HHMM' or 'HMHM' depending on the choices made in the DP steps. For example, in the sample input, the first sample output is 'HHMM'.\n\nBut how does the code handle it?\n\nWell, the code would compute the maximum sum. Let's think about the sum.\n\nIf the sequence is HHMM:\n\nHomer takes 1, 2 → S1 is 12.\n\nMarge takes 3,4 → S2 is 34. Total is 12 + 34 = 46.\n\nAlternatively, HMHM:\n\nH takes 1, 3 → 13.\n\nM takes 2, 4 → 24. Total 13 +24 = 37. Which is less than 46. So why is the sample output 'HHMM'?\n\nWait, but the sample output shows that the first input's output is 'HHMM', which gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut according to the code, the DP would select the maximum sum. So the code should generate that.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the DP steps.\n\nAt (0,0), the current digit is 1 (digits[0]).\n\nThe code would compare choosing H or M.\n\nIf choosing H:\n\ncontribution is 1 * 10^(2-0-1) = 1 * 10^1 = 10. Then, the rest of the steps would be handled by dp[1][0].\n\nIf choosing M: contribution is 1 * 10^(2-0-1) = 10? Wait, no. For M, the exponent is n - m -1. At (0,0), m is 0. So exponent is 2 - 0 -1 = 1. So 1 * 10^1 = 10. So both options give the same contribution. Then, the code would choose M (since val_h is not greater than val_m, it would choose M). But that would lead to a different path.\n\nWait, but in this case, the code would choose M, leading to the sequence starting with M, which may not be optimal. But this contradicts the sample input. So perhaps there is a mistake in the code's logic.\n\nWait, this suggests that there's a problem in the code. Because for the first step, the code would choose between H and M, but both options contribute the same value. However, the choice made here would affect the rest of the steps.\n\nBut in the sample input, the maximum sum is achieved by taking H first. So why would the code choose between H and M in this case?\n\nAh, perhaps my previous analysis was wrong. Let me re-examine the code's logic.\n\nAt (0,0), the code compares option_h and option_m.\n\noption_h = current_digit * pow10[n - h -1] + dp[h+1][m]\n\noption_m = current_digit * pow10[n - m -1] + dp[h][m+1]\n\nIn this case, current_digit is 1, h=0, m=0.\n\nn - h -1 = 2 - 0 -1 = 1 → 10^1 = 10.\n\nn - m -1 = 2 - 0 -1 = 1 → same as above.\n\nSo option_h and option_m are both 1*10 + dp[1][0] and 1*10 + dp[0][1].\n\nSo the code would compare dp[1][0] vs dp[0][1], and choose whichever is larger.\n\nSo the choice depends on the future steps.\n\nThus, the code's decision is not based solely on the current digit, but on the entire future steps.\n\nSo the code's logic is correct. It's possible that even though the current choice gives the same contribution, the future steps may differ.\n\nThus, the code would correctly compute the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to ensure that the code is correct?\n\nWell, the code is written as per the logic, and the sample input may have multiple correct outputs, but the code should choose one of them.\n\nBut for the first sample input, the code may output either 'HHMM' or 'HMHM' depending on the choices made during the DP steps. However, according to the sample, the correct output is 'HHMM'.\n\nBut perhaps the code would generate that.\n\nBut in any case, the code is correct in terms of choosing the maximum sum. The problem allows any correct sequence.\n\nNow, the code's reconstruction part is correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: in the code, the pow10 array is of size (n+1), but for exponents up to n-1. For example, when n is 2, the pow10 array is [1, 10, 100], and for exponents up to 1, which is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- All digits are zero. The output can be any sequence.\n\n- n=1: two digits. The code must choose which player takes first.\n\nFor example, n=1, A=12. The options are HM or MH. The sum would be 1 + 2 = 3 (HM) or 2 + 1 = 3 (MH). Both are equal, so either is acceptable.\n\nAnother edge case is when the digits are such that the choice between H and M depends on the future steps.\n\nNow, implementing the code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for the loops:\n\nfor s in range(2 * n - 1, -1, -1):\n\nBut 2*n can be up to 36 (when n=18). So for s in range(35, -1, -1).\n\nBut in Python, range(a, b, step) is exclusive of the end. So to generate from 2n-1 down to 0, inclusive, the code should be:\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize is maximized. Each player takes exactly n turns, and the goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers formed by the digits they collect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table where `dp[h][m]` represents the maximum total prize achievable when Homer has taken `h` digits and Marge has taken `m` digits.\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: Since each digit's contribution to the final number depends on its position, we precompute powers of 10 up to `n` to efficiently calculate the value of each digit in its respective position.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each state `(h, m)`, we decide whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit based on which choice leads to a higher total prize. This decision is made by evaluating both possibilities and choosing the one with the higher value.\n4. **Reconstructing the Path**: After filling the DP table, we trace back from the initial state `(0, 0)` to determine the sequence of moves that led to the maximum total prize.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n    length = 2 * n\n\n    # Precompute powers of 10\n    pow10 = [1] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        pow10[i] = pow10[i - 1] * 10\n\n    # Initialize dp and choice tables\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    choice = [[''] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n\n    # Fill dp and choice tables\n    for s in range(2 * n - 1, -1, -1):\n        for h in range(n + 1):\n            m = s - h\n            if m < 0 or m > n:\n                continue\n            if h == n and m == n:\n                dp[h][m] = 0\n            else:\n                current_digit = digits[s]\n                if h < n and m < n:\n                    val_h = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] + dp[h + 1][m]\n                    val_m = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] + dp[h][m + 1]\n                    if val_h > val_m:\n                        dp[h][m] = val_h\n                        choice[h][m] = 'H'\n                    else:\n                        dp[h][m] = val_m\n                        choice[h][m] = 'M'\n                elif h < n:\n                    dp[h][m] = current_digit * pow10[n - h - 1] + dp[h + 1][m]\n                    choice[h][m] = 'H'\n                else:\n                    dp[h][m] = current_digit * pow10[n - m - 1] + dp[h][m + 1]\n                    choice[h][m] = 'M'\n\n    # Reconstruct the path\n    result = []\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    for _ in range(2 * n):\n        c = choice[h][m]\n        result.append(c)\n        if c == 'H':\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            m += 1\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The `dp` table is initialized to store the maximum total prize for each state `(h, m)`.\n- **Power of 10 Calculation**: Precomputing powers of 10 allows quick calculation of the contribution of each digit based on its position in the respective player's number.\n- **State Transition**: For each state `(h, m)`, we evaluate both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and choose the one that maximizes the total prize.\n- **Path Reconstruction**: Starting from the initial state `(0, 0)`, we use the `choice` table to determine the sequence of moves that leads to the optimal solution.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal sequence using dynamic programming, considering all possible future moves and their contributions to the total prize.",
