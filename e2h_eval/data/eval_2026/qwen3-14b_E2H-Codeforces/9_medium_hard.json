Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So, the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the time complexity would be too high. Let me think about how to approach this efficiently.\n\nHmm, since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can handle each weight category separately. Let's think about grouping all items by their weight. For example, collect all items with weight 1, sort them in descending order of cost, and do the same for weight 2 and 3. Then, for each weight group, we can precompute prefix sums so that we can quickly calculate the maximum cost for taking k items from that group.\n\nBut how do we combine these groups optimally? Let's say we have a certain number of weight 1 items, weight 2 items, and weight 3 items. The problem is to choose how many of each to take such that the total weight doesn't exceed m, and the total cost is maximized.\n\nLet me think of this as a dynamic programming problem, but with optimized steps. However, even with that, for large m, it's not feasible. Wait, but since the weights are small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps there's a way to compute the optimal combination using the prefix sums.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible number of weight 3 items taken, we can calculate how much weight is left and then decide how to take weight 1 and 2 items optimally. But since the number of weight 3 items can be up to m//3, which could be up to 1e5 (if m is 3e5), this might be manageable if we can process the rest efficiently.\n\nWait, but even that might be O(m) which is 3e5, but multiplied by something else. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each weight group, we can precompute the best possible selection for any number of items. For example, for weight 1, the best is to take the top k items. Similarly for weight 2 and 3.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group. For example, prefix1[i] is the sum of the first i items in the weight 1 group. Similarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n4. Now, the problem becomes choosing x items from group1, y items from group2, z items from group3 such that x*1 + y*2 + z*3 <= m, and the total cost is prefix1[x] + prefix2[y] + prefix3[z], which is maximum.\n\nBut how to find x, y, z efficiently?\n\nThe challenge is to iterate through possible values of z (number of weight3 items) and then compute the optimal x and y for the remaining weight. But even that may be computationally heavy if done naively.\n\nLet me think: For each possible z (number of weight3 items taken), the maximum possible is up to min( len(group3), m//3 ). Then, the remaining weight is m' = m - 3*z. Now, for this m', we need to choose x and y such that x + 2y ≤ m', and maximize prefix1[x] + prefix2[y].\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently for each m'?\n\nFor each possible m', the maximum of prefix1[x] + prefix2[y], given that x + 2y ≤ m'. How can we compute this quickly?\n\nLet me think about the x and y part. For a given m', we can iterate over possible y values, and for each y, the maximum x is m' - 2y. Then, take the prefix1 up to that x. But for each m', if we iterate all possible y, that would be O(m') per m', which could be expensive.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible y, we can compute the maximum x allowed. But since the group2 is sorted, for each possible y, we can take up to floor( (m' - 2y)/1 ) items from group1. Wait, but group1 is sorted, so taking as many as possible from group1 is optimal. So for a given y, the x is min( len(group1), m' - 2y ), and then take the prefix1 up to that x. But how to find the optimal y?\n\nBut for each m', the optimal y can be found by trying all possible y values up to min(len(group2), m'//2). However, m' can be up to 3e5, and for each z, m' can be up to 3e5, leading to O(3e5 * 3e5) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThis approach would be O(z_max * y_max), which is O( (m/3) * (m/2) )) = O(m²), which is 9e10 operations. That's impossible.\n\nWe need a better way to compute, for a given m', the maximum value of prefix1[x] + prefix2[y], where x + 2y ≤ m'.\n\nLet me think about the x and y part again. Suppose we have a fixed m'. We can think of this as a two-dimensional knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2. But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can precompute for each possible number of items taken from group2 (y) and then take the maximum x possible.\n\nBut even then, for each m', how to find the best combination of x and y?\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible number of group2 items (y), we can precompute the maximum possible group1 items that can be taken given that 2y + x ≤ m'. So for each y, x can be up to (m' - 2y). Since group1 is sorted, the best x is the maximum possible, i.e., take min( (m' - 2y), len(group1) ) items. So for each possible y, the total cost is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, m' - 2y ) ].\n\nBut how to find the optimal y for this?\n\nThe maximum y can be up to min( len(group2), floor( m' / 2 ) ). Let's denote that as y_max.\n\nNow, for each m', we can iterate y from 0 to y_max, compute the corresponding x, and find the maximum sum. However, if m' is up to 3e5, and for each z (up to 1e5), this would be O(3e5) operations, which is 3e5 * 1e5 = 3e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is not efficient enough. Need another idea.\n\nLet me think again. Since the group1 and group2 can be processed in a way that allows us to find the optimal combination quickly. For example, for a given m', the optimal choice of y is to take as many group2 items as possible, but maybe not. Because group2 items have higher cost per unit weight than group1? Not necessarily. So it depends on the actual costs.\n\nBut since group2 is sorted, and group1 is sorted, perhaps we can precompute for each possible weight (up to m) the best combination of group1 and group2 items.\n\nWait, but that's similar to the original knapsack problem with two item types. Let me think of this as a knapsack problem with two types of items (weight 1 and 2), and we want to find the maximum value for capacity m'.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the two groups:\n\nFor group1 and group2, we can precompute an array dp where dp[w] is the maximum value achievable with weight w using items from group1 and group2.\n\nBut for m' up to 3e5, and with group1 and group2 sizes up to 1e5 each, how to compute this?\n\nBut considering that group1 and group2 are sorted, perhaps there's a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the group1 and group2. For group1, the best way to take x items is to take the top x items. Similarly for group2. So for a given total weight W, the optimal way is to take some number of group2 items (y) and then fill the rest with group1 items.\n\nLet me consider that for a given W, the optimal y can be determined as follows:\n\nWe can try all possible y such that 2y ≤ W. For each y, the number of group1 items is W - 2y. However, since group1 is sorted, taking min( (W - 2y), len1 ) items gives the maximum value.\n\nBut again, trying all y for each W is O(W) per W, which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For group1 and group2, precompute the prefix sums. Then, for any W, the optimal combination can be found by considering for each possible y (number of group2 items) up to min( len2, W//2 ), and take the maximum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, W - 2y ) ].\n\nBut again, for large W, this is expensive.\n\nBut perhaps for the group1 and group2, we can precompute for each possible number of group2 items, and for each possible W, find the best way. But I'm stuck.\n\nWait, here's another idea: For the group1 and group2, since the items are sorted, the best way to take y group2 items and x group1 items is to take as many as possible of the higher-value items. So for a given W, the optimal y can be found by checking all possible y in a certain range.\n\nBut how to find that range quickly?\n\nAlternatively, for the group1 and group2, let's precompute for each possible number of group2 items (y), the maximum number of group1 items that can be taken. Then, for each y, we can compute the total cost. The maximum among all possible y is the answer for that W.\n\nBut again, for each W, this is O(y_max) steps.\n\nBut perhaps, given that the group2 is sorted, and the group1 is sorted, we can find that the optimal y for a given W is either floor(W/2) or something around there. However, this is not necessarily true.\n\nAnother angle: For the group1 and group2, the maximum value for weight W can be computed by considering two possibilities:\n\n1. Take as many group2 items as possible, then fill the rest with group1 items.\n\n2. Take one less group2 item, and fill the rest with group1 items.\n\nBut this might not capture all possibilities. However, perhaps for the optimal solution, the number of group2 items taken is either floor(W/2) or ceil(W/2), or something similar. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since group2 items are sorted, the best way to take y group2 items is to take the first y items. So for a given W, the optimal y is in the range [max(0, y_opt - k), y_opt +k], where k is small. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose group2 items are [5,4,3,2,1], and group1 items are [10,9,8,7,6]. For W=5.\n\nIf I take y=2 group2 items (total weight 4), then take 1 group1 item (total weight 1). Total value is 5+4 +10=19.\n\nIf I take y=1 group2 item (weight 2), then take 3 group1 items (weight 3). Value is 5 + 10+9+8=32. Which is better.\n\nSo the optimal y is not necessarily the maximum possible (which was 2 for W=5). Hence, trying all possible y's up to max is necessary.\n\nBut this brings us back to the original problem of needing to check all possible y for each W, which is expensive.\n\nHmm. Let's think again about the original problem. The weight of the items is 1, 2, or 3. Maybe there's a way to model this as a knapsack problem where for each weight group, we can compute the best possible selection.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- For the weight 3 items, since they are expensive in terms of weight, but their cost can be anything, perhaps we can precompute all possible numbers of weight 3 items taken, and for each, compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, process the weight 1, 2, 3 items.\n\nGroup1: sorted descending, prefix1.\n\nGroup2: sorted descending, prefix2.\n\nGroup3: sorted descending, prefix3.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight3 items taken (z), from 0 to min( len3, m//3 ), compute the remaining weight: rem = m - 3*z.\n\nNow, for this rem, compute the best combination of group1 and group2 items. Let's call this function f(rem) which returns the maximum value for group1 and group2 with total weight up to rem.\n\nSo the overall maximum is the maximum over all z of (prefix3[z] + f(rem)).\n\nThe problem now is to compute f(rem) quickly.\n\nNow, how to compute f(rem) quickly for any rem?\n\nLet me think about f(rem) again. It's the maximum value of taking x items from group1 and y items from group2 such that x + 2y ≤ rem.\n\nLet me think of this as a knapsack problem with two types of items, but with the twist that the items are sorted and we can take any number up to the available count.\n\nAn alternative idea: For each possible number of group2 items y, we can take up to y_max = min( len2, rem//2 ), and for each y, the x can be up to min( len1, rem - 2y ). So the total value for this y is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, rem - 2y ) ].\n\nTo find the maximum of this over all possible y, including y=0 to y_max.\n\nBut if we can compute this in O(1) or O(1) per rem, that would be great. However, how?\n\nLet me think of precomputing for group1 and group2 the best possible for any possible rem. But with rem up to 3e5, and for each possible rem, this could be O(rem) time, which is not feasible.\n\nAnother idea: For group2, since the items are sorted, for any given rem, the optimal number of group2 items to take is up to min( len2, rem//2 ), but perhaps we can find the optimal y by considering that for each possible y, the x is rem - 2y, but only up to the available group1 items.\n\nBut since group1 is sorted, the more group1 items you take, the better. So for a given y, the x is as much as possible. Thus, for each possible y, we can compute the value as prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, rem - 2y ) ].\n\nNow, the question is, for a given rem, what is the maximum value of this expression for y in 0 ≤ y ≤ y_max (where y_max = min( len2, rem//2 )).\n\nBut how to compute this maximum quickly.\n\nLet me think of rem as a fixed value. Let's denote that for each possible y, the term is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, rem - 2y ) ].\n\nSuppose that rem is fixed. Let's imagine that for each y, the value is calculated as follows.\n\nLet me consider that for a given y, the value is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, rem - 2y ) ].\n\nBut rem - 2y could be negative. So when rem - 2y <0, that y is invalid. Hence, y can be up to floor(rem/2).\n\nBut how to find the maximum of this function over y?\n\nLet me think of this function as a function of y. For y in 0 to y_max.\n\nLet me note that for y increasing, the term 2y increases, so rem - 2y decreases. So the amount of group1 items that can be taken decreases as y increases.\n\nSo the function is a combination of two factors: increasing y adds prefix2[y], but reduces the possible x (group1 items) taken.\n\nThe optimal y is somewhere between 0 and y_max. However, since both prefix2 and prefix1 are non-decreasing functions, it's possible that the optimal y is not at the extremes.\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly.\n\nAn alternative idea is to precompute for group1 and group2 the best possible for all possible weights up to m. But since m is up to 3e5, and for each weight, this would take O(1) time, perhaps with some pre-processing.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach for group1 and group2:\n\nFor any weight W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many group2 items as possible, and filling the rest with group1 items.\n\n- Taking one less group2 item and filling the rest with group1 items.\n\nBut how to find the best option.\n\nAlternatively, since group2 items have weight 2, and group1 items have weight 1, for a given W, the optimal number of group2 items can be in the range of floor(W/2) - k to floor(W/2) + k for small k. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, the optimal y is either floor(W/2) or floor(W/2) - 1, etc. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose W is 5. Then possible y is 0, 1, 2.\n\nFor y=2, 2y=4, x=1 → total is prefix2[2] + prefix1[1].\n\nFor y=1, 2y=2, x=3 → prefix2[1] + prefix1[3].\n\nFor y=0, x=5 → prefix2[0] + prefix1[5].\n\nWhich of these is better depends on the actual values.\n\nBut in general, it's possible that the maximum occurs near the maximum possible y.\n\nBut how to find that without checking all possible y's?\n\nAnother idea: For a given W, the maximum number of group2 items is y_max = min( len2, W // 2 ). Let's consider taking y_max, y_max - 1, ..., down to max(0, y_max - k) for some small k. For example, k=200. Then, for each of these y's, compute the value and take the maximum. This would be O(k) per W.\n\nBut why would this work? Well, if the group2 items are very valuable compared to group1, then taking as many as possible is optimal. If group1 items are more valuable, then taking fewer group2 items and more group1 items would be better. However, since the group2 items are sorted, and group1 items are sorted, it's possible that the optimal y is in a small range around y_max or some other point.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible k that would cover all cases?\n\nWell, suppose that for a particular W, the optimal y is y_opt. Then, the difference between y_opt and y_max could be up to something. For example, if group1 items are extremely valuable, then maybe taking zero group2 items is optimal. But in that case, the group1 items are so valuable that even though you can take more items by reducing group2 items, the gain in group1 is worth it.\n\nBut how to find this without checking all possible y's?\n\nAlternatively, for each W, we can try all possible y's where y is between max(0, y_max - 1000) and y_max. But what value of 1000 would ensure that we don't miss the optimal y?\n\nBut this seems arbitrary and may not work for all cases. However, given that the constraints for n are up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, perhaps trying a few hundred possibilities for each W would be acceptable.\n\nBut how to choose this number? Let's think of the worst case. For example, if the group1 items are all very expensive, and group2 items are very cheap. Then, the optimal y would be 0. But if y_max is large (say, 1e5), then trying all y's from 0 to y_max is O(1e5) per W, which is not feasible.\n\nThus, this approach may not work.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the problem of combining group1 and group2 as follows. For any W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many group1 items as possible (x = min(W, len1)), and 0 group2 items.\n\n- Taking as many group2 items as possible (y = min(W//2, len2)), and then fill the rest with group1 items.\n\n- Also, possibly, taking y = floor(W/2) - 1, and then fill the rest with group1.\n\nBut how to know which of these options is best?\n\nThis seems like a heuristic, but perhaps in practice, the optimal solution is either taking the maximum number of group2 items, or one less, or something like that.\n\nBut this is not guaranteed. However, given the time constraints, perhaps this is the only feasible way to proceed.\n\nLet me try to think of the following approach for the function f(W):\n\nCompute the maximum between:\n\n1. Take as many group2 items as possible (y_max = min(len2, W//2)), then take x = W - 2*y_max group1 items.\n\n2. Take y_max - 1 group2 items, then take x = W - 2*(y_max -1) group1 items.\n\n3. Take y_max + 1 group2 items? No, since y_max is already the maximum.\n\nWait, no. So the maximum possible is y_max. So only check y_max and y_max - 1?\n\nBut this may not capture all cases. For example, if taking y_max - 2 is better.\n\nBut perhaps, for the purposes of this problem, given the time constraints, we can try all possible y in the range [max(0, y_max - 100), y_max], and take the maximum. The idea is that for large W, the optimal y is close to y_max.\n\nBut how to choose this 100? Well, given that the group2 items are sorted in descending order, and group1 items are also sorted, perhaps the optimal y is either y_max, or y_max - k where k is small. For example, if the group2 items are better than group1 items, then taking as many group2 as possible is optimal. Otherwise, taking fewer group2 items and more group1 items.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nAlternatively, we can try all possible y in the range [0, y_max], but only for small y_max. However, for large y_max (like up to 1e5), this is not feasible.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, for the group1 and group2, the maximum number of items in each group is up to 1e5. But when combined, for a given W, the y_max is up to min(len2, W//2). For example, if W is 3e5, then y_max can be up to 1.5e5.\n\nBut for each z in the group3 loop, we have to compute f(W) for W = m - 3*z. For example, if m is 3e5, and z is 0, then W is 3e5. Then, y_max is up to 1.5e5. For each of these, trying all y's from 0 to y_max is O(1.5e5) operations. And if z ranges up to 1e5, then the total operations would be 1e5 * 1.5e5 = 1.5e10, which is way too big.\n\nThis is not feasible. Therefore, this approach is not going to work. Need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the group1 and group2 as a combined knapsack. Since the items are sorted, perhaps we can precompute for each possible number of group2 items y, the maximum possible x for any weight.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the following: For group1 and group2, for any possible number of group2 items taken, we can precompute the maximum number of group1 items that can be taken given a certain total weight.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: For any weight W, the maximum value is the maximum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(len1, W - 2y)] for all y in 0..y_max.\n\nNow, since prefix1 is non-decreasing and prefix2 is non-decreasing, perhaps the function has a single peak, which allows us to find the maximum with a binary search approach.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me imagine varying y from 0 to y_max. As y increases, prefix2[y] increases, but W-2y decreases, which means prefix1[...] decreases. So the function is not necessarily unimodal. It could increase, then decrease, then increase again, depending on the actual values of the items.\n\nBut in practice, perhaps for most cases, the function is unimodal, allowing for binary search.\n\nBut this is not guaranteed. For example, imagine that group2 items have varying values. For instance, group2 has items [100, 1], and group1 has items [50, 50]. For W=3. \n\ny=0: x=3 → 0 + 150 = 150.\n\ny=1: 2*1=2 → x=1 → 100 + 50 = 150.\n\ny=2: 2*2=4 > 3 → invalid. So the maximum is 150.\n\nIn this case, the function has the same value at y=0 and y=1. So it's flat.\n\nAnother example: group2 has items [10, 9], group1 has items [8, 7, 6]. W=4.\n\ny=0: x=4 → 0 + 8+7+6 = 21.\n\ny=1: 2*1=2 → x=2 → 10 + 8+7 = 25.\n\ny=2: 2*2=4 → x=0 → 10+9 = 19.\n\nSo the maximum is at y=1.\n\nHere, the function increases then decreases.\n\nAnother example: group2 has items [10, 1], group1 has items [9, 8]. W=3.\n\ny=0: x=3 → 0 + 9+8 = 17.\n\ny=1: 2*1=2 → x=1 → 10 +9 =19.\n\ny=2: invalid.\n\nSo here, the maximum is at y=1.\n\nAnother case: group2 items are [5, 5], group1 items are [6, 6]. W=3.\n\ny=0: x=3 → 0 + 6+6 = 12.\n\ny=1: 2 → x=1 → 5 +6 = 11.\n\ny=2: 4>3 → invalid.\n\nSo the maximum is at y=0.\n\nSo, in this case, the function decreases as y increases.\n\nSo, the function is not strictly unimodal. It can have multiple peaks. Hence, binary search may not work.\n\nHmm. This seems like a dead end.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the group1 items are sorted and group2 items are sorted, for any given W, the optimal number of group2 items is such that the marginal value of adding a group2 item is greater than the marginal value of adding group1 items.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nFor example, for each additional group2 item, the cost increases by c2[y], and the weight increases by 2. For the group1 items, adding one item increases cost by c1[x], and weight increases by 1. So, comparing these, perhaps we can find the optimal y.\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nLet me think: For the current W, the optimal y is the one where adding another group2 item would require removing some group1 items. So, for example, if I take y group2 items, and x group1 items, then the total weight is 2y +x = W. If I take y+1 group2 items, then the weight would be 2(y+1) + x' = W, where x' = W - 2(y+1). But x' can be less than x. The question is whether the gain from adding the (y+1)th group2 item is worth the loss of the group1 items that are replaced.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nThis sounds like a greedy approach. For example, we can start with taking as many group1 items as possible, and then replace some group1 items with group2 items if it's beneficial.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think: For the current W, the initial state is x = min(W, len1), y = 0. Then, for each possible group2 item, we can check if replacing two group1 items (since 2y +x = W, adding one group2 item would increase the weight by 2, which requires decreasing x by 2). But this depends on whether the group2 item is better than two group1 items.\n\nFor example, suppose we have group2 item c2[y] and two group1 items c1[x] and c1[x-1]. If c2[y] > c1[x] + c1[x-1], then it's better to take the group2 item instead of those two group1 items.\n\nThis seems like a possible approach. Let me try to formalize it.\n\nStart with y = 0, x = min(W, len1). Then, while there are group2 items left to consider (y < len2) and there are at least two group1 items (x >= 2), compare the current group2 item (c2[y]) with the sum of the two best group1 items (c1[x-1] + c1[x-2]). If c2[y] is larger, then replace those two group1 items with one group2 item. This would increase the total cost by (c2[y] - (c1[x-1] + c1[x-2])). Then, increment y by 1, decrement x by 2. Repeat until no more improvements can be made.\n\nThis is a greedy algorithm that tries to swap out two group1 items for one group2 item if it's beneficial.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's see with an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\ngroup1: [10,9,8], group2: [5,4]. W=4.\n\nInitially, x=4 (but group1 has 3 items, so x=3). y=0. Total cost is 10+9+8 = 27.\n\nCompare group2[0]=5 with group1[2]+group1[1] = 8+9=17. 5 < 17 → no swap.\n\nSo final total is 27.\n\nBut what if W is 5?\n\nInitial x=5, but group1 has 3 items. So x=3. y=0. Total is 27. Weight is 3*1=3. Remaining weight is 2. Can't add group2 items because that would require adding 2 units of weight. So, perhaps this approach is not sufficient for cases where we can add group2 items without removing group1 items.\n\nWait, in this case, the weight is W=5. Initially, x=3 (weight 3). We can take one group2 item (weight 2) and add it, making total weight 3+2=5. So the new x is 3 (since x+2y =3+2=5). So the total cost is 27 +5=32.\n\nBut according to the previous approach, since we have x=3 and y=0, we can check if adding a group2 item is better. How?\n\nThe previous approach checks for swapping two group1 items for one group2 item. But in this case, we can take one group2 item without removing any group1 items, because there's room in the weight.\n\nAh, right! The initial approach misses this possibility. So the greedy algorithm needs to also consider adding group2 items when there is enough weight.\n\nThis complicates things. Perhaps the correct way is to consider both possibilities: adding group2 items when there's enough weight, and swapping group1 items for group2 items.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nAnother Idea: For the given W, we can first take as many group2 items as possible, and then fill with group1 items. Then, check if swapping group1 items for group2 items improves the total.\n\nBut again, this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For the given W, the optimal selection of group1 and group2 items is to take as many group2 items as possible, and for the remaining weight, take as many group1 items as possible. But this is not always optimal, as shown in earlier examples.\n\nBut perhaps this is the best we can do given time constraints. Let me try to code this approach and see if it passes the sample test cases.\n\nWait, let's look at the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 2\n1 3\n2 2\n\nOutput: 3.\n\nIn this case, the group1 has one item (w=1, c=3), group2 has one item (w=2, c=2). m=2.\n\nSo, for z=0, rem=2.\n\nFor group1 and group2, the options are:\n\nTake y=1 (group2 item, cost 2) and x=0 → total 2.\n\nOr take y=0 and x=2 (but group1 has only 1 item, so x=1 → cost 3. So the maximum is 3.\n\nWhich is the correct output.\n\nSo, in this case, taking as many group1 items as possible is better than taking group2 items.\n\nSo, the approach of taking as many group2 items as possible and then filling with group1 items would give the wrong answer here.\n\nHence, that approach is not sufficient.\n\nThis suggests that the greedy approach of taking as many group2 items as possible is not always optimal.\n\nThus, back to square one.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each possible W, the optimal number of group2 items is up to y_max = min(len2, W//2). For each y in 0 to y_max, the value is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(len1, W - 2*y) ].\n\nNow, since the group2 and group1 are sorted, the prefix arrays are non-decreasing. So, for a fixed y, the value increases with y, but the min(len1, W - 2y) decreases as y increases.\n\nBut how to find the maximum of this sum?\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(y) = prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(len1, W - 2y) ].\n\nNow, since prefix2 is non-decreasing and the second term is non-increasing (as y increases), the function f(y) may have a single peak. This is because initially, as y increases, prefix2 increases and the second term decreases, but the net effect could be increasing or decreasing.\n\nIf this function is unimodal, then we can use ternary search to find the maximum. Ternary search works on unimodal functions, finding the maximum in log(n) steps.\n\nBut is this function unimodal?\n\nLet me consider some examples.\n\nExample 1: group1 = [10,9,8], group2 = [5,4], W=4.\n\ny can be 0, 1, 2.\n\ny=0: 0 + 10+9+8=27.\n\ny=1: 5 + 10+9 = 24.\n\ny=2: 5+4 =9 + 0 (since 4-4=0, and len1 is 3). So total 9.\n\nSo the function is decreasing as y increases. Unimodal.\n\nExample 2: group1 = [3,2], group2 = [4], W=3.\n\ny can be 0 or 1.\n\ny=0: 3+2 =5.\n\ny=1: 4 + min(3-2*1=1, len1=2) → 4 + 3 =7. So function increases.\n\nUnimodal.\n\nExample 3: group1 = [10,9,8], group2 = [5,4], W=5.\n\ny_max = 2 (since 5//2=2).\n\ny=0: x=5 → 10+9+8 =27 (but len1 is 3, so x=3, total 27).\n\ny=1: 5 + 5-2*1=3 → x=3 → 5 + 10+9+8 = 32? No, wait, W is 5. 2y is 2*1=2, so remaining is 5-2=3.",
