After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, the gradebook is like a 2D array.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to process this. For each subject (column), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if in any of the subjects they have that maximum value. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the next n lines as a list of strings. Each string represents a student's marks.\n3. For each subject (columns), find the maximum value. For example, for column 0, collect all the first characters of each row and find the max.\n4. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in the subjects are equal to the maximum of that subject. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nBut how to process the columns? Let's think. For each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max(gradebook[i][j] for i in 0..n-1)\n\nOnce we have the max_marks array, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns equals the max_marks for that column.\n\nSo, for each student's row, check if any element in their row is equal to the max of that column.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Convert the gradebook into a list of lists (each row is a list of integers).\n- Compute for each column, the maximum value.\n- For each student, iterate through their marks. For each mark, check if it's equal to the max of that column. If any of them is, then the student is successful.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's think about the input. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nSo the gradebook is:\n\nRow 0: [2,2,3]\nRow 1: [2,3,2]\nRow 2: [1,1,2]\n\nFor columns:\n\nColumn 0: 2,2,1 → max is 2\nColumn 1: 2,3,1 → max is 3\nColumn 2: 3,2,2 → max is 3\n\nThen, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: has marks 2, 2, 3. Check each column:\n\nIn column 0, 2 equals max (2) → so he is successful. So even if others are not, he is counted.\n\nStudent 1: marks 2,3,2. In column 1, 3 is the max. So he is successful.\n\nStudent 2: marks 1,1,2. None of these are equal to the max of their columns (column 0 max is 2, column 1 max is 3, column 2 max is 3). So he isn't successful. So total is 2.\n\nSo the output is 2.\n\nSo the plan is correct.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and m. Then read n lines, each line is a string. Then convert each line into a list of integers. Then, for each column j, find the max value.\n\nThen, for each student (row), check if any of their elements in the columns is equal to the max of that column.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nRead the input. Let's think about how to read it. For example, the first input line is n and m. Then, the next n lines are the rows.\n\nIn Python, we can read from stdin using input(). But since the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the input is given as per the first example. Wait, the sample input shows two examples. But in the actual problem, the input is one case. Wait, looking back:\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first example. Wait, the sample input shows two examples, but perhaps that's just for illustration. The actual input is one case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: first line has n and m, then n lines of m characters.\n\nSo the code should read one case. The sample input shows two examples, but that's probably for the purpose of showing different test cases. So the code should process one test case.\n\nSo,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark than them in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m characters representing the marks of students in different subjects.\n2. **Convert Marks to Integers**: Convert each row of the gradebook from strings to lists of integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in at least one subject. If they do, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    gradebook.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\n# Find the maximum marks for each subject (column)\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if gradebook[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = gradebook[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\n# Check each student\nsuccessful_count = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if gradebook[i][j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            successful_count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(successful_count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into integers for the number of students (n) and subjects (m). The gradebook is stored as a list of lists of integers.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark achieved in that subject. This helps in determining the best student for each subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, increment the count of successful students and move to the next student.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
